The health authority added the outbreak of C. difficile to its list of current outbreaks on July 14.

According to Health Canada, Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is a bacterium that causes mild to severe diarrhea and intestinal conditions like pseudomembranous colitis (inflammation of the colon). C. difficile is the most frequent cause of infectious diarrhea in hospitals and long-term care facilities in Canada, as well as in other industrialized countries.

C. difficile bacteria and their spores are found in feces. People can get infected if they touch surfaces contaminated with feces, and then touch their mouth. Healthcare workers can spread the bacteria to their patients if their hands are contaminated.

Symptoms include watery diarrhea, fever, loss of appetite, nausea, and abdominal pain/tenderness.

For healthy people, C. difficile does not pose a health risk. The elderly and those with other illnesses or who are taking antibiotics, are at a greater risk of infection.

Fraser Health asks all visitors to use our hand hygiene stations when they enter and exit its facilities, particularly if there is a reported outbreak.

If you have any of the following, please do not visit at this time:

Vomiting or diarrhea

Cough or flu-like symptoms

Fever

Rash

If you are visiting someone who is located on an outbreak unit, visitors may be limited to two people at a time. Fraser Health asks that you do not visit other patient rooms or common areas on the unit such as the lounge and patient kitchenette. It also recommends you don’t visit public areas in the hospital such as the cafeteria and gift shop.",[]

COVID recovery plan, seek bold response: survey",[],,"VANCOUVER — The latest survey of businesses in British Columbia reveals few are confident the province's $1.5-billion recovery plan will help them survive or succeed.

The survey of 1,401 member businesses from groups including the BC Chamber of Commerce, Greater Vancouver Board of Trade and Business Council of B.C. indicates owners want a bold, long-term recovery plan.

Only 16 per cent of businesses were confident in B.C.'s restart plan and 47 per cent were not.

Two-thirds of those surveyed were relying on some form of government support and owners were braced for a ""second wave"" of shutdowns or other problems if programs expire too quickly.

Some 28 per cent believed they'll return to normal once programs end, 32 per cent expected to cut workers' hours, 27 per cent anticipated layoffs, and one business in every 10 forecast either temporary or permanent closure.

Owners say payroll and wage supports must remain key components of B.C.'s recovery plan, along with fee and tax cuts.

The survey also identified expectations that the province must create better investment conditions.

Bridgitte Anderson, president and CEO of the Greater Vancouver Board of Trade, says business viability hinges on those measures.

Val Litwin with the BC Chamber of Commerce urges policy-makers to ""stay sensitive"" to the vulnerability of the business sector.

""A bold economic recovery plan that helps small businesses compete is non-negotiable for a prosperous B.C., and when small businesses thrive so do communities and people,"" Litwin said in a statement.

""Governments must keep focused on delivering their recovery plans swiftly.""

The survey, conducted with the Mustel Group, is the fourth in a series examining the effects on B.C. businesses since the pandemic flared in March.

At its meeting Tuesday, council unanimously passed a proposal introduced by Coun. Steve Milani to waive any additional fees charged by the city for inspections and permits as they add adjunct locations or outdoor spaces to give customers and employees more room while reducing the risk of transmitting the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Businesses that have already expanded during the pandemic will be refunded fees they paid.

In a report presented to council, Milani said those fees can amount to hundreds of dollars in addition to further expenses like more rent, insurance and utilities. For instance, a special event permit to allow a pub or brewery to open a temporary outdoor patio space costs $211.

Port Moody’s manager of planning, Mary De Paoli, said eight such permits have been issued by the city so far.

Milani said money for city fees can be dear to business owners trying to survive the public health crisis that’s kept customers home or leery of venturing into crowded indoor spaces.

“The least we could do is find a way to eliminate these small extra fees,” he told council. “None of this was planned for.”

Coun. Zoe Royer agreed.

“It’s very difficult for businesses,” she said. “Right now they don’t know how many customers they’re going to get and they need as much safe space as possible.”

Milani said while the fees would be waived, inspections would still take place, a commitment confirmed by the city’s general manager of engineering and operations, Jeff Moi.

“We would continue to do the same level of service as far as inspections and issuing permits,” he said.",[]

Canada's Communications Security Establishment says the malicious cyberactivities were very likely undertaken to pilfer information and intellectual property relating to the development and testing of vaccines for the novel coronavirus.

article continues below

The cyberspy agency says the clandestine activity is hindering response efforts at a time when health-care experts and medical researchers need every available resource to help fight the pandemic.

The CSE's Centre for Cyber Security assesses that APT29, also known as ""the Dukes"" or ""Cozy Bear,"" was responsible, and almost certainly operates as part of Russian intelligence services.

""The group uses a variety of tools and techniques to predominantly target governmental, diplomatic, think-tank, health-care and energy targets for intelligence gain,"" says a joint advisory from the CSE and its allies.

""APT29 is likely to continue to target organizations involved in COVID-19 vaccine research and development, as they seek to answer additional intelligence questions relating to the pandemic.""

This assessment is supported by partners at Britain's Government Communications Headquarters' National Cyber Security Centre, the U.S. National Security Agency, and the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.

The CSE is urging Canadian health organizations to review a technical advisory on the threat and to take any necessary actions to protect themselves. ""We encourage them as well to contact the Cyber Centre if they suspect they have been targeted by cyberactors.""

The joint advisory says APT29 targeted COVID-19 vaccine research and development by scanning specific computer IP addresses of interest for vulnerabilities, a tactic that can help the group obtain login credentials to systems.

""This broad targeting potentially gives the group access to a large number of systems globally, many of which are unlikely to be of immediate intelligence value,"" the advisory says.

""The group may maintain a store of stolen credentials in order to access these systems in the event that they become more relevant to their requirements in the future.""

The joint study by researchers at the B.C. Centre for Disease Control, University of B.C., LifeLabs and public health scientists is posted on the health research website medRxiv and a news conference on the findings is scheduled for Thursday morning.

article continues below

The authors say the findings indicate successful suppression of community transmission in B.C., with an estimated overall infection rate of less than one per cent.

The study looked at anonymous blood samples collected for reasons unrelated to COVID-19 by LifeLabs in March and May, before and after public health measures were introduced.

The first samples in March found two of 869 specimens were positive, for a prevalence of 0.28 per cent, while the May sample found a prevalence of 0.55 per cent.

Health Minister Adrian Dix described the estimated infection rate as ""very low"" and says it shows the effectiveness of British Columbia's public health measures and co-operation of the public.

""It reinforces the fact that we're on the right track,"" Dix says.

""Of course, this is as the study suggests a dual-edged question, a low level of transmission but also very few people with antibodies to deal with potential future spikes of COVID-19.""

If the study's prevalence rate is applied to the whole provincial population, it could mean about 28,000 people have had the novel coronavirus, while 3,149 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed to date, however Dix noted the results are specific to the Vancouver area.

Health officials have repeatedly said that more people have been infected with the virus than have tested positive and Dix calls the estimated prevalence rate in B.C. ""encouraging.""

""Overall the level of infection in B.C. was low and that's due to the actions of people in B.C. That said, there are more people who were infected with COVID-19 than tested positive and that's something we've said clearly, especially in the period of March and April when we were focusing our testing program particularly on specific groups including health-care workers,"" Dix says.

The study is the first of its kind in Canada, he says.

The study is also important because it involved people who did not self-select for COVID-19 testing, so they likely didn't believe they had the virus, Dix says.

The study was authorized by provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and approved by the clinical research ethics board of the university. It has not yet been peer reviewed.

British Columbia recorded 21 new cases Wednesday and no new deaths. There are 207 active cases while 2,753 people who tested positive have recovered, the government said in a news release.

Tuesday, Port Moody council passed eight recommendations that, along with four already adopted in April, could make that happen.

article continues below

The recommendations include: stronger rules to protect existing rental housing; inclusionary zoning; better incentives to encourage the construction of new rental and affordable housing; minimum thresholds for the number of family-friendly units to included in new developments; and policies to discourage hostile architecture.

Those are in addition to previous recommendations that include an update of Port Moody’s laneway housing bylaws to make that housing option more attractive; the establishment of a renoviction bylaw; and updating the terms of reference for the city’s affordable housing reserve fund so it could also be used to help renters in need of financial assistance.

The recommendations were the product of months of work by council’s affordable housing task force, that was recharged last year after it was initially formed in 2017.

Lubik, a member of the task force, said making affordable housing a priority benefits everyone in the city.

“The housing-first model shows if we can keep people housed, it really does save a lot of money,” she said.

In its report to council, the task force said those savings would be realized by fewer people needing to access social and medical supports.

Coun. Diana Dilworth, also on the task force, said Port Moody is facing an affordability crunch as more than a quarter of its existing non-market rental units begin to show their age.

“That’s where we’re going to get caught,” she said, adding already 35% of renters in the city are paying more than 30% of their household income of rent and utilities, while 17% are paying more than 50% of their income to keep a roof over their head. According to the rental housing index compiled by the B.C. Non-profit Housing Association, accommodation is considered affordable if it costs less than 30% of household income.

Coun. Meghan Lahti said a goal of the task force, which also included Coun. Zoe Royer, was to provide a road map for future developments in the city.

“We really thought it was important to take a very descriptive approach as to how this could happen by providing developers with options, but also being very clear with our expectations,” she said.

Dilworth said the group tried to take elements from best practices being implemented in other cities like New Westminster, Burnaby, North Vancouver and Richmond that are wrestling with similar issues. It even enlisted councillors from New West to peer review its report.

For instance, the task force recommends the establishment of minimum maintenance standards for rental suites, which is currently being ireviewed in Burnaby.

It also favours a tiered approach to inclusionary zoning, similar to New West, that scales the requirement for affordable units in new projects with more than 80 units according to a developer’s adherence to the official community plan (OCP) or their proximity to transit. A project that’s within OCP guidelines would require 12.5% of its units be affordable or 6% to be offered at shelter rates, while those seeking an amendment to the OCP, exceed an area’s density limits or are located in a transit-oriented development area would need to provide a minimum of 20% affordable units.

City manager Tim Savoie told council staff will begin work on implementing the recommendations, but it could take several months for bylaws and policies to be drafted.

“We know how important this is to the community,” he said.",[]

Dr. Michael Schwandt, who was one of the first infectious disease specialists from Vancouver Coastal Health to help contain outbreaks at sites like the Lynn Valley Care Centre, made the comments not long after a group of 239 scientists from 32 countries wrote an open letter to the World Health Organization, successfully appealing for the world health body to change its guidance on aerosolized transmission.

article continues below

“We'll be watching closely the science around airborne transmission. At this time, we don't think it's played a major role in the outbreaks in Vancouver Coastal Health that we've had direct experience with,” said Dr. Schwandt.

The new W.H.O. guidance, which came last Thursday, accepts that the novel coronavirus can spread through aerosolized particles — tiny droplets in the air — in crowded indoor settings for prolonged periods of time.

“There have been reported outbreaks of COVID-19 in some closed settings, such as restaurants, nightclubs, places of worship or places of work where people may be shouting, talking, or singing.

“In these outbreaks, aerosol transmission, particularly in these indoor locations where there are crowded and inadequately ventilated spaces where infected persons spend long periods of time with others, cannot be ruled out,” reads the W.H.O.’s new guidance, which also calls for more research into aerosol transmission. aerosol transmission.

But Dr. Schwandt said his team doesn’t view the airborne versus droplet transmission debate as a binary, and that while the virus can be traced at varying distances at concentrations, most of the cases he’s come across in Vancouver Coastal Health region, home to the first outbreaks in the country, have been from “face-to-face” transmission.

The proof, he said, comes from Vancouver Coastal’s success in tracing contacts based on direct contact, an experience a spokesperson for Fraser Health told the Tri-City News has been echoed in their health authority.

“Without taking airborne transmission into account as a risk factor, we've been able to bring outbreaks under good control, really looking at close physical contact as the main risk factor,” said Dr. Schwandt.

That means, at the moment, current ventilation systems in places like long-term care homes are not considered a risk factor in the spread of the virus.

Airborne or not, sharing air in large, indoor public gatherings raises everyone’s risk of transmitting the virus, as Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry reminded British Columbians in her daily update Tuesday.

“Stay away from closed spaces as much as possible,” she said. “If it’s a house party, you may not know all the people who are there.”

And like the W.H.O., health officials in B.C. said they are keeping an eye on the science.

“If more evidence were to develop around airborne or aerosol transmission, then naturally we'd need to look at preventative measures that include attention to ventilation,” said Dr. Schwandt.",[]

Provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix announced July 15 that there were 21 new cases in the past 24 hours, including two cases that they call ""epi-linked,"" or presumed cases that have not been proven through testing but are being treated as official cases.

article continues below

The province has now recorded 3,149 cases since the novel coronavirus first appeared in B.C. in late January.

More than 87.4% of those infected, or 2,753 people, have recovered. Of those who haven't, 189 people have died and 207 people are actively fighting the virus. Only 14 people are hospitalized, with five of those in intensive care units. The rest are self-isolating at home. There were no new deaths recorded in the past 24 hours.

Recording at least 20 new COVID-19 cases in a 24-hour period has become common in B.C., and Henry said yesterday that she found that number ""distressing,"" even though, she added, the good news is that the province knows where the clusters of infection are, many of the infections are linked and the number is not really that large given the province's population of more than five million residents.

The numbers in the past week were:

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12;

• 21 new cases on July 13;

• 13 new cases on July 14; and now

• 21 new cases on July 15.

In June, the number of daily new cases many times was in the single digits.

""There is one active community outbreak, in addition to several community exposure events,"" Henry and Dix said. ""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks.""

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,023 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,659 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 216 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 51 people who reside outside Canada.

Public Health Official authored.

The list of 16 items runs the gamut of sound bite-style take-aways from Dr. Henry's many press conferences and interviews, however while the ideas may ring somewhat familiar in step with things she has said, none of the items on the list are direct quotes from Dr. Henry, nor did she assemble the list.

Here's how the list reads on Facebook, as shared in a public post from a user the morning of Wednesday, July 15:

Wisdom from Dr Bonnie Henry

We may have to live with C19 for months or years. Let's not deny it or panic. Let's not make our lives useless. Let's learn to live with this fact. You can't destroy C19 viruses that have penetrated cell walls, by drinking gallons of hot water you'll just go to the bathroom more often. Washing hands and maintaining a two-metre physical distance is the best method for your protection. If you don't have a C19 patient at home, there's no need to disinfect the surfaces at your house. Packaged cargo, gas pumps, shopping carts and ATMs do not cause infection. If you wash your hands, live your life as usual. C19 is not a food infection. It is associated with drops of infection like the 'flu. There is no demonstrated risk that C19 is transmitted by food. You can lose your sense of smell with a lot of allergies and viral infections. This is only a non-specific symptom of C19. Once at home, you don't need to change your clothes urgently and go shower! Purity is a virtue, paranoia is not! The C19 virus doesn't hang in the air for long. This is a respiratory droplet infection that requires close contact. The air is clean, you can walk through the gardens and through parks (just keeping your physical protection distance). It is sufficient to use normal soap against C19, not antibacterial soap. This is a virus, not a bacteria. You don't have to worry about your food orders. But you can heat it all up in the microwave, if you wish. The chances of bringing C19 home with your shoes is like being struck by lightning twice in a day. I've been working against viruses for 20 years — drop infections don't spread like that! You can't be protected from the virus by taking vinegar, sugarcane juice and ginger! These are for immunity not a cure. Wearing a mask for long periods interferes with your breathing and oxygen levels. Wear it only in crowds. Wearing gloves is also a bad idea; the virus can accumulate into the glove and be easily transmitted if you touch your face. Better just to wash your hands regularly. Immunity is greatly weakened by always staying in a sterile environment. Even if you eat immune boosting foods, please go out of your house regularly to any park/beach. Immunity is increased by EXPOSURE TO PATHOGENS, not by sitting at home and consuming fried/ spicy/sugary food and aerated drinks.

Be smart and stay informed!

Live life sensibly and to the fullest.—

Dr Bonnie Henry

The list isn't new to the internet, with roots going back to mid-May and a connection to a U.S. physician in Maryland. However, the list is newly showing Dr. Henry as its author.

That doctor is Dr. Faheen Younus, the Chief of Infectious Diseases, University of Maryland Upper Chesapeake Health. The list actually has its roots in the multiple tweets Dr. Younus shared into May on his personal Twitter feed. The paraphrased format first appeared, and was widely shared, thanks to an article on the site TheAZB.com.

If you take the first piece of ""wisdom,"" in the now-circulating Dr. Henry-attributed posts, it reads: ""We may have to live with C19 for months or years. Let's not deny it or panic. Let's not make our lives useless. Let's learn to live with this fact.""

TheAZB.com begins their recap of Dr. Younus' tweeted items as follows: ""He Tweets We will live with Covid19 for months. Let’s not deny it or panic. Let’s not make life unnecessarily difficult. Let us learn to be happy and live with that fact.""

Similarly, the items in the list are paraphrased and tweaked as they are adapted by each re-poster or re-formatter of the list. For example, while The AZB.com summarizes a thought attributed to Dr. Younus as ""You cannot be protected from the virus by drinking / eating vinegar, sumac, soda and ginger."" The Dr. Henry-attributed phony list reads as follows: ""You can't be protected from the virus by taking vinegar, sugarcane juice and ginger! These are for immunity not a cure.""

Dr. Younus himself discredited the viral post, which moved rapidly on WhatsApp, in a tweet on June 6:

IMPORTANT:



These are not my words. There are errors and typos in this viral post on FB/WhatsApp that someone adapted from my tweets without approval.



I share COVID info only on twitter. Just read through my TL here if you’d like accurate info.



Spread the word please. Thx pic.twitter.com/tplGscusMh — Faheem Younus, MD (@FaheemYounus) June 6, 2020

On July 15, a site called The Dallas Orthodox Jewish Life presents the list as ""Dr. Bonnie Henry’s Down to Earth Advice,"" featuring an image taken without permission from the New York Times' recent profile of B.C.'s top doc.

Forms of the list show up on Google as being reproduced all over, with varying attribution or none at all, from church newsletters to personal blogs.

Many B.C. residents are sharing the list on their Facebook pages today, however many more are trying to get the word out that the list is not Dr. Henry's.

Dr. Henry's COVID-19 provincial case media updates are published on the Province of British Columbia's website, and reputable sources readily cover the regular press conferences here in B.C. Further, B.C. has a robust online section dedicated to COVID-19, which includes reliable and accurate information.

There is no press conference scheduled for Wednesday, July 15. A representative who assists with media requests for Dr. Henry said the following via email to V.I.A.: ""[T]he information was not developed by Dr. Henry nor anyone in her office. While some of the recommendations are similar to her remarks over the past several months, there are inaccuracies and errors in the guidance that is provided. She rather recommends British Columbians refer to the excellent guidance found on the B.C. Centre of Disease Control’s website at www.bccdc.ca and share that information through their social networks.""",[]

It will feature local goods and farmed products but there will be some protocols to observe, according to the city of Port Coquitlam.

For example, masks will be required for vendors and customers who are unable to maintain a two metre physical distance. As well, customers will be required to do a complete health self-assessment and return home if they are feeling unwell.

As for shopping, customers will be able to select the items they wish to purchase, but vendors will handle and package the products prior to sale.

There will also be a one-way entrance to the market from Leigh Square with a one-way exit out to Donald Street.

The outdoor market will run Thursday until Oct. 8.

Consumers who prefer an online shopping experience, the market will also continue to offer curbside pick-up from the Gathering Place in Leigh Square.

To purchase on-line, residents can browse and shop for fresh food and produce at www.farmersandmore.org and select a pick-up time at the Gathering Place on Thursdays between 3 and 7 p.m. Orders must be submitted by Wednesday by 11:30 a.m. to be ready for pick-up Thursday the same week.

Customer parking will be reserved along Donald Street on Thursday afternoons.

The Port Coquitlam Farmers Market and the online food distribution hub is run by the Fraser North Farmers Market Society.

Port Coquitlam Mayor Brad West said the market is popular, and while it will look different will still provide shoppers with the local fresh food they crave.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons is expected to take Sidoo into custody on September 23 and release him from a Pacific Northwest area facility just before Christmas.

Sidoo, 61, appeared online via Zoom in front of United States District Judge Nathaniel Gorton of the United States District Court for District of Massachusetts, as well as his lawyers and prosecutors. He wore a plaid suit while sitting in an office space inside his $31.7 million home in Vancouver’s Point Grey neighbourhood.

Sidoo, now a convicted felon, initially pled innocent to fraud and money laundering charges; he teared up before being sentenced and read a prepared statement:

“The last several months have been the hardest in my entire life and today I accept the court’s decision without reservation. No words can express how sorry I am for my decisions and actions that led to this day. I make no excuses, your honour. I broke the law and pled guilty and I now must pay for my actions.

“To my wife and boys, all I ever wanted was your love and respect and to be a good role model. And I know I have made a terrible mistake that has deeply affected our family. To my friends and colleagues and former teammates over the years, I am deeply ashamed today. To the young men and women who looked up to me as a role model, you deserve better. To the court and all of you, I wish to apologize for my actions.

“I will serve my sentence and am committed to returning to the community and doing everything possible to make a positive impact. I hope in time people will not judge me for the worst mistake in my life but for the work in the days, weeks and years ahead in which I am committed to being a better man.”

Gorton told Sidoo he was “impressed” by the businessman’s “obvious remorse.”

But Gorton pointed out two omissions in Sidoo’s statement.

“You expect to put this behind you and go forward and make up for what you called mistakes. I would call it a crime, not a mistake, but nevertheless, it is important that you acknowledge it and realize how many constituencies you have disappointed,” said the judge.

Sidoo also did not explicitly acknowledge that his crimes resulted in two students missing an opportunity to attend the universities his sons, Dylan Sidoo and Jordan Sidoo, were admitted to.

“What you accomplished, along with getting them into college, is to deprive two other deserving students of admittance into those universities — an act that is the very antithesis of one you want to be known for,” said Gorton.

Likewise, United States Attorney Andrew Lelling submitted to Gorton: “Sidoo engaged in serious criminal conduct involving fraud and deception that stretched over multiple years.

“His crimes warrant significant punishment. By engaging in the scheme, with [scheme mastermind Rick Singer] and others, Sidoo was able to steal two college admissions slots for his sons, including one from the University of California at Berkeley, one of the top public universities in the nation.”

Sidoo, said Gorton, “committed a crime that displayed an unbelievable lack of integrity, morality and common sense.

“You have let your selfish desire, your pride and your enormous wealth overcome all of what you apparently want to stand for with your works of charity,” Gorton told Sidoo.

Sidoo’s philanthropy, derived from his earnings in the capital markets, was central to his sentencing defense. According to Sidoo he has donated several million dollars to charitable causes, such as the University of B.C. football program.

In pleading guilty to fraud, Sidoo avoided a maximum prison term of 20 years and prosecutors subsequently agreed to 90 days behind bars, plus a $250,000 fine and one-year of supervised release, which will not be enforced in Canada by the U.S. Probation Department. Prosecutors also agreed to drop the money laundering charge.

The prison Sidoo goes to is expected to have harsher conditions since his options are limited due to his foreign citizenship. His attorney Martin Weinberg said he is expected to spend 14 days in isolation in a “maximum security setting,” due to COVID-19.

Sidoo will get four days credit for time already served. If he serves the full 90 days he will be released December 17 but will have to spend 14 days in isolation at home should B.C. public health rules for international travellers and COVID-19 continue into the fall.

Gorton said Sidoo’s crime would normally warrant more time in jail but there are mitigating circumstances, such as his remorse, lack of criminal record, philanthropy and “collateral consequences,” such as not being able to enter the U.S. as a felon and being stripped last month of his Order of B.C. medal for community service. Sidoo’s attorneys also previously noted he did not directly pay the universities but that his fraud was limited to cheating on the tests.

The former B.C. Lions football player worked as a stock broker in the 1990s and an investment banker between 2000 and 2010. Since 2010 he has made millions of dollars directing a handful of public companies that have failed to generate wealth for retail investors.

Sidoo was arrested March 8, 2019, in San Jose, California, on charges by the U.S. Department of Justice of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering related to the high-profile U.S. college admissions and bribery scandal, brought to light by a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe dubbed Operation Varsity Blues.

One of dozens of parents to be charged, Sidoo initially pled innocent to paying $200,000 total to scheme mastermind William ‘Rick’ Singer, who hired corrupt exam expert Mark Riddell to take Dylan and Jordan’s SAT exams, in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Sidoo also helped falsify one of his son Jordan’s university applications in October 2013 with an essay that originally included a fake claim of Jordan being held up at gunpoint by gangsters, while he was purported to be an intern for an anti-gang organization.

Co-conspirators Singer and Riddell pled guilty last year in exchange for cooperating with the government’s investigation.

The guilty parties in the case, who used Singer’s criminal services, were generally well-off individuals. Celebrities such as actress Lori Loughlin and her clothing designer husband Mossimo Gianulli and actress Felicity Huffman also pled guilty for related crimes and brought much media attention to the investigation.

Sidoo’s sons had no involvement in their father’s crime.

Jordan is now a 2018 history graduate from University of California Berkeley. Dylan graduated in cinematic arts in 2016 from the University of Southern California (USC). The two previously attended Vancouver’s prestigious St. George’s School.

Neither university has announced whether or not their degrees will remain valid. Dylan, according to the sentencing documents, had scored a 1,460/2,400 SAT score until Riddell, using a fake ID in December 2011, bumped up the score to 1,700, which was high enough for Dylan to enter Chapman University (and later transfer to USC). Riddell then scored 2,280/2,400 for Jordan in December 2012, paving the way to Berkley.

Riddell also took a high school test for Dylan. The B.C. Ministry of Education has issued no statement on how its testing process was so vulnerable to fraud.

Both sons have since entered into penny stock promotion with their father.

The decision — released July 15 — describes an incident which occurred around 1:30 a.m. on Nov. 23, 2019, when several people were leaving a Coquitlam pub.

article continues below

The Independent Investigations Office of BC (IIO) decision cites statements from six officers and three civilians that said they either witnessed the altercation between the off-duty officer and the man, identified in the ruling as AP, or were nearby when it happened.

“I wouldn’t say [AP] was hammered, but he was almost getting to that point,” said the injured man’s girlfriend.

AP’s girlfriend described an unprovoked attack from the off-duty Port Moody police officer — referred to as SO, or Subject Officer.

Witnesses agree AP was walking down the sidewalk without a shirt when he crossed paths with SO and two other off-duty officers. One witness recalled the off-duty officer in question yelling something like “Where’s your shirt?” before they both began striking each other.

AP’s girlfriend, who was reportedly highly intoxicated at the time, described SO repeatedly punching and “stomping” on AP’s chest and face, while another witness described the off-duty officer initially “lunging” at AP.

But the other off-duty officers painted a different picture, in which AP took a fighting stance and began throwing punches at SO. That’s when SO gave AP a “one-two jab,” according to one of the off-duty officers, before both ended up in a “grappling match” where the shirtless man went down to the ground and the off-duty cop put his foot down towards his chest to hold him down.

Chief civilian director Ronald J. MacDonald writes in the decision that both off-duty officers who witnessed the incident “told IIO investigators that they could not see what SO did in the interaction, even though they were standing very close by and looking in the direction of the incident, suggesting they should have been able to see most, if not all, of what happened.”

Due to conflicting testimony and a lack of available evidence, the IIO decision found it was not possible to be sure what happened, but that “it seems unlikely that any of the officers would have had any motivation to attack AP, a large intoxicated man, and more likely that the blows that SO struck were struck in self-defence.”",[]

That characterization comes one day after Britain became the last of Canada's ""Five Eyes"" intelligence-sharing allies to ban the Chinese telecommunications firm from its 5G wireless internet.

article continues below

The next generation of wireless internet technology is to be dramatically faster than the current standard, with more bandwidth and faster response times. It's expected to be crucial to technologies such as autonomous vehicles and remote medicine.

Alykhan Velshi, Huawei Canada's vice president of corporate affairs, says the company hopes the Trudeau government's ongoing 5G review steers clear of political machinations by administration of U.S. President Donald Trump to undermine the company.

""We see ourselves as being caught in the middle of the U.S.-China trade war. Canada is also unfortunately caught in the middle of it,"" Velshi said in an interview on Wednesday.

""That is the context in which a lot of announcements and decisions are made, as the Trump administration is demanding that everyone pick a side whether it is actually in their interest to go all in on one side or that other.""

Britain's decision brought it firmly in line with Trump's campaign to have Huawei banned from allied countries, including Canada.

The United States views Huawei as a security threat and says its equipment and technology would serve as a back door for China's communist leaders and military to spy on other countries as they adopt 5G technology — a charge the company firmly denies.

The Trudeau government has delayed a long-awaited decision on whether to allow Huawei to participate in Canada's new 5G network largely because of China's ongoing imprisonment of two Canadian men, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.

Kovrig and Spavor were arrested nine days after Canada detained Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, on an American arrest warrant in December 2018. That move is widely seen as retaliation by China to force Canada to release Meng.

Velshi, a lawyer and former Conservative political staffer, called the case against Meng a ""politically driven"" prosecution by Trump, and pointed to a 2018 musing by the president that she could be used as a bargaining chip in his trade negotiation with China.

He said Meng will be vindicated by the Canadian courts when the extent of Trump's political motivation is properly presented.

(The Green party issued a statement along the same lines Wednesday, saying the United States is abusing its extradition treaty with Canada for political purposes and calling on the Canadian government to demand U.S. charges against Meng be dropped.)

But at the same time, Velshi also expressed sympathy for Kovrig and Spavor and reiterated the view of the Canadian arm of his company that diplomats can somehow win their freedom.

""Like all Canadians we're concerned about their detention, we're concerned about their treatment and we want to see them home as soon as possible.""

The tensions between Beijing and Washington intensified on Wednesday following Tuesday's announcement by Britain that Huawei would be excluded from work on the 5G network because U.S. sanctions made it impossible to ensure the safety of Chinese-supplied equipment.

The Trump administration decided in May to block non-U.S. companies from using American technology to produce processor chips and other components for Huawei without Washington's approval.

On Wednesday, the Chinese government accused Britain of colluding with the U.S. to hurt Huawei. The Trump administration fired back by announcing travel bans on employees of Huawei and other Chinese companies that the U.S. determines are assisting authoritarian governments in violating human rights, including against Uighurs in western China.

Velshi said Huawei has faith in the Canadian government's ongoing 5G review and the company has nothing to say about how long it has taken for a decision to be made.

In the meantime, Velshi said that despite the tensions between Beijing and Ottawa, Huawei's revenues in Canada grew in 2019, as did its workforce, which stands at about 1,200 employees. Velshi said the company has not yet made public its 2019 financials.

""We attribute that growth to the fact that our customers … have largely stood by us and continued to buy our products,"" said Velshi.

David Reed, Britain's deputy high commissioner to Canada, had no comment on what Canada should do next, but noted the two countries enjoy strong co-operation in the Five Eyes, which also includes Australia and New Zealand.

Reed said all countries must focus on allowing more companies to thrive in the 5G market.

""The reason we're in this position is there's a global market failure,"" Reed said in an interview. ""That's the conversation we started, particularly with Five Eyes partners, earlier in the year and we're trying to make progress on that.""

John Power, the spokesman for Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains, gave no indication as to when the government would make its decision on which companies can sell 5G gear in Canada. He reiterated that the government would ""not compromise on matters of national security"" but declined to reference specific companies.

""Our government's review will consider technical and security factors, including advice from our security agencies and consider decisions from our allies and partners,"" he said in a statement, adding that it would take into account ""important domestic and international considerations.""

Tuesday, council approved a bylaw change that would allow the city to delay its annual property tax sale for a year to relieve the burden of those in dire straits during COVID-19.

article continues below

While people don’t usually lose their homes during the annual tax sale because they are often able to buy them back, it’s a threat hanging over 132 properties with outstanding taxes.

Typically, property owners delinquent in their taxes for two years as of Dec. 31 would see their properties go up for a tax sale in September at a minimum bid price equal to the amount of outstanding property taxes plus 5% and the land title registration fees.

The highest bidder — either equal to or above that price — will be declared the purchaser. If there is no bid, or no bid equal to the outstanding taxes plus 5%, the city will be declared the purchaser.

Once sold the property owner has one year to redeem the property by paying the outstanding property taxes plus any interest that has been charged.

Two properties In 2019 and four properties in 2018 were auctioned off and subsequently redeemed by their owners.

“It is rare for a property owner to not redeem the property and over the last twenty-five years no taxpayer has lost their home due to this process,” according to a staff report.

Delaying the annual property tax sale to Sept. 27, 2021 gives owners a longer time frame to pay their back taxes, however, the outstanding balance will continue to accrue interest.

The initiative is one of a number the city is implementing to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic.

While allowed by the province, the annual tax sale delay will require bylaw approval and public posting.

The goal is to reduce the burden on financially-strapped taxpayers during COVID-19.

“By extending the tax sale date until 2021 the city will provide financially distressed property owners an additional year to pay their delinquent property taxes,” according to a city staff report.",[]

Perry, the owner of a Coquitlam accounting firm, said in her scholarship announcement that COVID-19 had added to the stress of families as many require a device to do school work.

But even before COVID-19 struck, she notes that many high schools required students to have access to a device.

‘For most families, coming up with $500+ within a couple of months is not the easiest thing to do and this was before COVID-19 even happened. Then we add COVID-19, parents working from home and kids also learning from home and realized that ALL kids need technology,” she further stated.

According to Perry, students need access to their own own device and shouldn’t have to share with a parent or sibling.

Instead, organizers of the Port Moody Firefighters Charitable Society’s annual pancake breakfast are taking their batter and spatulas online.

While the technology may not yet exist to allow the firefighters to reach through computer monitors and serve golden pancakes to people in their homes, Rob Shoucair said they’re going to try their best to replicate the fun and community spirit of the 43rd annual fundraising event through a special Facebook Live presentation on Aug. 2, from 8:30 to 10:30 a.m.

The timing coincides with breakfast because, Shoucair said, it’s hoped families will enjoy their own homemade flapjack feasts, then upload photos of their pancake parties to their social media feeds before Aug. 1, with the hashtag #43pomopancakes, for a chance to win prizes to be awarded during the live webcast.

Final details are still being worked out, but Shoucair said the livestream is expected to include a tour of the hall, messages from sponsors and a “battle of the pancakes” cook-off contest between competing groups of firefighters. There’s also a 50/50 draw and a raffle for two airline tickets.

Soucair said it took firefighters a bit of time to reboot their traditional kick-off to the summer season after the public health emergency and subsequent restrictions against large public gatherings.

“We wavered,” he said of the decision to find a new way to move forward. “It would have been disappointing to cancel after 42 years.”

The delay meant moving the breakfast from its traditional Canada Day date to the B.C. Day weekend so the five-man organizing committee could get all the pieces in place for an online event.

It also necessitated a new method to collect the money that normally comes from the $5-a-plate charge and goes to support local organizations like the Eagle Ridge Hospital Foundation, Crossroads Hospice Society and the Mossom Creek hatchery. That is being done through a special GoFundMe campaign.

Shoucair said the $10,000 goal of the campaign is a little more modest than the $58,000 that was raised at last year’s event that served more than 4,000 plates of pancakes, but the online initiative is a bit of an unknown quantity. He said it’s more important to retain the event’s continuity and carry through with the fundraising momentum already started by continued support from its many sponsors.

“A lot of charities are relying on our donations,” he said. “We didn’t want to let down the people we support.”

Shoucair said the virtual pancake breakfast will also be a way to boost morale in the community as people weary of months social isolation and physical distancing efforts to reduce the risk of transmitting the novel coronavirus.

“It shows people we can all adapt to the things we’re facing this year,” he said. “But it will definitely feel different.”",[]

And to kick things off, there will be an NHL20 online tournament presented by Alpha North Esports on PlayStation and Xbox.

Going virtual was a pivot made necessary by COVID-19, organizers said.

The first annual Ruben’s Ruckus took place May 12, 2018, and was a huge success with all time-slots completely sold out. This year was bound to be even bigger, with 250 kids pre-registered. And then COVID-19 took over and sideswiped the plans.

“Originally our goal for Ruben’s Ruckus was to create a really fun event to give back to all of our local kids who have helped us so much and been integral to our success; with everything that is happening, we knew we needed to find a way to leverage technology and continue to engage with our young stakeholders by offering the event virtually,” said Ruben’s Shoes Founder Kelly Strongitharm.

In the virtual event, kids can sign up to make pledges and do indoor and outdoor challenges, such as a sidewalk chalk obstacle challenge, ping pong ball challenge, make your own home fort, hallway maze obstacle course, along with a 3-km scavenger hunt race.

Every Sunday starting July 5 through Aug. 16 a new Home Obstacle Challenge will be presented. Registered participants will have the week to complete their obstacle for which they will win badges and points leading to exciting prizes and rewards.

Pledges are encouraged to help build a school in the Dominican Republic. For example, $50 in pledges will purchase a desk.

The Port Moody-based Ruben's Shoes Society has an elementary school in the Dominican Republic with over 240 students, and the next step is to build a high school.

• the Arts Award for an individual, business or organization that advances the artistic or cultural fabric of the Port Moody.

• the Environmental Award goes to an individual, organization or business that promotes environmental awareness and preservation.

• the Heritage Award recognizes the advancement of heritage conservation in the city by an individual, organization or business.

But, as refugees from the civil war in Afghanistan, they’ve also experienced how tenuous that can be.

Since finding their feet and rebuilding their lives in Coquitlam, the Malikzadas have not only nourished their customers with a unique fusion of Afghan, Indian and Greek cuisine they serve at their restaurant, Jamila’s Kitchen, they’ve also nurtured them as they have come through their doors.

That effort has taken on new urgency with so many of them struggling through the financial uncertainties and anxieties of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Malikzadas, who’ve quietly served free meals to people in need through their No Money, No Worries initiative since 2017, extended the courtesy to frontline workers and first responders in the early weeks of the public health crisis. Recently, they spent an entire Monday cooking and then delivering 200 meals for staff at Royal Columbian Hospital in New Westminster.

With schools back in session in a limited fashion, Malik said he’s reached out to local principals to distribute cards to needy families that can be discreetly redeemed for a free meal. He’s also dropped some off at local churches.

He said it’s hard not to keep on helping, even as he has to carefully manage his own business so suppliers can be paid and the rent covered. He said it’s about paying it forward and building a foundation that can be sustained through thick and thin.

“Community has always been important,” he said. “We’ve stood on the shoulders of others, and now we need to create the opportunity for the next generation to stand on our shoulders.”

The Malikzadas said they really gained their love and appreciation for community through their own struggles, first to escape the war in Afghanistan in 1995, and then living and working as refugees in Pakistan for six years before coming to Canada.

“When we see community as the human community, it brings a spark,” Malik said.

And while the family’s latest efforts have necessitated a dip into their own savings, he said it’s worth it.

“This is exactly the time, when we face difficulties in life,” he said. “Every morning you wake up, you feel good.”",[]

But when British Columbia’s chief medical officer, Dr. Bonnie Henry, gave her blessing to the covering — calling the donning of non-medical masks a “permissive use” — Walter got busy sewing.

article continues below

A month — and 300 masks — later, Walter’s work has connected her closer to the community around her Gabriola Drive home in Coquitlam and is raising money for a couple of causes close to her heart.

Now retired from her job assembling the course calendar at Simon Fraser University, the avid sewer started her mask making by fulfilling requests from friends. She also made some for members of Coquitlam Search and Rescue.

Walter said she would have stopped there, but when she got news an 83-year-old uncle had passed away in England from complications brought on by COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, the pandemic suddenly became very real to her. So she kept sewing masks.

Walter sent some to Costco, where a friend’s daughter works. She packed others into plastic sleeves she had saved from the home delivery of her daily newspaper, and affixed them to a sign on her front lawn, offering them up free to any takers.

In return, all Walter asked for was a donation to the Tri-Cities-based Share food bank or the Port Moody chapter of Days for Girls, a charitable organization that assembles feminine hygiene kits for young women in developing countries.

Walter said the project has had the added benefit of depleting her vast supply of fabric swatches she’s gathered over her years as a sewer. But, more importantly, she’s met strangers and neighbours who’ve not only heeded her call to help her causes but also earned her notes and letters of gratitude dropped into her mail slot, a bouquet of flowers delivered to her door and a bottle of wine left on her stoop.

“This project is lovely on so many levels,” said Walter, who often waits by her front window to watch people stroll up to her sign to retrieve a mask. “I’m connecting with people I don’t know.”

Eager to keep up with demand, Walter has even enlisted her partner, Jeff Rudd, to clip corners off the fabric or round up elastics.

Walter said she tries to make her masks appealing to any gender, and strives for whimsical colours and patterns when the fancy strikes her.

“People will turn this into something they’ll be proud to wear,” she said, adding she now pulls one on herself every time she ventures from the safety of her home.

“When I look outside and the bags are gone, I think I better get busy again,” Walter said.",[]

But with the season on hold because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the active, sports-loving Coquitlam Grade 8 student is hunkered in his room, sleeping in most mornings and flexing his thumbs on his X-Box controller when he does roust himself from bed.

Nathan’s dad, Keven, says isolation has been hard on the normally sociable teenager. So, to help him deal with some of his anxieties, they embarked on a book project together.

It’s not the first time father and son have collaborated.

Nathan has published four other kids’ books about super heroes, like firefighters, doctors, assistance dogs and the RCMP musical ride. In fact, the latter was set to be launched in Ottawa in March when the public health emergency hit. All raise money for affiliated causes like the BC Burn Fund, Canucks for Kids, Pacific Assistance Dogs Society and Cops for Cancer.

This latest book, Mom and Her Super Heroes, continues the super hero theme, except these ones don’t wear heavy turnout gear or eat kibble. They’re truck drivers, grocery store workers, pharmacists and teachers. Or, as Keven McTaggart said, they’re “the people out there that are trying to keep your life normal and without them your life would be totally different.”

The combination colouring and activity story book draws upon the McTaggart’s own experiences. Brad the truck driver is a friend of Keven’s, the pharmacist fills prescription’s for Nathan’s mom, the grocery store encounters are their own. Even Coquitlam Mayor Richard Stewart gets a shout-out.

McTaggart said it was important to make the story relatable to every young reader.

“They’ll recognize they’re not in it alone,” he said, adding kids must appreciate the risks being taken by everyday people to ensure some level of normalcy for everyone else.

McTaggart said it took only four days from Nathan’s first enquiry about the purpose behind the nightly pilgrimage his mom was making to the balcony to bang her pots that sparked the idea for another book to its realization.

The story grew from a series of conversations between father and son, as well as Nathan’s mom, Lucie, including one during a road trip to Abbotsford to get cheap gas.

The illustrations that kids can colour were done by Nathan’s former Grade 3-4 teacher, Sarah Shinkewski, and her daughter, Katie Fong.

Shinkewski normally gets her students to create the pictures for Nathan’s books, but with school being conducted virtually this spring, that wasn’t possible, McTaggart said.

In between each illustrated page of the story is a blank page where kids can draw the super heroes of their own lives in lockdown, or even write down their thoughts.

McTaggart said he hopes young readers will take the opportunity for self-reflection.

“A lot of kids take for granted what they have,” he said. “I’m hoping the kids will appreciate what they have more.”

So when she offers advice for surviving the COVID-19 pandemic and financial fallout, one is inclined to heed it.

For the Port Moody resident, who was acknowledged this week with the BC Community Achievement Award, hard work, perseverance and appreciating community connectedness are the keys to getting through tough times.

Cooper should know, while she putters around her home baking and participating in a documentary film about her life, a group of friends, family and other supporters are making sure she has seeds to grow on her deck and food for the cupboards during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“I see people around me and I applaud them,” Cooper said. “Now is when we need people who have that feeling of community. It makes a difference in people’s lives and how we might recover from it.”

This week Cooper was honoured, along with 24 other B.C. residents, for their community achievements.

In an interview with the Tri-City News, Cooper said she was “humbled” by the acknowledgement, but her efforts to make the historic Ioco townsite a community space have been a labour of love not an arduous task.

When envisioning a place where history and community-life are intertwined in the former refinery-worker town, Cooper has many ideas.

“I thought ‘what can I possibly bring about that would bring about the feeling of community and so that some action could be taken?’” she said. “To me it’s the vision of community that I want to see part of the planning in Port Moody.”

Through her efforts, many buildings were saved, the town was designated a heritage site, and a community event was held for many years called Ioco Ghost Town Days.

The land is now owned by Gilic Global Development Management Inc. and could one day be developed for housing, but Cooper would also like to see community amenities, including an interpretive walking trail so families can enjoy nature and local history safely.

“It’s a gift, it’s a beautiful piece of land, it’s got water, forests, pathways, birds,” Cooper said. “Future planning needs to consider it an asset.”

Meanwhile, a documentary is being made about Cooper and it will likely highlight many of her accomplishments. To bring it through to completion, a group of supporters is fundraising.

In the meantime, Cooper says she is managing fine during the COVID-19 pandemic, thanks to her friends and family.

Having lived through several pandemics, including the Spanish flu, and economic hard-times, like the Great Depression, Cooper said people will be able to get through this emergency too.

“There are three things — we have to believe in what we’re doing, we have to have persistence and number three we have to have have faith.”

And while so much has happened in the intervening period, thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic cancelling live performances and festivals in the Tri-Cities, the iconic Coquitlam theatre and arts centre is once again looking at how it will move forward.

article continues below

Thanks to theatre patrons who donated back money from cancelled shows and subscriptions, the possibility that some live and educational programming could continue is definitely being considered.

“The amount of support we have received from our patrons is heart-warming to say the least,” said executive director Philip Hartwick.

While the 2020/21 performing arts season will not be moving forward, there may be a selection of intimate performances for smaller audiences as well as online programming via social media.

Since closing to the public on March 17, Evergreen has had to cancel the remainder of its 2019-2020 season, and further postpone the planned 2020- 2021 season to the following year.

The shut down could have meant curtains for the theatre, but revenue losses were kept to only about 50% thanks to a combination of donations, account credits and gift certificates.

As much as 45% of ticket purchasers whose events were cancelled donated the cost of their tickets or retained a credit instead of requesting a refund and 77% of early season subscribers for the 2020-21 season returned the cost if their subscriptions as donations and credits to the theatre.

The art gallery, meanwhile, is open with an exhibit called Trace by Gwenessa Lam and Hyung-Min Yoon. Visitors can also take a tour along the Evergreen’s exterior lobby windows to see In Possible Lands by Annie Briard. Both installations will be available until Aug. 1.

That’s because it’s all parts.

article continues below

Fera and the 21 young thespians in his charge were already blocking scenes from the WWI comedy musical when the COVID-19 pandemic shut rehearsals down and put CYT’s year-end presentation at Port Moody’s Inlet Theatre in peril. But after three days of dreading the worst, the director and the 20 members of the troupe who elected to stick with it pivoted to tackle the challenge of presenting the play online.

At a sprawling two-and-a-half hours and with each cast member playing a multitude of characters, it was a big ask.

Monologues was the answer.

Fera, his production team, and the student-actors, who range in age from 10 to 17, whittled Joan Littlewood’s original story to 80 minutes, then pared it some more to come in at a more reasonable 50 minutes which was then divided into 20 five-minute increments. Each of those segments represented a monologue that would be adapted from a scene or several scenes in the play and then recorded by the actors in their homes to be edited together into the final presentation that premieres on YouTube on Friday.

Lara Chamberlain, 14, said she had some doubts at first. But as the young actors worked with Fera in virtual meetings and texted each other ideas, notes and messages, the creative process took on a life of its own.

“We had to kind of work together with each other, but separately,” Chamberlain said.

Fera said he had to trust his actors.

“I always have a very clear vision,” he said of his directing style. “I had to throw that out and focus on the process.”

As the production, now dubbed Oh, What a Lovely War! 2.0, progressed, that process started to look more like a film shoot than a theatrical play.

“It gave me an appreciation for the theatricality of film acting,” Fera said, adding other members of the team had to adjust their thinking from a stage presentation as well.

Costumes had to be designed using clothes and materials readily available at home, as did sets. And each actor was provided with paper to erect a simple green screen upon which a background could be digitally inserted in post-production.

Chamberlain said she had to learn where and how to position the cell phone she used to record her scene, scout a location in her home with an eye for setting up the green screen as well as have sufficient light available — she settled on a blank wall in her parents’ bedroom.

After perfecting their scenes in online rehearsals and small virtual workshops with Fera, the actors were given a week to record their five-minute monologue and submit it to a Dropbox folder for final editing.

Chamberlain, who plays a soldier pining for his family and better days amidst the mud and horror of a trench, said it took her two takes to nail her monologue, which was broken into three parts to allow for different camera angles.

Fera said the intimacy of each performance has allowed him to focus on the details of his actors’ craft, something he figures he’ll be able to carry forward to future theatrical endeavours.

“Sometimes we lose sight of the craft of acting when we’re trying to put on a big show,” he said.

Chamberlain said the individual feedback she received as she worked on her part will also serve her well.

“Ensemble acting is fun, but now that it’s all been stripped down, it was a really cool experience,” she said.

• Oh, What a Lovely War! 2.0 premieres at 6 p.m. on Place des Arts’ YouTube channel. Afterward, Fera will answer questions about the production on Facebook. The presentation is free, but donations to support Place des Arts’ youth programming are being accepted.",[]

That’s because Joel Salaysay filmed Home Cooking entirely in the kitchen of his mom’s home in Coquitlam as he joined her and his grandmother in preparing an old family recipe for bak chang, a kind of sticky rice dumpling stuffed with chicken and mushrooms.

article continues below

The 16-minute end result is featured in the Shorts Program: BC Voices at the DOXA documentary film festival that runs online from June 18 to 26.

The film isn’t Salaysay’s pitch for his own gig on The Food Network.

Rather, he said, it was an opportunity to connect with his own Chinese-Filipino heritage as the trio exchanged stories while they cooked over the course of three weekends of filming last year.

Salaysay, who was born and raised in Canada, said he learned a lot about the relationship between the two women and the challenges they faced as immigrants from Singapore, where gender roles can be quite traditional. He said the act of cooking together fed the discussion and distracted everyone from the artificiality of sharing their story to a camera.

“When you cook at home, it takes time, it takes teamwork,” Salaysay said. “You have an activity you can do together.”

Salaysay said he got the idea of using the kitchen as a backdrop because of his own journey into his wife’s heritage through cooking Italian dishes she grew up with. In fact, during filming he explored that aspect of his story as well, but it was left on the cutting room floor.

Salaysay, 30, said the importance of food as a social connector has been an ongoing presence in his life, from plying his childhood friends with Asian treats when they came over to his house, to toiling in kitchens part-time as he studied film at Simon Fraser University. But it wasn’t until recently he really developed an appreciation for its aspects beyond sating just his physical hunger.

“The only thing that really connected me to my heritage was the cuisine,” he said.

And with the self-isolation of the past few months brought on to limit the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, Salaysay anticipates his film will take on a particular poignancy.

“I think it takes on a different context now,” he said. “There’s now more time to explore recipes, but what is missing is the communal family component.”

But take-out theatre?

A play by Port Moody playwright and actor Hiro Kanagawa is one of four scripts that comprise Plays2Perform@Home, a box set of intimate productions commissioned by Vancouver theatre company Boca del Lupo.

The 10 to 20-minute plays are meant to be performed by the recipients, in their home, around the dinner table or even a campfire, their audience mostly each other or a few people already in their pandemic “bubble.”

Kanagawa, who lives in Eagle Point with his wife and two children, said his contribution, entitled Negotiations, is a piece of “meta theatre” that acknowledges it’s a script written by a playwright, and the characters recognize they are characters in a play speaking lines composed for them. He said it was an obvious creative choice to make as most of the people performing it will likely be amateurs.

“I think by acknowledging the artificiality of the situation, we can actually talk about what we’re missing when we don’t have live theatre,” Kanagawa told The Tri-City News.

Innovation is not unusual for the award-winning playwright, whose script Indian Arm — an adaptation of a Henrik Ibsen novel — was recognized with a Jessie Richardson theatre award in 2015 as well as a Governor General’s literary award for English-language drama two years later.

He’s also contributed to Boca del Lupo’s production of Red Phone, that takes place in two fully-enclosed phone booths where audience members participate in a five-minute scripted conversation. It’s a socially-distanced way of performing a play with a live audience and it’s being presented on Granville Island July 1 to Aug. 22. For tickets, go to Eventbrite.

Kanagawa said his ability to think beyond the parameters of a traditional stage comes from his varied career that started as a sculptor and stretched to acting roles in film, television, animation and even a video game.

“I’ve had my finger in a lot of different pies,” he said. “If I have an idea, I can decide that may not be a play, it could be a short story, or an essay or a haiku.”

Kanagawa said it took him about two weeks to write Negotiations. And while the play isn’t about the current public health crisis, it was certainly an influence as it addresses the sense of existential limbo many people are feeling as we wait for the pandemic to subside and a form of normalcy to resume. He said it’s not unlike the uncertainty of losing electricity to your home or your internet connection.

Kanagawa said the excitement of pushing the boundaries of traditional theatre is heightened by the mystery and uniqueness of each performance, none of which he’ll likely see unless someone decides to present it over the Zoom virtual meeting platform and invites him in.

“You don’t really know how it’s going to turn out,” he said.

While hundreds of people could be employed in positions relating to the games and hubs — such as security jobs, rink staff, food services and hotel housekeeping — the financial benefit of two bubble communities under tight seal would be ""modest"" at best, suggested Bank of Montreal chief economist Douglas Porter.

article continues below

""When you think of how many tourists would normally be in Toronto during peak tourist season, I'm quite sure this is less than one per cent,"" he said.

""The reality is, it's not going to move the needle.""

But Porter, a lifelong hockey fan, said he anticipates a ""reasonably meaningful positive"" morale boost to Canadian sports fans who've been eagerly anticipating players returning to the ice in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The games are slated to start Aug. 1 with six Canadian teams qualifying for the 24-team resumption of play. No fans will be in the seats.

Edmonton and Toronto were confirmed as the NHL's hub cities on Friday night.

""The fact that part of our world is getting back to some kind of normal will help reinforce the sense that things, generally, are moving in that direction and could help support the recovery,"" Porter said.

The gradual comeback of major sporting events has drawn plenty of interest in recent weeks, with debates raging over the risks of putting players back into the games, even if spectators aren't allowed in the facilities.

Further questions have been raised over whether rigorous testing is enough to prevent outbreaks within the isolated community, which could potentially throw the whole plan into a costly disarray.

Many of these factors make placing a value on hockey's return especially difficult.

Michael Naraine, a professor at Brock University in St. Catharines, Ont., said the largest amount of money is on the line at large corporations, which he said is driving the return of major sporting events.

""The primary revenue driver for sports is broadcasting,"" said the assistant professor of digital sport management and marketing.

""They need television advertisers come back. The league itself needs to gain its revenue from NBC and Sportsnet here in Canada.""

Politicians have preferred to emphasize the positive aspects of a deal with the NHL.

Alberta Premier Jason Kenney eagerly promoted Edmonton as the ultimate hub city for the hockey league, posting videos on Twitter that prominently featured the Rocky Mountains and other popular destinations in the province.

Naraine said those public expressions by leaders are more an attempt to ""pander"" to their constituents than actually drive any meaningful economic impact. He said this is especially the case in Edmonton.

""Having major events come to town allows them to beat their chests and say, 'We exist. We're on the map. Come look at us,'"" he said.

""But the fact that the hub city will be in Edmonton is no different than whether the hub city would be in Toronto or Vancouver or elsewhere. It's not going to significantly drive tourism all of a sudden.""

Patrick Rishe, a sports professor at Washington University in St. Louis, said he sees value in showcasing a lesser known Canadian city on broadcast television with ""beauty shots"" of the locale. He said it may also sit well with NHL executives.

""You never know,"" he said. ""Doing and serving a good deed for the league now, this could pay dividends down the road.""

Any semblance of a regular hockey season would be welcomed by Dana Parris, owner of the Lockeroom sports bar in Barrie, Ont.

Even though her business is over 100 kilometres away from downtown Toronto, she anticipates the excitement would reverberate to her customers.

""If we could have sports come back and we hit Stage 3 (of Ontario's COVID reopening plan) around the same time, I will probably stop crying myself to sleep,"" she said.

Shut out of school gyms and community centres that are mostly still closed, and loathe to overstay its welcome at some outdoor facilities like Port Coquitlam’s Evergreen Park, Panther Hoops’ head coach Doug Dowell said the program needed a more permanent solution to make its plans to put on a full schedule of summer camps viable and sustainable.

“The pressure was on us to find a place we could call our own.”

That’s when several parents decided if they built it, the kids could play.

Over the course of a rainy weekend in June, when pretty much every weekend was damp, they cleaned up detritus from the parking lot behind BC Christian Academy where the program is based, bored deep holes into the pavement, assembled four full-sized basketball nets with glass backboards and poured concrete to lock them in place. A welder was brought in to add another level of security.

The result is an urban playground worthy of a Woody Harrelson streetball movie, set against a backdrop of an auto repair shop, crooked particleboard fencing and stacks of shipping containers.

MARIO BARTEL/THE TRI-CITY NEWS Stacks of shipping containers, and crooked fibreboard fencing are the backdrop for makeshift basketball courts constructed in a parking lot behind BC Christian Academy so Panther Hoops could conduct its summer youth camps.

More importantly, Dowell said, the makeshift courts have allowed Panther Hoops to offer co-ed day camps for players aged 7 to 16, and evening camps three times a week for more experienced high school players.

Dowell said the camps are an important element of Panther Hoops’ broadened mandate to serve the wider community after it started 13 years ago as a prep program at BC Christian to develop elite players who could contend for post-secondary scholarship opportunities.

The public health emergency threatened to derail that progress.

Dowell said he quickly recognized moving outdoors was the solution.

“With this whole COVID thing, people are on the edge,” he said. “We wanted to get the kids out the door.”

With no gym at BC Christian, Panther Hoops has always led a nomadic existence, so it ventured as far as Pitt Meadows to find open-air facilities it could use for small groups of kids working on their individual skills.

Dowell said one of the biggest challenges was getting his staff of experienced coaches that includes longtime high school coach Rich Goulet, former Cape Breton University bench boss David Petroziello, and former Pitt Meadows Marauders star player Scott Walton, to deconstruct routines they’ve run for years and reassemble them as individual drills that don’t require sharing the ball or close-quarters defence.

MARIO BARTEL/THE TRI-CITY NEWS Will Patterson works on an agility drill at Panther Hoops basketball camp that is being held on makeshift courts assembled in the back parking lot of BC Christian Academy in Coquitlam.

He said the exercise has been refreshing.

“In a way, it’s helped us realign ourselves.”

The end result, Dowell said, is a more innovative, free-form approach to basketball, more akin to creative streetball than the regimented strategies and patterns of the sport when it’s played in the gym and a final score matters.

“It’s made you get more into the ingenuity,” Dowell said. “It’s a missing part of the game.’

The weekly camps, that run through to the end of August, have full safety procedures in place, like a staged entrance to the outdoor facility after each participant has answered a health questionnaire, had their temperature checked as well as recorded, and their hands sanitized. Players must also bring their own ball which can be used only by them exclusively, although it’s also wiped down frequently during sessions and before they head home for the day.

And while the outdoor venue means the odd session may get washed away, the kids don’t lose out, as each is issued a punch card so a missed day can be made up as part of another camp.

Dowell said their summer of survival is actually allowing the program to thrive.

“True growth in the sport will only happen when you think outside the box,” he said.

According to a report in the Grand Forks Herald, Rizzo has asked for a release from his commitment to attend the University of North Dakota beginning in September. It’s unclear what his plans are for the coming season. His Western Hockey League playing rights are held by the Kamloops Blazers, which selected him 15th overall in the 2016 bantam draft.

Rizzo, who’s from Burnaby, scored 19 goals and 44 points for the Express last season, after he was acquired from the Penticton Vees last June, the day after he was drafted in the seventh round — 216th overall — by the Carolina Hurricanes in the NHL draft in Vancouver.

The 19-year-old was originally projected to be selected in the third to fifth round, but a back injury cost him 21 games and he finished his sophomore season in the BC Hockey League with 40 points in 37 games. After off-season back surgery to repair a torn hip muscle, Rizzo missed training camp and several early season games with the Express before joining the lineup and leading the team to the top regular season record.",[]

Aaron Tung, and his dad, Wilson, depart July 6 for Florida where the Centennial secondary student will be enrolling in Grade 11 and playing football at Clearwater Academy International, a small, independent prep school with a big reputation for success on the field and sending its athletes to top NCAA programs like Clemson, Pitt, Indiana and the University of Minnesota.

article continues below

The decision to send Aaron south to pursue his educational and football goals has been fraught, not with concern about the tropical storms that frequently pound the state from June to November, but with the uncertainty of landing in the midst of a pandemic that is catching its second wind as well as the tumult of racial unrest and protests brought on by the killing of several African Americans by white police officers.

“It couldn’t have been worse timing,” admitted Aaron’s mom, Denise.

Until March, the Tung family had never heard of Clearwater Academy. That’s when 17-year-old Aaron got a message from Clearwater’s coach, Jesse Chinchar, who had been impressed by a highlight video he saw online of the six foot four inch, 300-pound offensive tackle in action with the Centennial Centaurs.

At first, Aaron said, he didn’t put much stock in the idea of heading to Florida, but the more he researched the school’s football credentials and his parents looked into its academic offerings, the more seriously they considered Chinchar’s recruiting efforts.

Comprised of only 250 students from kindergarten to Grade 12, Clearwater Academy built its Knights football program from a six-man team in 2008 to an 11-man side in 2016 that went undefeated just two years later and has won several Florida Christian Association of Private and Parochial Schools championships. Many of its players are from out of state, including several from Canada. A recent grad was former Terry Fox Ravens quarterback Jevaun Jacobsen, who’s signed a letter of intent to attend Charleston Southern University in the fall.

Academically, Denise Tung — a teacher herself — said she liked the idea of a small school with small classes where Aaron could get more one-on-one attention. While there, he’ll be billeted with a host family.

“You really get the sense they’ll look out for the boys,” she said.

Still, it’s hard to reconcile the impression of an idyllic little school in the middle of Florida when the state continues to amass record numbers of COVID-19 infections and the country reels from racial unrest and political division.

Denise said the family has had ongoing discussions with Chinchar and other school officials about their protocols to protect students, including an immediate 14-day quarantine upon Aaron’s arrival.

“If I felt the school would have put him in danger, it would have been a no-go,” she said. “The option to come home is always there.”

The family, which is mixed-race, has also had several discussions with Aaron about expectations for his conduct in an environment where a seemingly innocent interaction can sometimes turn tragic.

“He recognizes he’s going to a whole different situation,” Denise said. “He has to be more mindful of his surroundings. He can’t be as free as he is here.”

Aaron said he’s up to the challenge. Even the process of getting to this decision has forced him to mature.

“I’m getting more comfortable with the idea of being uncomfortable,” he said. “I just have to make sure I stay away from any potential trouble.”

Coquitlam's Aaron Tung has his eyes set on a scholarship to play football at an NCAA Div. 1 school as he heads to Florida to play out his high school career at a prep school in Clearwater even as the United States reels from record numbers of COVID-19 infections and racial turmoil. - MARIO BARTEL/THE TRI-CITY NEWS

That shouldn’t be too hard during his initial isolation period, when he’ll be involved in virtual meetings with coaches and teammates, and immersing himself in learning the team’s playbook so he can hit the field running when training camp begins on July 20.

And while it’s still uncertain what a competitive season might look like, or whether it will happen at all, Aaron said that’s no different from football’s situation locally, where the BC Secondary School Football Association has yet to announce its intentions for September.

At the very least, Aaron said, he’ll be able to measure himself against bigger players with a deeper football background, something he expects will serve him well towards attaining his goal of landing a football scholarship to a big-time NCAA program in the Pacific Northwest.

“I can do this,” he said.",[]

Port Moody boasts many beautiful green spaces.

article continues below

With summer upon us and new recreating patterns emerging due to the Pandemic, additional pressure is being placed on local parks and beaches. One such park is Old Orchard Park located in the Pleasantside neighborhood.

Visitors are frequenting this park in unprecedented numbers. On any given sunny weekend, both designated parking lots are full to capacity (approximately 70 spaces). Overflow parking spills into the surrounding residential streets. Bentley Slip, San Remo, Sentinel, Alderside Road become overwhelmed with frustrated drivers looking to park.

Alderside, deemed a slow city street, is in fact a de-facto extension of the popular and well-used pathway system that connects all of Port Moody’s inlet parks. This pathway welcomes runners, walkers, children on bikes, seniors with pets, strollers, wheelchairs, and locals just going about their daily business.

It also is busy.

Vehicles that park on these streets often double the number of cars parked in the two designated lots.

A traffic barricade at the north end of Bentley Slip has forced cars to alternate with those on Alderside and this often results in driver confusion as to who has the right of way to proceed.

Add to this a blind spot at the east side of the barricade for drivers, which makes it difficult to initially see pedestrians using the road to access the park. The stairwell to the park does not easily accommodate those with beach equipment, strollers, or mobility devices. This barricade has exacerbated an already dangerous situation.

The conditions on these streets are unsafe. They have become parking lots rife with constant two-way traffic, illegal U-turns, vehicles idling on private property waiting for an available street spot, dumping of garbage on the street and/or private property, overnight parking, and more

Let’s make slow streets truly safe by reducing traffic congestion and duration on these designated streets.

Whether the city places a time limit on street parking, offers shuttles from other accessible points in the city to the beach, a solution must be found. Make it user friendly, do it soon and all can enjoy these beautiful green spaces in our community this summer and in perpetuity.

Re. “Coquitlam has too much parking near SkyTrain stations, says city staff” (Tri-City News, July 10)

The apparent drop in demand for parking in high density developments is largely the result of a flawed economic model rather than any change in people’s habits.

For most types of residences, parking is an integral part of your purchase. In the case of apartments or condominiums, the purchase or rental of a parking space can be optional. It is not surprising that many purchasers, given the option, choose to forego purchasing a space and opt to use publicly funded on-street parking instead.

As the city continues to profit by selling ever higher densities in transit served neighbourhoods the cost of providing parking is increasing as more parking spaces must be provided on a smaller footprint. The resulting increase in cost means that fewer purchasers opt to buy a space. It is a self perpetuating cycle.

If the sale of a parking space with a unit was mandatory you would see far more vehicles parked in the facilities provided for that purpose and fewer clogging the surrounding streets.

Re. “Coquitlam has too much parking near SkyTrain stations, says city staff” (Tri-City News, July 10)

The idea that too much parking near public transit is an issue has no relevance to anyone but developers hoping to cut costs. In fact, the opposite is true, there should be much more available parking near public transport to encourage as many people as possible to either leave their cars at home, or not to take their vehicles downtown.

What happened to the thought that we could try to improve our world? Has it been abandoned so a developer can make a profit of an additional .0005%?

There are decisions to make about educational paths, housing and employment. Many young adults have support systems (whether it’s parents and/or extended family members) to help them through.

But for the 700 young adults aging out of foster care every year, which happens at age 19 in B.C., the challenges are even more dire. Along with a roster of social barriers, youth aging out of foster care often don’t have networks that can facilitate access to rental housing, such as parents who can act as guarantors to sign leases. “You don’t have any of the main things a landlord on a screening application would require, and you’re trying to compete with people who do,” says Christina Grammenos, Community Engagement Coordinator for Aunt Leah’s Place, a charity organization that for 30 years has been dedicated to preventing youth homelessness.

article continues below

To answer this need, in 2016 Aunt Leah’s Place created the Friendly Landlord Network, a web portal which connects young adults age 19 to 30 who are looking to live in safe, affordable housing with community-minded landlords.

The online system, which acts as an internal market for youth and non-profits around the Lower Mainland representing young adults, allows landlords to post information about available housing. “We can post the unit up on the (site) and that way through the 19 partner organizations, someone is going to have a young adult who fits the location and price range and style of unit, so we can find a good fit,” Grammenos explains.

Along with supporting youth through their house-hunting process, the Friendly Landlord Network also provides support to landlords including guidance on tenancy rights and responsibilities. The organization also commits to doing a physical check-in once a month for the first six months.

While a number of youth have found long-term housing through the network, Grammenos says, “We’d really like to get more private landlords, more property managers and building owners.”

Once stable housing is secured, the doors open to other possibilities for youth. As Brendan, 21, who has found a home through the Friendly Landlord Network puts it: “To me, having a home represents stability. You can't do anything if you're constantly worrying about where you'll sleep this month, this week, or even today. A nice home is the foundation for all future aspirations to succeed.”

The clinic can even arrange home or institutional visits for the patients who are unable to come for an appointment.

""We also offer complimentary consultations,"" Milad says. ""It's important to us that your dentures fit properly and look good. To do that, we need to take into consideration your personal situation and what's important to you.""

Conveniently located on Lougheed Highway, Coquitlam, next to the Superstore, the clinic is open Monday to Friday 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., with Saturday appointments available on request.

""One of the things we emphasize with all our patients,"" Milad explains, ""is that even the best dentures don't last forever. They may feel comfortable, but they are made of static material. Your gums change constantly over time, but your dentures don't. It's important to have regular checkups and a rebase or reline.""

Milad and his colleagues recommend a rebase or relining of dentures every two years and suggest considering replacing dentures every five years.

""We often see patients who have had the same dentures for 20 years,"" Milad says. ""They think they're fine, but often the dentures have worn down to the point that they are masticating food rather than chewing it.""

Westwood Denture Clinic contacts patients every three months just to touch base. At the six-month mark, they suggest an appointment to make sure that dentures are functioning as they should.

""The worst case scenario,"" Milad says, ""is that we will clean and polish your dentures so that you get a refreshed look.""

Milad often hears from his clients' families that Mom or Dad put up with denture discomfort because they don't want to be a bother.

""Don't suffer,"" Milad urges. ""Come and see us. You're not a bother. Don't put up with discomfort or pain; your mouth or gums could be deteriorating. We can help ease any discomfort by modifying or replacing the dentures.""

No referrals are necessary for an appointment with the clinic. For people without insurance coverage Westwood Denture has payment plans available.

Students typically have at least one parent who speaks French or has a French-language heritage, or a sibling who has been educated in a French school system elsewhere in Canada.

Instilling a sense of cultural and linguistic pride in children of a minority population is not easy, but the schools in the CSF system have shown that it can be done through patience and persistence.

Here are 4 suggestions from Eric Leclerc, principal l'école des Pionniers-de-Maillardville in Port Coquitlam to share your cultural heritage with your children.

1. Keep the older generation involved

""When my daughters were small,"" says M. Leclerc, ""we used to play the 'Grandma doesn't speak English game.' My parents would come and visit and the kids would sometimes stay with them and learn not only the language, but their French cultural traditions."" The older generation can be a wealth of knowledge when it comes to a child learning about his or her heritage.

2. Have fun with the language

If children feel forced to speak a language other than English, or feel like it's mandatory, very often they will refuse.

""It's not so bad with the young children,"" M. Leclerc notes. ""When they are small they will speak French just to please you. But older kids— teenagers in particular—will not speak French just because you want them to. It has to be fun and interesting. We don't want to make them feel that English is bad; we want them to enjoy and celebrate both languages.""

3. Share activities in French together

Movies in French can be found on video-on-demand services like Netflix, or your local library might still have the DVD versions. Movies can often share not only the language, but also the francophone culture.

""At des Pionniers-de-Maillardville, we have movie nights,"" M. Leclerc says. ""We invite the community to come watch with us. It's always very popular.""

4. Live your heritage

Probably the most straightforward way to share your heritage with your child is to live it every day. Speak French with your child as much as possible. Experiment with French recipes at mealtimes. Bring French books home from the library. Boost your collection of French music CDs. For younger children, read them French fairy tales and nursery rhymes.

For many years, bridges and dentures were the only solution for those with missing teeth.

But that’s changed.

article continues below

“These days, dental implants often represent the best option for replacing teeth,” says dentist Dr. Myrna Pearce of On Track Dental in Port Coquitlam. “The results are excellent.”

According to Dr. Pearce, here are 5 reasons to choose dental implants over dentures when replacing missing teeth:

1. Dental implants are permanent and look natural.The procedure begins with the dentist inserting a metal anchor into the jaw bone using a process known as osseointegration, which allows the jawbone to grow into the implant. An artificial tooth or crown that matches the rest of your teeth is later attached.

2. Dental implants are convenient and comfortable. Dentures and bridges can affect speech, can make eating more difficult and can be a hassle to clean. Because dental implants function just like your own natural permanent teeth, there’s no need to worry about these everyday annoyances.

3.Dental implants have a success rate of up to 98% and can last a lifetime.The procedure can be done with a local anesthetic at the dentist’s office.

4. Dental implants are cared for the same way as natural teeth. Brushing and flossing are important, as are regular dental checkups.

5. Dental implant technology has made great strides in recent years. Computerized tomography, a critical breakthrough, eliminates the need for a preliminary surgery to make impressions of the jawbone.

Dr. Pearce and her team at On Track Dental have a wealth of experience and expertise in the area of implant dentistry. Dr. Pearce is a Diplomate with the American Board of Implantology.

Often people think the tires are OK because they can still see the tread, but it may not be wearing properly.”

Smith encourages people to bring their car into a garage if they’re not sure how to check their tires, since it’s only going to take a few minutes to have a look.

article continues below

“The problem could even be on the inside of the tire, which you would never see by just looking at them,” says Smith.

Here are common problems associated with poor tire maintenance:

• Using an incorrect tread gauge: You may know there’s a way to measure the depth of a tire tread but not know what it is. Go to a car parts store for a tread-depth gauge. If you measure 4/32 and up, that’s good. Under 4/32 needs replacing.

• Unseen cuts: Cuts that cause air loss, either rapid or slow, can lead to a tire blow out – a very hazardous event, particularly during highway driving. And it’s very complicated to control a vehicle that blows a tire, Smith warns.

• Damage on the side of the tire: If you have any kind of damage on the side of the tire, the integrity is compromised. Any kind of puncture, in particular, should be dealt with right away.

• Over-inflation: This causes the tire to be too rounded where it touches the ground, so there is less grip on the road. It will also cause the middle treads to wear more quickly than the outer treads, causing the need for early replacement.

• Under-inflation: This causes the outer treads to wear more quickly and can lead to increasing fuel costs by as much as 15%, because the tire actually has too much grip and causes the engine to work harder.

“If air pressure is problematic because you now have to pay for air or you don’t have a proper gauge, go to a full-service station where they will check it for you,” Smith suggests. The minor extra cost could saves hundreds of dollars – or your life.

And you don’t need a referral from your dentist to see him.

“You can come directly to a denturist,” says Boris. “Dentists are doctors, but they do not fabricate the dentures. That’s the work of denturists.”

article continues below

It’s a common misconception that dentists do any denture-related work in-house. In fact, dentists outsource all of their denture work—which is why it makes sense to visit the denturist directly.

As it is with most consumer products, there are many variables when it comes to the quality of dentures, mostly as it pertains to the type of materials used. A denturist will inform you of exactly how your dentures are made and give you options based on what your lifestyle requires.

The initial steps required to make a good denture are the same whether you see the dentist first or not. Impressions are made of your upper and lower jaw using an impression tray and alginate. After the impressions are made, on your next appointment, the denturist will do a ‘Try-in’ where you can give your suggestions regarding the aesthetics before the final fabrication of the denture.

After the Try-in, the denturist will call you in for a fit. And once the dentures are fitted, you will be required to come for a few adjustments.

With the dentist, the process can take anywhere from 3 to 6 weeks, or even longer depending on the dentist’s and the outside lab’s availability. At Austin Denture Clinic, the timelines are shorter and much more predictable.

“The dentist is the middle-man with dentures,” says Boris. “Here, we do all the work in-office. We look after the patient’s needs from beginning to end. Fewer hands touch the case, and the end product is completely personalized to the patient.”

""Often, when that conversation doesn't happen, children are unclear as to their parent's wishes,"" Nicole explains. ""I've seen cases where one child has said that their parent wanted to buried and another felt that cremation was wanted. It leads to family arguments and the possibility that your wishes may not be carried out.""

article continues below

The Memorial Society of B.C. has been encouraging members and their families to have an end of life planning conversation for more than 60 years. With in excess of 242,000 members around the province, the Society is the largest memorial society in North America.

""Your survivors can benefit from our help when the time comes,"" says Nicole. ""Their first phone call should be to the Society. We can have your wishes for the disposition of your remains on file. We can then refer them to a registered funeral service provider that can offer them our member discount rate.""

That one phone call can relieve your loved ones from the anxiety and discomfort related to shopping around for the best funeral services rate at a time of emotional stress.

""Unfortunately, we live in denial,"" says Nicole. ""At the Society, we try to reach out to the children, who are usually in their forties and fifties, and encourage them to have the conversation with their parents. I've been at information sessions where a parent has shared that they have a pre-paid plot for their remains, but their child sitting next to them was totally unaware. They can't carry out your wishes if they don't know what they are.""

It seems natural that we all plan for our vacations and retirement, but we don't want to plan for the end of life. This is a mistake, says Nicole.

""A man I know opens his lectures by saying, 'Dying is not a choice. It is going to happen.' With that in mind, it is important that we plan for the end and make sure our loved ones know our wishes. It will save them money and heartache at a difficult time.""

Maybe it’s a quiet spot at home where you can sip a relaxing drink and unwind the tension of the day.

article continues below

Perhaps it’s under a cozy quilt, shared with a furry, loyal friend.

Or it could be the warm and comforting embrace of a loved one - your shield from the world outside.

Now, imagine for a moment you had none of those.

How would you feel?

Where would you go?

Who would seek out?

Now, think of what it would be like to endure that with the additional weight of mental illness.

When the Riverview Psychiatric Hospital was in the midst of its phased shut down during the early 1970s, a group of volunteers in the Tri-Cities area knew those being released would not have that safe place. They knew that the newly released patients would require the support of a caring community, and thus New View Society was born.

And since 1973 it has provided for those challenged by severe and persistent mental illness through social/recreational programming, life skills development, educational/vocational and employment support, and community living support, says Tiffany Melius, executive director of New View Society.

Today, with funding from the local health authority and BC Housing, the organization has grown to also provide housing to 51 people in the area, employ over 35 staff, and provide services to over 600 unique individuals in the Tri-Cities with a diagnosed mental illness.

“There was a huge amount of understanding, compassion and caring in the Tri-Cities that, instead of sending people elsewhere, created a safe place to care for people in their home community,” Meliussays.

“Our vision is community health through mental health. We believe there can’t be mental health without community, and a community is healthier if we look after those people who are struggling.”

For example, if employment is an obstacle, New View runs an in-house supported employment/social enterprise hybrid program - One Stop Assembly, a packaging business.

“We employ our members who are not quite ready to get a job in the general employment market,” Melius says.

“Sometimes, they just need the confidence to overcome their anxiety in seeking market employment. What they get with us is an environment where people have experience working with those with mental illness. And that provides a special, safe place when a day does not go well.

“On that day, they can be here at New View and know it’s a safe place for them to come,” Melius says.

With 20 years of eyewear and optical experience under his belt, it’s safe to say that Manocha knows a few things about finding your perfect glasses.

Here are some guiding questions Manocha uses when fitting customers at Basic Eyewear Optical. Think of these next time you’re getting new glasses:

article continues below

· What are the glasses being used for? Manocha says that the perfect frame can vary depending on what you’re using them for. “If their used just strictly for reading, then we would choose a frame that would be different and more focused in on that compared to glasses used for driving.”

· What do you do for a living? Somebody working in construction would want more of a durable frame, Manocha says, compared to somebody who does a lot of public speaking in meetings.

· What is your face shape? At Basic Eyewear Optical, the staff takes the time to determine your face shape and choose the kinds of styles and shapes that best compliment your features.

· How about style? Having been in the industry for two decades, you could say Manocha is an expert on the changing trends and style of eyewear.

Though, putting your trust in people who know glasses is just one of the many benefits of going to a smaller business, like Basic Eyewear Optical.

Manocha says that one of the defining features smaller businesses have over high volume and discount stores is consistency. “When you’re dealing with a lot of chains, you’re always dealing with somebody different,” Manocha continued. “But here, you’ll always be seeing the same group of people every time so we get to know you, know your name, and know your families.”

Personalized service is another thing Basic Eyewear Optical prides itself on. This means offering better pricing, and provides a direct billing service to the clients insurance providers, and providing a wide variety of nearly 20 designer lines of eyeglasses, sunglasses and contact lenses. Manocha says that at Basic Eyewear Optical, they can deal with anyone with any product.

Here are five ways it’s changing things up.

article continues below

1. It’s completely allergy friendly

Fung began to develop allergies and intolerances a few years ago – she reacts to everything from fruit to milk – so she provides something for everyone, from dairy-free cheesecake to gluten-free cupcakes. There’s no cross-contamination – “I’m a hygiene freak!” she says – so even people with severe allergies can order confidently. All ingredients are non-GMO and organic, and everything is home made.

2. The coffee is a cut above

Most of us see a takeaway coffee as fuel. For Fung, it’s an art. “I can’t stand most of the coffee you buy in high-street cafes – it’s too bitter and you can’t taste the beans. At my cafe you get the best cuppa, using the right beans, roasted the right way, brewed for the correct length of time,” she says. Fung’s obsession with coffee is the reason behind Cupping 8’s name – cupping is the proper term and protocol for how coffee should be tasted.

3. It caters to all cultures

Mindful of the fact that Coquitlam is a multicultural place, you can get foods from different backgrounds including Chinese, Japanese and Canadian. “We’re the first Japanese tofu cheesecake cafe in Vancouver and we offer several different flavours including mango, organic green tea and Americano,” says Fung, a trained baker. Vegetarians aren’t left out either – Cupping 8 serves dishes that go beyond standard fare, such as laksa noodles and Japanese curry.

4. It’s not just for desserts and coffee

While Cupping 8 is already known for its cheesecake, Fung is keen to tell customers about its all-day light lunch set of soup, salad, main course and coffee or tea. “Sometimes you want a little bit of everything, without too much of anything,” she says. The cafe also serves breakfasts and dinner and currently has a Happy Hour special from 2pm-5pm Tuesdays to Thursdays, where you get 10 per cent off with a minimum purchase of $5.

5. Its goal is to spread happiness

“My commitment for my business is customers first,” says Fung. “The 8 in the cafe’s name means infinity of love and happiness. Nowadays people are so sad. I want to share happiness for everybody.”

Cupping 8 Cafe is at 111-1190 Pinetree Way, Coquitlam. See Cupping8.com for opening hours. You can also find the cafe on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.",[]

As part of the Dignity Memorial® network, North America’s largest funeral corporation, Forest Lawn Funeral Home and Ocean View Funeral Home have access to learnings from across the continent, allowing staff to study different techniques and services offered in other cities and apply them to funerals in the Lower Mainland.

“We’ve brought a lot of programs here that have found success elsewhere,” says Andrew Knapman, manager of Forest Lawn Funeral Home. “It’s been a huge benefit having multiple funeral homes across the continent to draw from.”

Among the services they offer are a 24-hour compassion line, a bereavement travel program, full access to a grief management library, and a child/grandchild protection plan—if your child or grandchild passes away unmarried and under 21 years of age, funeral services are provided at no cost.

The compassion line is one of the most widely used programs, according to Knapman. It allows grieving family members to speak to a psychologist with a social work degree at any hour, in any language.

Knapman says this is particularly helpful months after the death of a loved one.

“Many people don’t think they’re going to use it at first,” he says. “They say they have a good network. But at 3 a.m., two months after your mom has passed away, most people aren’t comfortable calling someone and waking them up. “

“That’s where the compassion line is very useful,” he adds. “You can connect with someone when you really need to.”

It helps us accomplish tasks every day of our lives.

It allows us to solve problems, learn and grow.

So, when it comes to developing skills to become proficient at math, confidence plays a big role. That’s why it’s a mainstay in the approach for youngsters enrolled at Mathnasium of Tri-Cities, which is celebrating its second anniversary.

From their location at 2764 Barnet Hwy. in Coquitlam, specially trained instructors provide math help for students from K-12 in an enjoyable, comfortable and supportive environment.

“Our belief is every child has a potential, and our devotion is to help them achieve it,” says Dr. Anoma Mudalige, centre director of Mathnasium of Tri-Cities. “And we are passionate about math and want our students to feel the same way.”

Each student that comes to Mathnasium undergoes a written and oral assessment which helps to identify where their skill gaps are, if any. Based on the findings, a personalized learning plan is then developed.

“Whether they are struggling or want to leap ahead, we have a solution for them,” she says.

“Our unique way of teaching helps children to improve not only their math skills but also their confidence and problem solving. If they remain interested and enjoy what they are doing, they will build up their confidence.”

“And the learning sessions are very interactive and fun because our instructors are trained to teach that way,” Dr. Mudalige says.

Recently, an instructor at Mathnasium of Tri-Cities was recognized for their ability and hard work.

Homayoun Ghaseminezhad was selected as the best Mathnasium teacher in Western Canada.

“He is a first-year student at SFU, very outgoing and engaging and motivates the children very well.

“We are very proud of him,” Dr. Mudalige says.

Parents are also impressed with the Mathnasium of Tri-Cities approach.

“The Mathnasium community is very welcoming and is able to thoroughly help with the complete understanding of the main math concepts for the certain individual’s level,” says one. “With a hands on program, it allows the students to ask for assistance with whatever they may struggle at without taking away from their learning experience.”

While every student is different in their abilities, significant progress can usually be seen in as little as three months.

Plus, there is often a spillover benefit when it comes to school subjects other than math. “We give them problems to solve, and they can transfer that way of approaching problems in other subjects,” Dr. Mudalige says.

The welcoming aromatherapy sets in motion the feeling of home. As your body relaxes, there is an immediate release of tension from your mind and emotions.

Conveniently located on Austin Avenue at Gatensbury Street in Coquitlam, Jai Yoga brings a positive change to the lives of its community members in two ways.

1) Yoga helps improve your mental health

Let’s face it, life is stressful. There is so much going on that we often feel frazzled and overwhelmed. Yoga can help alleviate that feeling and allow you to relax and, thus, positively transform your life.

“Stress has become a regular part of our daily lives,” says Prem Kaur, co-founder of Jai Yoga Studio. “Before yoga came into my life, I didn’t even realize how wound up I was. When yoga became a regular part of my life, I quickly learned how to deal with daily stressors efficiently and effectively.

“If you do yoga every day or at least three times a week,” Kaur explains, “not only are you getting fantastic exercise for your body, you are learning tools on how to destress yourself in stressful situations. You will be amazed at how your overall perception will change.”

2) Yoga will tone your body, build strength and stamina

“If you know how to breathe, yoga is for you,” says Jai Singh, founder of Jai Yoga Studio. As soon as you start practicing yoga regularly, your entire body will begin getting stronger and leaner.

“Yoga will positively impact your life physically and emotionally,” says Singh. “If you are coming here to boost your fitness level, you will notice yourself becoming fitter and leaner. If you are coming here to improve your health, you will find yourself more centred in your day-to-day life. It is all-encompassing activity you can do for yourself.”

Jai Yoga is now offering a 30-days introductory program with an unlimited number of classes you can take within the first month. For more information, visit their website at www.jai-yoga.com, call 778-886-6520 or email hello@jai-yoga.com.",[]

It’s imprinted in Dr. Ron Elloway’s DNA.

So too, it seems, is dentistry, since he’s one of about 30 dentists in his expanded family circle. And like many of his siblings and relatives, when he’s not tending to patients at his practice, Elgin Dental Group in Port Coquitlam, he has combined his expertise and sense of community service to help those in need.

“We come from a religious background, I’m a third generation, Seventh-day Adventist Christian, and part of that upbringing is to help people in need,” Elloway says.

That’s the philosophy behind Loma Linda University in California, a Seventh-Day Adventist school where many of Elloway’s family members attended.

“Most of my relatives, including my father, sister and brothers all went there,” he says. “It prides itself on teaching medical and dental education so they can train students to become missionaries.”

While Elloway graduated from Georgetown University,that same willingness to help people in need remained at the forefront for him.

“I was on welfare once when I was waiting to pass my boards (exams) at UBC and had a young family with two children,” he says. “Not being able to make a living at what I was trained to do, I told the welfare office that if I could get some support, I’d return the favour to those in need once I was working.”

And he has, ever since he took over the practice from his father more than three decades ago.

When treating the local homeless population, Elloway says he is most often pulling teeth and making dentures for the patient.

“I’ve been given these gifts from God, and I love what I’m doing,” he says. “I really don’t need to work anymore, but I love my staff and what I can do for people.”

Elloway also helps feed the local homeless on a monthly basis, which provides the opportunity to check out their teeth and encourage them to make an appointment at his practice.

“In general, I love getting people out of pain,” he says. “But to help restore someone who has a really deficient smile and return some dignity to them so they can go out into the world, get a job or simply smile at someone else with confidence, it changes their life. To me, that’s very rewarding.”

Is using a so-called e-cigarette better than smoking? Are they really that different? These questions have been asked repeatedly since the products hit the market and became an everyday sight on street corners and outside coffee shops.

Some recent reports say e-cigarettes are no better for you than regular cigarettes, while others tout the devices as an effective way to quit smoking altogether.

“E-cigarettes and cigarettes are totally different things,” says Sutha Nada, Director of Express News & Smokes. “You really can’t compare the two. For one thing, they should not call them e-cigarettes, because you are not smoking, but rather ‘vaping’ or inhaling a vapour.”

Sutha, whose stores carry both conventional cigarettes and organic cigarettes, as well as e-cigarettes and accessories (they even make their own e-juice brand) said there are several important differences between regular cigarettes and e-cigarettes:

1. Smoke vs Vapour: With cigarettes, you’re inhaling the smoke from a treated and dried tobacco leaf, which can have many chemicals, according to Sutha, whereas the e-juice for e-cigarettes usually contain four (vegetable oil, glycol, flavouring and sometimes nicotine).

2. Nicotine: The addictive substance in cigarettes is more controlled and available in different e-juice strengths. Unlike conventional cigarettes, you can gradually decrease your dependence on nicotine by using e-juice with less and less nicotine… starting at 18 mgs per bottle and working your way to 12, 6, 0 and finally to an e-liquid without any nicotine at all.

3. Flavours: E-cigarette liquid comes in an incredible array of flavours, from standard tobacco flavouring to pina colada, strawberry milkshake, bubblegum, coffee and beyond.

4. Safety: Okay, a conventional cigarette never exploded in someone’s pants, however Sutha said the videos and reports he has heard of e-cigarettes exploding were all due to improper use and charging with the device’s lithium ion batteries. And since Express News & Smokes makes its own e-juice, Sutha knows what goes in the liquid, siting that vaping is “very safe” in comparison to cigarettes.

5. Personalization: E-cigarettes come in all shapes, sizes, colours, designs and functionalities. There are different tanks and different batteries. These new devices offer a novel way for people to personalize and accessorize.

Sutha said many customers who have never smoked are coming to his locations across the Lower Mainland just to try vaping, and choosing a non-nicotine juice.

“Without nicotine,” says Sutha, “it is not addictive, so people come in to try what it feels like and what it tastes like. We have four different brands as Express News Tobacconist, Express News, Express News Convenience, and Express News & Smokes.”

""People asking this question are generally thinking that it would be good to pay for tomorrow's cost today,"" says Nicole Renwick, Executive Director of the Memorial Society of B.C. ""And they want to save their loved ones the bother of making financial decisions after they have passed, and there are a few other options.""

article continues below

For a nominal membership fee, the Memorial Society can work with you to pre-plan, rather than pre-pay, your funeral and arrangements for the disposal of your remains.

""We've been helping people with end of life arrangements for more than sixty years,"" Nicole notes. ""We have in excess of 242,000 members around the province, making us the largest memorial society in North America.""

Pre-planning with the Memorial Society is as simple as filling in an arrangement form detailing your wishes, and then making sure your survivors are aware of your membership in the Society.

""When end of life occurs,"" Nicole explains, ""the survivor should call us first. We will then refer them to a funeral home that is registered with us and with whom we have negotiated a member discount.""

While pre-paying is an option, there are other options to keep in mind such as the CPP Death Benefit or taking out a GIC with your executor. If you do decide to pre-pay your costs here are a few points to keep mind:

· You may move away from the area where your selected funeral home is located.

· If you ask for a refund from a funeral service provider for any reason after 30 days of signing a pre-payment contract, the provider is entitled to retain up to 20 percent of your money.

· A pre-payment contract usually does not include all the costs incurred at the time of death. For example, catering, flowers, cost for death certificates etc. are not included.

· If your survivors do not know about the pre-payments, it is possible that the money will be lost.

""We can give you peace of mind through pre-planning,"" she says, ""and relieve your loved ones of stress at an emotional time, while also making sure they receive a discounted rate on the provision of funeral services.""

Figure skating is a well-respected competitive sport. So why don’t more boys do it? The answer seems to be: hockey.

There are well-known benefits to skating, of course, but figure skating has its own special rewards:

1. Get fit. We at the Coquitlam Skating Club, strive to have both boys and girls develop a love for figure skating and a desire to want to “Skate for Life”.

2. Get Artistic.As well as a sport, figure skating allows athletes to develop their artistic side, as movement to music is an integral part of the sport.

3. Get Confident. Asfigure skating, for the most part, is an individual, non contact sport, performance skills lead to building self confidence at an early age.

4. Get Life Skills. Activity, fitness, goal setting, performance, mentoring, friendship…… are just a few of the life skills developed through sport.

5. Patrick Chan. Scott Moir. Tessa Virtue. Kaetlyn Osmond. There are so many amazing Canadian figure skaters, representing Canada at the Olympics and at competitions all around the world. Hockey has its stars, and figure skating does, too.

We reached out to Phil Haig, award-winning Tri-Cities Realtor® and the leader of Team Phil Haig, for his top 10 tips on what to ask any Realtor® before you hire them.

1. Experience matters: Ask the prospective Realtor® how long they’ve been in the business and what length of time they’ve been selling in the local market, says Haig.

article continues below

“A better question might actually be to ask the Realtor® if he or she has another job,” he adds. “You want to know if being a Realtor® is their primary occupation, because it should be. Otherwise, it can quickly become frustrating if you’re trying to reach your Realtor® on their lunch break and you can’t get an answer.”

2. Ask for the time to review any document before signing. Not only is it a best practice with any contract, it’s your legal right.

3. Ask how the proposed marketing plan will meet your needs.Or simply ask for the name of their Marketing Director.

“There’s a lot that goes into selling a home,” says Phil. “If a Realtor is doing it all on their own, they’re spending 95% of their time on paperwork and administrative details. If they work with an experienced team, they can deliver a lot more value. We have a dedicated Marketing Director that handles marketing, for example. We also have assistants that handle the paperwork so that we can focus on helping our clients buy or sell a home.”

4. Ask for References: If the person can’t supply credible references, move on.

5. Ask what happens if you’re unhappy with their service.

“If a Realtor®refuses to cancel their listing, ask to speak to their manager right away,” says Phil. “Clients should be able to cancel at any time. Of course, if you do a good job, cancellation procedures tend to be irrelevant. But it’s still good to be aware of your rights.”

6. Does the prospective Realtor®try to convince you to sign based on their sales ratios? “Internal numbers can be manipulated to influence the public,” says Phil. “We keep track of sales ratios, of course, but we don’t use them for advertising.”

7. Ask if the Realtor® can help you find other professionals you might need during the process. The best Vancouver Realtors®have a rolodex filled with the names of the best home inspectors, staging directors, renovators, lawyers, financial advisors and more, says Phil. It should be a part of the service they offer.

8. Ask what their commission breakdown is. Commissions are negotiable and may differ from broker to broker. You should get a clear breakdown of the commission structure before hiring your Realtor®, not after.",[]

Passengers of the Pacific Bear will have an all-inclusive wilderness lodge experience which includes a stay at Homfray Lodge on the remote waters of Homfray Channel in Desolation Sound, as well as Grizzly Bears tours.

Desolation Sound has the warmest waters of the B.C. coast with temperatures in the Sound often exceeding 22°C (75°F) from June to September. It is the second-deepest sound in North America, reaching depths of 2,400 feet with peaks rising up to 8,000 feet from the water. With less than a knot of current, many global boaters and sea kayakers regard Desolation Sound as a spectacular destination.

This coastal haven of deep fjords and towering 7,000-foot peaks, boasts spectacular waterfalls, glacier-fed rivers and magnificent Coastal Mountains in the backdrop. And the small size of the boat allows guests to get up-close-and-personal with the fjords. “On the boat, there’s a rooftop where you can have lunch. We stop at the waterfalls and get so close that we can feel the splash of the water on our cheeks,” says Sabrina Ouellette, reservations coordinator at Pacific Coastal Cruises & Tours, which runs the tours.

Sadly, it wasn't the war to end all wars, as the world had been promised; many more wars followed WW2, some of which are still raging today.

Canada has been marking Remembrance Day since 1919 and in British Columbia it's a statutory holiday. The number of veterans from the two World Wars may be dwindling, but the Royal Canadian Legion Coquitlam Branch is determined that they be remembered, along with veterans of more recent conflicts.

""Without all the sacrifices that our veterans went through, our world would look a lot different today,"" says Bob Chapman, First Vice President of the Royal Canadian Legion Branch 263. ""Even now, our military personnel who are going overseas to fight or keep the peace must be remembered for their contributions and dedication.""

Remembrance Day is an important time for Legions across the country, but the work starts weeks before with the Poppy Appeal.

""All the money raised from the sale of poppies is kept in the community,"" Bob notes. ""We use the funds over the course of the year to support our veterans, both old and young. We also recognize the contributions of our police officers and first responders, as they're also eligible to apply to us for help.""

The day itself starts with a ceremony at the local school.

""It's generally well attended by the community,"" Bob says, ""and then we have a parade over to our small cenotaph in Coquitlam. There are usually several cadet bands, and the pipe band from Simon Fraser University joins us.""

After a brief service and two minutes of silence to remember the sacrifices of veterans here and abroad, the surviving veterans, local politicians, Legion members and the general public march back to the Legion on Ridgeway Avenue.

""There was a lot of evil during the World Wars,"" Bob says. ""It's important that we remember what our men and women went through for us- and that we acknowledge and appreciate the efforts of the generations of armed forces since who have fought for our country.""

Not only is it a place for residents to come together and learn new skills, get a really fun workout and meet new people, the studio also provides a chance for dancers to sharpen their minds. “Beyond the physical, social and emotional benefits, dancing has been shown to do a lot cognitively for people as they age,” says Ferchuk.

If those benefits weren’t enough, Smith and Ferchuk have made it their mission to give back to Tri-Cities charities through a variety of philanthropic partnerships. A cause close to their hearts is the Crossroads Hospice Society. “We got involved about eight years ago with a fundraiser that we were part of called Dancing With Our Stars. Crossroads Hospice is a wonderful organization that does important and significant work and we always do our best to do something with their Treasures of Christmas fund raising event each year” says Ferchuk.

Arthur Murray Coquitlam also holds a Food and Toy Drive for Share Services Society. Here, each year, the studio’s teachers, students and owners gather hundreds of pounds of food, toys and other donations. Numerous other charitable organizations benefit from Arthur Murray Coquitlam’s generosity through dance class packages donated to their silent auctions. Organizations such as Eagle Ridge Hospital Foundation, I am Someone (anti-bullying initiative) and local school fundraisers (Arch Bishop Carney, Glen Eagle Secondary) to name a few.

Perhaps the biggest benefit of all, though, is the dancing itself. There is a deeper, almost spiritual, benefit that social dancing brings to Coquitlam residents. Says Ferchuk: “I think one of the things dancing does is that it creates a place where people meet in a positive and healthy environment … when there’s laughter, music and smiles, it just tends to create more of that in [people’s] lives.”

A Coquitlam Community Imaging Clinic can help with that by using your body’s own natural healing powers to treat chronic pain and discomfort.

MedRay Imaging, located at 100 - 3001 Gordon Ave., offers a process employing platelet-rich plasma (PRP), a component found in blood, to help repair body tissue.

article continues below

The platelets, derived from a small amount of your own blood, are precisely re-injected back into the affected area, using MedRay’s expertise in medical imaging, where they can work their healing magic.

“Using a centrifuge, we are able to spin and separate your blood into various components, one of them being a rich and densely concentrated plasma with about 18 times the baseline amount of platelets that you naturally have,” said Randy Webster, COO of MedRay Imaging.

Since the blood supply to most tendons in a body is usually quite low, delivering a targeted platelet-rich injection directly to an affected area helps speed up healing and reduces discomfort.

“It triggers the healing within that specific part of your body,” Webster explained.

Traditional treatments for chronic joint pain usually involve anti-inflammatory medications or pain killers that can have negative side effects. While other treatments, such as steroid injections, can offer relief but they don’t address the core source of the problem. PRP goes to the root cause to repair tissue and provide pain relief, naturally.

“For a lot of people who lead active lifestyles, this treatment allows them to continue with that,” Webster said. “A lot of amateur and professional athletes who have used this have said it has extended their careers because it has allowed their body to regenerate.”

PRP is not covered by B.C.’s Medical Services Plan and each treatment costs $850. Webster said the number of treatments required can vary with the individual, depending on how your body responds.

“Some people can see results from one treatment, others can have a treatment once every four months over a longer period of time,” he said. “Ultimately, we want to give people relief and get them back to an active lifestyle.”

Here’s a look at five of Aroma Indian Restaurant and Lounge most popular vegan items:

1. Eggplant Bhurta – Combining mashed eggplants, tomatoes, sautéed onions and peas and Indian spices, the Eggplant Bharta is a hearty and thick meal for any vegan-eater. “The Eggplant also comes with a nice smoky taste to it because of the tandoori clay oven,” says Bhatt.

2. Vegetable jalfrazie – “Jalfrazie is a bit healthier than its thicker eggplant counterpart because it is made up of a lot of different veggies sautéed together,” said Bhatt, noting some key ingredients of cauliflowers, broccoli, green bean, carrots, baby eggplant, taro root, potatoes, tomatoes, mushrooms, ground onions, garlic and ginger. “Think of it as a stir fry - but an Indian stir fry - combining the exotic spices and flavours of the culture.”

3. Dal makhani – Commonly used instead of soup in Indian culture, the dal makhani consists of Red Beans and other lentils combined with onion, ginger, garlic, tomatoes, and indian spices.

With busy workdays and inconsistent sleep schedules, it is no wonder people struggle with tiredness and other serious health concerns stemming from sleep deprivation.

Roxanne Brooks is a Registered Holistic Nutritionist and Adult Sleep Coach who consults out of the CanSleep clinics, a medical consulting company that provides treatments for sleep-related disorders and specializes in sleep apnea. Brooks, who works by referral from the Clinical Therapists, said there are several things that people do throughout the day that affect their sleeping habits, both in positive and negative ways. She suggested that the time at which you exercise, have your last coffee, or watch TV can drastically affect your sleeping habits and overall quality of sleep.

Other sources of sleep deprivation can result from medical causes, a common disorder being Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). Often misdiagnosed and underreported, OSA is a breathing disorder that occurs when there is a blockage at the back of the throat, impeding on a person’s ability to breathe. While many may misdiagnose OSA as fatigue or snoring, it can have severe health consequences, resulting in heart disease, depression, type II diabetes, and high blood pressure.

Restful sleep is a necessary aspect of a healthy lifestyle. It is imperative for many essential bodily functions, including memory, cognition, and a strong immune system. Prolonged sleep deprivation has also been linked to eye disease, weight loss, and even death; while it is unclear how long people can survive without sleep, studies show that hallucinations begin within 11 days and people have died within 32 days.

The consequences of prolonged sleep deprivation can be dangerous for you and those around you. Whether you have trouble sleeping because you watch TV late at night, or because you suffer from untreated OSA, the Registered Nurses and Respiratory Therapists at CanSleep Services can help.

“I have an interest—you might call it a passion—for creating smiles,” Dr. Thorpe says. “I’m quite artistic by nature and cosmetic dentistry can be very creative.”

article continues below

Dr. Thorpe’s philosophy is to make sure you have the smile you want.

“It’s not about giving everyone the same smile,” she explains, “It’s about creating a smile that’s right for the patient’s face. The smile they think is perfect. Not the smile I think is perfect.”

Dr. Thorpe suggests a consultation to become informed about all the options available. Her consultations are free and she encourages patients to come back as many times as necessary before deciding on a procedure.

“It’s like building a house,” she says. “Here’s the foundation and this is what we can or cannot do on top or on the ground floor. These are the issues and these are the cost factors. We talk about how long a procedure will last; we talk about time factors. I want patients to be thoroughly informed and prepared.”

Taking photographs is also part of the process. Dr. Thorpe believes that if the patient can see what she sees, the whole process is a lot easier and less stressful.

Asked why cosmetic dentistry has become so popular, Dr. Thorpe points to both the physical and emotional benefits for patients.

“Dentists like cosmetic dentistry because it’s so rewarding,” she explains. “People who were afraid to smile, suddenly smile all the time. Their whole personality changes; their approach to the world changes. It’s a whole new beginning for them.”

The results of cosmetic dentistry should be natural and right for the patient’s face, Dr. Thorpe adds.

“You want people to say, ‘Wow, you look great!’ not “Wow, you’ve had your teeth fixed!’”

""Right now,"" says Kathy, ""if you want to hire a companion for yourself or an ageing parent, there are no regulations. In fact, anyone can call themselves a companion. Seniors or their families can hire graduates of the Clever Companion program and be confident that these people are professionals who have been trained to facilitate discussion on specific subjects of interest to their client, either on a one-to-one basis or in a group setting.""

Modules in the training program include sessions on communication, leadership, companionship and seniors' health, as well as a practicum component. A certificate is awarded after successful completion.

In keeping with the goal of Integra College to provide second career courses, graduates of the Clever Companion program often go on to set up their own home-based companion practitioner business working with seniors.

The College also supports graduates with an online practitioner database that lists their specific areas of expertise, such as music or literature.

Integra College is registered with—and accredited by—the Private Career Training Institutions Agency (PCTIA), a regulatory body that oversees education provided by private training colleges in British Columbia.

In fact, women may be at a higher risk than men due to the sheer societal views of sleep apnea.

Marina Abramskey, a Registered Respiratory Therapist at CanSleep Services, says women are less likely to report snoring due to embarrassment, and may even under-report it to their physician. “Women often associate it as a ‘men’s’ disease, and are unaware that other symptoms can be the cause of sleep apnea,” she said.

article continues below

There are different types of sleep apnea with various symptoms. Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is the most common form; it is a breathing disorder that is caused by a blockage in the pharynx, at the back of the throat, obstructing airflow. It can cause patients to stop breathing repeatedly throughout their sleep.

Women experience different, subtler symptoms of sleep apnea than men do. Abramskey said women are more likely to experience morning headaches, fatigue and tiredness, depression, and insomnia, rather than snoring or waking gasping, which are more common in men. “Because of the different symptoms experienced by women – mainly tiredness and insomnia – they are more likely to attribute it to taking care of the household and children, or even a stressful job rather than sleep apnea,” Abramskey added.

In both the medical and non-medical worlds, sleep apnea was traditionally seen as a men’s condition. However, as physicians become more educated on women’s symptoms, Abramskey said more women are being referred for sleep studies. So far, the studies have shown that women’s anatomies are different and therefore, women’s apnea and hypopneas are also different. “Women might experience shorter apneas and more in REM sleep,” Abramskey said.

As the medical field progresses with its studies on women and sleep apnea, Abramskey said it is especially important for women to report any sleep apnea symptoms to their physicians, or to consult the Registered Respiratory Therapists at CanSleep Services.

What do you do? Sometimes it seems that dash lights come on randomly, when nothing’s wrong. So why worry about it?

“There’s no light on the dashboard that should ever be ignored,” says Shelly Smith, owner of Port Moody Auto & Air. “Oil, battery, coolant, ‘check engine,’ all need to be dealt with. A light tells you something’s not working.”

article continues below

It’s very different from the old days when people used to put a piece of tape over the ‘check oil’ light that kept coming on every other day when nothing was wrong, Smith explains. Today’s dash lights give more accurate readings.

And if the check engine light is flashing, you don’t want to take any chances, Smith says.

“Get it off the road and don’t drive it at all. You have to pull over.”

Unfortunately, not everyone takes this advice.

“We had a woman with a Mini Cooper and her check engine light had been on forever,” says Smith. “She had 52 codes behind that, and all of these codes are combining. It’s hard to figure out where to start on the car.”

Some people try to save money by self-assessing and doing repairs just using the trouble codes that Smith and her team uncover during a diagnostic.

“We say OK, they can try and fix things on their own,” Smith says, “but more often than not, they come back.”

The key, of course, is not just getting the codes. Whether you have two or 52 codes, you still need to be able to diagnose the problem, says Smith, and that’s where you need the expertise that 50 years in the automotive service can provide.

So the next time a warning light flashes on your dashboard, don’t assume it’s nothing.

“At least get it diagnosed,” says Smith. “You want to know what you’re dealing with.”

Complete engine failure could be the result of an ignored light, and the cost to replace that starts at $3,000.

“You’re going to spend more money in the long run,” says Smith. “The longer you leave it, the worse it’s going to get.”

Shameer Dada, President of C.A.I. Financial in Port Moody, says the company has seen this with some customers who come in more than once looking for a loan. In fact, in talking to repeat customers, he often finds they have loans with multiple other companies.

article continues below

In those cases, Dada says, there are things C.A.I. Financial can do to help.

The company will assess the equity in the customer’s collateral, and, if it’s sufficient, consolidate all the loans into a single payment.

“We do lower our interest rates considerably,” he says. “It’s part of how we’ve tried to help those people we’ve found are falling into that cycle.”

Other tips for avoiding the short term loan cycle, according to Dada, include:

1. Recognize the trap. Many people get trapped in a never-ending cycle of short-term loans. Unable to pay back the original loan they end up borrowing more, or paying a fee to renew the loan. The first step is being aware of what’s happening. The second is to break the cycle.

2. Understand the true cost. Make sure you know up front how much interest you’re being charged, when the payment will be due and what your options are if you can’t pay on time.

3. Pay off the loan without borrowing to cover it. The most efficient way to stop the short-term loan cycle is to simply pay back the loan that you have without borrowing.

4. Cut back on non-essential expenses, like dining out. Raise extra money by selling items that you no longer use, working overtime or doing odd jobs. Or ask a trusted friend or family member to help out by lending you the money to pay off the loan.

5. Prioritize. If you have other outstanding loans or credit card debt, pay off the one with the highest interest rate first. Just make sure to continue to make minimum payments on the other loans.

6. Ask about a payment plan option. Most lenders will offer a payment plan to customers unable to pay the amount in full on time.

By then, their health may already be at risk.

Getting a mammogram before there is a problem is the best way to protect yourself, says Randy Webster, COO of MedRay Imaging in Coquitlam.

article continues below

“Breast tissue is unlike any other tissue that we have in the body. It’s very unique to you,” Webster explains. “In order for a doctor to diagnose cancer, many times what they need to do is see changes in the tissue over time.”

Because of this, the B.C. Cancer Agency recommends that women who are between the ages of 40 and 79 have mammograms every two years. Those with first-degree relatives – mothers, father, sisters, brothers, daughters or sons – with breast cancer should be screened annually. Women with a family history of breast cancer are nearly two times more likely to develop it themselves.

“We find it really important that women come in and get their first one done, because that’s the most important one in order to get them on the path,” Webster says.

A mammogram only takes five or 10 minutes. And after your first, the B.C. Cancer Agency sends reminders before your next one is due.

Medray offers full field digital mammography through its Screening Mammography Program of British Columbia. The facility also does diagnostic mammography and breast ultrasounds for patient who are symptomatic, such as those who have a found a lump, are experiencing discharge or have noticed some irregularity.

These diagnostic services determine whether a further work-up, such as a biopsy, is necessary.

Approximately one out of nine women will develop breast cancer, and one in 28 is expected to die as a result, according to the B.C. Cancer Agency. Breast screenings can catch cancer early, before it spreads.

Dignity Memorial®, the largest network of funeral, cremation, and cemetery service providers on the continent, ensures easy communication and extensive services between funeral homes in different cities.

“There are exclusive benefits that come with being part of such a vast network,” says Andrew Knapman, manager Forest Lawn Funeral Home. “Because we are part of Dignity Memorial®, we are part of the National Transferability Program, which allows people to transfer their pre-arranged and/or pre-funded funeral services to another city, if need be.”

In other words, if you’ve arranged a service in one city, but move to a different city, the corporation is easily able to transfer your arrangement to the nearest Dignity Memorial® funeral home.

“The same applies for snow birds,” says Knapman. “If you travel south for the winter and pass away in your winter home, we’ll take care of transferring the remains to your pre-arranged location. It’s much less work and cost for your loved ones at a very difficult time in their lives.”

Other services such as the 24-hour compassion line, the bereavement travel program, and the grief management library are easily accessible across Canada and the U.S. as well.

“Being attached to a trusted brand that’s been around for decades means our customers can expect a certain standard,” says Knapman. “Things aren’t going to differ from funeral home to funeral home. The brand ensures quality, value, caring service, and customer satisfaction.”

So when Nadalin discovered 4Cats, the Canadian-based art studio franchise, and told Maule about it, they knew what they wanted to do. It made perfect sense to open 4Cats Shaughnessy in the very neighbourhood that had always inspired them.

“Having art as our business, encouraging that love of art for families and children, and seeing them create and flourish is a big goal for us,” Nadalin says. “And doing that where we grew up as kids was super important.”

Nadalin and Maule work onsite at the studio with the help of a small team, including a full-time curator. The pair wanted to be thoroughly involved with the studio, according to Nadalin.

“We're passionate about what we do here. If you want to come and make art, this is the place to do it,” she says.

The studio offers a range of classes and workshops for different ages, for kids as young as two up to adults.

One popular program is the Artist Focus series – a 10 week course that explores the lives and the artistic techniques of two famous artists.

“They love it, because they're learning, they're taking in a lot of information on famous artists, and then they get to feel what that artist was like. So they're painting in that same style or creating in that same style,” Nadalin says. “They're going home and telling their parents all about Vincent van Gogh.”

They also hold family workshops, where kids and their parents can create together, which are really popular, she adds.

The studiooffers workshops for the young at heart, as well, with painting, sculpting and other classes for grownups.

“Adults feel really intimidated if they haven't made art in awhile and they want to try, and being in our environment here, it's not as stressful, we make it fun,” Nadalin says.

But the studiofocuses mostly on children, and helping them bloom as creators in their own right. The kids love creating, and sharing their work with their parents, she says.

“They're so proud of themselves. They're creating something from their ideas and their imagination, and of course we walk them through the steps to do it, but they take it to their own creative level,” she explains.

The most important aspect of the studio is the welcoming, fun atmosphere, Nadalin says.

“When they come to the studio, they're going to get an experience that is heartfelt,” she adds. “We really want kids to learn and to love art and to feel comfortable.”

As a patient, it can be both frightening and confusing.

But skilled radiologists, like those at MedRay Imaging in Coquitlam, can make the process a lot easier by providing answers and diagnostic support.

“We are usually at the start of someone’s journey—someone dealing with an unexplained symptom or issue—and the family physician or specialist needs to get an accurate diagnosis,” says Randy Webster, COO of MedRay Imaging. “They send patients for imaging to diagnose what specifically is going on. Without it, people would not be getting treated properly.”

MedRay, the largest medical imaging provider in the province, provides expedited MRI scans, ultrasounds, mammograms, X-Rays, bone densitometry exams and more.

Patients at MedRay see a technologist who performs their scan and sends it to a radiologist at the facility. The radiologist then makes the diagnosis.

A team of radiologists owns MedRay, something that makes the facility different from those owned by private equity firms, Webster says.

“We are a company who has a strong sense of vision about what the future’s going to be,” he explains. “We have a strong core purpose: to preserve and improve health and quality of life through medical imaging.”

The team of radiologists that run MedRay also work with Eagle Ridge and Royal Columbian hospitals. Because of this connection, MedRay is a sponsor of both hospital foundations.

“We see ourselves as an important community asset,” Webster says. “As such, we do our best to support the community and give back whenever possible.”

That’s because since 1972, the not-for-profit arts education centre, housed in Coquitlam’s historic Ryan House, offers a wide array of programs for all ages and skill levels in a welcoming, home-like environment.

“We like to say we have something for everyone, from babes to boomers and from recreational to pre-professional levels—conveniently all under one roof,” says Kate Lancaster, Communications Coordinator for the centre.

Everything from classes in the visual, literary and theatre arts, to music and dance lessons is offered—many with amusing twists that play on the centre’s theme for this year: humour.

If music is your passion, there’s a diverse range of lessons and classes, from group “Fiddlers” classes for youth to a cello ensemble for adults, and introductory drumming and singing to private lessons in a wide range of instruments.

Plus, if you are a budding young performer set on playing before fist-pumping fans, the centre offers “Rock Star 101.” The new program for nine to 12-year-olds, teaches students the basics of forming a band, using their voice and experimenting with instruments. No previous music skills are required.

Kids and adults alike can move to the groove in a variety of dance classes, including ballet (Cecchetti method), jazz, hip hop, lyrical and tap in its dedicated dance studio and off-site at the Evergreen Cultural Centre.

On the fine arts side, in addition to kid-focused classes, adults wanting to venture into the world of watercolours, but who may be feeling a bit timid, can join the “So You Think You Can’t Paint in Watercolour?” class.

And if you have a youngster (eight to 12-years-old) with a gift for storytelling, loves action and superheroes, the DIY Comics class might be the perfect after-school activity. In this class, they will learn the creative process of making comics, from idea-generating to script writing and drawing, so they can transform their imagination into comic book form.

The centre also hosts special arts events, including free Family Days, a Classic Concert Series and a social, adult-only pARTy@PdA series, which combines an art activity with food and wine in a social setting.

The first pARTy is “PAWcasso” on Sept. 7 and it’s one for the dogs. Folks can bring their pup to the event to create a collaborative painting.

“As you can see, for anyone who wants to engage in the arts, we’ve got something for them,” Lancaster says.

114,tricitynews,https://www.tricitynews.com/standout/3-reasons-new-flooring-is-a-great-investment-1.2385091,3 reasons new flooring is a great investment,[],,"Niki Jacques, President of Nufloors Coquitlam, tells her customers that in the current market, home renovation, particularly as it pertains to flooring, is an excellent investment—providing you choose the right products.

“Ideally you’re looking to replace your floor every 10-20 years,” says Jacques, whose home renovation-based business was voted Favourite Flooring Store in Coquitlam by readers of the Tri-City News in 2015. “The last thing you want is to have to replace your floors after 3 or 4 years because you went with a low-cost, no-warranty option and had them installed by someone without the necessary experience.”

article continues below

Here are 3 reasons to pay a little more to get the right product installed the right way, according to Jacques, whose business has been serving the Coquitlam area for nearly three decades:

1. Money: “Depending on what you prefer, flooring is around $7.00 to $10.00 per square foot,” says Jacques. “If you’re covering a large part of your house, the costs can really add up. Of course, you need to pick a flooring option that suits your budget, but if you buy a cheap, unsupported product, you also need to calculate the risk of having to replace your floors in a couple of years—and that’s really expensive!”

2. Comfort: “While we may not consciously think about them much after they’ve been installed, floors are a big part of what makes a home comfortable—or not,” says Jacques. “You come in contact with your floors more than any other part of your house so it can have a significant impact on how comfortable you are in your own home. You don’t want to crush your carpet and you don’t want your laminate to pull apart. You need to keep that top of mind when you’re picking your flooring.”

3. Stress: “If you’ve ever had to redo your floors right after upgrading them, you know how stressful the whole process can be,” says Jacques. “Not only is it a massive inconvenience, it’s incredibly expensive, when you consider that you’re basically paying to have your floors done twice. Picking the right flooring from the right supplier and installing it with experienced professionals will ensure your peace of mind—and it’s hard to put a price on that.”

But at the twelve-month mark, Westwood recommends a quick visit.

""Even if all is well, we like to see a patient at least once a year to check on general oral and gum health and to make sure the dentures are still a good fit for the mouth,"" Milad says.

One issue that pops up frequently is patients struggling to adapt to new dentures.

""We need to bear in mind that dentures are a prosthetic,"" Milad explains. ""No, they will not feel like your natural teeth. Yes, in the beginning you may feel that your mouth is full of pebbles. But the tongue will adapt and you will quickly learn how to chew using both sides of the mouth.""

Another issue is food becoming trapped under the dentures.

""Yes, this may happen from time to time, depending on the food,"" Milad says. ""And you will need to make sure you can rinse the dentures after eating. But these are minor issues compared to the aesthetics of well-fitting dentures and the convenience of being able to speak and eat properly. Good dentures will also help support the mouth and make you look younger than with no teeth at all.""

""We fabricate our dentures in house,"" Milad says. ""So we take care of you from beginning to end. We want you to feel assured that you will have a denture that fits properly and looks good.""

Milad also suggests considering the colour of your new dentures.

""Yes, people want white teeth,"" he says. ""But bear in mind that if you've always had ivory or yellow coloured teeth and then you turn up at the office or lunch with friends with bright white teeth, people will notice that they're not natural. It's always best to try and keep dentures as close to the colour of your natural teeth as possible.""

The aim, says Milad, is for your dentures to look and feel as natural as they can.

For many, getting ready for the upcoming spring and summer seasons means sorting through old clothing, and purchasing new items to accommodate weather changes. Goodbye, old flannel jammies, and woolly sweaters. Say hello to new shorts and dresses.

article continues below

While there is nothing wrong with wanting to clear out some of your items in order to create room for more seasonally appropriate garb, we can often run into trouble if we aren't thinking about the ways we release unwanted items from our wardrobe into the wild.

Pavel Lalev, Development Manager for Green Inspiration BC, says there are many ways to ensure that unwanted textiles are dealt with in sustainable and ethical ways. He points to many of the advances happening in many European countries.

In Paris, France, the municipality has designated that textiles aren't allowed to enter the waste stream, and as such has placed outside bins where textiles can be deposited for recycling. Textile recycling trucks also circulate throughout neighbourhoods, much like North American garbage trucks. Lalev also points to the Netherlands as a textile recycling role model.

""Over there they have textile recycling depots and classes where volunteers teach people how to make items out of recycled unwanted textiles.""

He adds that many of these initiatives run with government support and that many of the recycling depots even have stores where people can purchase items made of repurposed and recycled textiles.

Green Inspiration operates the green bins designated for textile collection all over the Lower Mainland. Lalev points out that while we are a long way from where we need to be in terms of textile sustainability (5% of all waste is textiles), that we are progressing.

""Our company diverted 1,200 tonnes of textiles last year,"" he says, noting that ninety percent of the clothing collected is resellable, either in Canada or in countries overseas. He says that disposing of used clothing and shoes in any of the hundreds green textile collection bins in the Lower Mainland or Greater Victoria area is always a good thing, because the 10 percent of clothing that isn't resellable is then reprocessed, either for items as diverse as car seat filling material, or as simple as rags.

Many of her patients are the grandchildren of patients she’s been seeing during her 31 years in practice.

“It’s very important that we see children when they’re very young,” she explains. “Our youngest patients are about one year-old. We want to make sure they have magical and fun visits before they ever need any dental work done.”

article continues below

Parents bring their children to Dr. Thorpe’s dentistry practice for check-ups and for advice on preventing tooth decay.

“At a very young age, it’s about sitting on Mom’s lap while I check their mouth for a short time to get them used to the process. I check on any issues that might be developing, such as nursing bottle tooth decay.”

Dr. Thorpe notes that unfortunately she still sees a lot of tooth decay developing in children, even children who have only ever been fed breast milk due to the sugar that’s present in the milk.

“The thing to remember,” Dr. Thorpe says, “ is that it’s the amount of time the sugar is in the mouth that causes the decay, not necessarily the amount of sugar or refined foods your child has. For example, a nursing bottle of milk before bed is just fine. But putting your child into bed with a bottle with the milk trickling into their mouth during the night, that’s the issue. The constant wash of sugar from the milk is what causes the decay.”

When a child is diagnosed with tooth decay, the parents feel terrible, Dr. Thorpe says. Her dental practice not only treats the child but also helps the parents understand that it’s not all their fault.

“Parents do their best, but unfortunately, tooth decay happens,” she says. “It’s difficult brushing a three year-old’s teeth. And flossing is even more of a challenge. I can help parents with that challenge with some tips and by reinforcing to the child that it’s very important that Mom or Dad brush and floss their teeth. I try to help parents address those issues early in their child’s life.”

“There’s not a lot of places were people can go who have special needs where they’re embraced,” says Sky Zone owner Morey Chaplick.

While there are many agencies and organizations in the Lower Mainland that provide support to families of autistic children, there aren’t many that give families opportunities to relax and have a good time. Chaplick felt his bounce park could fill that void.

“We just want to give back,” he says. “We want to be embedded in the community.”

The initiative launches on April 4, during Autism Awareness Month.

Every Monday night from 6 to 8 p.m., music will be lowered at the indoor trampoline park, and the trampolines will be turned over to those with autism and other children with special needs. Extra stimulation will also be curbed, to make the event more ideal for those with autism.

The staff have had a training session with the Canucks Autism Network in preparation for the evening sessions. The Canucks Autism Network runs sports, arts and social programs for kids with autism.

As of March 2014, one in 68 children were identified as having Autism Spectrum Disorder. Autism Spectrum Disorder and Autism are terms for a group of complex brain disorders. The disorders can make social interaction and communication challenging.

The Sensory Night event is specifically designed for children with autism and their caregivers, but all families with children with special needs are invited to attend. Caregivers pay half price on Sensory Night.

Noh helps his clients take on doable tasks, such as losing 10 pounds. But first he makes sure the client is up for a lifestyle change rather than a quick fix.

There are four steps to successfully losing 10 pounds, according to Noh.

1. Commit to exercise. Only you know how much exercise you can work into your schedule. Don’t declare you’re going to work out for an hour every day if that isn’t feasible in the long run. If you can find time three days a week, then commit to three days a week, Noh says.

2. Clean out the fridge.Doing all the exercise in the world won’t help if you don’t modify your eating. Set aside time to plan your meals, and organize your kitchen so making healthier food isn’t a struggle. Most importantly, clear out the junk food – the chocolate stashed in the vegetable crisper is not going to become less appealing in the future!

3. Be realistic. Lots of people want to lose weight. They feel fat or tired or fed up, and they just want to be done with feeling that way. But you can’t just drop 30 pounds in 10 days, and shouldn’t even if you could. You need to set healthy, achievable goals. Noh tells his clients to focus on losing the first five pounds, for example, and build from there.

4. Set the pace. You know what you can handle. For some people, they can set a goal of losing 20 pounds in a certain amount of time, and they can stick to that and achieve it. For others, it takes building up to that with smaller goals – not eating takeout this month, for example – and it can take longer. Make sure your pace is right for you, so you don’t get discouraged.

For help achieving your goals, call Eagle Ridge Fitness at 604-996-1111, email or visit their website. Eagle Ridge Fitness is located at 2624 St. Johns Street in Port Moody and 2311 Whyte Ave in Port Coquitlam.The studio can also be found on Facebook.",[]

We don't normally see the hurricanes of the East Coast or the wild fires of the B.C. interior, but that doesn't mean we should push catastrophic events out of our minds.

One disaster that certainly shouldn't take up residence at the very back of our thoughts is the long-anticipated major earthquake. BC Quake Premium Survival Supplies, a local family-owned disaster preparedness company, offers earthquake preparedness kits to keep you and your family safe, hydrated, and nourished after an earthquake.

article continues below

1. Emergency response time

According to the City of Vancouver's disaster preparedness advice, City services may be affected for at least 72 hours after a major earthquake, possibly delaying emergency response times. Make sure that your emergency preparedness includes being self-sufficient for at least this length of time, longer if possible.

2. Possible building damage

Wood structures handle earthquakes better than stone or concrete, but around 80 percent of houses built before the 1970s may not have been constructed to withstand a seismic event. It's quite possible that you might not be able to re-enter your home after an earthquake. Make sure your emergency preparedness kit includes some kind of shelter to protect you and your family from the elements.

BC Quake Premium Survival Supplies includes a small cube tent and blankets to keep your family warm and out of the rain or cold.

3. Prolonged exposure to the elements

During an earthquake, the danger is from falling objects such as bookcases, artwork, ceiling fans, as well as imploding windows. But when the earthquake is over, staying warm and out of the elements is crucial. Don't underestimate the effect of the earthquake trauma and living outside in rain or cold on the human psyche and health. Dehydration is a real concern as it can result in dizziness, confusion, and a lack of concentration and focus at a time when you will need all your mental faculties.

4. Value of an earthquake kit

An earthquake kit can supply peace of mind as well as many of the items you'll need if you can't re-enter your home for an extended period of time. BC Quake Premium Survival Supplies have several different kits depending on your requirements. Perhaps you're the outdoorsy type who already has a tent and a camping stove. But if not, there are kits to provide you with shelter, warmth, nutrition, and a means to purify water for drinking and cooking.

“A well prepared earthquake kit is the starting point for preparing for an earthquake, however having a plan in place amongst your immediate family or friends is essential as we won’t be able to rely on our cell phones or possibly even our roads and bridges immediately after the quake” says Brett Johnston Owner of BC Quake. “You really need to be prepared to be self sufficient for at least 72 hours if not longer and that’s going to include having the right food and medical equipment you might need at the ready”.

""Untreated sleep apnea can result in a variety of medical issues,"" says Paul Sweeney, a Registered Respiratory Therapist (RRT) and President of Coastal Sleep, a sleep therapy clinic with six locations in the Lower Mainland. ""These include hypertension and other heart issues. Often there are vague symptoms that people experience that they just don't associate with a lack of sleep.""

article continues below

The primary treatment for sleep apnea is a CPAP, or Continuous Positive Airway Pressure machine. The CPAP therapy is delivered through a mask that is worn over the nose each night while sleeping.

""The CPAP blows air pressure into the throat and prevents the tongue from collapsing and blocking the airway,"" Paul says. ""The mask models today are more tolerable than they were in the past. If you wore a CPAP mask 10 years ago, you would notice that the difference from then to now is like night and day.""

While the idea of wearing a mask every night might seem unappealing to some, Paul suggests you consider the alternative.

""The majority of people are so pleased with the results and the positive affect on their day-to-day life that they see the mask as just a minor inconvenience,"" he says. ""A very small number have existing medical conditions that may prevent them from wearing the mask, and an even smaller number may find they're not responsive to the treatment.""

In those cases, patients could consider an oral appliance.

""We work with a local dentist to fit the patient with an appliance that draws the jaw forward,” Paul explains. ""It's not ideal for some, as long-term use might affect the patient's bite.""

And unlike with an oral appliance, Coastal Sleep is able to offer a complimentary trial of the CPAP treatment to ensure the correct fit and tolerance.

""The oral device would need to be purchased right away,"" Paul notes.

While surgery, involving the removal of tonsils or any redundant tissue in the throat, is an option, it's not always effective in adults.

""Children and young adults are the preferred candidates for surgery,"" Paul says. ""It has less effect on an older population.""

The project in the 2400 block of Welcher Avenue in the city’s downtown would see two single family homes and a vacant lot redeveloped into a five-storey affordable rental apartment building with 63 homes.

article continues below

“Homes will support a diverse mix of families, couples, singles, and seniors with a mix of incomes,” noted a report to the Metro Van’s housing committee.

Plans have already been submitted to PoCo city hall to approve a variance, which would allow the building to be five storeys instead of four, permitting another 12 homes, which will support “the growing need for affordable housing in the city.”

The homes will be energy efficient, with efforts to reduce CO2 emissions by 20% compared to a baseline project, as well as meet a variety of housing needs, from seniors to families, with 10% wheel chair accessible units, among other adaptations.

There will be a community garden, a shared kitchen, outdoor plaza and seating, as well as landscaping.

To be able to make the units more affordable, Metro Vancouver will be applying to the BC Housing Community Housing Fund for forgivable loans of between $75,000 - $150,000 per unit as well a potential ongoing operating subsidy.

The program requires a 60-year operating agreement and rents would be reduced significantly. For example, 20% of units would be rented at a deep subsidy, 50% of units rented at or below BC Housing’s Household Income Limits and 30% of units rented at the low end of market.

To get the funding for the deeper discounts for renters, the application needs to be construction-ready and be submitted before Sept. 4.

Metro Vancouver will also apply to CMHC for funding for the project.",[]

The health authority added the outbreak of C. difficile to its list of current outbreaks on July 14.

According to Health Canada, Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is a bacterium that causes mild to severe diarrhea and intestinal conditions like pseudomembranous colitis (inflammation of the colon). C. difficile is the most frequent cause of infectious diarrhea in hospitals and long-term care facilities in Canada, as well as in other industrialized countries.

C. difficile bacteria and their spores are found in feces. People can get infected if they touch surfaces contaminated with feces, and then touch their mouth. Healthcare workers can spread the bacteria to their patients if their hands are contaminated.

Symptoms include watery diarrhea, fever, loss of appetite, nausea, and abdominal pain/tenderness.

For healthy people, C. difficile does not pose a health risk. The elderly and those with other illnesses or who are taking antibiotics, are at a greater risk of infection.

Fraser Health asks all visitors to use our hand hygiene stations when they enter and exit its facilities, particularly if there is a reported outbreak.

If you have any of the following, please do not visit at this time:

Vomiting or diarrhea

Cough or flu-like symptoms

Fever

Rash

If you are visiting someone who is located on an outbreak unit, visitors may be limited to two people at a time. Fraser Health asks that you do not visit other patient rooms or common areas on the unit such as the lounge and patient kitchenette. It also recommends you don’t visit public areas in the hospital such as the cafeteria and gift shop.",[]

The survey of 1,401 member businesses from groups including the BC Chamber of Commerce, Greater Vancouver Board of Trade and Business Council of B.C. indicates owners want a bold, long-term recovery plan.

Only 16 per cent of businesses were confident in B.C.'s restart plan and 47 per cent were not.

Two-thirds of those surveyed were relying on some form of government support and owners were braced for a ""second wave"" of shutdowns or other problems if programs expire too quickly.

Some 28 per cent believed they'll return to normal once programs end, 32 per cent expected to cut workers' hours, 27 per cent anticipated layoffs, and one business in every 10 forecast either temporary or permanent closure.

Owners say payroll and wage supports must remain key components of B.C.'s recovery plan, along with fee and tax cuts.

The survey also identified expectations that the province must create better investment conditions.

Bridgitte Anderson, president and CEO of the Greater Vancouver Board of Trade, says business viability hinges on those measures.

Val Litwin with the BC Chamber of Commerce urges policy-makers to ""stay sensitive"" to the vulnerability of the business sector.

""A bold economic recovery plan that helps small businesses compete is non-negotiable for a prosperous B.C., and when small businesses thrive so do communities and people,"" Litwin said in a statement.

""Governments must keep focused on delivering their recovery plans swiftly.""

At its meeting Tuesday, council unanimously passed a proposal introduced by Coun. Steve Milani to waive any additional fees charged by the city for inspections and permits as they add adjunct locations or outdoor spaces to give customers and employees more room while reducing the risk of transmitting the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Businesses that have already expanded during the pandemic will be refunded fees they paid.

In a report presented to council, Milani said those fees can amount to hundreds of dollars in addition to further expenses like more rent, insurance and utilities. For instance, a special event permit to allow a pub or brewery to open a temporary outdoor patio space costs $211.

Port Moody’s manager of planning, Mary De Paoli, said eight such permits have been issued by the city so far.

Milani said money for city fees can be dear to business owners trying to survive the public health crisis that’s kept customers home or leery of venturing into crowded indoor spaces.

“The least we could do is find a way to eliminate these small extra fees,” he told council. “None of this was planned for.”

Coun. Zoe Royer agreed.

“It’s very difficult for businesses,” she said. “Right now they don’t know how many customers they’re going to get and they need as much safe space as possible.”

Milani said while the fees would be waived, inspections would still take place, a commitment confirmed by the city’s general manager of engineering and operations, Jeff Moi.

“We would continue to do the same level of service as far as inspections and issuing permits,” he said.",[]

Canada's Communications Security Establishment says the malicious cyberactivities were very likely undertaken to pilfer information and intellectual property relating to the development and testing of vaccines for the novel coronavirus.

article continues below

The cyberspy agency says the clandestine activity is hindering response efforts at a time when health-care experts and medical researchers need every available resource to help fight the pandemic.

The CSE's Centre for Cyber Security assesses that APT29, also known as ""the Dukes"" or ""Cozy Bear,"" was responsible, and almost certainly operates as part of Russian intelligence services.

""The group uses a variety of tools and techniques to predominantly target governmental, diplomatic, think-tank, health-care and energy targets for intelligence gain,"" says a joint advisory from the CSE and its allies.

""APT29 is likely to continue to target organizations involved in COVID-19 vaccine research and development, as they seek to answer additional intelligence questions relating to the pandemic.""

This assessment is supported by partners at Britain's Government Communications Headquarters' National Cyber Security Centre, the U.S. National Security Agency, and the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.

The CSE is urging Canadian health organizations to review a technical advisory on the threat and to take any necessary actions to protect themselves. ""We encourage them as well to contact the Cyber Centre if they suspect they have been targeted by cyberactors.""

The joint advisory says APT29 targeted COVID-19 vaccine research and development by scanning specific computer IP addresses of interest for vulnerabilities, a tactic that can help the group obtain login credentials to systems.

""This broad targeting potentially gives the group access to a large number of systems globally, many of which are unlikely to be of immediate intelligence value,"" the advisory says.

""The group may maintain a store of stolen credentials in order to access these systems in the event that they become more relevant to their requirements in the future.""

Port Moody boasts many beautiful green spaces.

article continues below

With summer upon us and new recreating patterns emerging due to the Pandemic, additional pressure is being placed on local parks and beaches. One such park is Old Orchard Park located in the Pleasantside neighborhood.

Visitors are frequenting this park in unprecedented numbers. On any given sunny weekend, both designated parking lots are full to capacity (approximately 70 spaces). Overflow parking spills into the surrounding residential streets. Bentley Slip, San Remo, Sentinel, Alderside Road become overwhelmed with frustrated drivers looking to park.

Alderside, deemed a slow city street, is in fact a de-facto extension of the popular and well-used pathway system that connects all of Port Moody’s inlet parks. This pathway welcomes runners, walkers, children on bikes, seniors with pets, strollers, wheelchairs, and locals just going about their daily business.

It also is busy.

Vehicles that park on these streets often double the number of cars parked in the two designated lots.

A traffic barricade at the north end of Bentley Slip has forced cars to alternate with those on Alderside and this often results in driver confusion as to who has the right of way to proceed.

Add to this a blind spot at the east side of the barricade for drivers, which makes it difficult to initially see pedestrians using the road to access the park. The stairwell to the park does not easily accommodate those with beach equipment, strollers, or mobility devices. This barricade has exacerbated an already dangerous situation.

The conditions on these streets are unsafe. They have become parking lots rife with constant two-way traffic, illegal U-turns, vehicles idling on private property waiting for an available street spot, dumping of garbage on the street and/or private property, overnight parking, and more

Let’s make slow streets truly safe by reducing traffic congestion and duration on these designated streets.

Whether the city places a time limit on street parking, offers shuttles from other accessible points in the city to the beach, a solution must be found. Make it user friendly, do it soon and all can enjoy these beautiful green spaces in our community this summer and in perpetuity.

The joint study by researchers at the B.C. Centre for Disease Control, University of B.C., LifeLabs and public health scientists is posted on the health research website medRxiv and a news conference on the findings is scheduled for Thursday morning.

article continues below

The authors say the findings indicate successful suppression of community transmission in B.C., with an estimated overall infection rate of less than one per cent.

The study looked at anonymous blood samples collected for reasons unrelated to COVID-19 by LifeLabs in March and May, before and after public health measures were introduced.

The first samples in March found two of 869 specimens were positive, for a prevalence of 0.28 per cent, while the May sample found a prevalence of 0.55 per cent.

Health Minister Adrian Dix described the estimated infection rate as ""very low"" and says it shows the effectiveness of British Columbia's public health measures and co-operation of the public.

""It reinforces the fact that we're on the right track,"" Dix says.

""Of course, this is as the study suggests a dual-edged question, a low level of transmission but also very few people with antibodies to deal with potential future spikes of COVID-19.""

If the study's prevalence rate is applied to the whole provincial population, it could mean about 28,000 people have had the novel coronavirus, while 3,149 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed to date, however Dix noted the results are specific to the Vancouver area.

Health officials have repeatedly said that more people have been infected with the virus than have tested positive and Dix calls the estimated prevalence rate in B.C. ""encouraging.""

""Overall the level of infection in B.C. was low and that's due to the actions of people in B.C. That said, there are more people who were infected with COVID-19 than tested positive and that's something we've said clearly, especially in the period of March and April when we were focusing our testing program particularly on specific groups including health-care workers,"" Dix says.

The study is the first of its kind in Canada, he says.

The study is also important because it involved people who did not self-select for COVID-19 testing, so they likely didn't believe they had the virus, Dix says.

The study was authorized by provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and approved by the clinical research ethics board of the university. It has not yet been peer reviewed.

British Columbia recorded 21 new cases Wednesday and no new deaths. There are 207 active cases while 2,753 people who tested positive have recovered, the government said in a news release.

Tuesday, Port Moody council passed eight recommendations that, along with four already adopted in April, could make that happen.

The recommendations include: stronger rules to protect existing rental housing; inclusionary zoning; better incentives to encourage the construction of new rental and affordable housing; minimum thresholds for the number of family-friendly units to included in new developments; and policies to discourage hostile architecture.

Those are in addition to previous recommendations that include an update of Port Moody’s laneway housing bylaws to make that housing option more attractive; the establishment of a renoviction bylaw; and updating the terms of reference for the city’s affordable housing reserve fund so it could also be used to help renters in need of financial assistance.

The recommendations were the product of months of work by council’s affordable housing task force, that was recharged last year after it was initially formed in 2017.

Lubik, a member of the task force, said making affordable housing a priority benefits everyone in the city.

“The housing-first model shows if we can keep people housed, it really does save a lot of money,” she said.

In its report to council, the task force said those savings would be realized by fewer people needing to access social and medical supports.

Coun. Diana Dilworth, also on the task force, said Port Moody is facing an affordability crunch as more than a quarter of its existing non-market rental units begin to show their age.

“That’s where we’re going to get caught,” she said, adding already 35% of renters in the city are paying more than 30% of their household income of rent and utilities, while 17% are paying more than 50% of their income to keep a roof over their head. According to the rental housing index compiled by the B.C. Non-profit Housing Association, accommodation is considered affordable if it costs less than 30% of household income.

Coun. Meghan Lahti said a goal of the task force, which also included Coun. Zoe Royer, was to provide a road map for future developments in the city.

“We really thought it was important to take a very descriptive approach as to how this could happen by providing developers with options, but also being very clear with our expectations,” she said.

Dilworth said the group tried to take elements from best practices being implemented in other cities like New Westminster, Burnaby, North Vancouver and Richmond that are wrestling with similar issues. It even enlisted councillors from New West to peer review its report.

For instance, the task force recommends the establishment of minimum maintenance standards for rental suites, which is currently being ireviewed in Burnaby.

It also favours a tiered approach to inclusionary zoning, similar to New West, that scales the requirement for affordable units in new projects with more than 80 units according to a developer’s adherence to the official community plan (OCP) or their proximity to transit. A project that’s within OCP guidelines would require 12.5% of its units be affordable or 6% to be offered at shelter rates, while those seeking an amendment to the OCP, exceed an area’s density limits or are located in a transit-oriented development area would need to provide a minimum of 20% affordable units.

City manager Tim Savoie told council staff will begin work on implementing the recommendations, but it could take several months for bylaws and policies to be drafted.

“We know how important this is to the community,” he said.",[]

Dr. Michael Schwandt, who was one of the first infectious disease specialists from Vancouver Coastal Health to help contain outbreaks at sites like the Lynn Valley Care Centre, made the comments not long after a group of 239 scientists from 32 countries wrote an open letter to the World Health Organization, successfully appealing for the world health body to change its guidance on aerosolized transmission.

“We'll be watching closely the science around airborne transmission. At this time, we don't think it's played a major role in the outbreaks in Vancouver Coastal Health that we've had direct experience with,” said Dr. Schwandt.

The new W.H.O. guidance, which came last Thursday, accepts that the novel coronavirus can spread through aerosolized particles — tiny droplets in the air — in crowded indoor settings for prolonged periods of time.

“There have been reported outbreaks of COVID-19 in some closed settings, such as restaurants, nightclubs, places of worship or places of work where people may be shouting, talking, or singing.

“In these outbreaks, aerosol transmission, particularly in these indoor locations where there are crowded and inadequately ventilated spaces where infected persons spend long periods of time with others, cannot be ruled out,” reads the W.H.O.’s new guidance, which also calls for more research into aerosol transmission. aerosol transmission.

But Dr. Schwandt said his team doesn’t view the airborne versus droplet transmission debate as a binary, and that while the virus can be traced at varying distances at concentrations, most of the cases he’s come across in Vancouver Coastal Health region, home to the first outbreaks in the country, have been from “face-to-face” transmission.

The proof, he said, comes from Vancouver Coastal’s success in tracing contacts based on direct contact, an experience a spokesperson for Fraser Health told the Tri-City News has been echoed in their health authority.

“Without taking airborne transmission into account as a risk factor, we've been able to bring outbreaks under good control, really looking at close physical contact as the main risk factor,” said Dr. Schwandt.

That means, at the moment, current ventilation systems in places like long-term care homes are not considered a risk factor in the spread of the virus.

Airborne or not, sharing air in large, indoor public gatherings raises everyone’s risk of transmitting the virus, as Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry reminded British Columbians in her daily update Tuesday.

“Stay away from closed spaces as much as possible,” she said. “If it’s a house party, you may not know all the people who are there.”

And like the W.H.O., health officials in B.C. said they are keeping an eye on the science.

“If more evidence were to develop around airborne or aerosol transmission, then naturally we'd need to look at preventative measures that include attention to ventilation,” said Dr. Schwandt.",[]

Provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix announced July 15 that there were 21 new cases in the past 24 hours, including two cases that they call ""epi-linked,"" or presumed cases that have not been proven through testing but are being treated as official cases.

article continues below

The province has now recorded 3,149 cases since the novel coronavirus first appeared in B.C. in late January.

More than 87.4% of those infected, or 2,753 people, have recovered. Of those who haven't, 189 people have died and 207 people are actively fighting the virus. Only 14 people are hospitalized, with five of those in intensive care units. The rest are self-isolating at home. There were no new deaths recorded in the past 24 hours.

Recording at least 20 new COVID-19 cases in a 24-hour period has become common in B.C., and Henry said yesterday that she found that number ""distressing,"" even though, she added, the good news is that the province knows where the clusters of infection are, many of the infections are linked and the number is not really that large given the province's population of more than five million residents.

The numbers in the past week were:

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12;

• 21 new cases on July 13;

• 13 new cases on July 14; and now

• 21 new cases on July 15.

In June, the number of daily new cases many times was in the single digits.

""There is one active community outbreak, in addition to several community exposure events,"" Henry and Dix said. ""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks.""

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,023 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,659 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 216 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 51 people who reside outside Canada.

Public Health Official authored.

The list of 16 items runs the gamut of sound bite-style take-aways from Dr. Henry's many press conferences and interviews, however while the ideas may ring somewhat familiar in step with things she has said, none of the items on the list are direct quotes from Dr. Henry, nor did she assemble the list.

Here's how the list reads on Facebook, as shared in a public post from a user the morning of Wednesday, July 15:

Wisdom from Dr Bonnie Henry

We may have to live with C19 for months or years. Let's not deny it or panic. Let's not make our lives useless. Let's learn to live with this fact. You can't destroy C19 viruses that have penetrated cell walls, by drinking gallons of hot water you'll just go to the bathroom more often. Washing hands and maintaining a two-metre physical distance is the best method for your protection. If you don't have a C19 patient at home, there's no need to disinfect the surfaces at your house. Packaged cargo, gas pumps, shopping carts and ATMs do not cause infection. If you wash your hands, live your life as usual. C19 is not a food infection. It is associated with drops of infection like the 'flu. There is no demonstrated risk that C19 is transmitted by food. You can lose your sense of smell with a lot of allergies and viral infections. This is only a non-specific symptom of C19. Once at home, you don't need to change your clothes urgently and go shower! Purity is a virtue, paranoia is not! The C19 virus doesn't hang in the air for long. This is a respiratory droplet infection that requires close contact. The air is clean, you can walk through the gardens and through parks (just keeping your physical protection distance). It is sufficient to use normal soap against C19, not antibacterial soap. This is a virus, not a bacteria. You don't have to worry about your food orders. But you can heat it all up in the microwave, if you wish. The chances of bringing C19 home with your shoes is like being struck by lightning twice in a day. I've been working against viruses for 20 years — drop infections don't spread like that! You can't be protected from the virus by taking vinegar, sugarcane juice and ginger! These are for immunity not a cure. Wearing a mask for long periods interferes with your breathing and oxygen levels. Wear it only in crowds. Wearing gloves is also a bad idea; the virus can accumulate into the glove and be easily transmitted if you touch your face. Better just to wash your hands regularly. Immunity is greatly weakened by always staying in a sterile environment. Even if you eat immune boosting foods, please go out of your house regularly to any park/beach. Immunity is increased by EXPOSURE TO PATHOGENS, not by sitting at home and consuming fried/ spicy/sugary food and aerated drinks.

Be smart and stay informed!

Live life sensibly and to the fullest.—

Dr Bonnie Henry

The list isn't new to the internet, with roots going back to mid-May and a connection to a U.S. physician in Maryland. However, the list is newly showing Dr. Henry as its author.

That doctor is Dr. Faheen Younus, the Chief of Infectious Diseases, University of Maryland Upper Chesapeake Health. The list actually has its roots in the multiple tweets Dr. Younus shared into May on his personal Twitter feed. The paraphrased format first appeared, and was widely shared, thanks to an article on the site TheAZB.com.

If you take the first piece of ""wisdom,"" in the now-circulating Dr. Henry-attributed posts, it reads: ""We may have to live with C19 for months or years. Let's not deny it or panic. Let's not make our lives useless. Let's learn to live with this fact.""

TheAZB.com begins their recap of Dr. Younus' tweeted items as follows: ""He Tweets We will live with Covid19 for months. Let’s not deny it or panic. Let’s not make life unnecessarily difficult. Let us learn to be happy and live with that fact.""

Similarly, the items in the list are paraphrased and tweaked as they are adapted by each re-poster or re-formatter of the list. For example, while The AZB.com summarizes a thought attributed to Dr. Younus as ""You cannot be protected from the virus by drinking / eating vinegar, sumac, soda and ginger."" The Dr. Henry-attributed phony list reads as follows: ""You can't be protected from the virus by taking vinegar, sugarcane juice and ginger! These are for immunity not a cure.""

Dr. Younus himself discredited the viral post, which moved rapidly on WhatsApp, in a tweet on June 6:

IMPORTANT:



These are not my words. There are errors and typos in this viral post on FB/WhatsApp that someone adapted from my tweets without approval.



I share COVID info only on twitter. Just read through my TL here if you’d like accurate info.



Spread the word please. Thx pic.twitter.com/tplGscusMh — Faheem Younus, MD (@FaheemYounus) June 6, 2020

On July 15, a site called The Dallas Orthodox Jewish Life presents the list as ""Dr. Bonnie Henry’s Down to Earth Advice,"" featuring an image taken without permission from the New York Times' recent profile of B.C.'s top doc.

Forms of the list show up on Google as being reproduced all over, with varying attribution or none at all, from church newsletters to personal blogs.

Many B.C. residents are sharing the list on their Facebook pages today, however many more are trying to get the word out that the list is not Dr. Henry's.

Dr. Henry's COVID-19 provincial case media updates are published on the Province of British Columbia's website, and reputable sources readily cover the regular press conferences here in B.C. Further, B.C. has a robust online section dedicated to COVID-19, which includes reliable and accurate information.

There is no press conference scheduled for Wednesday, July 15. A representative who assists with media requests for Dr. Henry said the following via email to V.I.A.: ""[T]he information was not developed by Dr. Henry nor anyone in her office. While some of the recommendations are similar to her remarks over the past several months, there are inaccuracies and errors in the guidance that is provided. She rather recommends British Columbians refer to the excellent guidance found on the B.C. Centre of Disease Control’s website at www.bccdc.ca and share that information through their social networks.""",[]

It will feature local goods and farmed products but there will be some protocols to observe, according to the city of Port Coquitlam.

For example, masks will be required for vendors and customers who are unable to maintain a two metre physical distance. As well, customers will be required to do a complete health self-assessment and return home if they are feeling unwell.

As for shopping, customers will be able to select the items they wish to purchase, but vendors will handle and package the products prior to sale.

There will also be a one-way entrance to the market from Leigh Square with a one-way exit out to Donald Street.

The outdoor market will run Thursday until Oct. 8.

Consumers who prefer an online shopping experience, the market will also continue to offer curbside pick-up from the Gathering Place in Leigh Square.

To purchase on-line, residents can browse and shop for fresh food and produce at www.farmersandmore.org and select a pick-up time at the Gathering Place on Thursdays between 3 and 7 p.m. Orders must be submitted by Wednesday by 11:30 a.m. to be ready for pick-up Thursday the same week.

Customer parking will be reserved along Donald Street on Thursday afternoons.

The Port Coquitlam Farmers Market and the online food distribution hub is run by the Fraser North Farmers Market Society.

Port Coquitlam Mayor Brad West said the market is popular, and while it will look different will still provide shoppers with the local fresh food they crave.

“Farmers Markets are a vital way to provide residents with access to affordable, fresh and healthy food choices while supporting local farmers and businesses,” he stated in a press release.

To get updates on what will be available each week, residents are encouraged to sign up for the Farmers Market email newsletter at www.farmersandmore.org.

In Coquitlam, the farmers market operates Sundays from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. in the parking lot at Dogwood Pavilion, and in Port Moody, the farmers market operates at the Port Moody Recreation Complex Wednesdays from 3-7 p.m. More information is available here.",[]

The Federal Bureau of Prisons is expected to take Sidoo into custody on September 23 and release him from a Pacific Northwest area facility just before Christmas.

article continues below

Sidoo, 61, appeared online via Zoom in front of United States District Judge Nathaniel Gorton of the United States District Court for District of Massachusetts, as well as his lawyers and prosecutors. He wore a plaid suit while sitting in an office space inside his $31.7 million home in Vancouver’s Point Grey neighbourhood.

Sidoo, now a convicted felon, initially pled innocent to fraud and money laundering charges; he teared up before being sentenced and read a prepared statement:

“The last several months have been the hardest in my entire life and today I accept the court’s decision without reservation. No words can express how sorry I am for my decisions and actions that led to this day. I make no excuses, your honour. I broke the law and pled guilty and I now must pay for my actions.

“To my wife and boys, all I ever wanted was your love and respect and to be a good role model. And I know I have made a terrible mistake that has deeply affected our family. To my friends and colleagues and former teammates over the years, I am deeply ashamed today. To the young men and women who looked up to me as a role model, you deserve better. To the court and all of you, I wish to apologize for my actions.

“I will serve my sentence and am committed to returning to the community and doing everything possible to make a positive impact. I hope in time people will not judge me for the worst mistake in my life but for the work in the days, weeks and years ahead in which I am committed to being a better man.”

Gorton told Sidoo he was “impressed” by the businessman’s “obvious remorse.”

But Gorton pointed out two omissions in Sidoo’s statement.

“You expect to put this behind you and go forward and make up for what you called mistakes. I would call it a crime, not a mistake, but nevertheless, it is important that you acknowledge it and realize how many constituencies you have disappointed,” said the judge.

Sidoo also did not explicitly acknowledge that his crimes resulted in two students missing an opportunity to attend the universities his sons, Dylan Sidoo and Jordan Sidoo, were admitted to.

“What you accomplished, along with getting them into college, is to deprive two other deserving students of admittance into those universities — an act that is the very antithesis of one you want to be known for,” said Gorton.

Likewise, United States Attorney Andrew Lelling submitted to Gorton: “Sidoo engaged in serious criminal conduct involving fraud and deception that stretched over multiple years.

“His crimes warrant significant punishment. By engaging in the scheme, with [scheme mastermind Rick Singer] and others, Sidoo was able to steal two college admissions slots for his sons, including one from the University of California at Berkeley, one of the top public universities in the nation.”

Sidoo, said Gorton, “committed a crime that displayed an unbelievable lack of integrity, morality and common sense.

“You have let your selfish desire, your pride and your enormous wealth overcome all of what you apparently want to stand for with your works of charity,” Gorton told Sidoo.

Sidoo’s philanthropy, derived from his earnings in the capital markets, was central to his sentencing defense. According to Sidoo he has donated several million dollars to charitable causes, such as the University of B.C. football program.

In pleading guilty to fraud, Sidoo avoided a maximum prison term of 20 years and prosecutors subsequently agreed to 90 days behind bars, plus a $250,000 fine and one-year of supervised release, which will not be enforced in Canada by the U.S. Probation Department. Prosecutors also agreed to drop the money laundering charge.

The prison Sidoo goes to is expected to have harsher conditions since his options are limited due to his foreign citizenship. His attorney Martin Weinberg said he is expected to spend 14 days in isolation in a “maximum security setting,” due to COVID-19.

Sidoo will get four days credit for time already served. If he serves the full 90 days he will be released December 17 but will have to spend 14 days in isolation at home should B.C. public health rules for international travellers and COVID-19 continue into the fall.

Gorton said Sidoo’s crime would normally warrant more time in jail but there are mitigating circumstances, such as his remorse, lack of criminal record, philanthropy and “collateral consequences,” such as not being able to enter the U.S. as a felon and being stripped last month of his Order of B.C. medal for community service. Sidoo’s attorneys also previously noted he did not directly pay the universities but that his fraud was limited to cheating on the tests.

The former B.C. Lions football player worked as a stock broker in the 1990s and an investment banker between 2000 and 2010. Since 2010 he has made millions of dollars directing a handful of public companies that have failed to generate wealth for retail investors.

Sidoo was arrested March 8, 2019, in San Jose, California, on charges by the U.S. Department of Justice of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering related to the high-profile U.S. college admissions and bribery scandal, brought to light by a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe dubbed Operation Varsity Blues.

One of dozens of parents to be charged, Sidoo initially pled innocent to paying $200,000 total to scheme mastermind William ‘Rick’ Singer, who hired corrupt exam expert Mark Riddell to take Dylan and Jordan’s SAT exams, in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Sidoo also helped falsify one of his son Jordan’s university applications in October 2013 with an essay that originally included a fake claim of Jordan being held up at gunpoint by gangsters, while he was purported to be an intern for an anti-gang organization.

Co-conspirators Singer and Riddell pled guilty last year in exchange for cooperating with the government’s investigation.

The guilty parties in the case, who used Singer’s criminal services, were generally well-off individuals. Celebrities such as actress Lori Loughlin and her clothing designer husband Mossimo Gianulli and actress Felicity Huffman also pled guilty for related crimes and brought much media attention to the investigation.

Sidoo’s sons had no involvement in their father’s crime.

Jordan is now a 2018 history graduate from University of California Berkeley. Dylan graduated in cinematic arts in 2016 from the University of Southern California (USC). The two previously attended Vancouver’s prestigious St. George’s School.

Neither university has announced whether or not their degrees will remain valid. Dylan, according to the sentencing documents, had scored a 1,460/2,400 SAT score until Riddell, using a fake ID in December 2011, bumped up the score to 1,700, which was high enough for Dylan to enter Chapman University (and later transfer to USC). Riddell then scored 2,280/2,400 for Jordan in December 2012, paving the way to Berkley.

Riddell also took a high school test for Dylan. The B.C. Ministry of Education has issued no statement on how its testing process was so vulnerable to fraud.

Both sons have since entered into penny stock promotion with their father.

The decision — released July 15 — describes an incident which occurred around 1:30 a.m. on Nov. 23, 2019, when several people were leaving a Coquitlam pub.

article continues below

The Independent Investigations Office of BC (IIO) decision cites statements from six officers and three civilians that said they either witnessed the altercation between the off-duty officer and the man, identified in the ruling as AP, or were nearby when it happened.

“I wouldn’t say [AP] was hammered, but he was almost getting to that point,” said the injured man’s girlfriend.

AP’s girlfriend described an unprovoked attack from the off-duty Port Moody police officer — referred to as SO, or Subject Officer.

Witnesses agree AP was walking down the sidewalk without a shirt when he crossed paths with SO and two other off-duty officers. One witness recalled the off-duty officer in question yelling something like “Where’s your shirt?” before they both began striking each other.

AP’s girlfriend, who was reportedly highly intoxicated at the time, described SO repeatedly punching and “stomping” on AP’s chest and face, while another witness described the off-duty officer initially “lunging” at AP.

But the other off-duty officers painted a different picture, in which AP took a fighting stance and began throwing punches at SO. That’s when SO gave AP a “one-two jab,” according to one of the off-duty officers, before both ended up in a “grappling match” where the shirtless man went down to the ground and the off-duty cop put his foot down towards his chest to hold him down.

Chief civilian director Ronald J. MacDonald writes in the decision that both off-duty officers who witnessed the incident “told IIO investigators that they could not see what SO did in the interaction, even though they were standing very close by and looking in the direction of the incident, suggesting they should have been able to see most, if not all, of what happened.”

Due to conflicting testimony and a lack of available evidence, the IIO decision found it was not possible to be sure what happened, but that “it seems unlikely that any of the officers would have had any motivation to attack AP, a large intoxicated man, and more likely that the blows that SO struck were struck in self-defence.”",[]
151,tricitynews,http://www.tricitynews.com/huawei-hopeful-it-can-provide-5g-to-canada-despite-trump-five-eyes-pressure-1.24170835,"Huawei hopeful it can provide 5G to Canada despite Trump, Five Eyes pressure",[],,"OTTAWA — Huawei Canada says it is collateral damage in the Trump administration's trade war with China and remains hopeful that it might still be able to sell next-generation internet equipment to Canada.

That characterization comes one day after Britain became the last of Canada's ""Five Eyes"" intelligence-sharing allies to ban the Chinese telecommunications firm from its 5G wireless internet.

article continues below

The next generation of wireless internet technology is to be dramatically faster than the current standard, with more bandwidth and faster response times. It's expected to be crucial to technologies such as autonomous vehicles and remote medicine.

Alykhan Velshi, Huawei Canada's vice president of corporate affairs, says the company hopes the Trudeau government's ongoing 5G review steers clear of political machinations by administration of U.S. President Donald Trump to undermine the company.

""We see ourselves as being caught in the middle of the U.S.-China trade war. Canada is also unfortunately caught in the middle of it,"" Velshi said in an interview on Wednesday.

""That is the context in which a lot of announcements and decisions are made, as the Trump administration is demanding that everyone pick a side whether it is actually in their interest to go all in on one side or that other.""

Britain's decision brought it firmly in line with Trump's campaign to have Huawei banned from allied countries, including Canada.

The United States views Huawei as a security threat and says its equipment and technology would serve as a back door for China's communist leaders and military to spy on other countries as they adopt 5G technology — a charge the company firmly denies.

The Trudeau government has delayed a long-awaited decision on whether to allow Huawei to participate in Canada's new 5G network largely because of China's ongoing imprisonment of two Canadian men, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.

Kovrig and Spavor were arrested nine days after Canada detained Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, on an American arrest warrant in December 2018. That move is widely seen as retaliation by China to force Canada to release Meng.

Velshi, a lawyer and former Conservative political staffer, called the case against Meng a ""politically driven"" prosecution by Trump, and pointed to a 2018 musing by the president that she could be used as a bargaining chip in his trade negotiation with China.

He said Meng will be vindicated by the Canadian courts when the extent of Trump's political motivation is properly presented.

(The Green party issued a statement along the same lines Wednesday, saying the United States is abusing its extradition treaty with Canada for political purposes and calling on the Canadian government to demand U.S. charges against Meng be dropped.)

But at the same time, Velshi also expressed sympathy for Kovrig and Spavor and reiterated the view of the Canadian arm of his company that diplomats can somehow win their freedom.

""Like all Canadians we're concerned about their detention, we're concerned about their treatment and we want to see them home as soon as possible.""

The tensions between Beijing and Washington intensified on Wednesday following Tuesday's announcement by Britain that Huawei would be excluded from work on the 5G network because U.S. sanctions made it impossible to ensure the safety of Chinese-supplied equipment.

The Trump administration decided in May to block non-U.S. companies from using American technology to produce processor chips and other components for Huawei without Washington's approval.

On Wednesday, the Chinese government accused Britain of colluding with the U.S. to hurt Huawei. The Trump administration fired back by announcing travel bans on employees of Huawei and other Chinese companies that the U.S. determines are assisting authoritarian governments in violating human rights, including against Uighurs in western China.

Velshi said Huawei has faith in the Canadian government's ongoing 5G review and the company has nothing to say about how long it has taken for a decision to be made.

In the meantime, Velshi said that despite the tensions between Beijing and Ottawa, Huawei's revenues in Canada grew in 2019, as did its workforce, which stands at about 1,200 employees. Velshi said the company has not yet made public its 2019 financials.

""We attribute that growth to the fact that our customers … have largely stood by us and continued to buy our products,"" said Velshi.

David Reed, Britain's deputy high commissioner to Canada, had no comment on what Canada should do next, but noted the two countries enjoy strong co-operation in the Five Eyes, which also includes Australia and New Zealand.

Reed said all countries must focus on allowing more companies to thrive in the 5G market.

""The reason we're in this position is there's a global market failure,"" Reed said in an interview. ""That's the conversation we started, particularly with Five Eyes partners, earlier in the year and we're trying to make progress on that.""

John Power, the spokesman for Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains, gave no indication as to when the government would make its decision on which companies can sell 5G gear in Canada. He reiterated that the government would ""not compromise on matters of national security"" but declined to reference specific companies.

""Our government's review will consider technical and security factors, including advice from our security agencies and consider decisions from our allies and partners,"" he said in a statement, adding that it would take into account ""important domestic and international considerations.""

Tuesday, council approved a bylaw change that would allow the city to delay its annual property tax sale for a year to relieve the burden of those in dire straits during COVID-19.

article continues below

While people don’t usually lose their homes during the annual tax sale because they are often able to buy them back, it’s a threat hanging over 132 properties with outstanding taxes.

Typically, property owners delinquent in their taxes for two years as of Dec. 31 would see their properties go up for a tax sale in September at a minimum bid price equal to the amount of outstanding property taxes plus 5% and the land title registration fees.

The highest bidder — either equal to or above that price — will be declared the purchaser. If there is no bid, or no bid equal to the outstanding taxes plus 5%, the city will be declared the purchaser.

Once sold the property owner has one year to redeem the property by paying the outstanding property taxes plus any interest that has been charged.

Two properties In 2019 and four properties in 2018 were auctioned off and subsequently redeemed by their owners.

“It is rare for a property owner to not redeem the property and over the last twenty-five years no taxpayer has lost their home due to this process,” according to a staff report.

Delaying the annual property tax sale to Sept. 27, 2021 gives owners a longer time frame to pay their back taxes, however, the outstanding balance will continue to accrue interest.

The initiative is one of a number the city is implementing to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic.

While allowed by the province, the annual tax sale delay will require bylaw approval and public posting.

The goal is to reduce the burden on financially-strapped taxpayers during COVID-19.

“By extending the tax sale date until 2021 the city will provide financially distressed property owners an additional year to pay their delinquent property taxes,” according to a city staff report.",[]

Perry, the owner of a Coquitlam accounting firm, said in her scholarship announcement that COVID-19 had added to the stress of families as many require a device to do school work.

But even before COVID-19 struck, she notes that many high schools required students to have access to a device.

‘For most families, coming up with $500+ within a couple of months is not the easiest thing to do and this was before COVID-19 even happened. Then we add COVID-19, parents working from home and kids also learning from home and realized that ALL kids need technology,” she further stated.

According to Perry, students need access to their own own device and shouldn’t have to share with a parent or sibling.

“Having access to a device for only one hour a day, at say 7 p.m., once the working parent is done for the day, isn’t ideal if your child has no access to their teacher at that same time.”

She told The Tri-City News she hopes other students will consider offering laptop scholarships, too.

She says the province is investing $275,000 in the new BCcampus website to further develop online resources and tools focused on well-being for students, staff and faculty.

The resources include videos and webinars on topics such as adapting to online learning, stress management and navigating financial supports.

Mark says the province is also providing another $400,000 to support the development of more resources covering a wide range of courses and subjects in B.C.'s growing open textbook collection.

The minister says students may also now apply to StudentAid BC to be automatically considered for a free access grant announced in this year's provincial budget.

She says the grant means more than 40,000 eligible low- and middle-income students could receive up to $4,000 per year to help with costs associated with degree, diploma and certificate programs.

""This is double the funding and the number of students who were supported through grants under the former government,"" Mark said at Camosun College on Wednesday.

The B.C. access grant is open to part-time students, she added.

The amount students receive would depend on their family income, the length of their program and whether it's full or part time.

The 8,000-kilogram, armour-plated truck — equipped with a rotating roof hatch, eight gun ports and a powered battering ram — looked like it was ready for the worst of war zones.

article continues below

However, when the purchase was scuttled by city council last month, Mayor Mike Savage made it clear the brawny vehicle had become a symbol of oppression, particularly for Halifax's Black community. The mayor said the money would be used instead for anti-Black racism programs.

""There has been in this province a history of systemic racism, and we have to do better,"" Savage said at the time.

The decision was seen as a step forward by those who have long complained that Canada's police forces are becoming paramilitary organizations that act more like occupying armies than community-based partners.

""This announcement sends a positive message,"" said Akwasi Owusu-Bempah, a sociology professor at the University of Toronto. ""I have no doubt that what we call defunding of police ... will take hold in Canada.""

Owusu-Bempah, whose work examines race, crime and policing, cited the July 6 decision by Edmonton city council to cut $11 million over two years from the Edmonton Police Service budget. That money will be spent on housing, social services and a safety task force.

The professor, who also works with the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, said there is a growing movement to ""de-task"" the police, which means reducing the scope of their responsibilities and reallocating the savings.

He said mental-health organizations should be given the resources to deal with people facing mental-health crises rather than poorly trained front-line officers.

In the same vein, police should not be expanding their duties to include what the military is trained to do, because it transforms peace officers into soldiers who see members of the public as enemy combatants, he said.

""Poor, Black and Indigenous people then become the enemies in the war on drugs. It further entrenches the problems of racial injustice,"" Owusu-Bempah said. ""(Police) feel like they're in battle, as opposed to serving a community.""

The Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police did not respond to a request for an interview.

Meanwhile, there are others who say the about-face in Halifax was just a distraction from a much larger problem.

Kevin Walby, an associate professor of criminal justice at the University of Winnipeg, said there's more to militarization than the purchase of armoured vehicles, automatic weapons and tactical gear.

""In terms of defunding, they're actually the smallest piece of the puzzle,"" he said. ""So I wouldn't say the decision (in Halifax) means that Halifax police are off the hook when it comes to militarization, because it could still be happening in other ways.""

As an example, Walby points to the increasing use of heavily armed emergency response team members in routine, everyday policing.

Using information gleaned through access to information laws, Walby has found that police forces across Canada are increasingly using SWAT members to serve low-risk warrants.

""It is happening all the time, but we don't see it,"" he said. ""And they even assign SWAT team members to do mental-health checks.""

As well, Walby said he has been tracking a more insidious form of militarization known as ""community policing.""

It involves teams of officers fanning out in neighbourhoods to ask residents questions about their safety concerns and problems with their neighbours. The information is later used to compile detailed community profiles.

Though it may sound like a tame, feel-good strategy, Walby said community policing is anything but.

""Community policing has morphed into this kind of intelligence-gathering activity,"" he said. ""The militaries in Afghanistan and Iraq used community policing models to ... collect intelligence and feed it back into military operations. Canadian police are now using the very same tactic.""

In the United States, where the militarization of police has been more overt, an academic paper in the journal Research and Politics found that the increasing use of military equipment has led to more violent police behaviour.

The article, published in June 2017, cites a U.S. Department of Defence program that has made excess military weapons and vehicles available to local law enforcement agencies since the late 1990s.

The study revealed a statistically significant relationship between military transfers to police in four states and fatalities from officer-involved shootings.

""As militarization seeps into their cultures, (law enforcement agencies) rely more on violence to solve problems,"" the paper says. ""The mechanism mirrors psychology's classic 'Law of the Instrument,' whereby access to a certain tool increases the probability that the tool is used for problems when other tools may be more appropriate.""

Owusu-Bempah said police in the United States routinely use armoured vehicles for low-level drug raids.

""In the United States, we saw police with armoured vehicles pulling down the front walls of houses with a battering ram to execute warrants,"" he said. ""When you have the militarized type of policing, it creates an environment in which the warrior cop is allowed to exist.""

In January 2015, U.S. President Barack Obama cited concerns over the militarization of police when he signed an executive order that prohibits law enforcement agencies from acquiring certain military equipment, including tracked armoured vehicles, bayonets, grenade launchers and large-calibre weapons.

Obama's order came a few months after the shooting by police of Michael Brown, an unarmed Black youth in Ferguson, Mo., whose death sparked protests across the country — not unlike the protests that followed the death of George Floyd, the Black man in Minneapolis who died May 25 as a police officer was kneeling on his neck.

The disturbing video showing Floyd's violent arrest gave rise to a global movement that, among other things, is calling for the defunding and demilitarization of police departments — and an end to police brutality and systemic racism.

Plenty of cities across Canada already have armoured vehicles like the one Halifax rejected, including Ottawa, Fredericton, Saskatoon, Winnipeg and Sault Ste. Marie, Ont.

The Department of National Defence confirmed in 2014 it had donated five armoured vehicles to police agencies since 2007: a Grizzly armoured personnel carrier to Edmonton police in 2007; two Cougar armoured vehicles to the B.C. RCMP in 2010; and one Cougar each to the police in New Glasgow, N.S., and Windsor, Ont., in 2013.

The Cougar sent to New Glasgow was given away in 2017 because it was never put to good use, the police chief said at the time.

Still, the police departments that have these vehicles argue they are necessary because they offer protection to officers and the public during mass public shootings, hostage takings and other high-risk scenarios.

Ottawa lawyer Michael Spratt doesn't buy that rationale.

""Our police forces look more like military organizations — with automatic rifles and riot shields and tanks,"" said Spratt who specializes in criminal law and policing. ""There's no need for any police force to have a tank.""

The Ottawa Police Service, for example, has an imposing armoured vehicle known as a Lenco Bearcat, which Spratt says has rarely seen service since it was purchased in 2010.

""When we're talking about defunding the police ... this is really low-hanging fruit,"" said Spratt. ""Even if there is some marginal benefit in some rare circumstances, the cost of having these vehicles — and inherent harm of having a militarized police force — vastly outweighs any potential benefit.""

Members of the navy as well as the public at large will be able to vote online on two alternatives starting Friday, with both variants substituting ""sailor"" in place of ""seaman"" in different ways.

While the plan to drop the term has already prompted some backlash on social media, Gates says the navy wants to show both Canadians and its sailors that it is a modern and progressive organization.

Mohammed Shahed, a member of the governing party who regularly appeared on TV talk shows, was arrested Wednesday by the Rapid Action Battalion near the Indian border after a nine-day manhunt.

article continues below

Shahed is chairman of the Regent Group and owner of two Regent hospitals in the capital, Dhaka.

Abdul Baten, a commissioner of the Detective Branch in Dhaka, said Shahed admitted after his arrest that his hospitals did not have proper equipment to conduct coronavirus tests.

A court in Dhaka on Thursday allowed investigators to keep Shahed in custody for 10 days for questioning.

Officials said the hospitals had issued more than 10,000 coronavirus test results and about 60% were fake even though patients were charged for them. The hospitals allegedly arranged for the remaining tests to be conducted by another hospital.

The two hospitals had not renewed their medical licenses for years, but the Ministry of Health nevertheless signed a deal with Shahed to dedicate the hospitals to coronavirus testing and treatment as the number of cases rose in Bangladesh.

Bangladesh on Thursday was nearing 200,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, including 2,496 deaths. Public health experts say the actual number is much higher because only about 70 testing facilities are available in the country of 160 million people.

Shahed belongs to the governing Awami League party headed by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and is a member of its foreign affairs subcommittee. He has more than 50 illegal cases pending against him across the country on various charges including forgery and cheating.

Another doctor and her husband were also arrested recently on similar charges of falsifying test results.

Local media reports say the scams could hurt Bangladesh’s earnings from overseas workers. Last week, Italy suspended all flights from Bangladesh to Rome after some Bangladeshis reportedly presented fake negative test reports for the coronavirus.

Bangladesh earns about $19 billion a year from about 10 million overseas workers. Authorities said about 15,000 Bangladeshi workers with jobs in Italy remain stranded in Bangladesh and it is unclear whether they will be able to travel to the European country.

The Anti-Defamation league and some Jewish leaders had condemned what they called anti-Semitic theories expressed by Cannon and demanded the apology.

article continues below

""First and foremost I extend my deepest and most sincere apologies to my Jewish sisters and brothers for the hurtful and divisive words that came out of my mouth during my interview with Richard Griffin,"" Cannon said on his Twitter account.

""They reinforced the worst stereotypes of a proud and magnificent people and I feel ashamed of the uninformed and naïve place that these words came from. The video of this interview has since been removed.""

ViacomCBS cut ties with the TV host and producer Tuesday in response to his comments on a podcast where he discussed racial bias.

Rabbi Abraham Cooper, the Simon Wiesenthal Center’s associate dean, told The Associated Press that Cannon reached out to him Wednesday and during a 30-minute telephone conversation he apologized to the Jewish community and Cooper asked him to post it on social media.

""He started out the right way, he said the right things. Half an hour is a long time, and we'll probably meet tomorrow in the LA area,"" Cooper said.

""He understood that the words and references that he thought were based on fact, turned out to be hateful propaganda and stereotypical rhetoric.""

The TV host and producer wrote earlier a lengthy Facebook post defending himself and criticizing his firing for what the company deemed ""bigotry"" and ""anti-Semitism,"" prominent members of the U.S. Jewish community said the post fell well short and demanded an apology.

""It’s not enough to say, ‘I’m not a racist, I’m not a bigot,’"" Cooper had told the AP earlier. ""The statements he made are hurtful, and they’re false.""

Cooper said Cannon should read and heed the words of Martin Luther King Jr., who ""dedicated his life for civil rights for all and a colour-blind America."" Cooper also had advised him to seek out the guidance of basketball Hall of Famer-turned-writer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who has condemned several sports and entertainment celebrities for anti-Semitic posts.

In the hour-plus episode of ""Cannon's Class"" released last month that prompted his firing, Cannon and Richard ""Professor Griff"" Griffin, formerly of the rap group Public Enemy, contended that Black people are the true Hebrews and Jews have usurped that identity.

Cannon then argued that lighter-skinned people — ""Jewish people, white people, Europeans"" — ""are a little less"" and have a ""deficiency"" that historically caused them to act out of fear and commit acts of violence to survive.

""They had to be savages,"" he said.

""When I first heard about the comments Mr. Cannon made, it was very, very disappointing,"" said Oren Segal, director of the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism. ""We’re in a time where hatred of all kinds is very much apparent. It’s in the news every day.""

""Anti-Semitism in particular over the past several years has been something that we've seen in increase , as well as racism and other issues,"" Segal added. ""So when you hear an individual who has a public profile, who has influence over people, make statements that are highly offensive to the Jewish community, the first reaction is disappointment.""

Anti-Semitic violent attacks rose worldwide by 18% in 2019 compared with the previous year, according to a report published in April by Tel Aviv University’s Kantor Center for the Study of Contemporary Jewry.

Segal said some members of the Black Hebrew Israelite movement see themselves as the true ""chosen people,"" and believe that Blacks, Hispanics and Native Americans are the true descendants of the 12 Tribes of Israel. He noted that not all spew hateful rhetoric, although many adhere to an extreme set of anti-Semitic beliefs.

Bruce D. Haynes, a professor of sociology at the University of California, Davis, who has been studying Black Jews for more than two decades, agreed that the remarks echo the ideas of extreme Black Hebrew Israelites and of Minister Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam leader who last year referenced ""Satanic Jews"" in a speech denying allegations of anti-Semitism. But Haynes took a more nuanced view.

""The danger is that those groups get confused with other self-identified Israelites like (Rabbi) Capers Funnye, who has a congregation in Chicago, and who is very much involved with the Ashkenazim Jewish community. So I want to make clear that the term 'Israelites' is a tricky term,"" he said.

""Is it anti-Semitic to say Black people are the real Israelites or the real Jews? I’m not sure I’d call it anti-Semitism,"" Haynes said. ""It’s not a good reading of history, but I wouldn’t call it anti-Semitism. On the other hand, some of those groups that call Jews impostors certainly cross the line.""

Until his firing, Cannon produced ""Wild ’n Out,"" a comedy improv series for VH1, the ViacomCBS-owned cable channel.

In an earlier Facebook post, he had said that he welcomes being held accountable and takes responsibility for his words, while also accusing the company of trying to silence an ""outspoken black man"" and demanding full ownership of the ""Wild ’n Out"" brand.

""I do not condone hate speech nor the spread of hateful rhetoric. ... The Black and Jewish communities have both faced enormous hatred, oppression persecution and prejudice for thousands of years and in many ways have and will continue to work together to overcome these obstacles,"" he wrote.

Cooper had said that Cannon should reject Farrakhan’s hate speech and ""reduce the long statement to two sentences"" — a simple apology, which he did after their conversation.

""I just had the blessed opportunity to converse with Rabbi Abraham Cooper director of global social action @SimonWiesenthal. My first words to my brother was, I apologize for the hurt I caused the Jewish Community"" Cannon tweeted.

""On my podcast I used words & referenced literature I assumed to be factual to uplift my community instead turned out to be hateful propaganda and stereotypical rhetoric that pained another community For this I am deeply sorry but now together we can write a new chapter of healing.""

GLAAD called the decrease in non-white LGBTQ characters ""concerning."" In 2019, 34% of LGBTQ characters were people of colour. That's down from 42% in 2018 and 57% in 2017.

""GLAAD is ?calling on the studios to ensure that within two years at least half of their LGBTQ characters are people of colour,"" said the advocacy group that tracks representation of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in the media.

For the third year in a row, transgender characters were also absent from major studio releases.

But overall, GLAAD found higher rates of inclusion than it has in the eight years its been tracking studio films. Of the 118 films studied, 22 (18.6%) included lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or queer characters. That's a slight increase from 18.2% in 2018.

But none of the studios studied — the Walt Disney Co., Warner Bros., Universal Pictures, Lionsgate, Paramount Pictures, Sony Pictures, STX Films and United Artists Releasing — received a ""good"" or higher grade for LGBTQ representation. Sony and Disney received ""poor"" grades. STX Films, which released ""Hustlers,"" ""21 Bridges"" and ""Uglydolls"" last year, failed GLAAD's test since their 2019 movies featured zero LGBTQ representation.

GLAAD has sought that studios reach inclusion of LGBTQ characters in 20% of their films by 2021 and 50% by 2024. Paramount, Lionsgate, Disney and United Artists reached the 20% level last year.

Screen time is also an issue. In many of Hollywood’s biggest films, LGBTQ characters — when included — came and went. Only nine of the 22 films with an LGBTQ character featured one with more than 10 minutes of screen time.

""Despite seeing a record high percentage of LGBTQ-inclusive films this year, the industry still has a long way to go in terms of fairly and accurately representing the LGBTQ community,"" said GLAAD President and CEO, Sarah Kate Ellis. ""If film studios want to stay relevant to today’s audiences and compete in an industry that is emphasizing diversity and inclusion, then they must urgently reverse course on the diminishing representation of LGBTQ women and people of colour, as well as the complete absence of trans characters.""

The bank's report says 1.5 million women lost their jobs in the first two months of the pandemic.

article continues below

The report found that women tend to work in industries hardest hit by the crisis, their employment level has been slower to rebound as the economy reopens and they are more likely to fall out of the workforce in the long-term.

The study says one-third of women who lost jobs between February and June did not seek work, putting them at higher risk of long term job-separation and future wage penalties.

Employment among women with toddlers or school-aged children fell seven per cent between February and May, compared with a four-per cent decrease for fathers of children the same age.

Single mothers with a toddler or school-aged child saw their employment drop 12 per cent between February and June, compared with a seven per cent decrease for single fathers.

The study says women accounted for about 45 per cent of the decline in hours worked over the downturn, but will only make up 35 per cent of the recovery.

The Toronto-based miner says gold production in the three months ended June 30 fell by about eight per cent to 1.149 million ounces from 1.25 million in the previous quarter, mainly due to COVID-19 related disruptions at its Veladero mine in Argentina.

article continues below

It warns that second quarter gold all-in sustaining costs per ounce are expected to be seven to nine per cent higher than in the first quarter, while copper costs are to rise by four to six per cent.

Barrick says the average market price for gold in the second quarter was US$1,711 per ounce, up from its realized price of US$1,589 per ounce in the first quarter.

Copper production, meanwhile, rose to 120 million pounds from 115 million in the first quarter, and the average market price was US$2.43 per pound, up from a realized price of US$2.23 in the first quarter.

CEO Mark Bristow says Barrick is positioned well to achieve its guidance for the year.

In May, 2020 gold guidance was adjusted lower by about 200,000 ounces to between 4.6 and five million ounces to account for the suspension of its Porgera gold mine amid a dispute with the federal government in Papua New Guinea.

Barrick is to report its second quarter financial results on Aug. 10.

The Toronto-based company says it has reassigned about 220 of the complex's 475 workers elsewhere within its Canadian organization since the suspension began in April.

However, Kirkland Lake Gold says it now believes that the best course of action is to provide severance packages for the remaining employees who can't be reassigned.

The mining and milling complex near Matheson, Ont., was designated as non-core to Kirkland Lake Gold's business in mid-February.

That was followed by a suspension of operations as of April 2 under protocols that Kirkland Lake Gold put into effect to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Holt, Taylor and Holloway mines and Holt mill accounted for nearly 12 per cent of the 975,000 ounces produced last year by Kirkland Lake Gold, according to its website.

Kirkland's other properties include the Macassa mine and the Detour Lake mine in northern Ontario and the Fosterville mine in Australia.

But closing those sales has been problematic, Rivera says, since the Alberta government ended a rebate program that had covered as much as 35 per cent of the initial cost of a typical system.

article continues below

""I've been in the solar business long enough to watch it slowly, slowly increase, then once the grant program was there, it increased quite sharply for the residential market,"" says the president and co-founder of Calgary's GreenLight Power, which was founded in 2008.

""But, once the grants disappeared (last fall), we saw that sharp increase drop drastically. We had 21 customers signed up — the day they cancelled the grant, all but one cancelled their contract with us.""

The financial argument for investing in a home solar power array in Canada depends, experts say, on how much sun your house receives, how much it costs for electricity from the public grid, the capital cost of installation and, of course, which way the political wind blows.

In Alberta's case, the United Conservative Party cancelled a program put in place by the New Democrats. Similarly, after a 2018 provincial election, Ontario's Progressive Conservatives put an end to the main solar rebates program, implemented by a previous Liberal-led government.

Shifting policy and power prices make it difficult to estimate how long it will take for energy savings to pay off the capital cost of a home system, said Nicholas Gall, director, distributed energy resource for CanREA, the Canadian Renewable Energy Association.

Abundant — and cheap — hydroelectric power in Quebec, for instance, makes it more difficult to justify home solar power on a cost-saving basis there, he said.

Still, the declining cost of solar panels makes them a much better deal today than they were a decade ago.

""Costs for solar panels have fallen by about 55 per cent between 2008 and 2018,"" he said, citing the most recently available numbers.

""Those costs will represent anywhere from 20 to 45 per cent of the total installed cost. There are fixed costs that haven't come down as much, for labour and permitting and design, but the hardware is continuing to decrease in price.""

Installations are long-lived, he said, noting some installed in the 1980s are still producing plenty of electricity and panels installed today are expected to last at least 30 years.

The systems work best if your roof faces south but east or west can work, too, he said. (Roofs that are shaded by neighbours or trees make poor solar power collectors.)

Most provinces have programs where excess power from residential systems is purchased for distribution on the grid, he added, but the compensation varies widely from one jurisdiction to another.

Asked which Canadian province is the best in which to buy a solar power system now, Gall was quick to identify Prince Edward Island, which has a ""generous"" rebate of $1 per watt.

""That's around 40 per cent of the total installed cost for a typical system, up to a maximum of $10,000,"" he said.

Nova Scotia has a slightly less generous rebate program that pays 60 cents per watt, up to 25 per cent of system costs, to a maximum of $6,000, he added.

There are a hodgepodge of other programs across the country. The Northwest Territories, for instance, will pay up to 50 per cent of the cost of a solar system but only for buildings that are off the grid.

Some municipal governments also offer solar rebates — Medicine Hat is an example in southern Alberta. In Calgary, residents can lease their solar power system.

Prospective homebuyers in Edmonton and Calgary, meanwhile, have the option to buy solar power as an included component of their new house — Jayman Built Homes has been putting six-panel, two-kilowatt solar systems on all of its homes since early 2019.

The Calgary-based company built 811 homes last year and expects to add more than 700 this year, said Jayman president and chief operating officer Dave Desormeaux.

The withdrawal of the provincial rebate program last year meant an additional cost to Jayman of about $1,500 per home, he said, but after much thought, the company kept its solar program going.

""We're not making the margins we used to but we don't want to change the brand unless we absolutely had to. And so far that strategy is working,"" said Desormeaux.

He estimates the panels result in annual utility bill savings of about $200 to $250 per home.

GreenLight's Rivera says a full-sized home system should generate eight to 12 kilowatts at a non-subsidized capital cost of between $2 and $3 per watt, or $16,000 to $36,000.

He said he's fielding plenty of calls these days asking about adding battery storage to improve system reliability, independence from the grid on cloudy days and power quality.

But, although battery costs are falling, storage adds thousands of dollars to the cost of the system.

""As soon as you add batteries, you're doubling if not tripling the cost of solar because the battery technology is so expensive,"" he said.

""It's a tonne of interest — but not a tonne of sales.""

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, there also won’t be crowds of families and kids snaking through the parking lot, kicking the tires on the big red trucks as they await their flapjacks.

article continues below

Instead, organizers of the Port Moody Firefighters Charitable Society’s annual pancake breakfast are taking their batter and spatulas online.

While the technology may not yet exist to allow the firefighters to reach through computer monitors and serve golden pancakes to people in their homes, Rob Shoucair said they’re going to try their best to replicate the fun and community spirit of the 43rd annual fundraising event through a special Facebook Live presentation on Aug. 2, from 8:30 to 10:30 a.m.

The timing coincides with breakfast because, Shoucair said, it’s hoped families will enjoy their own homemade flapjack feasts, then upload photos of their pancake parties to their social media feeds before Aug. 1, with the hashtag #43pomopancakes, for a chance to win prizes to be awarded during the live webcast.

Rob Shoucair is getting ready for the Port Moody Firefighters Charitable Society's 43rd annual pancake breakfast on Aug. 2 that is being held online because of the COVID-19 pandemic. - MARIO BARTEL/THE TRI-CITY NEWS

Final details are still being worked out, but Shoucair said the livestream is expected to include a tour of the hall, messages from sponsors and a “battle of the pancakes” cook-off contest between competing groups of firefighters. There’s also a 50/50 draw and a raffle for two airline tickets.

Soucair said it took firefighters a bit of time to reboot their traditional kick-off to the summer season after the public health emergency and subsequent restrictions against large public gatherings.

“We wavered,” he said of the decision to find a new way to move forward. “It would have been disappointing to cancel after 42 years.”

The delay meant moving the breakfast from its traditional Canada Day date to the B.C. Day weekend so the five-man organizing committee could get all the pieces in place for an online event.

It also necessitated a new method to collect the money that normally comes from the $5-a-plate charge and goes to support local organizations like the Eagle Ridge Hospital Foundation, Crossroads Hospice Society and the Mossom Creek hatchery. That is being done through a special GoFundMe campaign.

Shoucair said the $10,000 goal of the campaign is a little more modest than the $58,000 that was raised at last year’s event that served more than 4,000 plates of pancakes, but the online initiative is a bit of an unknown quantity. He said it’s more important to retain the event’s continuity and carry through with the fundraising momentum already started by continued support from its many sponsors.

“A lot of charities are relying on our donations,” he said. “We didn’t want to let down the people we support.”

Shoucair said the virtual pancake breakfast will also be a way to boost morale in the community as people weary of months social isolation and physical distancing efforts to reduce the risk of transmitting the novel coronavirus.

“It shows people we can all adapt to the things we’re facing this year,” he said. “But it will definitely feel different.”",[]

Ruben’s Ruckus LIVE & Virtual 2020 will launch July 5 with eight weeks of home-based obstacles and challenges leading up to a virtual Race Day on Aug. 23.

And to kick things off, there will be an NHL20 online tournament presented by Alpha North Esports on PlayStation and Xbox.

Going virtual was a pivot made necessary by COVID-19, organizers said.

The first annual Ruben’s Ruckus took place May 12, 2018, and was a huge success with all time-slots completely sold out. This year was bound to be even bigger, with 250 kids pre-registered. And then COVID-19 took over and sideswiped the plans.

“Originally our goal for Ruben’s Ruckus was to create a really fun event to give back to all of our local kids who have helped us so much and been integral to our success; with everything that is happening, we knew we needed to find a way to leverage technology and continue to engage with our young stakeholders by offering the event virtually,” said Ruben’s Shoes Founder Kelly Strongitharm.

In the virtual event, kids can sign up to make pledges and do indoor and outdoor challenges, such as a sidewalk chalk obstacle challenge, ping pong ball challenge, make your own home fort, hallway maze obstacle course, along with a 3-km scavenger hunt race.

Every Sunday starting July 5 through Aug. 16 a new Home Obstacle Challenge will be presented. Registered participants will have the week to complete their obstacle for which they will win badges and points leading to exciting prizes and rewards.

Pledges are encouraged to help build a school in the Dominican Republic. For example, $50 in pledges will purchase a desk.

The Port Moody-based Ruben's Shoes Society has an elementary school in the Dominican Republic with over 240 students, and the next step is to build a high school.

Mayor Rob Vagramov said those heroes can be anyone from teachers to business owners to community volunteers, advocates for heritage, arts, culture and the environment, as well as sports coaches and athletes.

“Sometimes heroes are easily recognizable to everyone, but often they work quietly in the background, providing support and inspiration so that others can shine,” he said.

Nominations are open until July 31, and are being accepted in five categories:

• the Peter Hulbert Accessibility Award recognizes an individual, business, group, educator or government agency that works to remove barriers for individuals with disabilities.

• the Arts Award for an individual, business or organization that advances the artistic or cultural fabric of the Port Moody.

• the Environmental Award goes to an individual, organization or business that promotes environmental awareness and preservation.

• the Heritage Award recognizes the advancement of heritage conservation in the city by an individual, organization or business.

• the Sports Award is a recognition for local athletes, teams or builders — like coaches, officials or volunteers — who serve as positive role models and encourage young people to get involved in sports and lead healthy lifestyles. For the first time this year, there will be three recipients, one of whom will be a young person between the ages of 12 and 19.

But, as refugees from the civil war in Afghanistan, they’ve also experienced how tenuous that can be.

Since finding their feet and rebuilding their lives in Coquitlam, the Malikzadas have not only nourished their customers with a unique fusion of Afghan, Indian and Greek cuisine they serve at their restaurant, Jamila’s Kitchen, they’ve also nurtured them as they have come through their doors.

That effort has taken on new urgency with so many of them struggling through the financial uncertainties and anxieties of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Malikzadas, who’ve quietly served free meals to people in need through their No Money, No Worries initiative since 2017, extended the courtesy to frontline workers and first responders in the early weeks of the public health crisis. Recently, they spent an entire Monday cooking and then delivering 200 meals for staff at Royal Columbian Hospital in New Westminster.

With schools back in session in a limited fashion, Malik said he’s reached out to local principals to distribute cards to needy families that can be discreetly redeemed for a free meal. He’s also dropped some off at local churches.

He said it’s hard not to keep on helping, even as he has to carefully manage his own business so suppliers can be paid and the rent covered. He said it’s about paying it forward and building a foundation that can be sustained through thick and thin.

“Community has always been important,” he said. “We’ve stood on the shoulders of others, and now we need to create the opportunity for the next generation to stand on our shoulders.”

The Malikzadas said they really gained their love and appreciation for community through their own struggles, first to escape the war in Afghanistan in 1995, and then living and working as refugees in Pakistan for six years before coming to Canada.

“When we see community as the human community, it brings a spark,” Malik said.

And while the family’s latest efforts have necessitated a dip into their own savings, he said it’s worth it.

But when British Columbia’s chief medical officer, Dr. Bonnie Henry, gave her blessing to the covering — calling the donning of non-medical masks a “permissive use” — Walter got busy sewing.

A month — and 300 masks — later, Walter’s work has connected her closer to the community around her Gabriola Drive home in Coquitlam and is raising money for a couple of causes close to her heart.

Now retired from her job assembling the course calendar at Simon Fraser University, the avid sewer started her mask making by fulfilling requests from friends. She also made some for members of Coquitlam Search and Rescue.

Walter said she would have stopped there, but when she got news an 83-year-old uncle had passed away in England from complications brought on by COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, the pandemic suddenly became very real to her. So she kept sewing masks.

Walter sent some to Costco, where a friend’s daughter works. She packed others into plastic sleeves she had saved from the home delivery of her daily newspaper, and affixed them to a sign on her front lawn, offering them up free to any takers.

In return, all Walter asked for was a donation to the Tri-Cities-based Share food bank or the Port Moody chapter of Days for Girls, a charitable organization that assembles feminine hygiene kits for young women in developing countries.

Walter said the project has had the added benefit of depleting her vast supply of fabric swatches she’s gathered over her years as a sewer. But, more importantly, she’s met strangers and neighbours who’ve not only heeded her call to help her causes but also earned her notes and letters of gratitude dropped into her mail slot, a bouquet of flowers delivered to her door and a bottle of wine left on her stoop.

“This project is lovely on so many levels,” said Walter, who often waits by her front window to watch people stroll up to her sign to retrieve a mask. “I’m connecting with people I don’t know.”

Eager to keep up with demand, Walter has even enlisted her partner, Jeff Rudd, to clip corners off the fabric or round up elastics.

Walter said she tries to make her masks appealing to any gender, and strives for whimsical colours and patterns when the fancy strikes her.

“People will turn this into something they’ll be proud to wear,” she said, adding she now pulls one on herself every time she ventures from the safety of her home.

“When I look outside and the bags are gone, I think I better get busy again,” Walter said.",[]

But with the season on hold because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the active, sports-loving Coquitlam Grade 8 student is hunkered in his room, sleeping in most mornings and flexing his thumbs on his X-Box controller when he does roust himself from bed.

Nathan’s dad, Keven, says isolation has been hard on the normally sociable teenager. So, to help him deal with some of his anxieties, they embarked on a book project together.

It’s not the first time father and son have collaborated.

Nathan has published four other kids’ books about super heroes, like firefighters, doctors, assistance dogs and the RCMP musical ride. In fact, the latter was set to be launched in Ottawa in March when the public health emergency hit. All raise money for affiliated causes like the BC Burn Fund, Canucks for Kids, Pacific Assistance Dogs Society and Cops for Cancer.

This latest book, Mom and Her Super Heroes, continues the super hero theme, except these ones don’t wear heavy turnout gear or eat kibble. They’re truck drivers, grocery store workers, pharmacists and teachers. Or, as Keven McTaggart said, they’re “the people out there that are trying to keep your life normal and without them your life would be totally different.”

The combination colouring and activity story book draws upon the McTaggart’s own experiences. Brad the truck driver is a friend of Keven’s, the pharmacist fills prescription’s for Nathan’s mom, the grocery store encounters are their own. Even Coquitlam Mayor Richard Stewart gets a shout-out.

McTaggart said it was important to make the story relatable to every young reader.

“They’ll recognize they’re not in it alone,” he said, adding kids must appreciate the risks being taken by everyday people to ensure some level of normalcy for everyone else.

McTaggart said it took only four days from Nathan’s first enquiry about the purpose behind the nightly pilgrimage his mom was making to the balcony to bang her pots that sparked the idea for another book to its realization.

The story grew from a series of conversations between father and son, as well as Nathan’s mom, Lucie, including one during a road trip to Abbotsford to get cheap gas.

The illustrations that kids can colour were done by Nathan’s former Grade 3-4 teacher, Sarah Shinkewski, and her daughter, Katie Fong.

Shinkewski normally gets her students to create the pictures for Nathan’s books, but with school being conducted virtually this spring, that wasn’t possible, McTaggart said.

In between each illustrated page of the story is a blank page where kids can draw the super heroes of their own lives in lockdown, or even write down their thoughts.

McTaggart said he hopes young readers will take the opportunity for self-reflection.

“A lot of kids take for granted what they have,” he said. “I’m hoping the kids will appreciate what they have more.”

So when she offers advice for surviving the COVID-19 pandemic and financial fallout, one is inclined to heed it.

For the Port Moody resident, who was acknowledged this week with the BC Community Achievement Award, hard work, perseverance and appreciating community connectedness are the keys to getting through tough times.

Cooper should know, while she putters around her home baking and participating in a documentary film about her life, a group of friends, family and other supporters are making sure she has seeds to grow on her deck and food for the cupboards during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“I see people around me and I applaud them,” Cooper said. “Now is when we need people who have that feeling of community. It makes a difference in people’s lives and how we might recover from it.”

This week Cooper was honoured, along with 24 other B.C. residents, for their community achievements.

In an interview with the Tri-City News, Cooper said she was “humbled” by the acknowledgement, but her efforts to make the historic Ioco townsite a community space have been a labour of love not an arduous task.

When envisioning a place where history and community-life are intertwined in the former refinery-worker town, Cooper has many ideas.

“I thought ‘what can I possibly bring about that would bring about the feeling of community and so that some action could be taken?’” she said. “To me it’s the vision of community that I want to see part of the planning in Port Moody.”

Through her efforts, many buildings were saved, the town was designated a heritage site, and a community event was held for many years called Ioco Ghost Town Days.

The land is now owned by Gilic Global Development Management Inc. and could one day be developed for housing, but Cooper would also like to see community amenities, including an interpretive walking trail so families can enjoy nature and local history safely.

“It’s a gift, it’s a beautiful piece of land, it’s got water, forests, pathways, birds,” Cooper said. “Future planning needs to consider it an asset.”

Meanwhile, a documentary is being made about Cooper and it will likely highlight many of her accomplishments. To bring it through to completion, a group of supporters is fundraising.

In the meantime, Cooper says she is managing fine during the COVID-19 pandemic, thanks to her friends and family.

Having lived through several pandemics, including the Spanish flu, and economic hard-times, like the Great Depression, Cooper said people will be able to get through this emergency too.

“There are three things — we have to believe in what we’re doing, we have to have persistence and number three we have to have have faith.”

While hundreds of people could be employed in positions relating to the games and hubs — such as security jobs, rink staff, food services and hotel housekeeping — the financial benefit of two bubble communities under tight seal would be ""modest"" at best, suggested Bank of Montreal chief economist Douglas Porter.

""When you think of how many tourists would normally be in Toronto during peak tourist season, I'm quite sure this is less than one per cent,"" he said.

""The reality is, it's not going to move the needle.""

But Porter, a lifelong hockey fan, said he anticipates a ""reasonably meaningful positive"" morale boost to Canadian sports fans who've been eagerly anticipating players returning to the ice in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The games are slated to start Aug. 1 with six Canadian teams qualifying for the 24-team resumption of play. No fans will be in the seats.

Edmonton and Toronto were confirmed as the NHL's hub cities on Friday night.

""The fact that part of our world is getting back to some kind of normal will help reinforce the sense that things, generally, are moving in that direction and could help support the recovery,"" Porter said.

The gradual comeback of major sporting events has drawn plenty of interest in recent weeks, with debates raging over the risks of putting players back into the games, even if spectators aren't allowed in the facilities.

Further questions have been raised over whether rigorous testing is enough to prevent outbreaks within the isolated community, which could potentially throw the whole plan into a costly disarray.

Many of these factors make placing a value on hockey's return especially difficult.

Michael Naraine, a professor at Brock University in St. Catharines, Ont., said the largest amount of money is on the line at large corporations, which he said is driving the return of major sporting events.

""The primary revenue driver for sports is broadcasting,"" said the assistant professor of digital sport management and marketing.

""They need television advertisers come back. The league itself needs to gain its revenue from NBC and Sportsnet here in Canada.""

Politicians have preferred to emphasize the positive aspects of a deal with the NHL.

Alberta Premier Jason Kenney eagerly promoted Edmonton as the ultimate hub city for the hockey league, posting videos on Twitter that prominently featured the Rocky Mountains and other popular destinations in the province.

Naraine said those public expressions by leaders are more an attempt to ""pander"" to their constituents than actually drive any meaningful economic impact. He said this is especially the case in Edmonton.

""Having major events come to town allows them to beat their chests and say, 'We exist. We're on the map. Come look at us,'"" he said.

""But the fact that the hub city will be in Edmonton is no different than whether the hub city would be in Toronto or Vancouver or elsewhere. It's not going to significantly drive tourism all of a sudden.""

Patrick Rishe, a sports professor at Washington University in St. Louis, said he sees value in showcasing a lesser known Canadian city on broadcast television with ""beauty shots"" of the locale. He said it may also sit well with NHL executives.

""You never know,"" he said. ""Doing and serving a good deed for the league now, this could pay dividends down the road.""

Any semblance of a regular hockey season would be welcomed by Dana Parris, owner of the Lockeroom sports bar in Barrie, Ont.

Even though her business is over 100 kilometres away from downtown Toronto, she anticipates the excitement would reverberate to her customers.

""If we could have sports come back and we hit Stage 3 (of Ontario's COVID reopening plan) around the same time, I will probably stop crying myself to sleep,"" she said.

""If those two come together it's just going to be the most beautiful thing.""

Shut out of school gyms and community centres that are mostly still closed, and loathe to overstay its welcome at some outdoor facilities like Port Coquitlam’s Evergreen Park, Panther Hoops’ head coach Doug Dowell said the program needed a more permanent solution to make its plans to put on a full schedule of summer camps viable and sustainable.

article continues below

“The pressure was on us to find a place we could call our own.”

That’s when several parents decided if they built it, the kids could play.

Over the course of a rainy weekend in June, when pretty much every weekend was damp, they cleaned up detritus from the parking lot behind BC Christian Academy where the program is based, bored deep holes into the pavement, assembled four full-sized basketball nets with glass backboards and poured concrete to lock them in place. A welder was brought in to add another level of security.

The result is an urban playground worthy of a Woody Harrelson streetball movie, set against a backdrop of an auto repair shop, crooked particleboard fencing and stacks of shipping containers.

MARIO BARTEL/THE TRI-CITY NEWS Stacks of shipping containers, and crooked fibreboard fencing are the backdrop for makeshift basketball courts constructed in a parking lot behind BC Christian Academy so Panther Hoops could conduct its summer youth camps.

More importantly, Dowell said, the makeshift courts have allowed Panther Hoops to offer co-ed day camps for players aged 7 to 16, and evening camps three times a week for more experienced high school players.

Dowell said the camps are an important element of Panther Hoops’ broadened mandate to serve the wider community after it started 13 years ago as a prep program at BC Christian to develop elite players who could contend for post-secondary scholarship opportunities.

The public health emergency threatened to derail that progress.

Dowell said he quickly recognized moving outdoors was the solution.

“With this whole COVID thing, people are on the edge,” he said. “We wanted to get the kids out the door.”

With no gym at BC Christian, Panther Hoops has always led a nomadic existence, so it ventured as far as Pitt Meadows to find open-air facilities it could use for small groups of kids working on their individual skills.

Dowell said one of the biggest challenges was getting his staff of experienced coaches that includes longtime high school coach Rich Goulet, former Cape Breton University bench boss David Petroziello, and former Pitt Meadows Marauders star player Scott Walton, to deconstruct routines they’ve run for years and reassemble them as individual drills that don’t require sharing the ball or close-quarters defence.

MARIO BARTEL/THE TRI-CITY NEWS Will Patterson works on an agility drill at Panther Hoops basketball camp that is being held on makeshift courts assembled in the back parking lot of BC Christian Academy in Coquitlam.

He said the exercise has been refreshing.

“In a way, it’s helped us realign ourselves.”

The end result, Dowell said, is a more innovative, free-form approach to basketball, more akin to creative streetball than the regimented strategies and patterns of the sport when it’s played in the gym and a final score matters.

“It’s made you get more into the ingenuity,” Dowell said. “It’s a missing part of the game.’

The weekly camps, that run through to the end of August, have full safety procedures in place, like a staged entrance to the outdoor facility after each participant has answered a health questionnaire, had their temperature checked as well as recorded, and their hands sanitized. Players must also bring their own ball which can be used only by them exclusively, although it’s also wiped down frequently during sessions and before they head home for the day.

MARIO BARTEL/THE TRI-CITY NEWS David Mutabzi, right, works with one of his young charges, Skyler Nuestro, at Panther Hoops basketball camp.

And while the outdoor venue means the odd session may get washed away, the kids don’t lose out, as each is issued a punch card so a missed day can be made up as part of another camp.

Dowell said their summer of survival is actually allowing the program to thrive.

“True growth in the sport will only happen when you think outside the box,” he said.

According to a report in the Grand Forks Herald, Rizzo has asked for a release from his commitment to attend the University of North Dakota beginning in September. It’s unclear what his plans are for the coming season. His Western Hockey League playing rights are held by the Kamloops Blazers, which selected him 15th overall in the 2016 bantam draft.

Rizzo, who’s from Burnaby, scored 19 goals and 44 points for the Express last season, after he was acquired from the Penticton Vees last June, the day after he was drafted in the seventh round — 216th overall — by the Carolina Hurricanes in the NHL draft in Vancouver.

The 19-year-old was originally projected to be selected in the third to fifth round, but a back injury cost him 21 games and he finished his sophomore season in the BC Hockey League with 40 points in 37 games. After off-season back surgery to repair a torn hip muscle, Rizzo missed training camp and several early season games with the Express before joining the lineup and leading the team to the top regular season record.",[]

Aaron Tung, and his dad, Wilson, depart July 6 for Florida where the Centennial secondary student will be enrolling in Grade 11 and playing football at Clearwater Academy International, a small, independent prep school with a big reputation for success on the field and sending its athletes to top NCAA programs like Clemson, Pitt, Indiana and the University of Minnesota.

article continues below

The decision to send Aaron south to pursue his educational and football goals has been fraught, not with concern about the tropical storms that frequently pound the state from June to November, but with the uncertainty of landing in the midst of a pandemic that is catching its second wind as well as the tumult of racial unrest and protests brought on by the killing of several African Americans by white police officers.

“It couldn’t have been worse timing,” admitted Aaron’s mom, Denise.

Until March, the Tung family had never heard of Clearwater Academy. That’s when 17-year-old Aaron got a message from Clearwater’s coach, Jesse Chinchar, who had been impressed by a highlight video he saw online of the six foot four inch, 300-pound offensive tackle in action with the Centennial Centaurs.

At first, Aaron said, he didn’t put much stock in the idea of heading to Florida, but the more he researched the school’s football credentials and his parents looked into its academic offerings, the more seriously they considered Chinchar’s recruiting efforts.

Comprised of only 250 students from kindergarten to Grade 12, Clearwater Academy built its Knights football program from a six-man team in 2008 to an 11-man side in 2016 that went undefeated just two years later and has won several Florida Christian Association of Private and Parochial Schools championships. Many of its players are from out of state, including several from Canada. A recent grad was former Terry Fox Ravens quarterback Jevaun Jacobsen, who’s signed a letter of intent to attend Charleston Southern University in the fall.

Academically, Denise Tung — a teacher herself — said she liked the idea of a small school with small classes where Aaron could get more one-on-one attention. While there, he’ll be billeted with a host family.

“You really get the sense they’ll look out for the boys,” she said.

Still, it’s hard to reconcile the impression of an idyllic little school in the middle of Florida when the state continues to amass record numbers of COVID-19 infections and the country reels from racial unrest and political division.

Denise said the family has had ongoing discussions with Chinchar and other school officials about their protocols to protect students, including an immediate 14-day quarantine upon Aaron’s arrival.

“If I felt the school would have put him in danger, it would have been a no-go,” she said. “The option to come home is always there.”

The family, which is mixed-race, has also had several discussions with Aaron about expectations for his conduct in an environment where a seemingly innocent interaction can sometimes turn tragic.

“He recognizes he’s going to a whole different situation,” Denise said. “He has to be more mindful of his surroundings. He can’t be as free as he is here.”

Aaron said he’s up to the challenge. Even the process of getting to this decision has forced him to mature.

“I’m getting more comfortable with the idea of being uncomfortable,” he said. “I just have to make sure I stay away from any potential trouble.”

Coquitlam's Aaron Tung has his eyes set on a scholarship to play football at an NCAA Div. 1 school as he heads to Florida to play out his high school career at a prep school in Clearwater even as the United States reels from record numbers of COVID-19 infections and racial turmoil. - MARIO BARTEL/THE TRI-CITY NEWS

That shouldn’t be too hard during his initial isolation period, when he’ll be involved in virtual meetings with coaches and teammates, and immersing himself in learning the team’s playbook so he can hit the field running when training camp begins on July 20.

And while it’s still uncertain what a competitive season might look like, or whether it will happen at all, Aaron said that’s no different from football’s situation locally, where the BC Secondary School Football Association has yet to announce its intentions for September.

At the very least, Aaron said, he’ll be able to measure himself against bigger players with a deeper football background, something he expects will serve him well towards attaining his goal of landing a football scholarship to a big-time NCAA program in the Pacific Northwest.

“I can do this,” he said.",[]
184,tricitynews,http://www.tricitynews.com/burris-named-first-ballot-inductee-into-canadian-football-hall-of-fame-1.24171335,Burris named first-ballot inductee into Canadian Football Hall of Fame,['Dan Ralph'],,"For one of the few times in his life, Henry Burris was left speechless.

The 18-year veteran quarterback headlines the Canadian Football Hall of Fame's 2020 class that was unveiled Thursday. Burris, 45, got the nod in his first year of eligibility, becoming just the 21st player ever to do so but second in as many years after Calgary running back Jon Cornish in 2019.

article continues below

Joining Burris in the player category are offensive linemen Clyde Brock and Freddie Childress and quarterback Greg Vavra. John Hufnagel, the Calgary Stampeders president/GM, and Larry Uteck (posthumously), the former head coach/athletic director at Saint Mary’s University, were both named as builders.

Burris's family — wife Nicole and sons Armand and Barron — had known of his induction since February but managed to keep quiet about it until about two and a half weeks ago when the Hall of Fame informed Burris. Even then, the Burris clan was very nonchalant in asking the former quarterback to take in what he thought was a run-of-the-mill video.

Instead, Burris watched Hall of Famer Damon Allen (2012) outline his pro football journey to Canada, which drew a rather bewildered look from Burris. Then Allen detailed Burris's stellar CFL career before Mark DeNobile, the Hall of Fame's executive director, delivered the big news.

And the player, affectionately dubbed Smilin' Hank because of his outgoing personality, was lost for words as tears streamed down his face.

""Yeah, they got me good,"" Burris said with a chuckle. ""What's funny is whenever I've told the boys to keep anything quiet, they've always gone back to their mother and yet they didn't say a peep about this.

""I was lost for words just because to hear it shows you that people appreciated the things you did throughout your career. This is the way for the league and all the organizations and the fans saying, 'Thank you,' and for me I'm humbled by it . . . there's so many guys in there (Hall of Fame) who I looked up to and now to be able to join them is a dream come true.""

The six-foot-one, 190-pound Burris, a native of Spiro, Okla., played 20 pro seasons, 18 in the CFL with the Calgary Stampeders (1997-99, 2005-11), Saskatchewan Roughriders (2000, 2003-04), Hamilton Tiger-Cats (2012-13) and Ottawa Redblacks (2014-16). Burris also spent time with the NFL's Green Bay Packers (2001) and Chicago Bears (2002).

Burris appeared in five Grey Cups, winning three (1998, '08, '16) and being named the MVP twice (2008, '16). The CFL's outstanding player on two occasions (2010, 2015), Burris amassed 63,639 passing yards and 373 TD passes — both third all-time.

Burris retired shortly after leading Ottawa to a thrilling 39-33 overtime Grey Cup upset win over Calgary. He threw for 461 yards and three TDs despite suffering a knee injury during warmups.

Burris said his Hall of Fame induction is as much a testament to his family's resilience and perseverance as it is his on-field accomplishments.

""I had to take my wife all over Canada, drag my kids all over Canada and force them to make new friends just for dad to be able to play this game called football,"" said Burris, whose family still calls Ottawa home. ""And for them to understand and see just the emotions that ran through me . . . it just shows how big that moment is, just kind of when your whole life flashes before you.""

Burris and the other inductees will have to wait for their day in the sun due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2020 class will be honoured alongside the 2021 inductees next August.

When Burris is formally honoured, he'll be joined by former teammate Childress and Hufnagel, who served as Calgary's head coach (2008-2015) before moving into the front office full-time. Burris won Grey Cups with both ('98 with Childress, '08 with Hufnagel).

""Calgary is a machine right now and it all started in 2008 when Huf came in and we got that Grey Cup in his first year,"" Burris said. ""Calgary has always had double-digit wins and been in the playoffs each and every year Huf has been there, they've always been a strong contender for the Grey Cup and there's one reason why.""

Hufnagel, a 68-year-old native of Coraopolis, Pa., spent 12 seasons as a CFL quarterback with Calgary (1976-79), Saskatchewan (1980-83, 1987) and Winnipeg (1984-86) before getting into coaching. A five-time Grey Cup champion, Hufnagel also earned a Super Bowl ring as an assistant with the New England Patriots (2003).

Hufnagel amassed a 102-42-1 record as Calgary's head coach, his .712 win percentage being the highest among coaches with more than 100 games. He's been named the CFL's coach of the year twice (2008, 2014).

Childress, a 53-year-old native of Little Rock, Ark., played 13 CFL seasons with Shreveport (1994), Birmingham (1995), Calgary (1996-03) and Saskatchewan (2004-06). A former second-round pick of the NFL's New England Patriots, Childress won two Grey Cups with the Stampeders (1998, 2001) and in 1998 was named the CFL's top offensive lineman.

Brock, 79, of Los Angeles, played 12 seasons with Saskatchewan (1964-75), helping the club win its first Grey Cup in 1966. The former Dallas Cowboy-San Francisco 49er appeared in 169 regular-season CFL games and four times was named a league all-star before being inducted into Saskatchewan's Plaza of Honour in 1995.

Vavra, 59, of Red Deer, Alta., helped the Calgary Dinos win the Vanier Cup in 1983, his final season at the school. That year, he also became the first player in the program's history to capture the Hec Crighton Trophy as Canadian university football's top player and still holds the U Sports record for most passing yards in a game (627).

Vavra was drafted by the Calgary Stampeders in 1984 and also spent time with the B.C. Lions (1986-87) and Edmonton Eskimos (1988).

After playing seven CFL seasons as a defensive back with Toronto (1974-76), B.C. (1977), Montreal (1978-80) and Ottawa (1980), Uteck became an assistant coach at Saint Mary’s University in 1982. He was promoted to head coach the following year, a position he held until 1997.

Over that span, Uteck was named the Atlantic University Athletic Association coach of the year five times and twice Canadian university football's top coach.

Uteck served as athletic director from 1995 to 2002 and the Huskies captured two Vanier Cups (2001-02). The native of Thornhill, Ont., passed away Dec. 25, 2002 of Lou Gehrig's disease at the age of 50.

The Atlantic Bowl was renamed the Uteck Bowl in 2003.

Columbus announced Thursday that it has named McMillan vice-president, soccer administration and operations.

McMillan stepped down as Toronto's senior director of administration and operations in March. So did husband Corey Wray, who was Toronto's assistant GM, team operations and strategy. Toronto did not announce the departures at the time.

The latest move reunites McMillan with Columbus president and GM Tim Bezbatchenko, who stepped down as Toronto's senior vice-president of soccer operations and GM in January 2019 to join his hometown club in Ohio.

""We are thrilled to welcome Jaime McMillan to the club,"" Bezbatchenko said in a statement. ""Jaime played a critical role in the front office, simultaneously managing and executing high-level projects during her time with Toronto FC as it became a perennial MLS Cup contender, and I know she will be a great asset to the Crew as we continue to grow our ambitions and elevate the club in this new era.""

McMillan will oversee Columbus' administration and management in non-technical areas, including soccer operations administration, facilities and budgeting.

The Crew said her role ""will also include a focus on player and staff administration, academy administration and other club support areas.""

Toronto enjoys a reputation as one of MLS' best teams at helping players settle off the field, with McMillan leading the way.

McMillan joined Toronto in 2010 as co-ordinator for business operations. She went on to become senior manager of team development (2013-15), director of team development (2015-16) and director of administrations and operations (2016-18) before taking on the role of senior director of administration and operations.

Toronto won one MLS Cup (2017), one Supporters' Shield (2017) and six Canadian Championships (2010, 2011, 2012, 2016, 2007, 2018) during McMillan's tenure.

""Regrettably for the Wolfpack the challenges around travel, international border protocols and the hosting of public events in Toronto have proved too significant for the team to be able to host games at Lamport Stadium this season,"" Toronto CEO and chairman Bob Hunter said in an open letter to fans.

""This is not a decision that has been taken lightly, and we vow to return to Toronto bigger and better than ever before in 2021.""

Toronto has not played at home since Oct. 5, 2019, when it won promotion to the Super League with a 24-6 victory over Featherstone Rovers in the Million Pound Game before an announced sellout crowd of 9,974 – a Wolfpack record — at Lamport Stadium.

Rubbing salt in the wound, Toronto fans also woke up to the news Thursday that winger Liam Kay, the team's all-time leading scorer and first-ever player signing, had left to join Wakefield Trinity.

The Wolfpack, 0-6-0 in their first season in the top-tier Super League, have not played since March 11, when they blanked Huddersfield 18-0 in the fifth round of the Challenge Cup. Play was suspended five days later.

Super League features 12 teams — 10 in England, one in France and the Wolfpack.

Play resumes Aug. 2 in England with Toronto playing Hull Kingston Rovers as part of a tripleheader at Leeds Rhinos' Emerald Headingley Stadium. The rest of August sees weekend tripleheaders played over two days behind closed doors — initially at Headingley and St Helens' Totally Wicked Stadium.

""Today's fixtures announcement finally brings the 2020 season back to life,"" Super League executive chairman Robert Elstone said in a statement.

The schedule grows more crowded near the end of the season with Toronto playing its final six games over three weeks.

That's a concern given the physical nature of the sport. It's more of a worry for Toronto, which has a small squad and is facing a looming visa issue involving New Zealand star Sonny Bill Williams and six other imports.

Australia's Josh McCrone, Darcy Lussick and Blake Wallace, Australian-born Samoan international Ricky Leutele and New Zealand's Williams, Chase Stanley and Bodene Thompson have visas that allow for six months in England over a year.

That's not a problem when the Wolfpack are spending part of the season in Canada. But the global pandemic has kept the players in England and the visas are slated to expire at the end of the month.

Because the Wolfpack are Canadian-owned, they require different visas than overseas players employed by English clubs.

Super League said it will review dates and venues ""in the back end of the campaign ... in line with government advice and in discussion with our host broadcaster, Sky Sports.""

The hope is the teams can eventually host games with fans in their home market — with the exception of Toronto.

The playoffs, featuring the top four in the 12-team league, are scheduled for mid/late-November with the Grand Final scheduled for the end of November.

The championship game was originally slated for Oct. 10.

Super League said clubs will be back in training by the end of next week.

Under the original 2020 schedule, nine of Toronto's first 10 games were to be played in England with the other in France — with the late start due to the Canadian winter and the bubble over Lamport Stadium yet to come down. The Wolfpack were to play 11 of their last 19 games at home, with the season wrapping up Sept. 11.

Three other home games were to be played at neutral sites in England.

The Irish international is also one of only five players left from Toronto's inaugural 2017 squad to have taken part in the Wolfpack's rise from the third-tier League 1 to the elite Super League.

article continues below

With the Super League season set to resume Aug. 2 after a pandemic hiatus, Kay joins Wakefield initially on a loan agreement through the end of the season. He has signed a two-year deal covering the 2021 and 2022 campaigns.

Toronto has faced a salary cap crunch in recent times and is currently dealing with a visa issue that could leave New Zealand star Sonny Bill Williams and six other imports on the sidelines when the team resumes play next month in England.

Assigned the Wolfpack's heritage jersey No. 1 with the club, Kay is a pacey winger with a nose for the try-line. He scored 65 tries for Toronto, upping his career total to 159.

""While the fans will remember Liam for his incredible strike rate for games played and tries scored, everyone inside the Wolfpack bubble will also remember his commitment to the cause for the first-ever transatlantic professional sports team,"" Toronto coach Brian McDermott said in a statement.

""We all wish Liam well, and I'm sure I speak for everyone in expressing our gratitude to his efforts over the last four years.""

The move to Wakefield takes the 28-year-old Kay back to where he began his career in 2012. Kay has made more than 150 career appearances for Wakefield, Doncaster (on loan), Leigh Centurions and Toronto.

He was signed by Paul Rowley, Toronto's first coach, who had worked with him at Leigh.

Speaking in 2017, Kay said he committed to Toronto because Rowley ""sold this dream to me."" Several other former Leigh teammates also signed on.

""We kind of jumped into the unknown, when I didn't know what it was,"" said Kay, a native of Leeds. ""I have no regrets. I'm glad I did it.""

Kay made his mark in plenty of games.

He scored in the club's first-ever fixture, a 2017 pre-season friendly against Hull FC. He added two more tries in the Wolfpack's opening 2017 League 1 match against the London Skolars.

And he helped the Wolfpack earn promotion to the second-tier Championship by scoring in five of seven post-season fixtures in 2017.

Kay scored 27 tries that year, which remains a club record. Fellow winger Matty Russell tied the mark in 2019.

Kay opened the 2018 season with a three-try performance against Leigh before a left ankle injury ended his season prematurely. He was involved in a tackle in a game against Halifax when his studs caught in the mud and his ankle rolled the wrong way.

After the ankle did not respond to rehab, he had to undergo surgery that delayed his start to the 2019 campaign. He still finished with 12 tries, helping the team win promotion to the Super League.

This season, he wasted little time scoring Toronto's first-ever try in the top tier — chasing down a Hakim Miloudi kick to touch down in the corner three minutes into Toronto's opening game against Castleford.

Easy to spot with long locks that often did not stay totally in place during games, Kay was a fan favourite.

""I would just like to thank all the fans for your loyal commitment over the last four years, that's including Wolfpack fans in the U.K. and of course the ones in Canada,"" Kay said in a statement. ""It has been a privilege to represent you and I have cherished every moment of it.""

And while so much has happened in the intervening period, thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic cancelling live performances and festivals in the Tri-Cities, the iconic Coquitlam theatre and arts centre is once again looking at how it will move forward.

Thanks to theatre patrons who donated back money from cancelled shows and subscriptions, the possibility that some live and educational programming could continue is definitely being considered.

“The amount of support we have received from our patrons is heart-warming to say the least,” said executive director Philip Hartwick.

While the 2020/21 performing arts season will not be moving forward, there may be a selection of intimate performances for smaller audiences as well as online programming via social media.

Since closing to the public on March 17, Evergreen has had to cancel the remainder of its 2019-2020 season, and further postpone the planned 2020- 2021 season to the following year.

The shut down could have meant curtains for the theatre, but revenue losses were kept to only about 50% thanks to a combination of donations, account credits and gift certificates.

As much as 45% of ticket purchasers whose events were cancelled donated the cost of their tickets or retained a credit instead of requesting a refund and 77% of early season subscribers for the 2020-21 season returned the cost if their subscriptions as donations and credits to the theatre.

The art gallery, meanwhile, is open with an exhibit called Trace by Gwenessa Lam and Hyung-Min Yoon. Visitors can also take a tour along the Evergreen’s exterior lobby windows to see In Possible Lands by Annie Briard. Both installations will be available until Aug. 1.

That’s because it’s all parts.

article continues below

Fera and the 21 young thespians in his charge were already blocking scenes from the WWI comedy musical when the COVID-19 pandemic shut rehearsals down and put CYT’s year-end presentation at Port Moody’s Inlet Theatre in peril. But after three days of dreading the worst, the director and the 20 members of the troupe who elected to stick with it pivoted to tackle the challenge of presenting the play online.

At a sprawling two-and-a-half hours and with each cast member playing a multitude of characters, it was a big ask.

Monologues was the answer.

Fera, his production team, and the student-actors, who range in age from 10 to 17, whittled Joan Littlewood’s original story to 80 minutes, then pared it some more to come in at a more reasonable 50 minutes which was then divided into 20 five-minute increments. Each of those segments represented a monologue that would be adapted from a scene or several scenes in the play and then recorded by the actors in their homes to be edited together into the final presentation that premieres on YouTube on Friday.

Lara Chamberlain, 14, said she had some doubts at first. But as the young actors worked with Fera in virtual meetings and texted each other ideas, notes and messages, the creative process took on a life of its own.

“We had to kind of work together with each other, but separately,” Chamberlain said.

Fera said he had to trust his actors.

“I always have a very clear vision,” he said of his directing style. “I had to throw that out and focus on the process.”

As the production, now dubbed Oh, What a Lovely War! 2.0, progressed, that process started to look more like a film shoot than a theatrical play.

“It gave me an appreciation for the theatricality of film acting,” Fera said, adding other members of the team had to adjust their thinking from a stage presentation as well.

Costumes had to be designed using clothes and materials readily available at home, as did sets. And each actor was provided with paper to erect a simple green screen upon which a background could be digitally inserted in post-production.

Chamberlain said she had to learn where and how to position the cell phone she used to record her scene, scout a location in her home with an eye for setting up the green screen as well as have sufficient light available — she settled on a blank wall in her parents’ bedroom.

After perfecting their scenes in online rehearsals and small virtual workshops with Fera, the actors were given a week to record their five-minute monologue and submit it to a Dropbox folder for final editing.

Chamberlain, who plays a soldier pining for his family and better days amidst the mud and horror of a trench, said it took her two takes to nail her monologue, which was broken into three parts to allow for different camera angles.

Fera said the intimacy of each performance has allowed him to focus on the details of his actors’ craft, something he figures he’ll be able to carry forward to future theatrical endeavours.

“Sometimes we lose sight of the craft of acting when we’re trying to put on a big show,” he said.

Chamberlain said the individual feedback she received as she worked on her part will also serve her well.

“Ensemble acting is fun, but now that it’s all been stripped down, it was a really cool experience,” she said.

• Oh, What a Lovely War! 2.0 premieres at 6 p.m. on Place des Arts’ YouTube channel. Afterward, Fera will answer questions about the production on Facebook. The presentation is free, but donations to support Place des Arts’ youth programming are being accepted.",[]

That’s because Joel Salaysay filmed Home Cooking entirely in the kitchen of his mom’s home in Coquitlam as he joined her and his grandmother in preparing an old family recipe for bak chang, a kind of sticky rice dumpling stuffed with chicken and mushrooms.

article continues below

The 16-minute end result is featured in the Shorts Program: BC Voices at the DOXA documentary film festival that runs online from June 18 to 26.

The film isn’t Salaysay’s pitch for his own gig on The Food Network.

Rather, he said, it was an opportunity to connect with his own Chinese-Filipino heritage as the trio exchanged stories while they cooked over the course of three weekends of filming last year.

Salaysay, who was born and raised in Canada, said he learned a lot about the relationship between the two women and the challenges they faced as immigrants from Singapore, where gender roles can be quite traditional. He said the act of cooking together fed the discussion and distracted everyone from the artificiality of sharing their story to a camera.

“When you cook at home, it takes time, it takes teamwork,” Salaysay said. “You have an activity you can do together.”

Salaysay said he got the idea of using the kitchen as a backdrop because of his own journey into his wife’s heritage through cooking Italian dishes she grew up with. In fact, during filming he explored that aspect of his story as well, but it was left on the cutting room floor.

Salaysay, 30, said the importance of food as a social connector has been an ongoing presence in his life, from plying his childhood friends with Asian treats when they came over to his house, to toiling in kitchens part-time as he studied film at Simon Fraser University. But it wasn’t until recently he really developed an appreciation for its aspects beyond sating just his physical hunger.

“The only thing that really connected me to my heritage was the cuisine,” he said.

And with the self-isolation of the past few months brought on to limit the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, Salaysay anticipates his film will take on a particular poignancy.

“I think it takes on a different context now,” he said. “There’s now more time to explore recipes, but what is missing is the communal family component.”

But take-out theatre?

A play by Port Moody playwright and actor Hiro Kanagawa is one of four scripts that comprise Plays2Perform@Home, a box set of intimate productions commissioned by Vancouver theatre company Boca del Lupo.

The 10 to 20-minute plays are meant to be performed by the recipients, in their home, around the dinner table or even a campfire, their audience mostly each other or a few people already in their pandemic “bubble.”

Kanagawa, who lives in Eagle Point with his wife and two children, said his contribution, entitled Negotiations, is a piece of “meta theatre” that acknowledges it’s a script written by a playwright, and the characters recognize they are characters in a play speaking lines composed for them. He said it was an obvious creative choice to make as most of the people performing it will likely be amateurs.

“I think by acknowledging the artificiality of the situation, we can actually talk about what we’re missing when we don’t have live theatre,” Kanagawa told The Tri-City News.

Innovation is not unusual for the award-winning playwright, whose script Indian Arm — an adaptation of a Henrik Ibsen novel — was recognized with a Jessie Richardson theatre award in 2015 as well as a Governor General’s literary award for English-language drama two years later.

He’s also contributed to Boca del Lupo’s production of Red Phone, that takes place in two fully-enclosed phone booths where audience members participate in a five-minute scripted conversation. It’s a socially-distanced way of performing a play with a live audience and it’s being presented on Granville Island July 1 to Aug. 22. For tickets, go to Eventbrite.

Kanagawa said his ability to think beyond the parameters of a traditional stage comes from his varied career that started as a sculptor and stretched to acting roles in film, television, animation and even a video game.

“I’ve had my finger in a lot of different pies,” he said. “If I have an idea, I can decide that may not be a play, it could be a short story, or an essay or a haiku.”

Kanagawa said it took him about two weeks to write Negotiations. And while the play isn’t about the current public health crisis, it was certainly an influence as it addresses the sense of existential limbo many people are feeling as we wait for the pandemic to subside and a form of normalcy to resume. He said it’s not unlike the uncertainty of losing electricity to your home or your internet connection.

Kanagawa said the excitement of pushing the boundaries of traditional theatre is heightened by the mystery and uniqueness of each performance, none of which he’ll likely see unless someone decides to present it over the Zoom virtual meeting platform and invites him in.

“You don’t really know how it’s going to turn out,” he said.

It’s easy to understand why — it’s crispy on the outside, juicy in the middle and served with a flavourful sauce (or two).

It’s essentially a breaded chicken cutlet that could be sliced and served with side dishes. But in recent years, it’s also become a very popular thing to stuff into a sandwich, what I did in today’s recipe.

article continues below

To make my sandwiches, large, boneless, skinless chicken thighs are pounded until fairly thin. They are coated in flour, dipped into a beaten egg mixture, then thickly coated with panko, coarse Japanese-style breadcrumbs.

In restaurants, the chicken katsu is often deep-fried once coated. But in my recipe, I opted to shallow-fry it in oil in a skillet until golden, crispy and cooked through.

Many recipes for chicken katsu sandwiches ask you to use a soft style of sliced white bread — something you can easily bite through to get to the flavourful chicken inside.

I instead chose to use a tender hamburger bun, which I find yields a more attractive-looking sandwich.

That said, you likely wouldn’t be looking at the sandwich long before devouring it. That’s because the chicken is flavoured with two addictive sauces. One is a fresh ginger-flavoured mayo that you spread on the cut sides of the buns.

The other is tonkatsu sauce, a kind of Japanese-style barbecue sauce that you drizzle on the chicken. You can buy that sauce at Japanese food stores and in the Asian-foods aisle of some grocery stores, but I made my own simple version.

You can coat the chicken and make the sauces many hours before cooking the chicken and making the sandwiches. Keep everything refrigerated until needed. You could also do the same with the cucumber and radish quick pickles I served with the sandwiches.

Chicken Katsu Sandwiches

Japanese-style chicken that’s crunchy on the outside and juicy in the middle stuffed into buns with two flavourful sauces and refreshing lettuce. The panko needed for the chicken is sold in grocery stores, often in the Asian-foods aisle.

Preparation time: 40 minutes

Cooking time: Six minutes

Makes: Four servings

For ginger mayo (see Eric’s options)

1/2 cup mayonnaise

1 tsp finely grated fresh ginger

2 tsp soy sauce

2 tsp rice or cider vinegar

1 tsp granulated sugar or honey, or to taste

1/2 tsp sesame oil

Combine ingredients in a small bowl. Cover and refrigerate until needed.

For tonkatsu sauce

3 Tbsp ketchup

1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce

1 tsp soy sauce

1/2 tsp granulated sugar or honey

Combine ingredients in a small bowl (see Eric’s options). Cover and refrigerate until needed.

For chicken katsu sandwiches

4 large boneless, skinless chicken thighs (about 325 to 350 grams)

• salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

2 large eggs

1/4 cup milk

1/3 cup all-purpose flour

1 3/4 cups panko

• vegetable oil, for frying

4 tender hamburger buns, split and warmed

1 cup shredded head or leaf lettuce, or to taste

Set a chicken thigh flat on a work surface, smooth-side-down. Cover with a double layer of plastic wrap. Using a kitchen hammer, pound chicken until it’s about 1/4-inch thick, then set on a plate (see Eric’s options). Pound the other chicken thighs this way. Season the chicken with salt and pepper.

Place eggs and milk in a bowl large enough to dunk the chicken in and beat to combine. Place flour and panko in separate wide plates. Set out a baking sheet to set the chicken on once coated.

Coat one chicken thigh in flour. Dip it in the egg mixture, evenly coating it. Coat chicken in panko, thickly pressing it on. Set coated chicken on the baking sheet. Coat the remaining chicken thighs in this fashion.

Preheat oven to 225 F. Set out a second large baking sheet. Pour 1/4 inch or so of oil into a large skillet set over medium, medium-high heat.

When oil is hot, add two of the chicken katsu to the skillet and cook about three minutes per side, until golden and cooked through. (Keep a close eye on the chicken and lower the heat if it overly darkens as it cooks.)

Drain chicken katsu on paper towel, then set on the second clean baking sheet.

Cook the other two chicken katsu as you did the first two and set them on the baking sheet. Put chicken into the oven to keep warm.

Spread the cut sides of each bun generously with the ginger mayo. Top each bottom bun with some shredded lettuce.

Remove chicken katsu from the oven and, at a slight angle, cut each one, widthwise, in half. Now set two half pieces of chicken katsu on each bottom bun. Drizzle chicken katsu with the tonkatsu sauce. Set on top buns and serve.

Eric’s options: For spicy tonkatsu sauce, add sriracha or other spicy chili sauce, to taste.

If you don’t have a kitchen hammer, try using the bottom of a heavy skillet or rolling pin to pound the chicken thighs.

Cucumber and Radish Quick Pickles

Easy and quick sweet and tangy pickles you can serve with the chicken katsu sandwiches.

Preparation time: 15 minutes, plus salting time

Cooking time: A few minutes

Makes: About 1 1/2 cups

3/4 cup water

3 Tbsp rice or cider vinegar

2 tsp granulated sugar

1 cup thinly sliced radishes (see Note)

1 cup thinly sliced mini English cucumbers

1 tsp salt

Place water, vinegar and sugar in a small pot. Bring to a simmer over medium heat for 30 seconds, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Remove from the heat and cool vinegar mixture to room temperature.

Meanwhile, place radishes and cucumber in a fine sieve. Sprinkle with the salt and toss to coat the vegetables. Set sieve over a bowl or sink and let stand at room temperature 30 minutes.

When the 30 minutes are up, rinse the vegetables with cold water, drain well, then pat dry with paper towel. Place the vegetables in a two-cup jar. Pour in the vinegar mixture. Push on the vegetables to submerge them. Cover and refrigerate pickle until ready to serve with the chicken katsu sandwiches.

Note: About two mini cucumbers and 10 radishes, depending on size, should yield the amounts needed here.

Halibut, salmon, albacore tuna, ling cod, crab, sablefish, oysters, clams and mussels are just some of the tasty choices we have and there’s much to celebrate about that.

But for many seafood lovers in this province, the party hits its peak when spot prawns are in season. This year’s fishery began in early June and according to Mike Atkins, Executive Director of Pacific Prawn Fishermen’s Association, will likely last four to six weeks.

article continues below

Although you can buy good quality frozen spot prawns year round, they really are at their best when ultra fresh. They have sweet tasting, almost buttery, succulent meat and part of their allure is that they are only available for a few weeks each year. So when you do have them you really appreciate their fine flavour and recognize what a treat they are.

Despite their name, spot prawns are the largest of the shrimp species commercially harvested off the B.C. coast. They are named after the distinctive white spots you’ll find on their tails.

You are most likely to find spot prawns for sale at stand-alone seafood stores and, occasionally, at some supermarkets, depending on availability. In some coastal locations you can also buy them direct from the fisher.

Depending on where you buy them, you’ll see fresh spot prawn tails with their heads removed, and whole live or recently live spot prawns for sale.

When buying spot prawn tails, choose bright-looking, firm tails that have few or no black spots and smell of the sea. It’s best to cook fresh spot-prawn tails the day you purchase them. But, if they are very fresh and you keep them well chilled on a bed of ice in the refrigerator, you could store them for one day or maybe two.

According to information on the Pacific Prawn Fishermen’s Association website, bcprawns.ca, when buying live spot prawns, look for lively, almost translucent specimens. The tail should be straight in line with the head, and the head should be firm to the touch.

When going out to buy live prawns, bring a cooler with ice in it to put them in for the ride home. Once home, refrigerate them until ready to cook.

Don’t leave live or recently live prawns for more than a few hours before cooking them or removing the heads. Spot prawns have an enzyme that will permeate into the tail and causes their quality to deteriorate quickly. You’ll know the prawns have started to deteriorate if the head is showing a black colour and is soft or mushy when touched, an unappealing quality the meat will also have.

If you need to store the prawns for more than a few hours, you can remove the heads by swiftly turning and pulling them away from the tails. After the heads are removed, the tails should be thoroughly rinsed and, as noted above, kept refrigerated until ready to cook.

Spot prawns can be prepared in ways similar to other large shrimp and prawns. I used them in an aromatic, colourful and tasty Cajun-style sheet pan dinner for two.

Spot Prawn Sheet Pan Dinner for Two

Here’s a nicely spiced, peel-and-eat, Cajun-style way to prepare B.C. spot prawns that sees them cooked on a sheet pan with bits of sausage, potatoes, onions and peppers. For a filling meal, serve with cornbread or corn on the cob.

Preparation time: 25 minutes

Cooking time: 23 to 27 minutes

Makes: two servings

8 to 10 B.C. nugget potatoes, halved

3 Tbsp olive oil

2 Tbsp lemon juice

1 large garlic clove, minced

1 1/2 tsp paprika

1 1/2 tsp oregano

1/2 tsp dried thyme

• freshly ground black pepper, to taste

1 tsp hot pepper sauce, such as Tabasco, or to taste

14 to 16 whole live spot prawns, or spot prawn tails (see Eric’s options)

1 cured (about 5-inch long) chorizo or other tasty sausage, sliced (see Note)

1/2 medium onion, sliced

1/2 medium red bell pepper, sliced

1/2 medium green bell pepper, sliced

• sea salt, to taste

• chopped fresh parsley, to taste

• lemon slices, for garnish

• remoulade sauce (optional, see recipe)

Boil potatoes until just tender, about eight to 10 minutes. Drain well, set on a large plate and cool to room temperature.

Preheat oven 400 F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper, unless it’s non-stick.

Combine oil, lemon juice, garlic, paprika, oregano, thyme, black pepper and hot pepper sauce in a large bowl. Add prawns, sausage, cooked potatoes, onions and bell peppers and use a spatula to toss and coat them with the oil mixture.

Set prawns, sausage and vegetables on the baking sheet, spreading them out so that they sit in a single layer. Drizzle any oil mixture left in the bowl over them and then sprinkle lightly with salt.

Roast the sheet pan dinner 15 to 17 minutes, or until the prawns are cooked and sizzling. Sprinkle with parsley, garnish with lemon slices and, if desired, serve with remoulade sauce.

Note: Ready-to-eat chorizo sausages are sold at supermarkets, butcher and charcuterie shops and European-style delis.

Eric’s options: The prawns used in today’s recipe came from Oak Bay Seafood (oakbayseafood.com). No matter where you shop, it’s best to call ahead to see if they are stocking spot prawns that day. When spot prawns are not available, simply use another type of wild prawn tail in this recipe.

Remoulade Sauce

Here’s a tangy southern-style sauce that you can dollop alongside the prawns and other items in the sheet pan dinner once plated.

Preparation time: five minutes

Cooking time: None

Makes: about 1/2 cup

1/3 cup mayonnaise

1 Tbsp finely chopped sweet mixed pickles or sweet green relish

2 tsp fresh lemon juice

1 tsp capers, finely chopped

1 tsp Dijon mustard

1 tsp chopped fresh parsley

• pinch dried tarragon and paprika

1/4 tsp hot pepper sauce, such as Tabasco, or to taste

Combine ingredients in a small bowl. Cover and refrigerate until needed for the sheet pan dinner.

""I did not hesitate to come back for my regular exercise sessions. LIVE WELL has always been very clean and sterile, which is very important for me due to my allergies and asthma,"" client Ayla Kilic says.

""Now, the personnel at the clinic are even more careful in maintaining sanitation and cleanliness. The new positioning of exercise equipment maintains social distancing, and the trainers ensure that everybody is following the safety standards. They keep the equipment clean and sterile while providing the best professional and personal care to us. I feel very safe exercising at the clinic, and I appreciate everybody's effort to provide us with this safe venue to exercise"".

LIVE WELL Exercise Clinics has many locations across B.C. and other parts of Canada. Every clinic focuses on providing customized exercise programs for each member to help reach their personal health goals.

""Most of our members will have one health condition or concern,"" says Biffart. ""We work with people with heart disease, obesity, arthritis, and a variety of other ailments and diseases, including those who are recovering from knee and hip replacements.""

LIVE WELL is inviting anyone interested in learning more about its personalized exercise programs to tour a clinic near you by signing up online.

""There's no 'gym-timidation' here,"" Biffart says. ""Most of our members come to us because they want that extra care and attention that we can provide that a big box gym can't. We have a very warm and inviting community-based atmosphere. It's very easy for new people to come in and immediately feel like they're part of things.""

LIVE WELL's staff includes university-educated kinesiologists and clinical exercise physiologists that often work together to help clients meet their goals. When new members come in for an initial consultation, LIVE WELL's staff does a full medical intake and a baseline assessment to determine where they are in their fitness journey. From there, a customized exercise plan is created, including participation in small classes.

""From the very first time I stepped into Live Well, I knew it was going to be amazing. I have never experienced a gym like this and am truly grateful for the opportunity to be a member,"" client Rebecca Donald says.

All workouts are by appointment, and members have set schedules to know ahead of time when to come into the clinic. Roughly hour-long classes with a maximum of 12 people are overseen by two staff members, who provide oversight and coaching throughout the session.

""Members have a constant sense of being guided through their workouts,"" Biffart says. ""Because we cater to people who don't have a background in exercise, we do everything we can to make them feel comfortable and help them work on that confidence. They get a real sense of accomplishment.""

LIVE WELL has also introduced two new online programs for existing members to foster support and access. One is LIVE WELL At Home, an online personalized exercise program that can be accessed through a member portal online. This allows members to log in wherever and whenever to do their exercises. The fitness clinics have also introduced LIVE WELL Live, which will enable members to join via video conferencing to be led through their exercises in a traditional class environment.

""It provides that social aspect of a live instructor,"" Biffart says. ""An important part of what we do is that social aspect and creating community.""

That community is part of the accountability that LIVE WELL creates for its members, partly credited to the same group of people sharing classes week in and week out. Biffart encourages anyone who is curious about the LIVE WELL experience to come in and see the clinic.

""Any concerns, insecurity or fears you have will be cleared up when you come in and see that we don't have that typical gym-feel.""

He’s returned to the charts in 2020, working on songs for rising and established rap stars, including Lil Wayne, Juice WRLD, Saweetie and Doja Cat.

The songmaster, who has been entangled in a bitter lawsuit with former collaborator Kesha since 2014, has produced and co-written Saweetie’s new single ""Tap In,"" the follow-up to her double-platinum smash ""My Type."" Dr. Luke also co-wrote and co-produced Juice WRLD’s ""Wishing Well,"" taken from the rapper’s first posthumous album ""Legends Never Die,"" released last week.

article continues below

The recent successes mean all three major U.S. record label companies have worked with Dr. Luke this year, even if he hasn't always put his widely recognizable professional name to the new collaborations.

Dr. Luke marked a major comeback this year with the success of the Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hit ""Say So"" by rapper-singer Doja Cat, who is signed to Dr. Luke's Kemosabe Records. Dr. Luke, born Lukasz Sebastian Gottwald, produced several songs on Cat’s sophomore album ""Hot Pink,"" including single ""Like That,"" which is No. 5 on Billboard’s Hot R&B songs chart. He is the only producer with two songs in the Top 10 on the latter chart (""Say So"" sits at No. 2).

For his work with Cat, he used the alias Tyson Traxe. He used the same pseudonym for his production credit on Toronto rapper-singer Benny Mayne’s ""Hokey Pokey,"" released this year. For Lil Wayne’s ""Shimmy,"" a track featuring Cat on the deluxe edition of his latest album ""Funeral,"" Dr. Luke used the name Loctor Duke.

Label representatives for Saweetie, Juice WRLD, Lil Wayne and Cat didn’t immediately reply to emails seeking comment. Neither did a representative for Dr. Luke.

Luke has sprinkled his comeback among the major labels. Cat is signed to Sony Music’s RCA Records, while Saweetie is part of the Warner Music family. Lil Wayne releases music through his Young Money imprint and Republic Records, a division of Universal Music Group.

Before Dr. Luke topped the charts this year with ""Say So,"" he last had a No. 1 with Katy Perry's ""Dark Horse"" in 2014. Months later, Kesha accused him of sexual assault during their yearslong partnership (Dr. Luke has vigorously denied the allegations.)

A New York court dismissed Kesha’s sexual abuse-related claims in 2016 because of legal issues, without ruling on whether the allegations were true. Kesha lost another round in February, when a New York judge said she made a defamatory statement about Dr. Luke on a different occasion: a 2016 text message telling Gaga the producer had also raped Perry. Both he and Perry have denied it, and the judge said there was ""no evidence whatsoever"" to support the claim.

Kesha’s lawyers have said they plan to appeal the ruling, but it didn’t resolve other aspects of his defamation and breach-of-contract suit, including the crucial question of whether Kesha’s allegation that he raped her is true. The judge said that’s for a jury to decide at trial.

Outside of rap in 2020, Dr. Luke has produced music for pop singer Kim Petras, using the pseudonym MADE IN CHINA.",[]

Some critics online questioned whether the masked vigilante should be the primary focus after DC announced the sequel ""Rorschach"" on Wednesday. Others have slammed the decision to bring on Batman writer Tom King to write the 12-issue series, which will debut in October.

article continues below

King's approach to the Dark Knight's comic book story line he's written has been divisive. With ""Rorschach,"" he said the new series will take a compelling look at politics similar to that of HBO’s ""Watchmen"" and the original comic in 1986. The comic will also be worked on by artist Jorge Fornés, colorist Dave Stewart and letterer Clayton Cowles.

The HBO series earned acclaim for delivering a story about race relations in America. But some are concerned about whether the story about the anti-hero Rorschach, who wears a trenchcoat, fedora and white mask with morphing inkblots, will be as relevant today.

King believes it will be.

""This is a very political work."" he said in a statement. ""It’s an angry work. We’re so angry all the time now. We have to do something with that anger. It’s called ‘Rorschach’ not because of the character Rorschach, but because what you see in these characters tells you more about yourself than about them.""

The sequel is set 35 years after the ""Watchmen"" comic series when Dr. Manhattan turned Rorschach into dust.

A plot summary released on DC's website asks: ""So what does it mean when Rorschach reappears as part of a pair of assassins trying to kill the first candidate to oppose President Robert Redford in decades? Follow one determined detective as he walks backward in time, uncovering the identities and motives of the would-be killers, taking him deep into a dark conspiracy of alien invasions, disgraced do-gooders, mystical visions, and yes, comic books.""",[]

But confusion remains over whether he's actually running.

A representative for West filed the necessary paperwork and paid the $35,000 filing Wednesday afternoon, which was the deadline for a spot on the state's Nov. 3 presidential ballot, said Oklahoma Board of Elections spokeswoman Misha Mohr. He was one of three independent presidential candidates to pay the filing fee prior to the deadline, she added. The others were concert pianist Jade Simmons and cryptocurrency entrepreneur Brock Pierce.

The filing came a day after New York Magazine's ""Intelligencer"" quoted West adviser Steve Kramer saying ""he's out"" and noting that the staff he had hired were disappointed.

However, TMZ reported that the West campaign had filed a ""Statement of Organization"" Wednesday with the Federal Election Commission, stating that a Kanye 2020 committee would serve as principal campaign committee for a West candidacy.

West has already missed the deadline to qualify for the ballot in several states, and it’s unclear if he is willing or able to collect enough signatures required to qualify in others.

West, who is married to reality television star Kim Kardashian West, initially announced his candidacy on July 4. Days later, he told Forbes magazine that he, who once praised President Donald Trump and said the two share ""dragon energy,"" was ""taking the red hat off"" — a reference to Trump’s trademark red ""Make America Great Again"" cap.

West, who said that he had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, told the magazine that he planned to model his White House on the fictional land in ""Black Panther"" if he won the presidency, adding ""Let’s get back to Wakanda.""",[]

Re. “Coquitlam has too much parking near SkyTrain stations, says city staff” (Tri-City News, July 10)

article continues below

The apparent drop in demand for parking in high density developments is largely the result of a flawed economic model rather than any change in people’s habits.

For most types of residences, parking is an integral part of your purchase. In the case of apartments or condominiums, the purchase or rental of a parking space can be optional. It is not surprising that many purchasers, given the option, choose to forego purchasing a space and opt to use publicly funded on-street parking instead.

As the city continues to profit by selling ever higher densities in transit served neighbourhoods the cost of providing parking is increasing as more parking spaces must be provided on a smaller footprint. The resulting increase in cost means that fewer purchasers opt to buy a space. It is a self perpetuating cycle.

If the sale of a parking space with a unit was mandatory you would see far more vehicles parked in the facilities provided for that purpose and fewer clogging the surrounding streets.

Re. “Coquitlam has too much parking near SkyTrain stations, says city staff” (Tri-City News, July 10)

article continues below

The idea that too much parking near public transit is an issue has no relevance to anyone but developers hoping to cut costs. In fact, the opposite is true, there should be much more available parking near public transport to encourage as many people as possible to either leave their cars at home, or not to take their vehicles downtown.

What happened to the thought that we could try to improve our world? Has it been abandoned so a developer can make a profit of an additional .0005%?

Tourism Coquitlam has plenty of ideas that its new catch-phrase describes perfectly - Fun Is In Our Nature.

article continues below

It’s the gateway description to a newly launched website that contains a complete lineup of places and activities to enjoy.

“It’s an in-depth view of what there is to see and do,” said Eric Kalnins, the City’s Tourism Manager. “Whether it’s a staycation for Coquitlam residents or a daytrip from another part of the Lower Mainland, we want people to explore our community.”

And there’s not only so much to do, but a great variety of experiences to enjoy. For example, maybe it’s a hike on the Coquitlam Crunch, a heart pumping outdoor stair-climb trail with a net elevation of 242 metres leading to Westwood Plateau.

Perhaps grab your binoculars or camera and head for Colony Farm Regional Park at the southern end of the city, which is known as one of the best destinations for birdwatching in Metro Vancouver.

Or go down to Town Centre Park for one of the several colourful festivals and sports tournaments just steps from the SkyTrain and walking distance from an array of businesses and fine restaurants.

“It’s our biggest signature park where people can fish, play outdoor foosball, table tennis, or take part in Tai Chi,” Kalnins said. “And it’s five minutes from city centre, Coquitlam Centre and SkyTrain that will get you to the other side of Coquitlam.”

“I like to tell people to connect the dots,” Kalnins said, adding many activity destinations in Coquitlam are located close to an array of other services.

For those seeking indoor pursuits and don’t mind getting wet, the City Centre Aquatic Complex has a wave pool, a water slide, a lazy river and an eight-lane, Olympic-sized pool.

And local businesses also provide plenty of activities, such as the Lower Mainland’s largest, indoor climbing facility at Climb Base5 just off United Blvd.

“A lot of people tend to seek many of these types of activities far afield when we have so much right here in Coquitlam,” Kalnins said. “We want people to explore Coquitlam, and explore local.”

Walk-in clinics are an important part of medical care in Canada, but there’s nothing quite like having your own family doctor – one who remembers how your crackly chest sounded last winter, or that your son can’t stand shots.

Dr. Ian Hyams qualified as a doctor more than 20 years ago and until recently was located in West Vancouver. He moved to Port Coquitlam recently to be closer to family, and is now the head of Elicare Hyams Medical Clinic, a brand-new clinic at Fremont Village Shopping Centre.

The clinic will eventually offer walk-in and specialty services, but for now, the emphasis is firmly on family medicine. Dr. Hyams has a special interest in chronic pain management and treatment of fibromyalgia, and will be joined by three other GPs from different specialties and backgrounds.

“Dr. Hyams is looking forward to putting down roots in the Port Coquitlam community and getting to know the people who live here,” says Richard Wang, director of operations for Elicare, which is partnering with the doctor in the new clinic. “He’s known for his caring, genuine approach and his thoroughness – so important in a family doctor, as well as his expertise in helping people deal with chronic pain, which can be such a difficult condition to live with.”

Elicare Hyams Medical Clinic will be reaching out to other clinics and healthcare practitioners in the PoCo area. “We want to be part of the medical community here, getting to know our colleagues and seeing how we can be of service to them,” says Wang. “It’s part of our commitment to creating a strong, healthy community in Port Coquitlam.”

Elicare Hyams Medical Clinic is at 105 Fremont Village Shopping Centre, 1250 Dominion Ave, Port Coquitlam and is open 9am-5pm Monday to Saturday, plus selected Sundays. To find out more, visit Elicare.ca/port-coquitlam, or email info@elicare.ca.",[]

No example is better than the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks in the United States, which gave us the “Patriot Act” after just 45 days of deliberation to expand government surveillance of Americans to previously unimagined levels.

In mid-April, the actions of Gabriel Wortman led to the deaths of 22 people in Nova Scotia after multiple shootings and fires. Most Canadians, at the time still under lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, were horrified at Wortman’s actions, which included impersonating a police officer.

article continues below

It took the federal government only 13 days after Wortman’s criminal activity was evident for the entire country to announce a nationwide ban on 1,500 types of military-grade “assault-style” weapons in Canada. Any Canadian who possesses these firearms will have two years to get rid of them. The prohibition led to many new discussions about the role that firearms play in Canada’s urban and rural areas.

We know now that the perpetrator of the 22 murders in Nova Scotia had obtained his weapons illegally from Canadian and American sources. This was not a surprise for Canadian authorities, who have consistently reported that more than 70% of the weapons used in gun-related crimes in our country come from the United States.

On the issue of firearms, Canada is decidedly different from the United States. In Canada, it is not legal for a person to own or carry a firearm for the purpose of self defence against human beings. When Research Co. and Glacier Media asked Canadians about this key precept of Canadian law, more than three in four (77%) agreed with it, while 18% disagreed and 5% were undecided.

Atlantic Canada (31%), Saskatchewan and Manitoba (29%) and Alberta (24%) boast the highest number of residents who openly question Canada’s long-standing regulations for firearms. While higher than what is observed in Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia, these are not proportions of voters that would sway an election, certainly not in the way American statewide and congressional races can be tilted if your candidate can adequately hold a shotgun and recite the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution in a manner that panders to the base.

Fewer than one in five Canadians welcome the notion of citizens carrying firearms for something other than hunting or scaring wildlife away. Any survey measuring opinions on banning “assault-style” weapons would be met with near unanimity. The opposition reacted to the announced ban as it always has under its outgoing leader, by claiming the regulations would affect law-abiding Canadians. Lost in this unfortunate combination of inadequate polling and incapable opposition are the solutions that matter to Canadians.

In our survey, more than three in five Canadians (63%) told us that gun violence in Canada is a “very serious” or “moderately serious” problem – a proportion that climbs to 69% among women and 68% among those aged 55 and over.

Sizable majorities of Ontarians and British Columbians, who have experienced gang wars in urban areas, are more likely to look at gun violence as particularly problematic (76% and 67%, respectively). The COVID-19 pandemic did little to curb gun violence in Toronto, where 61 people were shot in the first four months of the year.

We asked Canadians about the effectiveness of four possible measures, and their responses outline a public that is ready for bold action. More than three in five Canadians (62%) think enacting a complete ban on handguns would be “very effective” or “moderately effective” in reducing gun violence in Canada. Most crimes, after all, are not being committed with the military-grade “assault-style” weapons that the federal government was quick to ban.

A higher proportion of Canadians deem two other measures as effective: imposing mandatory jail terms for crimes committed with firearms (74%) and introducing new outreach programs to steer youth away from gangs (also 74%).

Canadians place dealing with firearms smuggled from the United States as the most important issue that needs to be addressed. Many of the country’s residents also want to make sure gangs are not attractive to our country’s youth and believe mandatory minimum jail sentences would act as a deterrent.

Banning military-grade “assault-style” weapons is low-hanging fruit in a challenge that definitely has Canadians preoccupied and wishing for a type of government intervention that goes beyond a photo-op celebrated by poorly executed survey charity work.

True sociologists know that we learn nothing from posing the wrong questions to Canadians, and capable politicians should go beyond voicing displeasure with plans and proposals just because that is what they are expected to do. Meanwhile, Canadians are still worried about gun violence and expecting their elected officials to do better. •

Cancer, like other life-threatening diseases, isn’t taking a break for COVID-19. Over 23,000 Canadian men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer this year and 4,200 Canadians will die from it. Prostate cancer represents 20% of all new male cancer cases.

Our Tri-Cities Prostate Cancer Support Group has been meeting at 7 p.m. on the first Tuesday of every month for the past 23 years.

Like many others, when COVID-19 struck, we had to scramble to find new ways to provide support to the men and their partners facing this life-threatening disease.

We knew that we had to find a way to make use of Zoom so that we could continue providing this essential support until we could meet in person again at the IBEW 213 Union Hall at 1424 Broadway Street in Port Coquitlam. We resumed virtual meetings using Zoom on the first Tuesday in May.

Some of the information we offer include presentations from health care professionals, often a urologist or an oncologist. This is followed by discussions where people can ask questions and share experiences.

Since some of our members have very limited experience with computers, we provide them with help to join our meetings.

Speakers at our recent meetings have paid particular attention to the challenges of isolation, depression and accessing services during this pandemic.

Our virtual meetings have been very well-received, including participants from as far away as Arizona and New Brunswick. We are also holding Zoom meetings on the third Tuesday of each month for a less structured opportunity to share common questions and concerns.

Our meetings are open to anyone with questions or concerns about prostate cancer. For more information contact us by email at rasmunds@sfu.ca.

Dear shoppers: While the rules are slowly being relaxed regarding limits on how many people are allowed in a business, don't forget that social distancing still applies.

article continues below

Please check the signage before you enter a business and remember that any business that wants to stay open has to abide by the rules as they are told to, and it is not the sole decision of the individual business owners or employees.

The rules apply to everyone and no businesses are intentionally trying to cause an inconvenience for shoppers. Don't expect the same rules wherever you go; some places count individual customers, some count groups of people up to a certain limit; some count couples as two individuals and some count them as one.

Some businesses request customers to wait outside if they are at capacity, so please have patience with staff and other shoppers; you will be called in. (This is also the procedure at the medical labs if you go for a test.)

Interrupting staff while they are helping someone else only causes a delay for everyone. If you phone a business and they don't pick up right away, phone back in a few minutes rather than right away.

Lastly, put enough money in the parking meter because you never know if you will encounter an unexpected delay; give yourself time to have a good shopping experience.

The current session of the B.C. legislature is exhibit A in support of that thesis.

article continues below

The legislative chamber is often so empty, I half expect to start hearing echoes when I watch the proceedings on Hansard television. In order to enforce physical distancing, there can only be a maximum of 25 MLAs in the chamber at any one time and that occurs usually only during Question Period three times a week.

Everyone else participates in debates via Zoom chats, with the speaker or the chair calling on individual MLAs who are hunkered down at their office desks whenever it is their turn to speak (and occasionally reminding them to unmute their mic).

In terms of getting work done – passing bills and reviewing ministry spending plans – the new approach has been a success, with few glitches. Kudos to the house leaders, the clerks and Speaker Darryl Plecas for making it work.

However, the lack of human interaction is having a noticeable impact on political discourse - the normal cut and thrust of debate that traditionally frames B.C. politics.

“I’m Zoomed out,” said Dan Davies, the BC Liberal MLA from Peace River, told me last week. “It’s so tiring and you’re just sitting there, talking to a computer all day.”

Government House Leader Mike Farnworth agreed with that assessment and noted energy levels had dropped in this unusual, virtual session.

“You just don’t have the same atmosphere. You don’t pick up on the body language from those across the floor,” he said. “Everyone’s using scripts, there’s not a lot of spontaneity and you can’t get a read on anyone.”

BC Liberal MLA Jas Johal – Richmond-Queensborough - said the current Question Period bears no resemblance to pre-pandemic ones.

“Personally, I would much rather see the whites of a minister’s eyes when I’m challenging them,” he told me. “Video will never replace that.”

The public gallery seats are empty as the legislature building remains closed. The hallways are quiet.

Even press gallery members remain out of sight in the Speaker’s Corridor or the press theatre, where the news conferences and ministerial and opposition availabilities occur. Reporters are hooked up via a phone line and a pool TV camera operator records the proceedings.

A challenge facing every legislative body right now is appearing relevant in a pandemic that shattered the world economy, led to millions of people being out of work and continues to pose a dangerous health threat.

The B.C. legislature is not immune from that challenge. Politicians have to take care not to appear to be politicians in the traditional sense.

This is a particularly difficult issue for opposition parties to address. The BC Liberals have to walk a fine line between raising issues of legitimate importance and others that might have been raised in the past, but now seem rather pointless.

And they now have to walk that line in a virtual world, which allows for political debate to occur, but only in a dull, emotionless process.

As we slowly adapt to the pandemic, we will find our “new normal” in all kinds of places. Eventually, we will find it in B.C. politics as well and that is when the liveliness will return.

We have seen how the Trudeau government has been doling out billions of taxpayer's money, however, has seen fit to provide only $300 tax free to seniors who currently receive Old Age Security and Canada Pension Plan. This is a one time payment!

Seniors are those Canadians who have suffered through World Wars and the Great Depression. They have survived by hard work and savings for their retirement. Their savings and investments have been severely affected by COVID-19 and now they are subject to reduced income from investments and possibly faced with selling their residences during a real estate downturn.

Seniors count and are important to Canada, having contributed significantly to the growth of the economy and values of freedom, diversity and equality for all. It is now time for the Trudeau government to come to the table and top up pensions for seniors for an appropriate monthly amount under various COVID-19 programs.

The old adage “damned if you do, damned if you don’t” comes to mind when discussing the current ‘hostage’ situation involving China’s Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou and Canada’s Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.

article continues below

Kovrig and Spavor have been detained in China since 2018, and their release is increasingly improbable given Beijing’s ruling to indict them on the alleged crime of espionage, with little evidence to suggest that they are, indeed, culpable. The more likely evidence-based explanation for their detainment is that Beijing is playing politics and engaging in hostage negotiations to get Wanzhou back.

On the one side of the debate, we have 19 prominent Canadians, including former parliamentarians and senior diplomats, calling on the Canadian Minister of Justice to end the extradition proceeding against Wanzhou to secure the release of the two Michaels. On the other hand, we have 30 Canadian defence and national security experts signed an open letter urging the Prime Minister to stand firm and not to engage in hostage diplomacy. It is truly a modern-day case of Homeric proportions, with the Canadian government being caught between Scylla and Charybdis.

Many Canadians concur with the Prime Minister that it would be disastrous to engage in hostage diplomacy with China, arguing that the best response is to levy sanctions against the Chinese Communist Party officials using the Sergei Magnitsky Law. Undoubtedly, it is an arduous decision with both sides expressing valid points and, ultimately, everyone empathizes with the two Michaels and their families.

It appears that Canada is experiencing a moral crisis of what to do, and a simple solution does not seem likely. What is required to fix this issue is a hard and earnest look at Canada’s relationship with China. Increasing globalization and trade relationships with China have not brought forth the democratic reforms our politicians and business leaders had hoped. It is exceedingly unlikely that China will miraculously abide by international law concerning human rights while under an autocratic, totalitarian regime.

One thing seems abundantly clear – many Canadian politicians have been reticent to criticize China. The pursuit of trade agreements and corporate profits supersede truth, justice, and human rights. And now, it has come back to bite us squarely in the backside. Perhaps it is time for the Canadian government to admit that reforms are not happening in China despite the signing of a free trade agreement and to look for trade partners elsewhere. The opportunities for new trade partners are limitless; we just have to be willing to admit that China is not going to change and work through some growing pains for a better, safer, and more just future.

Police Act review handcuffed right from the start,['Chris Campbell'],,"I hated having to use “handcuffed” in this blog’s headline, but it seemed a fitted word to what’s going on with the review of the B.C. Police Act.

Right from the start, the review has been tainted some of the people chosen to review the Police Act.

article continues below

In a statement announcing the creation of the committee doing the review, Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General, said that the Police Act is “out of step with our government’s approach our work with police services on important issues including harm reduction and mental health.”

“Everyone deserves to be treated fairly by the police, and our government acknowledges that for many Black, Indigenous and other people of colour, that hasn’t always been the case,” Farnworth said in an email to Glacier Media. “Ensuring the police are held accountable to the highest standards for fair and unbiased conduct is crucial to maintaining public trust.”

That sounds good and I’m sure all the intentions are good, but I have some issues with who is on the committee and you should too.

The nine-member committee includes four NDP MLAs, four BC Liberal MLAs and the Green Party’s Adam Olson.

Two of those MLAs are former police officers, Garry Begg (MLA for Surrey-Guildford) who is a former inspector with the RCMP and Mike Morris (MLA for Prince George-MacKenzie), who is a former RCMP superintendent for the North. He also served as solicitor general under the BC Liberals.

And this is the problem.

“Black, Indigenous and other people of colour,” as Farnworth described, have consistently said police, be they RCMP or municipal forces, are rife with systemic racism and out to protect themselves.

So I object to having two former police officers on the committee. What is needed are people from outside of the system taking a fresh look, not two former cops who are tainted by their association with the RCMP. (Read about what the RCMP has done to its female members of the years.)

The committee will be consulting widely with people across the province on policing in order to examine whether the Police Act, created in 1975, needs tweaking, changing or if some parts can be eliminated, committee member Jas Johal, the MLA for Richmond-Queensborough.

Those are the voices we need to listen to, not former members of a police force.

This is the kind of thing that people hate about “reviews” – the devil is always in the details about the scope of a review, the terms of reference and those controlling what happens on the committee.

I am a particular maniac when it comes to B.C.-grown cherries. I must admit I felt a little sticker shock a week or so ago when I saw the cashier ringing in my bag of cherries. She paused, looked me dead in the eye and asked if I really wanted to pay $13-plus for the bag of purple delight. I barely flinched and thanked her for asking but said that yes, I have to have them.

The thing with cherries is that if it rains on the orchard close to maturity, the cherries will spilt and become unmarketable to most consumers. The flavour is still there, of course, but the appeal of a split cherry on the store shelf is woefully low.

article continues below

Some growers will pay $1,000 an hour for helicopters to hover over the orchards after a rain to dry the trees and the fruit preventing a crop failure. This solution can take care of an acre in about five minutes

The other problem with the cherry harvest is the usual pickers are not as available as they were pre-COVID-19. Typically, hundreds of domestic “backpackers” from Quebec would make the trek to the Okanagan this time of year but the pandemic has kept most of them at home. Likewise, migrant workers from Mexico and the Caribbean that usually work the orchards are hamstrung by border access issues despite field workers being classified as an essential service.

Locally we look to be in good shape. A fantastically warm April saw a great start to our field crops and a moist start to summer is promoting growth. When the heat comes, and it will, we will be in good shape to enjoy the bounty grown for us by our local farmers. Remember to buy B.C. to support our farming community.

On a micro-local basis, the Farm Roots field in Boundary Bay is in early summer glory. The small farm is producing some fantastic food. Several hundred Russian Red garlic bulbs are curing in the school and hundreds of pounds of new potatoes have been harvested and make it to the farm stand daily along with super sweet snap peas, turnips, scallions and other early season goodies. The 250-metre walk from field to farm stand make these offerings the freshest around.

The young farmers that I work with are now officially on summer vacation but I see them around all the time. Just this past Tuesday I was greeted by three sets of two students on scooters and bikes while watering their school farm at English Bluff. It was a warm and sunny day and they pleaded with me to spray them with the hose. Farmer Mike happily obliged with enthusiasm. The switch from shower mode to “jet” was appreciated by the kids.

The school district has prepared signage that I will be installing at the school farms to remind us all to maintain social distancing when visiting school farms and community gardens during the pandemic.

Keep your distance and enjoy our local bounty.

Things have certainly changed since the federal election in 2019. I remember politicians visiting my mom’s retirement home in Port Coquitlam, no masks, no physical distancing, lots of handshakes.

That was then, this is now.

My mom’s retirement home in Port Coquitlam is attached to the Legion. When COVID-19 came at us in full force I knew that seniors, especially those in close living and dining quarters, would be at the greatest risk. When the Legion initially stayed open and people were coming and going seemingly unconcerned for the health and well-being of the seniors, I arranged to move my mom out and bring her to live with me.

Now I see that MP Nelly Shin (Con-Port Moody-Coquitlam) has proudly posted a photo of herself, on her own website, smiling, maybe a foot away from a senior, no mask in sight, except the one in her hand (clearly she had plenty if she wanted to put one on), at a local Legion.

It made my heart skip a beat thinking that could be my parent she might be carelessly infecting. To make matters worse, she has been travelling to Ottawa, or at least she was there to attend Parliament this week. I think it is fair to inquire from any MP during this time of essential travel only, how much travel they are in fact doing, especially if they are going to be exposing the community to unnecessary risks.

Well, it's hunting season again! The BC Conservation Officer Service is at it again.

Sadly, there are very, very rare times when an animal must be put down. Very rarely that is for sure.

I'm writing because of this: Part of this above article says ""After checking with his officers, Insp. Smith said there may have been some miscommunication, but that BCCOS officers strive for transparency and don’t lie to residents about operations.""

They may not 'lie' but they tend to express only their truths, and I suspect these truths are most often words straight out of their internal playbooks.

I continue to believe that until the BCCOS is subject to direct third party accountability, their credibility in their actions will remain subject to challenges that they cannot defend.

There is some good news, however. Port Coquitlam city officials have recently announced their intention to enforce their bear aware enforcements. I sincerely hope they are serious in their promise to enforce. I'm so tired — as I'm sure so many others are as well — of reading about our bears being shot or otherwise put down, particularly due to ignorant, selfish people who forget they have a direct responsibility to be bear smart and responsible for their actions.

I would like to see the BCCOS, Port Coquitlam and the Tri-Cities, overall, coordinate and cooperate as one to move forward with a meaningful and effective program to save our bruins.

And as I have advocated in the past, the fines remain too low and need raising. Further, warnings need to be eliminated. People know the rules; warnings are meaningless and generally gain nothing.

I look forward to reading more about the progress and effects of Port Coquitlam’s enforcement program and I sincerely hope that our co-habitation with our bears becomes bear friendly and supporting.

I applaud your decision to protect people, especially when you enter indoor public places. Unless, of course, you’re not wearing that mask properly.

I’ve seen too many people attempt to “wear” a face mask, but then ruin things by doing what the dude in the above photo is doing. (The photo kills me because it’s NBA player Daniel Theis from my beloved Boston Celtics, but what he’s doing is being done right here in Burnaby.)

Too many people are wearing their mask below their nose. Or their mask is only covering their nose and not all of their mouth. Or, in extreme cases, the person just says, f*%$ it, I’m going to just let it hang around my neck. I’ve seen at least two people have the mask loop just hanging off of one ear as they parade around a grocery store.

It’s like they think the mere approximation of the mask to their face – without actually covering the face – is enough to protect themselves and others.

It’s not, of course. I hate to get all preachy, but wearing the mask incorrectly is dangerous and embarrassing to you. People are literally laughing at you behind your back.

Compromises are necessary to ensure safety and stop the spread of COVID-19.

“Make sure your mask is well-fitted over your nose, mouth and chin, and that it is secured to your head with ties or ear loops so that you do not have to adjust frequently,” says Canada’s top public health official, Dr. Theresa Tam. “Try not to touch the mask or your face while wearing the mask, as this is another route of infection. Some people may not realize that masks can become contaminated on the outside. Wash your hands before and after putting on and taking off your mask using soap and water or a Health Canada-approved hand sanitizer. Only you should wear your mask - please do not share it with others.”

232,tricitynews,https://www.tricitynews.com/opinion/opinion-gig-workers-deserve-a-living-wage-not-insecurity-1.24168170,"Opinion: 'Gig' workers deserve a living wage, not insecurity",['Elliot Rossiter'],,"On June 22, New Westminster City Council approved the city’s participation in an inter-municipal business licence for ride-hailing agencies to operate in the region.

While there are some merits to participating in this licence scheme around the integration of transportation options and data collection, I think that a basic condition for ride-hailing agencies such as Uber and Lyft, as well as food-delivery services such as Skip The Dishes and DoorDash, to operate in the Metro Vancouver region should be that workers for these types of companies must be classified as employees and not as independent contractors.

article continues below

These workers must be guaranteed employment rights and paid at least a minimum wage net of vehicle expenses and other incidentals.

There are many reasons why the failure to ensure this basic floor is economically unjust, but the problem of the distribution of economic risk is worth considering in the growth of the gig economy.

One of the broad trends in the economy over the last 50 years or so has been the downloading of risk from the aggregate to the individual in ways that have increased economic insecurity for many people.

In The Great Risk Shift, the political scientist Jacob Hacker describes various aspects in which the downloading of risk has been harmful in society: the decline of defined-benefit pensions has led to more retirement insecurity for individuals, the deregulation of financial institutions has led to various kinds of financial insecurity, and the erosion of collective bargaining and the outsourcing of employment have led to increased insecurities for workers.

The rise of the gig economy increases economic insecurity. It doesn't just merely unlock certain side jobs for people who are already affluent; rather it shifts more economic risk from the employer to the employee, as outsourcing leaves workers with fewer protections and less stability.

I'm not really worried about voluntary contingent arrangements that I would call ""flexible,"" but rather I'm concerned here with involuntary contingent arrangements – situations in which workers want more stability and protection – which would be more appropriately described as ""precarious.""

While outsourcing in the gig economy has undeniably led to increased income inequality – with all of its attendant problems – another important issue to consider is the way in which the gig economy has increased income volatility such that lows in month-to-month income fluctuations have become lower for average workers, and this has seriously harmful effects not just for individual workers but for the community more broadly.

Skip the Dishes photo

To get a more detailed sense of the problems faced by gig workers in Canada, the following two resources are worth consulting: The Tyee’s “Life in the Gig Economy” series outlines the challenges and pressures faced by gig workers; and CPA Canada’s “The Perils of Living Paycheque to Paycheque” explores the serious problem of income volatility in the Canadian context. The economic realities described in these resources should lead us to fight for income security for workers in the gig economy.

A common objection is the ""if you don't like the work conditions, why don't you get another job?"" type of response. But this objection has at least two problems with it.

First, the objection seems to presume that there exists a plentiful supply of secure jobs such that any one individual could reasonably opt out of contingent jobs structured in a model like Uber or DoorDash and move to more secure structures in the economy.

If this were really the case, there wouldn't be as much of a problem here. But the gig economy is something that is growing in scale and we should be deeply concerned about a situation where a large class of workers can't find work outside of precarious gig structures. Thus, it is important to limit and even reverse some of the pernicious elements of the gig economy.

Second, the objection arbitrarily locates responsibility with the worker rather than with the employer. Indeed, one could just as easily say the following to executives and investors at a company like Uber or DoorDash: ""If you don't like ensuring a minimum floor for workers or can’t do it while maintaining a viable level of profitability, then why don't you start a different kind of business where you can do these things?”

A licence to operate a ride-hailing agency or delivery service isn’t a right, but a privilege that should require meeting some basic threshold of ethical and legal standards – ensuring the provision of a minimum wage net of vehicle expenses and other incidentals is one such standard.

I want to conclude by emphasizing that none of this is to disparage the invaluable work done by transportation and delivery workers in our community. Helping someone to ferry groceries home or delivering a meal to someone immunocompromised in the midst of our current moment are examples of things that do our community a great service; thus, the province is right to classify these kinds of work as essential.

But if our praise of these workers is to have substance, it needs to be accompanied by a demand for economic justice.

In fact, I would argue that reciprocal fairness demands that workers who provide for our essential needs should themselves be provided with a living wage sufficient to meet their own essential needs.

While it would certainly be worth exploring how governments and businesses could work together to ensure a living wage for workers, a good place to begin is by ensuring that gig workers are never paid below a minimum wage.

I read Ian Cameron’s commentary — “B.C.’s education system no hotbed of systemic racism,” July 6 — with interest and would like to offer my own perspective as a Chinese-Canadian educator who was born and raised in British Columbia.

My four siblings and I attended school in the Kootenay and the Lower Mainland from the 1970s to the 1990s. Racism was so prevalent at school that we rarely spoke of it to each other, taking it for granted as part of our everyday reality.

Like the furnishings in a room, it was pointless to talk about something that was always there. Only recently, during the modern discourse on “systemic racism,” are we becoming self-aware enough to reflect on our experiences and articulate how it felt to be always treated and viewed as “lesser than.”

In the 1970s and 1980s, popular rhymes in our grade school were blatantly racist. After hearing these ditties chanted for fun in the schoolyard, we repeated them at home, internalizing the racism.

Although bullies occasionally directed racial slurs at us, rarely were people intentionally unkind to us specifically because we were Asian; however, ignorance was rampant.

When a new student from China moved to town, my classmates assumed he had to be some sort of relation, or at least my boyfriend. As for my sister, in high school she volunteered as manager of a school store called “Rocky’s Den,” and her Chinese ethnicity was enough to spark rumours that she ran an opium den.

Our teachers were generally better at hiding their racial bias, but my siblings and I could still detect it in our gut in many instances.

My gym teacher constantly mixed up my name with another girl in my class who looked nothing like me, except that she was also Asian.

In Grade 12 (mid 1990s), my brother happened to sit near some new immigrants from Hong Kong, and although he had read his essay out loud several times in class, was given only 25 per cent for participation on his report card, with the suggestion that he should move away from the “friends” that he had never actually spoken to.

Teachers in high school knew that their students had nicknamed my sister Sushi because of her ethnicity and thought it was funny.

Cameron takes issue with the use of the term “systemic racism” to describe the B.C. school system, stating that teams of educators have interviewed students of visual minorities who rarely complain about racism.

To be honest, if my siblings and I had been asked to take that survey as high school students, I doubt that any of us would have accused our school of “systemic racism.”

There was never any overtly racist incident that we could pinpoint; we had only a lifetime collection of uncomfortable moments that added up to an internalized sense of not measuring up to our white peers.

We couldn’t blame this only on school; it was the world around us. Growing up, we idolized white celebrities and felt inferior for being so unlike them, having never seen Asians starring in a sexy or heroic role. People of colour rarely existed in the books we read, and never as the protagonist.

As an educator recently trained in the new B.C. curriculum (2015-2016), I acknowledge that the Ministry of Education has been striving to evolve with the times since the ’80s, providing funding, resources and professional development to support multicultural and Indigenous learning.

However, racism is a social ill so pernicious and insidious that it is really not enough as an educator to “not be racist,” but to strive toward anti-racism, actively teaching that although we have advanced somewhat on the path toward enlightenment, we are still on the continuum.

We have not yet arrived. As a teacher, I feel a great responsibility to talk openly about my experiences to my students, and to ensure that the minorities in my classroom — whether they are Indigenous, gender non-conforming, differentiated learners or a visible minority — understand that it is unacceptable to feel “lesser than,” as my siblings and I did.",[]

Re. “Comment: I just moved here and have U.S. plates: Stop looking for COVID scapegoats” (The Times Colonist, July 8)

article continues below

To Anonymous who moved to Victoria from California: Welcome to Canada. I am glad you cleared your 14-day self-isolation. If you arrived from California last month then you have had time to change your license plate over to a B.C. plate. That would avoid some of the hassle you feel you are getting.

We in B.C. have done an excellent job of flattening the curve, unlike California who had 11,694 new cases of COVID-19 reported Wednesday, July 8. That same day, B.C. reported 18 new cases. So we aren’t under a mandatory rule to wear masks when indoors or outside unless we want to. And most people are social distancing. Obviously, people weren’t paying attention to the risks in California and didn’t take the necessary precautions earlier on. There is a price to pay for that.

Another reason we Canadians are not being so nice right now is because people from the States that cross our borders into B.C. and Alberta are saying they are driving straight through to Alaska. Bad loophole.

One couple in Golden did not go straight to Alaska. Instead they did the tourist thing and were forced to self-quarantine for 14 days. Four people in Banff were up from Texas, another hot spot, and freely admitted (rather stupidly) that no, they weren’t going to Alaska, they were on vacation.

So don’t get so bent out of shape when we Canadians want to keep flattening the curve and advise visitors to stay away. You can come and visit us when this pandemic is over and not until then.

The current health pandemic has shone a light on the cracks in many of our public systems, and BC Parks is no exception. B.C.’s provincial parks have been chronically underfunded since the early 2000’s, with minimal resources to manage nearly 15% of the land in our province.

This lack of funding has caused many issues within parks. Parks rangers are few and far between, leaving areas with no one to monitor for illegal activity such as wildlife poaching and dumping. There are decades worth of maintenance and planning to do, to keep up with demand for outdoor recreation while safeguarding nature.

As BC reopens our communities and green lights local travel, camping and hiking in provincial parks provide one of the most affordable and spectacular ways to explore the province. To keep these places open safely, we must invest in BC’s parks.

Investing in parks means investing in community wellbeing.

Contained in the government's election commitments was a promise to maintain and improve facilities and services in our parks. Now is the time to live up to those promises.

The survey of 1,401 member businesses from groups including the BC Chamber of Commerce, Greater Vancouver Board of Trade and Business Council of B.C. indicates owners want a bold, long-term recovery plan.

Only 16 per cent of businesses were confident in B.C.'s restart plan and 47 per cent were not.

Two-thirds of those surveyed were relying on some form of government support and owners were braced for a ""second wave"" of shutdowns or other problems if programs expire too quickly.

Some 28 per cent believed they'll return to normal once programs end, 32 per cent expected to cut workers' hours, 27 per cent anticipated layoffs, and one business in every 10 forecast either temporary or permanent closure.

Owners say payroll and wage supports must remain key components of B.C.'s recovery plan, along with fee and tax cuts.

The survey also identified expectations that the province must create better investment conditions.

Bridgitte Anderson, president and CEO of the Greater Vancouver Board of Trade, says business viability hinges on those measures.

Val Litwin with the BC Chamber of Commerce urges policy-makers to ""stay sensitive"" to the vulnerability of the business sector.

""A bold economic recovery plan that helps small businesses compete is non-negotiable for a prosperous B.C., and when small businesses thrive so do communities and people,"" Litwin said in a statement.

""Governments must keep focused on delivering their recovery plans swiftly.""

Canada's Communications Security Establishment says the malicious cyberactivities were very likely undertaken to pilfer information and intellectual property relating to the development and testing of vaccines for the novel coronavirus.

The cyberspy agency says the clandestine activity is hindering response efforts at a time when health-care experts and medical researchers need every available resource to help fight the pandemic.

The CSE's Centre for Cyber Security assesses that APT29, also known as ""the Dukes"" or ""Cozy Bear,"" was responsible, and almost certainly operates as part of Russian intelligence services.

""The group uses a variety of tools and techniques to predominantly target governmental, diplomatic, think-tank, health-care and energy targets for intelligence gain,"" says a joint advisory from the CSE and its allies.

""APT29 is likely to continue to target organizations involved in COVID-19 vaccine research and development, as they seek to answer additional intelligence questions relating to the pandemic.""

This assessment is supported by partners at Britain's Government Communications Headquarters' National Cyber Security Centre, the U.S. National Security Agency, and the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.

The CSE is urging Canadian health organizations to review a technical advisory on the threat and to take any necessary actions to protect themselves. ""We encourage them as well to contact the Cyber Centre if they suspect they have been targeted by cyberactors.""

The joint advisory says APT29 targeted COVID-19 vaccine research and development by scanning specific computer IP addresses of interest for vulnerabilities, a tactic that can help the group obtain login credentials to systems.

""This broad targeting potentially gives the group access to a large number of systems globally, many of which are unlikely to be of immediate intelligence value,"" the advisory says.

""The group may maintain a store of stolen credentials in order to access these systems in the event that they become more relevant to their requirements in the future.""

It’s easy to understand why — it’s crispy on the outside, juicy in the middle and served with a flavourful sauce (or two).

It’s essentially a breaded chicken cutlet that could be sliced and served with side dishes. But in recent years, it’s also become a very popular thing to stuff into a sandwich, what I did in today’s recipe.

article continues below

To make my sandwiches, large, boneless, skinless chicken thighs are pounded until fairly thin. They are coated in flour, dipped into a beaten egg mixture, then thickly coated with panko, coarse Japanese-style breadcrumbs.

In restaurants, the chicken katsu is often deep-fried once coated. But in my recipe, I opted to shallow-fry it in oil in a skillet until golden, crispy and cooked through.

Many recipes for chicken katsu sandwiches ask you to use a soft style of sliced white bread — something you can easily bite through to get to the flavourful chicken inside.

I instead chose to use a tender hamburger bun, which I find yields a more attractive-looking sandwich.

That said, you likely wouldn’t be looking at the sandwich long before devouring it. That’s because the chicken is flavoured with two addictive sauces. One is a fresh ginger-flavoured mayo that you spread on the cut sides of the buns.

The other is tonkatsu sauce, a kind of Japanese-style barbecue sauce that you drizzle on the chicken. You can buy that sauce at Japanese food stores and in the Asian-foods aisle of some grocery stores, but I made my own simple version.

You can coat the chicken and make the sauces many hours before cooking the chicken and making the sandwiches. Keep everything refrigerated until needed. You could also do the same with the cucumber and radish quick pickles I served with the sandwiches.

Chicken Katsu Sandwiches

Japanese-style chicken that’s crunchy on the outside and juicy in the middle stuffed into buns with two flavourful sauces and refreshing lettuce. The panko needed for the chicken is sold in grocery stores, often in the Asian-foods aisle.

Preparation time: 40 minutes

Cooking time: Six minutes

Makes: Four servings

For ginger mayo (see Eric’s options)

1/2 cup mayonnaise

1 tsp finely grated fresh ginger

2 tsp soy sauce

2 tsp rice or cider vinegar

1 tsp granulated sugar or honey, or to taste

1/2 tsp sesame oil

Combine ingredients in a small bowl. Cover and refrigerate until needed.

For tonkatsu sauce

3 Tbsp ketchup

1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce

1 tsp soy sauce

1/2 tsp granulated sugar or honey

Combine ingredients in a small bowl (see Eric’s options). Cover and refrigerate until needed.

For chicken katsu sandwiches

4 large boneless, skinless chicken thighs (about 325 to 350 grams)

• salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

2 large eggs

1/4 cup milk

1/3 cup all-purpose flour

1 3/4 cups panko

• vegetable oil, for frying

4 tender hamburger buns, split and warmed

1 cup shredded head or leaf lettuce, or to taste

Set a chicken thigh flat on a work surface, smooth-side-down. Cover with a double layer of plastic wrap. Using a kitchen hammer, pound chicken until it’s about 1/4-inch thick, then set on a plate (see Eric’s options). Pound the other chicken thighs this way. Season the chicken with salt and pepper.

Place eggs and milk in a bowl large enough to dunk the chicken in and beat to combine. Place flour and panko in separate wide plates. Set out a baking sheet to set the chicken on once coated.

Coat one chicken thigh in flour. Dip it in the egg mixture, evenly coating it. Coat chicken in panko, thickly pressing it on. Set coated chicken on the baking sheet. Coat the remaining chicken thighs in this fashion.

Preheat oven to 225 F. Set out a second large baking sheet. Pour 1/4 inch or so of oil into a large skillet set over medium, medium-high heat.

When oil is hot, add two of the chicken katsu to the skillet and cook about three minutes per side, until golden and cooked through. (Keep a close eye on the chicken and lower the heat if it overly darkens as it cooks.)

Drain chicken katsu on paper towel, then set on the second clean baking sheet.

Cook the other two chicken katsu as you did the first two and set them on the baking sheet. Put chicken into the oven to keep warm.

Spread the cut sides of each bun generously with the ginger mayo. Top each bottom bun with some shredded lettuce.

Remove chicken katsu from the oven and, at a slight angle, cut each one, widthwise, in half. Now set two half pieces of chicken katsu on each bottom bun. Drizzle chicken katsu with the tonkatsu sauce. Set on top buns and serve.

Eric’s options: For spicy tonkatsu sauce, add sriracha or other spicy chili sauce, to taste.

If you don’t have a kitchen hammer, try using the bottom of a heavy skillet or rolling pin to pound the chicken thighs.

Cucumber and Radish Quick Pickles

Easy and quick sweet and tangy pickles you can serve with the chicken katsu sandwiches.

Preparation time: 15 minutes, plus salting time

Cooking time: A few minutes

Makes: About 1 1/2 cups

3/4 cup water

3 Tbsp rice or cider vinegar

2 tsp granulated sugar

1 cup thinly sliced radishes (see Note)

1 cup thinly sliced mini English cucumbers

1 tsp salt

Place water, vinegar and sugar in a small pot. Bring to a simmer over medium heat for 30 seconds, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Remove from the heat and cool vinegar mixture to room temperature.

Meanwhile, place radishes and cucumber in a fine sieve. Sprinkle with the salt and toss to coat the vegetables. Set sieve over a bowl or sink and let stand at room temperature 30 minutes.

When the 30 minutes are up, rinse the vegetables with cold water, drain well, then pat dry with paper towel. Place the vegetables in a two-cup jar. Pour in the vinegar mixture. Push on the vegetables to submerge them. Cover and refrigerate pickle until ready to serve with the chicken katsu sandwiches.

Note: About two mini cucumbers and 10 radishes, depending on size, should yield the amounts needed here.

Halibut, salmon, albacore tuna, ling cod, crab, sablefish, oysters, clams and mussels are just some of the tasty choices we have and there’s much to celebrate about that.

But for many seafood lovers in this province, the party hits its peak when spot prawns are in season. This year’s fishery began in early June and according to Mike Atkins, Executive Director of Pacific Prawn Fishermen’s Association, will likely last four to six weeks.

article continues below

Although you can buy good quality frozen spot prawns year round, they really are at their best when ultra fresh. They have sweet tasting, almost buttery, succulent meat and part of their allure is that they are only available for a few weeks each year. So when you do have them you really appreciate their fine flavour and recognize what a treat they are.

Despite their name, spot prawns are the largest of the shrimp species commercially harvested off the B.C. coast. They are named after the distinctive white spots you’ll find on their tails.

You are most likely to find spot prawns for sale at stand-alone seafood stores and, occasionally, at some supermarkets, depending on availability. In some coastal locations you can also buy them direct from the fisher.

Depending on where you buy them, you’ll see fresh spot prawn tails with their heads removed, and whole live or recently live spot prawns for sale.

When buying spot prawn tails, choose bright-looking, firm tails that have few or no black spots and smell of the sea. It’s best to cook fresh spot-prawn tails the day you purchase them. But, if they are very fresh and you keep them well chilled on a bed of ice in the refrigerator, you could store them for one day or maybe two.

According to information on the Pacific Prawn Fishermen’s Association website, bcprawns.ca, when buying live spot prawns, look for lively, almost translucent specimens. The tail should be straight in line with the head, and the head should be firm to the touch.

When going out to buy live prawns, bring a cooler with ice in it to put them in for the ride home. Once home, refrigerate them until ready to cook.

Don’t leave live or recently live prawns for more than a few hours before cooking them or removing the heads. Spot prawns have an enzyme that will permeate into the tail and causes their quality to deteriorate quickly. You’ll know the prawns have started to deteriorate if the head is showing a black colour and is soft or mushy when touched, an unappealing quality the meat will also have.

If you need to store the prawns for more than a few hours, you can remove the heads by swiftly turning and pulling them away from the tails. After the heads are removed, the tails should be thoroughly rinsed and, as noted above, kept refrigerated until ready to cook.

Spot prawns can be prepared in ways similar to other large shrimp and prawns. I used them in an aromatic, colourful and tasty Cajun-style sheet pan dinner for two.

Spot Prawn Sheet Pan Dinner for Two

Here’s a nicely spiced, peel-and-eat, Cajun-style way to prepare B.C. spot prawns that sees them cooked on a sheet pan with bits of sausage, potatoes, onions and peppers. For a filling meal, serve with cornbread or corn on the cob.

Preparation time: 25 minutes

Cooking time: 23 to 27 minutes

Makes: two servings

8 to 10 B.C. nugget potatoes, halved

3 Tbsp olive oil

2 Tbsp lemon juice

1 large garlic clove, minced

1 1/2 tsp paprika

1 1/2 tsp oregano

1/2 tsp dried thyme

• freshly ground black pepper, to taste

1 tsp hot pepper sauce, such as Tabasco, or to taste

14 to 16 whole live spot prawns, or spot prawn tails (see Eric’s options)

1 cured (about 5-inch long) chorizo or other tasty sausage, sliced (see Note)

1/2 medium onion, sliced

1/2 medium red bell pepper, sliced

1/2 medium green bell pepper, sliced

• sea salt, to taste

• chopped fresh parsley, to taste

• lemon slices, for garnish

• remoulade sauce (optional, see recipe)

Boil potatoes until just tender, about eight to 10 minutes. Drain well, set on a large plate and cool to room temperature.

Preheat oven 400 F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper, unless it’s non-stick.

Combine oil, lemon juice, garlic, paprika, oregano, thyme, black pepper and hot pepper sauce in a large bowl. Add prawns, sausage, cooked potatoes, onions and bell peppers and use a spatula to toss and coat them with the oil mixture.

Set prawns, sausage and vegetables on the baking sheet, spreading them out so that they sit in a single layer. Drizzle any oil mixture left in the bowl over them and then sprinkle lightly with salt.

Roast the sheet pan dinner 15 to 17 minutes, or until the prawns are cooked and sizzling. Sprinkle with parsley, garnish with lemon slices and, if desired, serve with remoulade sauce.

Note: Ready-to-eat chorizo sausages are sold at supermarkets, butcher and charcuterie shops and European-style delis.

Eric’s options: The prawns used in today’s recipe came from Oak Bay Seafood (oakbayseafood.com). No matter where you shop, it’s best to call ahead to see if they are stocking spot prawns that day. When spot prawns are not available, simply use another type of wild prawn tail in this recipe.

Remoulade Sauce

Here’s a tangy southern-style sauce that you can dollop alongside the prawns and other items in the sheet pan dinner once plated.

Preparation time: five minutes

Cooking time: None

Makes: about 1/2 cup

1/3 cup mayonnaise

1 Tbsp finely chopped sweet mixed pickles or sweet green relish

2 tsp fresh lemon juice

1 tsp capers, finely chopped

1 tsp Dijon mustard

1 tsp chopped fresh parsley

• pinch dried tarragon and paprika

1/4 tsp hot pepper sauce, such as Tabasco, or to taste

Combine ingredients in a small bowl. Cover and refrigerate until needed for the sheet pan dinner.

""Focus on member health and safety has always been extremely important to us,"" says Cameron Biffart, clinic director of the Kelowna LIVE WELL.

""Our protocols going into COVID-19 were probably what a lot of gyms will come out of the pandemic with. In addition, we've taken our sanitation and cleaning standards and stepped them up dramatically. We've placed a real emphasis on following health authorities and going above and beyond guidelines.""

While Biffart's Kelowna clinic opened up on June 1, the rest of the clinics in B.C. will be welcoming members back from June 15 through the first week of July with enhanced health and safety measures.

So far, LIVE WELL's clients have been extremely happy with the enhanced health measures and are confident in their safety while working out at the clinics.

""I did not hesitate to come back for my regular exercise sessions. LIVE WELL has always been very clean and sterile, which is very important for me due to my allergies and asthma,"" client Ayla Kilic says.

""Now, the personnel at the clinic are even more careful in maintaining sanitation and cleanliness. The new positioning of exercise equipment maintains social distancing, and the trainers ensure that everybody is following the safety standards. They keep the equipment clean and sterile while providing the best professional and personal care to us. I feel very safe exercising at the clinic, and I appreciate everybody's effort to provide us with this safe venue to exercise"".

LIVE WELL Exercise Clinics has many locations across B.C. and other parts of Canada. Every clinic focuses on providing customized exercise programs for each member to help reach their personal health goals.

""Most of our members will have one health condition or concern,"" says Biffart. ""We work with people with heart disease, obesity, arthritis, and a variety of other ailments and diseases, including those who are recovering from knee and hip replacements.""

LIVE WELL is inviting anyone interested in learning more about its personalized exercise programs to tour a clinic near you by signing up online.

""There's no 'gym-timidation' here,"" Biffart says. ""Most of our members come to us because they want that extra care and attention that we can provide that a big box gym can't. We have a very warm and inviting community-based atmosphere. It's very easy for new people to come in and immediately feel like they're part of things.""

LIVE WELL's staff includes university-educated kinesiologists and clinical exercise physiologists that often work together to help clients meet their goals. When new members come in for an initial consultation, LIVE WELL's staff does a full medical intake and a baseline assessment to determine where they are in their fitness journey. From there, a customized exercise plan is created, including participation in small classes.

""From the very first time I stepped into Live Well, I knew it was going to be amazing. I have never experienced a gym like this and am truly grateful for the opportunity to be a member,"" client Rebecca Donald says.

All workouts are by appointment, and members have set schedules to know ahead of time when to come into the clinic. Roughly hour-long classes with a maximum of 12 people are overseen by two staff members, who provide oversight and coaching throughout the session.

""Members have a constant sense of being guided through their workouts,"" Biffart says. ""Because we cater to people who don't have a background in exercise, we do everything we can to make them feel comfortable and help them work on that confidence. They get a real sense of accomplishment.""

LIVE WELL has also introduced two new online programs for existing members to foster support and access. One is LIVE WELL At Home, an online personalized exercise program that can be accessed through a member portal online. This allows members to log in wherever and whenever to do their exercises. The fitness clinics have also introduced LIVE WELL Live, which will enable members to join via video conferencing to be led through their exercises in a traditional class environment.

""It provides that social aspect of a live instructor,"" Biffart says. ""An important part of what we do is that social aspect and creating community.""

That community is part of the accountability that LIVE WELL creates for its members, partly credited to the same group of people sharing classes week in and week out. Biffart encourages anyone who is curious about the LIVE WELL experience to come in and see the clinic.

""After we've completed the repair work,"" says Mike, ""we typically wash your vehicle before returning it to you. If a customer is in a hurry, sometimes it's too soon after painting to wash the vehicle, so we'll return it straight away. That's when customers wonder about how soon they can get the vehicle washed.""

Mike and his team at Coquitlam Express Auto Body suggests waiting for 30 days after a vehicle has been painted before taking it to the car wash.

""The standard car wash uses a friction brush system that could damage the paint work if the vehicle is washed too soon,"" Mike explains. ""And the touch-free washes often use acid presoaks that could affect the finish on a newly painted vehicle.""

If your vehicle needs washing before the end of the 30-day period, Mike suggests hosing it down with cool water, then drying it with a soft cloth to eliminate water spots.

""After the 30-day period, you can then give the vehicle a wash using a mild detergent recommended for the purpose,"" says Mike. ""Again, you should dry it off with a soft cloth or shammy.""

Keeping the vehicle away from tree sap and bird droppings is also ideal, if possible.

""Both bird droppings and tree sap contain acids that could damage the finish."" Mike says. ""If it's not possible to park the vehicle in a covered garage, rinse the vehicle as soon as possible after contact and dry it off with a soft cloth. This is particularly important for the first few days after painting.""

Finally, allow the fresh paint to breath. Don't cover the vehicle with a tarp and quickly rinse off any gasoline, antifreeze or windshield solvent from the vehicle.

""At Coquitlam Express Auto Body we provide a high-quality paint finish when we've completed the repairs,"" Mike says. ""Take care by removing dirt, debris, and solvents quickly and your vehicle will keep that ""just painted"" look.""

""I always had endodontics at the back of my mind. It was actually my favourite part of dentistry,"" he explains. ""Early in your dentistry career you tend to find a specialty area that piques your interest. For me, that was endodontics.""

article continues below

Endodontists perform root canals and have completed a three-year specialist program in addition to a dentistry degree.

""It's a complicated procedure,"" says Dr. Parhar, ""and it requires a high level of knowledge and expertise. In addition to taking care of the teeth, we also need to take care of the patient. When patients come in for a root canal, they are often in pain and nervous about the treatment.""

While he understands that nervousness, Dr. Parhar is quick to reassure the patient that root canal therapy is not as painful as they may think.

""I make sure patients are comfortable,"" he says, ""not only during the treatment, but also by making sure they have the right medication after the procedure to minimize any discomfort. I believe in being proactive from start to finish.""

When a tooth gets infected, sometimes the only way to save it is with a root canal procedure. While it's always the patient's choice to have a tooth extracted, Dr. Parhar believes that keeping your own teeth for as long as possible is the better option.

""Often patients believe that if they remove the teeth, they remove the problem. But dentures don't always fit well and implants can bring their own problems. Your own teeth will function better, allow you to chew better and are always a better option than anything artificial.""

In endodontics, being the patient is usually the easy part. For the dentist, root canals present various challenges due to the nature of teeth.

""Teeth are actually very complex,"" says Dr. Parhar. ""Teeth can have long roots, skinny roots, some are curved like a candy cane, and they're never in a straight line. Often there is more than one root; there can be as many as six in one tooth. And obviously, the teeth in the front are easier to treat than those in the back, which are generally harder to see and reach.""

Dr. Parhar encourages people who may think they need a root canal to contact him for a consultation.

""I can be a valuable resource,"" he says. ""I can answer questions about the procedure and make sure you're aware of all the options available to you to treat your tooth.""

Well, that's partly true, according to Keith Louw, Location Manager at First Memorial Burkeview.

""It's a little more involved than people think,"" Keith says. ""First, it depends on where you die and whether any arrangements have been made beforehand.""

article continues below

The most common place that people die is in hospital.

""In that case,"" Keith explains, ""the deceased is moved immediately off the ward and into the morgue. If the death occurred during the night, the next day the family calls First Memorial Burkeview, or their funeral services professional of choice, and we invite them to come in with the necessary forms for registering the death of your loved one. The legal next-of-kin will sign the forms to have your loved one released into our care, and we take care of the rest.""

The release forms are necessary to make sure that the appropriate person is making the arrangements.

""There have been a couple of instances in Vancouver,"" Keith notes, ""where one person has called a funeral home and arranged for the deceased to be moved and another family member has already made arrangements somewhere else.""

If a person dies in a hospice, the procedure is very similar.

""In the hospice,"" Keith says, ""the body needs to be removed immediately. The next-of-kin would phone First Memorial Burkeview or another funeral home and ask for the transfer of their loved one. It's important to note that the phone call has to be made by the legal next-of-kin. It cannot be a hospice worker, nurse or doctor. The funeral services provider will then transfer the deceased regardless of the time of day or night.""

When death happens at home, it typically is under two circumstances: a planned home death and an unplanned death.

""In the case of a planned home death,"" Keith explains, ""the deceased has prearranged with the appropriate health authority to pass away at home. When that occurs, there's no need for a doctor, the coroner, or the police. As a professional funeral service provider we can go ahead and transfer the body as long as the appropriate release form has been signed.""

For unplanned home deaths, Keith recommends calling 911.

""A death at home that has not been prearranged under the Planned Home Death Act will need the attendance of the police and, eventually, a coroner,"" he says.

Devoting forty years to studying, teaching, and practicing acupuncture was an easy decision for Dr. Wang after she witnessed the extraordinary effect of this ancient healing technique early in life.

With its origins stretching back to later than 6000 BCE, acupuncture is one of the world’s oldest medical practices. Used widely on a global scale to alleviate pain caused by a variety of conditions, this form of traditional Chinese medicine consists of inserting fine needles into specific areas of the body to stimulate sensory nerves under skin and in muscles.

article continues below

Though it may seem like sticking needles into your body like a pushpin is not the best way to treat pain, millennia of alleviated, and even healed, patients embedded into a rich history of medicine spanning the globe should change your mind otherwise.

In her many years of practice in Taiwan, California, and Coquitlam, Dr. Wang has kept a proud record in helping people with many problems. Whether it is used for preventative measures or to keep recurring pain at bay, Jane’s Acupuncture Clinic sees all different types of problems, some, even, with unknown causes. “When general physicians don’t know how to treat unknown symptoms, they usually refer their patients to us,” Dr. Wang said. “We’re often their last resort.”

It is no wonder other medical practitioners put their trust in Dr. Wang; her history of studying and teaching acupuncture is impressive by any account. Beginning her long career with acupuncture with the famed Dr. M.K. Tseng, a renowned acupuncturist in Taipei, Dr. Wang took to California to further her studies at the Asian American Acupuncture University. As a licensed acupuncturist by the state of California, Dr. Wang practiced in San Diego until 1986. While in California, Jane was awarded as a distinguished member by the Chula Vista Chamber of Commerce. She returned to Taiwan to practice and teach acupuncture at the University of Chinese Culture until 1994, when she came to Vancouver with her family and settled down in Coquitlam. Since then, her established practice continues to serve its community by treating and healing pain one patient at a time.

Michelle Di Tomaso of Bella Gift Baskets in Vancouver has just the answer. Di Tomaso has been coming up with amazing personalized gift baskets for nearly two decades. Her advice on creating custom Easter Baskets for kids?

article continues below

1.Think outside the … basket! Use something other than the conventional basket. Sand-pails, storage bins, dump trucks and toy boxes make a great alternative and serve as a something useful afterwards.

2. Personalizing is key. Make your little one feel as though the Easter Bunny made this especially for them. Include their name in or on whatever you choose for a basket. You can use a tag tied on with a ribbon or decorative shoestrings.

Incorporate colours your children like or ones that will match their bedroom or playroom. And use the baskets afterwards to store, books, or small toys.

3. Get creative with the goodies. Visit one of Vancouver’s chocolatiers and check out their Easter twists. From chocolate-apple bunnies to beautiful Easter-inspired sculptures, many are brilliantly creative. Di Tomaso compares buying good quality chocolate creations to buying a piece of art.

4. Pick a theme they really like, i.e. arts and crafts, a tea party, a particular sport, gardening or “beach party”. Include something that they are really into right now, like Lego, puzzles, a doll, hockey cards or a toy car. Choose something they can play with and think: “How the heck did the Easter Bunny know I loved these things?” Items could include a plastic placemat and cups, plates, utensils in their favorite superhero or Disney character or arts and craft supplies.

“Start thinking outside the box,” says Di Tomaso. “Look for things that your child loves at the moment and go from there.”

Rest Your Head: Set on an expansive double lot in a community nestled on the hill overlooking Gibsons Marina, The Seasalt Cottage is a quiet home base from which to explore Gibsons Landing and the nearby towns of Sechelt and Roberts Creek. The owner, Michele, has lovingly renovated the two guest suites—one on the ground level and one on the “Upper Deck,” in the complex in which she resides with her adorable French bulldog, Chloe.Each suite is bright and stylishly decorated with plush furnishings and marine-inspired décor touches (think seashells and a white and blue pastel colour scheme). Both guest units boast soaker tubs, TVs/Netflix, wifi and kitchenettes which are perfect for those wanting to stay for more than a couple of nights (and who wouldn’t want that when this adorable pup is one of your hosts?).

article continues below

While the interiors are pristine and calming, the exterior space at The Seasalt Cottage is truly spectacular. Both suites have their own private patios where guests can enjoy a glass of wine while relaxing and enjoying the refreshing sea breeze. These terraces extend onto a huge garden filled where undulating pathways winding past lush bushes, vines and flowers.

Michele has created a few different seating areas nestled within the garden where guests can while away summer afternoons swaying in one of the suspended rocking chairs while taking in views of the sparkling sea and listening to the sound of water trickling from the fountains installed throughout the garden. Guests can also make use of the communal barbecue, grilling up seafood bought at the Gibsons Farmer’s Market (or caught on a fishing trip) and enjoying it in the outdoor dining area under a grapevine-covered arbour.

Wine & Dine: Just a three-minute walk down the hill from The Seasalt Cottage you’ll find an array of hip boutiques, coffee shops, restaurants and pubs at Gibsons Landing. My friend Fran and I arrived late on a Friday night and as soon as we dropped our bags in our suite we made a beeline to Tapworks pub, on Michele’s recommendation. The brewery has recently expanded from a hole-in-the-wall behind Gibsons Art Gallery to a two-level hotspot to see-and-be-seen while sipping locally crafted brews.

After ascending to the second floor, Fran and I made ourselves comfortable next to the firepit and ordered beer tasting flights, flatbread and spinach and artichoke dip from the snack menu. It wasn’t long before we had made friends with a couple of folks in their sixties who were visiting from West Vancouver and a group of twenty-somethings who were in town from Kitsilano. By the end of the night, we were playing board games with our new friends in the pub’s first-floor area. I mentioned to Fran later that night that it was Gibsons’ friendly small-town vibe that had likely inspired us to bond with complete strangers so quickly: if we had encountered the same people in a Vancouver bar we probably wouldn’t have connected in the same way.

Other notable (and super hip) dining experiences in Gibsons include Buono Osteria, a new Italian restaurant with a warm ambiance that overlooks the marina. Opened by Wally Buono’s son, the eatery serves traditional Italian fare with a modern twist, as well as excellent wines. Fran and I loved the locally foraged wild mushroom Bucatini with celery root and sherry cream. For happy hour drinks, super fresh oysters and a fun environment, head to Smitty’s Oyster House which is set right on the water. Next door Lunitas Mexican Eatery serves up beer, margaritas and excellent Mexican fare.

No trip to Gibsons is complete without a meal at the infamous Molly’s Reach restaurant which made its mark in the ’70s as one of the locations in the infamous Beachcombers series. On Day 2, Fran and I started our morning with a bacon and egg breakfast at the eatery while listening to Elvis tunes and overlooking Gibsons Marina.

Later in the day we had coffee at the locally owned and operated Beachcomber Coffee shop, an energetic little place located right on Gibsons’ Gower Point strip. I loved the unexpected, youthful vibe of the space known for its neon yellow and green branding and club-style music. On the last morning of my stay, after Fran had returned to Vancouver, I sat on the patio for a couple of hours, drinking coffee and snacking on pastries from Sandy’s Bake Shoppe down the street, people-watching, chatting with the locals and listening as they caught up on life.

Explore: The Sunshine Coast is a haven for nature-lovers so hiking, kayaking, fishing and beach-going are givens for visitors to the area. Soames Hill is a beautiful intermediate hike that we completed in about an hour and rewarded us with spectacular views of the Georgia Strait and Keats and Bowen Islands. Davis Bay is a beautiful beach to park yourself for the day with a blanket and a book. And for breathtaking sunsets Bonniebrook beach comes highly recommended by the locals I chatted with a Beachcomber Coffee.

But there is also lots to do right in Gibsons. You could spend a few hours visiting the many shops and boutiques along the strip which sell well-curated homewares and local art, as we did. And the Gibsons Public Market, opened in March 2017, is a fun place to pick up local cheeses, fresh fish, produce and flowers, and to visit the Nicholas Sonntag Marine Education Centre which temporarily holds local marine life in its tanks until they are returned to their natural habitat.

After spending a weekend getting to know Gibsons, it’s strange for me to think that it was once a town I’d drive through, without a thought, on my way to Sechelt. Now I realize it’s a gem in its own right—and I’ll definitely be back the next time I want a fun and laid back experience just a boat ride from Vancouver.

How to stop the calls from collection agencies,[],,"""If you find that you're not making any headway with your debt and you're on the receiving end of a number of calls from creditors or collections agencies, you need to call us,"" says David Wood of Boale Wood & Company Ltd, a Licensed Insolvency Trustee firm with offices in Coquitlam, Surrey, and Vancouver that also provides services on the Sunshine Coast and in the Yukon Territory.

David and his colleagues at Boale Wood offer a free initial consultation to make sure you have all the information you need to make an informed decision about your debt load.

article continues below

""Once you've been in to see us and filed a proposal or declared bankruptcy, calls from creditors or collection agencies must stop,"" notes David. ""The only other way they are going to stop is if you pay the debt—and most people are receiving the calls in the first place because they can't afford to pay the debt.""

One of the reasons David often hears from people who are hesitant to call Boale Wood for help, is the fear of affecting their credit rating.

""It's one of my pet peeves,"" says David. ""I usually ask, 'what is your credit rating doing for you at the moment?' The answer is typically, 'Nothing,' in which case, it's time to stop worrying about it. People place far too much emphasis on their credit rating.""

People struggling with debt often resist applying for a consumer proposal or declaring bankruptcy because of a fear that banks and credit card companies will not lend them money in the future.

""Not so,"" says David. ""Credit card companies are in the business of making money. If people don't have credit cards, they're not making money. There are around 100,000 insolvencies in Canada every year and somewhere along the line, those people are discharged and get loans or credit cards.""

What if you owe money to the Canada Revenue Agency?

""As Licensed Insolvency Trustees, we can address the issue of government debt, including student loans,"" David explains. ""It's a big misconception that government debt is somehow different from consumer debt, but it's not true. Again, once a proposal or bankruptcy is filed, any calls and demands from government agencies must cease.""

Nancy Gattey of Port Coquitlam’s Creekside Fashions has been in the clothing industry for nearly four decades and she offers some tips for different women’s body types.

article continues below

“Women should learn about their body type and what suits them,” she says. “That saves them a lot of time when they go shopping because they’ve got a clearer idea of what styles will work for them and make them look great.”

She uses four different categories of body types to help find just the right fit for her clients.

1. Circle Shape. A little fuller through the stomach area. This body type really suits a flowy top that conceals the midsection. Gattey suggests pairing this with either leggings or skinny jeans because this body type usually has slim legs. “So then the focus shifts to the legs.” Need something dressier? She suggests a shift dress with heels to give you a bit of height.

2. Triangle Shape. These women are narrower through the shoulders and broader through the hips so they need to find things that will balance them out. “Usually a wider-leg pant, like a trouser, would be more flattering and a structured jacket is usually best for making them more proportional.”

3. Hour-glass Shape. Very balanced and curvy, so they need to have very fitted styles to show off their curves. “You put them into a flowy top and it just looks like they are wearing a tent,” says Gattey. “You need something that comes in at the waist, and fits their curves, that’s what works best for them.” Gattey suggests something like a wrap-dress or pencil skirt with a fitted top with an open neckline.

4. Rectangular Shape. These women need to have clothing that gives them a bit of shape. “Things that fit snugly at the waist and sort of flare out a little bit and create curves. That works for them. A little jacket that tapers in at the waist and bootcut pant gives them a more flattering look,” Gattey says.

“We believe in delivering a superior customer service experience” Jean-Marc, co-owner of Spray-Net Vancouver Lower Mainland, said. This is just one of the main tenets that sets Spray-Net apart from its competition.

Spray-Net Vancouver offers a value-added service to homeowners throughout the Lower Mainland by delivering a quick, cost-effective and permanent exterior paint solution for your home. At a fraction of the cost of replacement, Spray-Net renews and restores everything from aluminum and vinyl siding, to stucco, aggregate, hardie board, brick, and even front and garage doors and windows.

What sets Spray-Net apart from its competitors? Karine, Spray-Net Vancouver Lower Mainland’s Operations Coordinator, says it’s because the franchise offers a “permanent solution with a 15 year warranty.”

“Most of the other paint products out there will create a finish that needs to be repainted at some point. Our coatings, stains, and spraying technique guarantee s a like-new factory finish that won’t ever peel. So for our customers, they’re not investing in maintenance. They’re investing in an alternative to replacement that will last, since they don’t have to re-paint 2-5 years down the line.”

Stemming from the family’s own past experiences with disappointing contractors, Jean-Marc wanted to fill the gap for a home improvement business rooted in customer satisfaction.

“When we came across Spray-Net it was a perfect fit,” he said. “The standards that Spray-Net brings, in terms of product quality, attention to detail and customer focus, are some of the highest in the industry.”

As one of the fastest growing home improvement franchises in Canada, it is also booming in the Lower Mainland. It continues to surpass its customers’ expectations with each home that is transformed.

""I always tell my clients, 'It's cheaper to pay for home staging than it is to reduce your price',"" she says.

article continues below

Lisa successfully uses mini-stages to sell homes for her clients.

""A mini-stage is where I use the client's furniture and fixtures,"" Lisa explains, ""but I bring in bedding, pillows, and extra lighting to turn a run-of-the mill property into a show home.""

The staging helps give a client's home an updated look and brings it in line with current trends in the market.

""It lets prospective buyers see what the property would look like if they lived there,"" says Lisa. ""Any house that has been staged usually will sell quicker and for more money.""

Lisa discovered the value of staging, and her knack for employing it, about four years ago when selling a house that was less than desirable.

""I ended up bringing a lot of stuff from my own home and putting it in the house to update it,"" she recalls, ""and I sold the home in a weekend!""

A recommendation Lisa gives her clients when listing their home is to take a look at the amount or size of their furniture.

""Often, they have too much furniture,"" she says, ""or it's too big. I advise them to take this piece out or move that piece somewhere else. Then they either give the furniture away, sell it, or move it into storage. ""

A key thing to show your home off to its full advantage, according to Lisa, is lighting.

""Lighting is key. You'll often find me up a ladder changing the bulbs or even the fixtures themselves,"" Lisa laughs. ""You can't underestimate the advantage of good lighting to help show off your home.""

While Lisa usually recommends mini-stages using your own furniture and fixtures, if needed she can bring in a professional company to supply furniture to replace outdated or worn pieces.

""I work with a couple of companies to come in with larger pieces,"" she says, ""then I can bring in the accessories. Any property that is staged is going to sell.""

“People don’t always make distinctions about types of government, so they may come to us with issues we can’t help with directly, but we can point them in the right direction,” says Ms Robinson. “For example, if they’re worried about a project in their area, we will direct them towards the mayor and council. If they have immigration issues, we’ll send them to their MP, who is three doors down in the same strip mall.” Likewise, people are often confused about exactly which constituency they’re in, so the team at Ms Robinson’s office will always ask your postcode in case you’re actually represented by one of Coquitlam’s other three MLAs.

3. The best day to reach Ms Robinson is Friday

These days, she travels a lot, but reserves Fridays to meet with people in the community. That said, she’s not the only expert in helping get her constituents the help they need. “Don’t wait for me – meet with my staff. They are just as able as I am to connect you with the right service,” she says.

4. Any feedback is appreciated

Ms Robinson encourages all her constituents to stay in touch and raise issues or concerns, but also to tell her they like what the team is doing. “We don’t need pats on the back but we do need to know if we’re on the right track, if policy decisions have been helpful in constituents’ lives, and what we need to be doing more or less of,” she explains. The best way to make contact is initially by email, including your phone number in your message. “I might have questions and usually it’s easier just to pick up the phone instead of getting into an email chain,” Ms Robinson explains.

5. It doesn’t matter who you support or voted for

While Ms Robinson was elected under the New Democrat banner, she represents everyone in the Coquitlam-Maillardville riding. “I serve everyone in this region – it doesn’t matter how you voted, or if you voted,” she says.

Selina Robinson MLA’s office is at 102-1108 Austin Avenue, Coquitlam. Contact her by email at selina.robinson.mla@leg.bc.ca, phone 604-933-2001 or visit SelinaRobinson.ca",[]

Simple - when you treat your customers right and provide some of the best food around.

article continues below

That’s the recipe for success Me-n-Ed’s Pizza Parlors has been serving up since opening the doors in Burnaby back in 1969.

Today, there are three other locations - Coquitlam, Port Coquitlam and Langley - where the commitment carries on the same way it started out 50 years ago.

“We love what we do, and that’s caring for our customers,” says Cris Florian, who, along with husband Richard, got involved with the business 25 years ago at the Port Coquitlam location.

“Our clientele is about 95 per cent repeat customers,” Richard says. “That speaks volumes about what we do.”

And what they do is serve up a host of pizzas which all come with a unique, thin and flaky crust.

“We have a great product, and we take care of our customers, plain and simple,” Richard says. “That sounds like a simple formula, but it can be difficult as trends change.”

Back in 1969, Me-n-Ed’s featured live music and sing-a-longs. Later it was jukeboxes. Today, it’s a full service, family restaurant whose menu remembers the past and reflects the present.

“We are always coming up with new toppings. For example, we have roasted kale on one of our pizzas,” Cris says.

They also offered gluten-free products, before they became widely available. And now they are introducing Beyond Meat toppings which are derived from plant-based protein.

“We serve up healthy pizzas. We slice all of our own cold cuts. The chicken we use, we roast them ourselves,” Cris says. “All of the sauces are made in house, too.”

While the main attraction at Me-n-Ed’s is the food, the sense of community found at each restaurant is what provides that special feeling.

“The community is our customer base, they are everything,” Cris says. “If you support those sports teams and fundraisers, it all comes back to you.”

Among the groups they have helped include the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research, as well as the Parkinson’s Society of BC, which supplies patient support.

“Michael grew up in Burnaby and started eating at Me-n-Ed’s as a teenager, so when he comes into town now, he always heads in for pizza here,” Cris says. “So we wanted to support something that has so much meaning to him. And in the past 12 years we’ve raised about $300,000.”

Maria Oliveira, who along with husband Antonio (Tony), manages the Oliveira Funeral Home in Port Coquitlam, has counseled many people over the years about the importance of end of life planning. She offers these great reasons for preplanning and prepaying for your funeral or other end of life service.

article continues below

1. Lock in at today’s prices

“People don’t often think about the cost of a funeral or memorial service,” Maria says. “My parents didn’t. They planned their funeral, but they didn’t think about the cost of the service . When you prepay your funeral, you not only save your loved ones from having to make financial decisions at a very emotional time, but you lock in at today’s prices. It makes sense on so many levels.”

To help with the cost today, Oliveira Funeral Home accepts a 25 percent down payment with the balance financed over five years, interest free. The money is held in trust and Oliveira will work with another funeral home in the event you move and want to be buried elsewhere.

2. Let your family know your plans

“Many people don’t talk to their kids or their parents about end of life decisions,” says Maria. “When the time comes, you want your loved ones to know your wishes. Do you want a full funeral service with a burial, or perhaps just a graveside service? Orwould you prefer cremation and no service at all? Whatever you choose, it makes so much sense to relieve your loved ones of the guesswork at their time of grieving.”

3. Preserve the life insurance

Oliveira Funeral Home believes that life insurance is for the living, not the deceased. Insurance can help your family adjust to the loss of income that the loss of a family member often causes. Without prearrangements, a significantportion of any insurance payout might need to be spenton the funeral and related items. This can add to the financial burden of the family and loved ones left behind.

Preplanning and prepaying for your end of life choices can save your family a lot of heartache and financial worries at a very emotional time.

“People forget that when they don’t plan for death,” says Maria, “they can’t be sure that their wishes will be honoured.”

According to a variety of studies, he adds, around 9 percent of women and 25 percent of men in middle age suffer from Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).

He compares suffering from sleep apnea to living every night on Mount Everest.

article continues below

""Two things happen,"" Paul explains. ""First, you continually get woken up from the deeper sleep stages, so you end up tired the next day. Second, you stop breathing and the oxygen levels drop in your blood stream. Those lower oxygen levels can then be attributed to many cardiovascular issues, hypertension, diabetes, and even stroke, if left untreated.""

A common misconception is that sleep apnea is caused by being overweight. Obesity can certainly be a cause, Paul says, but it's not the only one.

""It's true that if you're overweight with a high body mass index, you have an 80 percent chance of having sleep apnea,"" he says. ""But we also treat slim people who might have a really short jaw or redundant tissue in their throat. Being obese is only one possible factor.""

Most patients experience the obvious symptoms of snoring or their partners notice frequent interruption in their breathing. Another symptom could be those frequent bathroom visits in the night.

""Symptoms are our starting point,"" Paul says. ""Apart from feeling tired during the day, you may have headaches in the morning, or a heartburn sensation. We look at whether you have other medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or a history of heart problems.""

If you're unsure if sleep apnea is the cause of your constant tiredness, Coastal Sleep offers a complimentary in-home test to determine if you have the condition and if so, the level of severity and possible treatment options.

For more information about the causes and symptoms of sleep apnea call Coastal Sleep at 604.279.9066, visit their website or send them an email. There is a Coastal Sleep facility in the Tri-cities area located at 602-2950 Glen Drive, Coquitlam. Coastal Sleep can also be found on Facebook and Twitter.",[]

It offers an education and a variety of out-of-school programs for francophone children from K – 12 in 37 schools around the province.

While CSF is restricted as to what students it can accept (see https://www.csf.bc.ca/csf-eng/admissions for more information), the school board encourages all Canadian students to become proficient in both of the country's official languages.

article continues below

Check out these 8 great reasons why both you and your child should learn French:

1. An official Canadian language: You may not have much opportunity to speak French in your community, but French is spoken throughout Canada–and not just in Québec. French communities can be found in every province from B.C. to Newfoundland. It's also a language of the Parliament of Canada, our court system, and the federal civil service.

2. Open up educational opportunities: Graduating with high school certificates in both English and French means you have the pick of renowned universities and business schools, not just in Canada but also throughout the English and French-speaking world.

3. Open up job opportunities: French language skills are often required for government positions, especially in federal departments. Studies have shown that Canadians fluent in both official languages can earn more than unilingual job candidates, even if they're not required to speak French in the work place.

4. Stimulate the brain: Learning a second language stimulates the brain and is thought to help your brain function better in old age. A 2014 study found that reading, verbal fluency, and intelligence were improved in people who learned a second language, even if they took up that language later in life.

5. Learn more than one: French is an excellent base for learning other languages, especially Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese.

6. French is familiar: Approximately 50 percent of English vocabulary is derived from French. It's not quite as simple as just learning the other 50 percent, but it is a good start.

7. Travel widely: French is the only language that is spoken on all 5 continents. There are more than 75 million native French speakers in the world and another 190 million who have French as a second language. The world is truly yours with French.

8. Language of international relations: French is the working and official language of the United Nations, European Union, UNESCO, NATO, the International Olympic Committee, the International Red Cross, and various international courts.

Eric Leclerc, Principal of l'école des Pionniers-de-Maillardville a CSF high school in Port Coquitlam adds:

""If your child leaves our school fully bilingual, they can go to any of about 160 countries in the world for a university education without having to take another English or French language course. There are lots of opportunities for kids who are bilingual.""

Getting a test is now as simple as contacting a sleep clinic such as Coastal Sleep.

article continues below

""At Coast Sleep, we can provide a monitor that you use at home,"" says Paul Sweeney, President of Coastal Sleep. ""There's a small nasal device to measure your airflow and a band on your chest to measure the movements. The third device is a pulse oximeter that measures the heart rate and oxygen level.""

It’s a far cry from the fifteen or so devices and the long wait that sleep apnea sufferers had to endure when being diagnosed in the past.

Sleep apnea results in a brief interruption in the breathing pattern, often many times during the night, Paul explains. And when this happens, the monitor senses that the chest is moving, but there's no airflow.

""This usually indicates an obstruction in the airway,"" says Paul. ""The information we can gather from the monitor tells us how many times during the night you experienced this interruption of breathing. Comparing the number of events to the Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI) will indicate if you have sleep apnea and if so, whether if it's a mild, moderate, or severe condition.""

When there are other medical issues present, or if the screening test results are inconclusive, Coastal Sleep refers patients to a sleep specialist for the more detailed in-hospital test.

""Sleep apnea is very prevalent,” says Paul. “People with diabetes or heart issues have up to 50 percent chance of suffering from the condition and there's an 83 percent of having sleep apnea if your hypertension has been shown to be drug resistant.""

Even children are not exempt from suffering from sleep apnea, he says.

""Unfortunately, children present a challenge because they tend to go undiagnosed. In the past, a lot of kids would have had their tonsils removed, but these days, tonsillitis can be treated with antibiotics. Some children have large tonsils and this can result in a crowded airway.""

Unlike adults, children can often benefit from surgery and the removal of tonsils or redundant tissue in the throat.

Real Estate Wire (REW), one of Canada’s leading digital real estate platforms, is expanding their well-established listings portal to include rentals. The website, which has been trusted by real estate buyers and sellers for the better part of a decade, will offer a number of tools and resources to help renters find their next home.

“Renting is an important part of the real estate market for many families, especially in cities like Vancouver and Toronto, where affordability is a major issue,” said Simon Bray, REW President. “Over the years, we have seen an increasing need for a rental platform that is safe, secure, and provides renters with the same great service as buyers. That’s why we’ve expanded our real estate marketplace to include rentals.”

The Lower Mainland is one of the world’s most expensive real estate markets for buyers, driving many families to look for affordable rentals as an alternative. The COVID-19 pandemic has further impacted the buying power of many families.

A recent REW survey found that 45% of respondents had either lost their job or some income due to the pandemic. About 38% of survey respondents said that COVID-19 had negatively affected their financial ability to buy a home.

“The shift to include rental properties on our platform has been in the works for some time, but the pandemic has really accelerated the demand for this service,” added Bray.

“Our goal is to help Canadians find their next home. Whether it’s buying a new development, browsing a listing down the street, or finding a great rental apartment, REW delivers a comprehensive real estate experience for everyone.”

In addition to listings, renters will have access to videos, virtual tours, market insights, and detailed descriptions of the rental properties, including their location, nearby schools, and amenities.

With the uncertainty surrounding the future of COVID-19 and its impact on the real estate market, these resources will become increasingly important to families that want to shop for a home online. About 80% of survey respondents believe websites like REW are now a critical resource, with 90% reporting having used a website like rew.ca in the last 30 days.

REW is working exclusively with property management companies to ensure rental properties are vetted and meet REW’s quality management standards.

“Our position in the real estate market has enabled us to establish strong relationships with the top property management companies in Canada. When using our platform, renters can rest assured they are receiving quality listings that have been reviewed by industry professionals.”

There are currently over 10,000 rental listings available on REW in British Columbia, Alberta, and Ontario. Expansion plans to bring rental listings across Canada are in the works.

There are several benefits to taking out a short-term loan from a private lending company versus heading to the bank, says Shameer Dada, President of C.A.I. Financial in Port Moody.

article continues below

One major difference is the impact on your credit rating.

“Every time you apply for a bank loan, there is an inquiry into your credit score,” he says.

And each inquiry is a hit to your credit rating.

Short-term loan companies, like C.A.I. Financial, do not require a credit check so applying won’t negatively affect your credit rating.

Other benefits of short-term loans include:

• Approval is instant and the funds are typically available the same day

• With a reciprocal loan, using collateral, like a vehicle, boat, RV or ATV, doesn’t require the lender to take over the title, so you can continue using your collateral over the course of the program

• Not a lot of paper work is required; often, the application process can be started online or over the phone

• While the interest rates are higher, payback periods are flexible and typically there are no penalties for early payouts

• In most cases, with proper collateral, approval is guaranteed

Bank loans, by comparison:

• Typically have minimum credit requirements and each application includes a credit check

• More stringent lending criteria means you might not qualify for as much cash as you need

• Have a set payback period, usually over a longer period of time, with penalties for paying out early

• Loan approval and then getting the funds can often take several days

“Shopping for a car should be fun,” says Westwood Honda’s General Manager, Colin Case. “If you keep a few things in mind, it takes the stress out of the process.”

If you’re in the market for a car, follow these 8 steps to a stress-free car buying experience:

· Buy from a licensed dealer. This will ensure a certain level of protection, such as a warranty. And many dealerships offer certified used vehicles, which have undergone rigorous inspections and must meet a high standard before being made available for sale.

· Do your research.Take the time to get online and look at the comparable models. Sites like Autotrader.ca will give you a very good feel for the prices in the market and give you an idea of what you should be paying.

· Insist on a vehicle history report. Reports such as Carproof give a detailed history of the vehicle including accidents, repairs and ownership history. A reputable dealer should have this readily available and the really good ones will have it online for you to review.

· Online Reputation matters. Check the internet for reviews from other consumers and you’ll get a very good idea if the dealer is someone you’ll be comfortable dealing with.

· Look for vehicles that start immediatelyand idle smoothly once warm.

· Check the steering. Make several turns in both directions and listen for unusual noises.

· Try the transmission in every gear– look for smooth shifting- that means no grinding with a manual transmission. An automatic transmission should not allow excessive engine speeds between gears.

· Get a feel for the brakes. They should feel firm and the car shouldn’t swerve when stopping abruptly.

“Buying a used vehicle is about being comfortable,” says Case. “If anything about the sales process is making you uncomfortable, feel free to surface it. In the end, you want to get the vehicle that’s right for you, not the sales person.”

“Wedding planners do the legwork so that couples can get married without stress and enjoy their special day with family and friends,” says Kayla Bell, Weddings & Events Coordinator with Meadow Gardens Golf Club in Pitt Meadows. ”Brides and grooms don’t want to spend their wedding day scurrying around to set up place cards, hang decorations or check on dinner.

From proposals to weddings, including a recent surprise proposal at Meadow Gardens’ beautiful 18th hole, Kayla has planned weddings big and small, casual and formal, and everything in between.

Here are 5 tips Kayla says will help ensure your wedding day remains stress-free for the bride and groom:

1. Meet your Wedding Planner to talk… and listen. “Bring your ideas, from dreams to magazine pictures. Then ask your wedding planner for his or her thoughts and let the possibilities happen!”

2. Set a budget… and stick to it. “With your planner, do some research about prices, and decide what features are worth the money and which ones you can do without. Also, talk to friends who’ve recently gotten married for tips on what worked for them.”

3. Consider a Plan B. Or C. “Opting for a sunset ceremony? The winds could be light and balmy or cold and gusting. Back-up plans like tents, umbrellas, and a loaded iPod aren’t a sign of pessimism; they’re an indication that your wedding planner is proactive and wants to be prepared no matter what.”

4. Show your true colours. “Something borrowed, something blue? Don’t confine yourself to traditional colours and schemes. Let your planner see your personalities, quirks and all. The most meaningful wedding moments come from special touches that show off who you really are!”

5. Plan your day… and your night. “Plan your day, from breakfast to your getaway vehicle. Work in some time to relax, mingle with guests, and take photographs with family… and keep the pace relaxed so that you’ll have time to enjoy each moment. It’s also a good idea to make a detailed plan for the night, too. How you end the day is as important as how you start it!”

As part of the expansion and redevelopment of Eagle Ridge Hospital, which includes the Emergency Department and is expected to be completed in late 2021, two Airborne Isolation Suites will be built within the ED and the hospital’s Foundation is currently campaigning to raise $225,000 to help support the build of one of the new facilities. Overall, Eagle Ridge Hospital Foundation has committed to raising $5 million to the total project cost of $27.6 million for the expansion.

“When patients come to the Emergency Department they may be unaware they are suffering from an infectious disease or other respiratory condition, putting other patients, their families and the staff at risk,” says Dr. Peter Macdonald, an Emergency Physician at Eagle Ridge Hospital.

Dr. Macdonald adds that, “the whole idea behind such facilities as the Airborne Isolation Suites is that they will have negative pressure air handling capabilities dedicated to each suite, so a patient who poses an infectious risk to the rest of the patient population and the staff can be placed there to protect everybody else.”

Currently, the hospital has a makeshift room serving as an isolation-capable room that is not outfitted with features that the new airborne isolation suites will have. For example, the Airborne Isolation Suites will each have dedicated ensuite washrooms and dedicated spaces where staff can don protective gear. This means that protective and potentially contaminated clothing doesn’t need to leave the room.

“In an era experiencing a resurgence of infectious illnesses, such as measles and chickenpox, plus other serious diseases like tuberculosis and the influenza virus, the addition of dedicated isolation spaces is needed more than ever to protect our community,” says Charlene Giovannetti-King, Executive Director of Eagle Ridge Hospital Foundation.

“Infection prevention is a significant challenge within the high-volume setting of any Emergency Department. When infected patients await diagnosis and treatment within close proximity of others, not only are they at risk of becoming more ill due to their compromised state of health, they are exposing others to a potentially contagious disease,” says Dr. Macdonald.

Faced with that challenge, the first priority of the Emergency Department health care team is to isolate patients with suspected or confirmed airborne infectious illnesses in the safety of an Airborne Isolation Suite.

Conveniently located on Glen Drive in Coquitlam, this flourishing dental practice has proven popular with patients in the community. CGS offers general dentistry services as well as specialized treatments, such as implants, Invisalign, and certain types of periodontics.

Dr. Park enjoys all aspects of dentistry, with a particular interest in cosmetic, restorative and endodontic dentistry. She also enjoys working with children and the elderly patients. For advancement in latest dentistry, she continuously devotes countless hours into continuing education and study clubs across North America.

Outside of work, her passion is to create paintings as a fine artist. She finds great joy in sharing this creative and meticulous side of hers when providing dental work for her patients.

The newest member to their clinical team Dr. Lin, is available for appointments on Mondays and Tuesdays.

""Dr. Lin is very comfortable with all the clinical aspects of dentistry,"" and is a great fit here at CGS. Shainaz says.

Visiting the dentist isn't always the priority it should be in our busy lives, and often we only present ourselves when there's a problem. For people who have let dental visits slip and suddenly find it's been at least ten years since the last visit, Shainaz has some advice:

""Don't be embarrassed,"" she says. ""There is never any judgment on our end. Sometimes patients are afraid to call after a long absence, but we're just really happy that you want to get back on track. We're completely comfortable with you coming back, whatever stage you're at. We just want to help our patients have the healthiest teeth and gums they can.""

Community is very important for the team at CGS. The clinic is owned by Dr. Shafiq Kara, who runs another popular clinic in Langley. Dr. Kara is a strong believer in giving back to the Tri-Cities community and supports the efforts of the CGS team in community involvement.

""We've participated in Coquitlam's Teddy Bear's Picnic and Parade,"" Shainaz says, ""and of course, we're the home of the great Mother's Day Dream Smile Makeover Contest! We enjoy being out there in the community offering information about how to create good oral health habits for kids and families.""

“We offer a very personalized service designed to honour all faiths, cultures, and traditions,” says Maria Oliveira, who together with her husband, Antonio (Tony), heads the family-run funeral home. “We walk the grieving family through everything. One family might need an hour or two to make arrangements; others may need five or six hours. It doesn’t matter; we always give people whatever time they need.”

article continues below

Oliveira Funeral Home opened its doors in 2004, but Tony Oliveira has more than three decades of experience in helping people arrange funerals for themselves or loved ones.

“Tony used to work in a family-owned funeral home in Vancouver,” Maria explains. “He worked closely with members of the Portuguese community and developed a reputation as someone who cared and who could honour our culture and traditions. He decided to open his own funeral home to offer a more personalized service to everyone, regardless of faith or tradition.”

Something Tony and Maria insist upon is that the person you meet when arranging a funeral at Oliveira, is the same person you will meet at the service.

“At larger funeral homes,” says Maria, “very often you spend time arranging a service with someone, only to find that someone else is at the service. They don’t know the family or the circumstances of the death at all. We make sure that the person doing the arrangements is there to support the family at the service. There’s a connection and it’s very important.”

Another difference at Oliveira is the compassionate help line. Most funeral homes have them, but usually an answering service is employed after hours to take the call about a death or to comfort a grieving relative.

“We answer our phones 24/7,” Maria notes. “Often people call after midnight – sometimes it’s a care home where a death has occurred and they don’t have the cooling facilities, but it could just as easily be the next-of-kin or a relative needing to speak to someone. ""

Tony and Mariaalways answer the phone in person after hoursto offer comfort and reassurance to the family. The second generation Oliveiras, already very involved in the funeral home, have also committedto carrying on this important service.

While Oliveira Funeral Home has strong connections to the Portuguese community and Catholic burial services, Maria explains that Oliveira excels at customizing funeral services to meet any cultural, traditional, or religious beliefs.

“We have performed many Muslim services,” she says, “and services for many different cultures and traditions. It’s what we do best.”

""We shed about 30,000 skin cells per hour,"" Mike says. ""and we spend around seven hours sleeping on our mattress a day. All that dead skin is a food source attracting dust mites, which can trigger asthma or other respiratory problems.""

article continues below

Mikey's Carpet Care offers professional cleaning of carpets, mattresses, and other household fabrics to residential customers from Burnaby to Aldergrove. In business for over 12 years, Mike is passionate about customer service – and his customers' health.

""Those dust mites produce fecal matter and expire,"" he notes, ""and our faces are just one inch away. By having your mattress professionally cleaned and deodorized on a regular basis, you can minimize respiratory issues while prolonging the life of your mattress.""

Mike spends time with his customers educating them around the benefits of regular cleaning of both carpets and mattresses.

""Many people are visual people and only get cleaning done when things look dirty or have spots. For example, people don't realize that a carpet can hold up to three times its weight in dust and dirt. If they don't see coffee or wine stains, they think the carpet is clean. But if the carpet weighs 100lbs, it can hold up to 300lbs of dust and dirt before you see it. And if you can see it, then it's past its’ optimal cleaning point and overdue.""

That mattress and bedding needs regular attention too.

""Pillows should be replaced every year,"" Mike explains, ""and the mattress should be flipped over every month and vacuumed every month. I often shock customers when I run my vacuum hose over their mattress and they see the very fine flour or sugar-like substance that comes off the mattress, which is dead skin and dander. I remind them that regular professional cleaning is actually cheaper than throwing a good mattress out.""

Mikeys Carpet Care, has been named the number one carpet cleaner in Langley and customers are eager to recommend Mike.

""I'm not a pushy salesman,"" he says. ""Customer service is my passion and I like to educate my clients around how to keep their carpets and mattresses clean between my visits. Many of my customers refer me to their friends and family. I work at being that guy who people can trust, the family friend in the industry.""

But if you suffer from multiple food allergies and intolerances too, you might struggle to find a decent cup of joe and a snack.

That’s the situation Bonnie Fung found herself in, and the reason she started Coquitlam’s Cupping 8 Cafe, a couple of months ago. “Until I moved to Canada from Hong Kong, eight years ago, I had never drunk a cup of coffee. Then I began to suffer from migraines, and discovered a morning brew was the only thing that could relieve them,” she says. At the same time, she began to develop food intolerances and allergies to everything from dairy to mangoes, and eating out became a nightmare. “I became so sick and tired of having to order things so carefully, yet still finding hidden ingredients that made me sick,” she says.

Fung began to research great coffee: Where to find the best beans and how long to roast them; the perfect temperature at which they should be brewed. A trained baker and herbalist, she started developing recipes for the food she loved to eat – Japanese cheesecakes, sandwiches, cupcakes and soups – that were free from allergens. After months of trying and testing dishes on herself, she opened Cupping 8 four months ago.

The café serves breakfasts, dinners and an all-day light lunch set of soup, salad, main course and coffee or tea. You can also get food and drinks to go. To reflect Coquitlam’s multicultural community, the menu has Japanese, Chinese and Canadian dishes, and as well as meat options, there are vegetarian specials such as Japanese curry and laksa. “We can really cover something for anyone,” says Fung. “I love cheesecake but can’t eat dairy products, so I’ve substituted ingredients to make a version I can have, that’s still rich, creamy and silky, in flavours like mango, organic green tea and Americano. We have dishes that are suitable for people who need gluten-free food too, use all organic, non-GMO ingredients, and have non-dairy milk replacements for tea and coffee. Everything is home-made, and we use strict hygiene rules to avoid cross-contamination.”

The name ‘Cupping’ comes from the official term and protocol for how coffee should be tasted. But Fung also likes the way it sounds like coupling – hanging together. 8 is considered fortuitous in Chinese culture. “It means infinity of love and happiness,” says Fung. Eventually, she’d like to grow her business across the Metro Vancouver region. But for now, she’s content with sharing her happiness – and great coffee – with the Coquitlam community.

But Keith Louw thinks it should be. Keith is the Location Manager at First Memorial Burkeview in Port Coquitlam.

""While no one wants to talk about death sooner than we need to, prearranging your funeral and taking care of decisions will be a great help to your family and loved ones,"" Keith says.

article continues below

Let's look at four reasons why pre-arranging your funeral is a wise move.

1. Eliminate guesswork for your loved ones

""If you know what kind of funeral service you want or how you want your remains to be handled, making prearrangements means that your wishes will be carried out,"" says Keith. ""Also, you'll be relieving your family of having to make major decisions at a difficult and emotional time.""

2. Save money

Prearranging and prepaying for funeral services could save you money.

""Let's say you made your arrangements in 1999,"" Keith explains. ""If you die tomorrow, we honour the 1999 price. There's no additional charge to fulfill your original choices, your family is not burdened with paying the difference between the 1999 price and today's cost.""

First Memorial Burkeview holds the prepaid amount in trust and pay interest on the funds they receive.

3. Be buried or cremated where you want

One reason people resist preplanning and prepaying for their funeral is the fear that they might move and want to be buried somewhere other than in the community where they used to live.

""Because First Memorial Burkeview is part of the Dignity Memorial network,"" says Keith, ""we can transfer your prepayment to any one of over 2,000 funeral service providers in North America. Chances are, wherever you move to, we have an affiliation with a funeral service provider in your area.""

4. Less worry for Snowbirds and travellers

""First Memorial Burkeview offers a Travel Protection Plan that means that if you should die while travelling, we can arrange to have your body repatriated,"" Keith says. ""It's a great relief to people who travel south for the winter to know that the surviving partner just has one phone call to make, and everything is taken care of.""

Whether you want to personalize your own service or relieve your loved ones of difficult decisions, prearranging your funeral could be a smart move.

Now, after nearly two decades of operating under the Boyd brand, the auto body repair shop is reverting back to its roots of being family owned and operated, under the respected name, Circuit Collision.

Gerry Sly, the original and operating owner of Circuit Collision said that it is important for him to surround his business with people who care about the customers and the community. “The majority of our work comes from the local community,” Sly explained, “we still have customers coming here that we serviced back in our ‘old days.’”

article continues below

Sly started out as an apprentice in the auto body repair industry in the 60s, when he met his business partner, Jock. Soon after, the two mechanics opened their own frame and suspension shop in Port Moody. It was not until 1980 when Sly and his business partner built the shop at the location where Circuit Collision is currently located, and expanded into auto body work as well. In the late 90s, Circuit Collision became the first Boyd franchise shop. Looking back, it is easy to see that throughout its long history of auto body repair, servicing the community has always been the number one priority at Sly’s shop, regardless of the name.

Perhaps this is why Circuit Collision’s long list of loyal customers continues to grow after nearly five decades.

Working primarily on cars that have been in accidents or that need automotive glass repairs, the staff at Circuit Collision are a dedicated and experienced crew. There is little they have not seen. Returning to the trusted and beloved name of Circuit Collision, the Coquitlam shop will continue to help and serve its community any way it can.

That’s what a group of tea enthusiasts found when they explored the rituals and experienced the benefits of the centuries-old drink. And since 2016, they have passed on their knowledge at the Belcarra Seasonglass Tea Festival.

article continues below

This year, it runs over a pair of three-day sessions - July 12-14 and 19-21 at Camp Howdy in Belcarra where the 8 Corners Organic Tea Room provides the setting for not only drinking tea against the backdrop of a lush, soothing environment, but a place where appreciation and learning about green tea’s benefits takes place.

“We chose a space we felt was less of a concrete jungle and more in tune with nature,” says Daniel Kim, general manager at Camp Howdy where the tea room is located and one of the tea lovers that helped establish the site.

During the group’s first festival they ran the tea room, which was so popular many visitors asked if it was open year round.

Now, it operates seasonally, hosting tea workshops, with the aim to serve tea all year.

Those taking in the tea festivals over the years generally came based on curiosity, says Linda Ko, one of the directors who runs tea room.

“But when they arrived, they realized there’s more to simple tea drinking than meets the eye,” she says, adding the health benefits differ from person to person, but remain numerous and effective.

For her, the symptoms of hay fever abated over time. In Kim’s case, green tea’s natural diuretic properties were a solution to quelling kidney stones.

And the overall sense of calmness and clarity that descends when consuming green tea is a unique experience.

“Many people start their day with a cup of coffee,” Kim says. “So, to change peoples’ minds about what they are drinking is a very big undertaking.

“But we’re not trying to convert people to drinking tea instead of coffee. We just wanted people to try a really premium green tea.”

“I think if you offer people alternatives that come with health benefits, people seem more inclined to search things like that out,” Ko says.

That, and more is what the Belcarra Seasonglass Tea Festival and 8 Corners Organic Tea Room promote.

After extensive public engagement, two new City-owned lots next to Riley Park and the future Burke Mountain Village are ready for construction. The City has completed all the groundwork on the Smiling Creek sites, including zoning approval for approximately 70 units on a 1.69-hectare lot and 96 units on the adjoining 2.17-hectare lot. The conceptual plan shows a mix of townhouses, duplexes and triplexes — the type of housing that is in high demand in the Lower Mainland.

The Smiling Creek neighbourhood is ideal for people who value living in a dynamic community where they can walk to parks and stores, with easy access to schools and the beautiful natural surroundings of Burke Mountain.

Design guidelines are already on title, which will ensure the City’s vision is brought to life. In the near future, the City will open a public bidding process to find a developer to carry out its plans for the fully serviced land.

“Our approach is unique for a city,” says Curtis Scott, manager of land development. “We look at development from a more holistic viewpoint: how do we create a thriving and comprehensive community?”

For developers, “opportunities like this don’t come up very often,” he adds. “We’ve eliminated a lot of the risks by taking care of the rezoning. It’s turn-key for developers.”

It’s an exciting time for the Burke Mountain community. Riley Park, a 3.5-acre site adjacent to the lots, is set to open in early September. It will have an accessible playground and provide a scenic, peaceful place where people can stroll on trails and gather with friends and family. Plans also include a Discovery Centre and coffee shop to the northeast of the site. Both the park and Smiling Creek sites will be a short walk from the future Burke Mountain Village’s plaza, grocery store, recreation centre, shops and condos.

These are the cities talked about most often, but they aren’t the only places across the country with great opportunities for newcomers.

Young professional applicants with post-secondary education have a better chance of moving to the mentioned cities. If they don’t have a bachelor’s or master’s degree, Canada admits people who are willing to consider other provinces as options.

For those who have only a high school diploma, the best path to citizenship is by going to where the jobs are, says Rachel Gary, COO of Canada Direct. “Be flexible about where you’re willing to move to,” she adds.

The only province that does not require applicants to pass an English test is Manitoba. Manitoba has the most lenient eligibility requirements because it needs people the most, Gary says. Saskatchewan is also making it easier for people to immigrate there for the same reasons.

Environment and weather may play a big factor in why people don’t choose these Prairie provinces as their first choice. Gary suggests that starting in Manitoba or Saskatchewan doesn’t mean it has to be their permanent home. Once immigrants have earned enough points to get resident status, they can apply for jobs in other provinces.

“We can submit their application to move to Vancouver right from the start but I can almost guarantee they won’t be in the pool,” she says. “We always tell them the truth because immigrating to Canada is not a cheap process. We don’t want to submit people’s applications and not get them here. If they only have a high school diploma and want this opportunity to come to Canada, they have to go to Manitoba.”

The same principle applies to the type of work people are willing to do. If they agree to work in the fields with the most demand, they can get their start in Canada and earn the points that lead to residency either on their job or by going to school.

Here are four facts about one of B.C.’s officers of the Legislature.

The Office of the Ombudsperson is independent from the government.

article continues below

As it is often said in their line of work: ""An Ombudsperson is neither an advocate for the complainant nor an apologist for the public body.” They’re impartial and independent and work to improve fairness in the delivery of government services.

The Office of the Ombudsperson receives over 8,000 inquiries each year.

The majority of British Columbians who contact the Office of the Ombudsperson are helped on the spot, such as with a bit of guidance or referral information, or have their complaint resolved within a short time period. Other complaints result in an investigation to determine if the actions of a public authority were fair and reasonable. If they find that the government treated a member of the public unfairly, they look for outcomes that can help that person. They also look for how that one case can be applied in the future. So one case may help many!

The Office of the Ombudsperson regularly goes on the road.

The Office of the Ombudsperson does outreach into communities across B.C., rural and urban. This is an important part of their work. Not everyone has the same access to information – some may not have access to the Internet or to a telephone. There are others whose concerns are best heard in-person. To best meet the needs of all British Columbians, Ombudsperson staff regularly go on the road. Their next event will be in the Greater Vancouver area the week of January 28th, giving residents an opportunity to discuss their complaints about B.C. provincial and local government organizations. No lines or waiting. Call 1-800-567-FAIR (3247) to book a free and confidential appointment.

The Office of the Ombudsperson has jurisdiction over virtually every provincial and local public authority in B.C.

As the B.C. Ombudsperson, Jay Chalke, likes to say, they’re the public’s “one-stop-shop for any fairness concerns.” The public can complain to us about most provincial or local public organization. In addition to provincial government ministries, the Ombudsperson can investigate complaints about crown corporations such as BC Hydro and ICBC, public schools, municipalities, universities, self-governing professions or the health system.

It is an exciting new chapter in the already compelling story of a school that has wasted no time providing parents in the Lower Mainland—particularly Burnaby, New Westminster, and the Tri-Cities—with another choice when searching for a private school.

A private school with a difference

Founded in 2001 with a mission to prepare students for a rapidly changing future, Urban Academy is not a ‘staunchly traditional’ school. For many parents, that’s a major plus, the evidence for which can be found in the school’s rapid growth from 10 Kindergarten/Grade 1 students in 2001 to 180 JK to Grade 12 students today.

With a goal to provide a community-involved school option in New Westminster, Urban Academy got its start. The plan was, and continues to be, simple: develop an environment that connects classroom learning to real life, that allows teachers to be at their best while creating a school that includes parents as partners.

Mindful of the changing world in which we live, the educational approach is to expose students to real world challenges. By allowing them to apply their newly acquired classroom skills to real world examples, they learn early to answer the age-old adage of: why must I learn this? Urban Academy seeks to prepare students to think on their feet, draw on a vast number of experiences with confidence and develop the leadership skills necessary to become the creative innovators of tomorrow.

This ambitious thinking is also reflected in Urban Academy’s new campus, which might just challenge your perception of what a school should look like, and how it should feel.

Opportunity knocks for young minds

The countdown to JK and Kindergarten enrollment for Fall 2018 has already started. If you are one of the many parents who are still working through their checklist of what to look for in a school, here’s a quick tour of what Urban Academy offers you and, more importantly, your child.

Numbers that add up for discerning parents

The reimagined campus, handily located for road and transit access, raises the bar for private school facilities, while enhancing Urban Academy’s growing reputation for combining academic learning with real-life skills building.

· 50,000 sq ft of varied educational, lab, music, sports, and dynamic learning spaces

· 4,000+ sq ft gymnasium

· Seven custom-design and built outdoor areas for play, study, and leisure

· Five storeys of Grade-specific and multi-purpose learning spaces

· 15 minutes by car from Burnaby, Surrey, and the Tri-Cities

· Average maximum class sizes of 16 to 18 students

Built for enquiring minds

The school’s new classrooms have been planned with flexibility in mind to create engaging and diverse learning spaces, and all rooms are wired for the latest technologies. Even the library combines the traditional library space with a technology lab to create an innovative environment that fuses old ideas with new thinking. There are also fully equipped science labs. If you want to see the future of learning, this is it.

Space to grow

Urban Academy is doing its level best to create a place where students feel they can do things they enjoy, and explore new and diverse interests. That includes a full-size gymnasium, music areas, art rooms, and a performance space and theatre that can host 150 people. Topping it all off is a rooftop patio for older students to create gardens and work on science projects.

Designed for all ages

The new campus acknowledges the different needs of the various age groups. There are designated learning spaces for Junior Kindergarten, Kindergarten, Intermediate, Middle School, and Secondary school students. However, there are also flexible learning spaces everyone can enjoy, including a large multi-purpose area and kitchen that’s open to all. It feels like a community as well as a school.

Can you imagine a place your children will actually look forward to going to every day? Urban Academy didn’t just imagine it; they’re building it.

Kids enrolled in a CSF school spend their days learning and living in French. But what happens when they come home?

Speaking a minority language in a community where everyone else primarily speaks English is not easy.

""In our school, we have about 25 different languages other than French or English being spoken at home,"" says Eric Leclerc, principal of l'école des Pionniers-de-Maillardville a CSF high school in Port Coquitlam. ""We work together to celebrate all languages and cultures in addition to offering support to our students and parents who speak French.""

Here are a few tips from CSF to support your child while they learn in French while navigating life in a predominately English-speaking community:

· Make French a priority: If you're a francophone yourself, make speaking French at home part of your daily life – not a chore to be associated only with homework. For French immersion parents, consider learning French along with your child. You can practice together.

· Play in French: Kids of all ages love to play games. Consider playing board or computer games, such as Scrabble, in French. Check with the school or local library for a French version of popular games such as Monopoly. Online games can be played with people from all over the world; encourage your teenager to play with French-speaking participants.

· Watch & Listen in French: Tune the television into a French channel; pick a French film; listen to the news on Radio-Canada together. Or watch out for a CSF school play production in your community!

· Enrol in French clubs:Check with your CSF school or local library for French-speaking clubs or activities, such as sports or hobbies, in your community. If you don't find one, consider starting a group and encouraging your child's French-speaking or French-learning friends to join.

· Travel in French:Book your next holiday in a French-speaking destination. There are 40 countries in the world where French is an official language. Want to stay in Canada? Take a trip to Québec or New Brunswick.

· Don't forget the grandparents: If your child has French-speaking grandparents, make sure they're involved. Even if they live far away, they can Skype or Facetime with their grandchild. Grandparents have interesting stories to tell and are usually eager to share their lives and heritage.

Make sure French is part of your child's out-of-school activities and you will be supporting them to be fully bilingual for the rest of their life.

Why guided injections might be your best option,[],,"There are many different treatment options for those suffering from chronic pain, each having different levels of success depending on the person and the underlying condition.

MedRay Imaging in Coquitlam is introducing a new therapy called image-guided pain management injections. According to Medray COO, Randy Webster, it’s a form of treatment that can be highly effective for those suffering from chronic back, neck or joint pain.

“Many people notice significant improvement after 1 or 2 treatments, and some require ongoing treatments 3 or 4 times per year,” he says. “They can play with their kids again, go back to work, and engage in physical activity that they otherwise couldn’t.”

As everyone is different, it is important for patients to find the therapy that works best for them and their situation. According to Webster, there are primarily four types of treatments available for people suffering from chronic pain:

1. Paramedical services. These include acupuncture, physiotherapy and massage therapy. They can take the edge off the pain and help resolve a number of mobility issues, but may not help address the underlying reason for chronic pain, Webster says.

2. Pain medication.Opiates and pain suppressors are a very effective treatment option for patients with high levels of pain, but can lead to other health problems if taken for extended periods of time, such as gastro-intestinal issues, liver problems, or the potential for addiction. Furthermore, their effectiveness can wear off over time.

3. Blind injections. Physicians inject medicine in the pain site, without image guidance. They hit the right spot a good portion of the time, according to Webster, but without image-guidance, there is the risk the injection misses the mark.

4. Guided injections. These injections use specialized equipment (C-arm fluoroscopic and ultrasound machines) operated by physicians. With the help of live x-ray or ultrasound technology to ensure the needle enters the appropriate site, the physician injects a small amount of contrast agent to confirm the needle is properly positioned. Finally, the physician injects local freezing, such as a corticosteroid or a hyaluronan agent. It can be highly effective in treating chronic pain, as well as a helping those people who are on waiting lists for surgery (as well as those for whom surgery isn’t an option).

MedRay Imaging is launching image-guided pain management services in June, says Webster. The guided injections are covered by the Medical Services Plan of B.C., and the medication can be covered by extended health insurance plans.

While SFU Camps appeal to just about everyone, Stockley said they are the perfect introduction to higher education.

“We really want to encourage these campers to become university students, to aspire and to dream and to push themselves, whether it’s educationally or athletically,” Stockley said.

Situated on SFU’s beautiful Burnaby Mountain campus, most of the camp staff are university students or recent graduates. Having these mentors, Stockley added, really fosters a learning and educational environment. With the diverse magnitude of campers who join each year, it is also the perfect place to explore the local community with youth from around the Lower Mainland, and to get exposed to other cultures beyond our borders. Camps range from athletics to educational and provide young learners with the chance to meet campers from around the world. After all, SFU has one of the most demographically diverse campuses in the area, which is one of the reasons it draws so many students from every corner of the globe.

As the SFU summer camp program has grown over the decades, so too has the number of younger campers. “Our university campus is an expanding community so we have campers as young as four years old” Stockley said, adding that “the sooner a child is introduced and socialized to the global world and international culture, the better.”

With an estimated 8,000 campers participating in SFU Summer Camps this year, it will no doubt be an exceptional opportunity for campers to meet new people, build relationships, and make friends from around the world.

So what should you look for when picking a Greek restaurant in the Lower Mainland?

According to Noori, CEO of Dinakis Mediterranean Grill, it’s all about the ingredients.

article continues below

“Customers shouldn’t just settle for good,” says Noori, whose restaurant was voted the People’s Choice Best Greek Restaurant for Foodpages.ca for the past six years. “They should expect the very best.”

Opening its doors in 2010, Dinakis Mediterranean Grill has earned a reputation for serving some of the best authentic Greek food in the Lower Mainland, including such popular dishes as roast lamb, dry ribs, moussaka, and tiramisu.

“We draw from many different segments of the population – young people, seniors, different cultures, genders and languages,” he says. “That’s the beauty of authentic Greek cuisine and brings people together: there’s something for everyone.”

Here are Noori’s suggestions for what to look for when planning your next authentic Greek dining experience:

1. Make sure it’s homemade: Roast lamb, lamb souvlaki and moussaka are three customer-favourites at Dinakis Mediterranean Grill, but that wouldn’t be the case if they weren’t made from scratch, says Noori.

“Consider the moussaka,” he says. “It has multiple layers, so if it’s not fresh and it’s not made from scratch—and if the chef hasn’t put her love and passion into each step of the process—the effect is compounded and the dish will suffer. If layered food is just slapped together, the customer will know right away.”

2. Where does the food come from? “The uniqueness and authenticity of the food starts before the preparation,” says Noori. “It’s not just the ingredients, it’s where you buy them from. The right supplier can make all the difference.”

3. How is the food presented? “When we cook, plate and present the food, our goal is to highlight the uniqueness of the dish,” says Noori. “Certain flavours or sections of the food are emphasized. But this can only be done in an authentic setting with people who know the history of the food and the best way to present it.”

287,tricitynews,https://www.tricitynews.com/standout/smaller-class-sizes-benefit-everyone-1.23154079,Smaller class sizes benefit everyone,[],,"With public school class sizes in the Lower Mainland reaching unmanageable heights, parents have begun searching for schools offering smaller class sizes for their children. A 2014 study by the National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE) reveals that students in smaller classes consistently outperform those in larger ones. This is especially true for elementary school students who require more one-on-one attention than older children do. Other studies have found that elementary students in small classes are more engaged in learning and display less disruptive behaviour as compared to students in larger classes.

Since its inception in New Westminster, the private school Urban Academy has been committed to embracing the small class philosophy by keeping class sizes to between 14 to 18 students.

And the school, which offers Junior Kindergarten through Grade 12 courses, will continue to offer small class sizes when it relocates its campus to a brand new facility located near Braid Skytrain Station in Fall 2018. Says Cheryle Beaumont, the Head of School for four years: “We’ve always had a policy of restricting class sizes so that they’re large enough for a good social dynamic but small enough for individual attention.”

Small class sizes don’t mean small classrooms, though. Spanning five storeys and over 50,000 square feet, the new campus has more than enough space to accommodate multiple smaller-sized classes. In order to meet the needs of all types of students and learners, the school has constructed movable walls which both maximize and open up the learning spaces. These classrooms will also be outfitted with the most up-to-date technology, including fibre-optic connectivity.

At Urban Academy, learning isn’t just confined to the four walls of a classroom. In fact, the small class sizes allow teachers to take students outside of the classroom more easily, says Beaumont. Embracing the benefits of outdoor learning, the school’s outdoor education curriculum encourages students to take risks and challenge themselves physically, and to demonstrate courage and leadership through new experiences.

Students can expect to have over 75 hours of outdoor education per year, and the new campus will have seven outdoor learning spaces to help support the students as well. In addition to the outdoor program, students have access to the school’s new full-sized 4,000 square foot gymnasium. Students are encouraged to participate in both traditional sports such as soccer or basketball as well as more unique pass-times such as curling and fencing.

The new campus is conveniently located just steps from the Skytrain, at 100 Braid Street. Applications are now being accepted for Fall 2018 intake.

Because we're licensed and regulated by the Federal Government through the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy, we can also offer alternatives to bankruptcy, such as a consumer proposal.""

A Licensed Insolvency Trustee is the only professional that can file a proposal, including a consumer proposal, or a bankruptcy. No one else can.

Most people shy away from talking about their debt problems, but David says that tackling the issue early is key to benefiting from his help.

We're the only professionals authorized to file consumer proposals or a bankruptcy, whichever option makes sense for your situation.

Individual players pick a theme and donate items that Di Tomaso then elegantly packages together in a gift basket that includes personalized elements, such as the player’s number in the basket’s bow.

One of her favourite Dice and Ice Canucks baskets was put together bythe coaching staff a few years ago. It was a team duffel bag filled with the team training apparel, used play sheets, coaching books, autographed items, and to finish it off, a box of bright pink Original Bubblicious, a brand of gum the coaches were famous for chewing during games.

Not only does a hospital need the right health care team in place, but it also requires the right equipment to save lives when every second counts.

That’s why Tri-Cities based Eagle Ridge Hospital Foundation is asking the community for help purchasing a new generation Lifepak Transport Monitor with Defibrillator, which is vital for monitoring, stabilizing and at times resuscitating patients while they are being transferred. This piece of equipment alerts nurses and physicians of life-threatening complications, and its defibrillator can even bring patients back to life in certain situations if their hearts stop.

“Every hour of every day, our emergency department is open to care for you,” says Dr. Ali Abdalvand, Emergency Department Head at Eagle Ridge Hospital. “But, even with the very best in health care professionals on your side, we cannot do our very best for you without the equipment we need.”

Last year, over 53,000 patients and their families came to Eagle Ridge Hospital’s emergency department in need of critical care. Time is of the essence when diagnosis and treatment require enhanced services not available at Eagle Ridge, and patients must transfer to a centre with a higher level of care.

“When these transfers happen, our health care team relies on trusted high performance medical equipment to provide critical and lifesaving care,” Dr. Abdalvand says. “This is why our emergency department is in need of a second transport monitor with defibrillator, to give people in need of transfer a fighting chance.”

The purchase of a new transport monitor is part of the Foundation’s 2020 Have a Heart Campaign, with a goal of raising $80,000 for the new piece of equipment.

“The response from our community has been phenomenal,” says Charlene Giovannetti-King, Executive Director of Eagle Ridge Hospital Foundation. “We’re currently just under 65 percent of our goal to purchase this piece of equipment and are pleased to announce the support of donor, Bill Dick, who recently challenged his fellow community members with a matching gift up to $16,000.”

By funding the new transport monitor, the community is contributing to Eagle Ridge Hospital’s expansion as a whole. The expansion of Eagle Ridge Hospital will transform health care in the Tri-Cities by expanding the emergency, cardiology and community outpatient services departments.

“It’s the same deal with dentures as it is for other kinds of mouth care,” says Austin Denture Clinic denturist Boris Eroshevski. “Dentists recommend a visit twice a year for your teeth, and your local denturist recommends the same schedule for you and your dentures.”

The human body is constantly changing. And that means your gums are changing, too. Unfortunately, dentures don’t change to suit your gums, so after a while, they need to be adjusted.

Loose dentures are a leading cause of discomfort for denture wearers. If your dentures are loose for too long, you run the risk of irritation, and that can lead to sores or infection. Rebasing or relining your dentures every two years or so will address this issue. In many cases, regular check-ups will prevent it from ever occurring.

“Ill-fitting dentures can cause more harm than a lack of cleaning,” says Boris. “Check-ups are the best way to prevent dentures from becoming loose. Always keep in mind that while dentures don’t change, your gums do.”

While not as potentially harmful as a bad fit, a lack of cleaning can lead to a shorter shelf-life for your dentures and poor health for you. A thorough and professional cleaning is recommended twice yearly to take care of plaque and tartar.

Dentures are prone to bacteria just as natural teeth are. The bacteria will grow on the denture and in your mouth, especially if daily cleaning is missed, and this can cause fungus and hygiene problems.

“The bacteria found on dentures can be bad for your health,” Boris says. “Regular check-ups will eliminate it. We will all lose our teeth, but there is no reason to become less healthy because of it.”

""The root canal is the chamber inside the tooth that houses the blood vessels and nerve supply,"" Dr. Parhar explains. ""Every tooth has this chamber and the soft tissue inside this chamber is referred to as the pulp. The function of this chamber is to help the tooth develop—and to protect the tooth.”

article continues below

While the chamber carries on functioning as we age, various causes can make it susceptible to infection.

""Infection can come from an untreated cavity or crack,"" Dr. Parhar notes, ""or trauma like an accident or sports injury. Once bacteria enter the tooth and cause infection, you get a toothache. There could be ongoing pain, or sensitivity to hot or cold items.""

To combat the infection and save the tooth, Dr. Parhar and his team at Tri-City Endodontics remove the infected contents of the chamber.

""We take everything out of there,"" he says. ""We disinfect the chamber and replace the soft tissue, or pulp, with an anti-bacterial filling so it won't become infected again.""

While the procedure sounds straightforward, it requires an advanced level of dentistry training including high-level training in the use of microscopes and cone beam computed tomography scanners (CBCT) to take high-resolution 3-D images.

""CBCT allows us to have a complete view of the tooth and bone using ultra low radiation,"" says Dr. Parhar. ""A typical CBCT scan produces about the same amount of radiation as three digital dental ex-rays.""

Often the root canal procedure requires more than one visit. According to Dr. Parhar, a patient may need to visit Tri-City Endodontics three or more times.

""One to two visits is pretty typical for a simple, straightforward procedure,"" he says. ""If the tooth can be adequately cleaned, we'll complete the root canal in one visit. However, if the tooth takes a long time to heal, you may need three or four visits. Every tooth and infection is different, which is why we spend time with scans and x-rays to come up with the best possible treatment plan.""

While Dr. Parhar prefers to save the tooth through a root canal procedure, there may be times when this is not possible.

""If the tooth has had a lot of work done to it over the years, then the tooth may weaken over time. For example, if the tooth has had several fillings or even a previous root canal, it may no longer be structurally sound. While in most cases it's better to save the tooth, if it's too weak, extraction may be a better option.""

Although some may seem independent or withdrawn, a happy cat can be one of the most affectionate, playful beings out there.

Dr. Leah Montgomery, the veterinarian at Meadow Brook Cat Clinic, knows a thing or two about keeping cats happy and healthy, and what their owners, or guardians, can do to facilitate this.

article continues below

1. When your cat feels under the weather, try bringing it to a cat-only clinic. At Meadow Brook Cat Clinic, everything from the design of the exam room to the size of the equipment used is tailored for cats. Montgomery says this can help cats feel more comfortable, relaxed, and can even help your cat’s recovery.

2. Give them lots of toys. Cats are hunters by nature, so giving them a job or something to do is critical. Montgomery says food puzzles are a great way to get your cat to ‘hunt’ or work for its food.

3. Start thinking high. Montgomery says cats are three dimensional creatures, meaning they like to use vertical spaces as well. Cat trees are a good start, and perhaps think about hanging benches or shelves for your cat to play and rest in.

4. Feed them the appropriate food. Montgomery suggests incorporating wet food into your cat’s everyday diet. It can help with digestion, hydration, and weight control.

5. Making sure the litter box is something your cat is happy and comfortable using. Try to put it in a place where the cat is relaxed and feels safe. “Also use litter boxes that don’t have covers – ones that have them are like cat outhouses, and no one wants to use an outhouse,” Montgomery said.

Cats are a lot smarter than people give them credit for, Montgomery said. Bad behaviour, she continued, is often a result of stress or boredom, which can lead to health issues. In what can be a potentially vicious cycle of stress and health issues, Montgomery said it is important for your cat to be under the care of people who understand it. That is why Montgomery opened Meadow Brook Cat Clinic, the only clinic you and your cat will ever need.

Rest Your Head: Set on an expansive double lot in a community nestled on the hill overlooking Gibsons Marina, The Seasalt Cottage is a quiet home base from which to explore Gibsons Landing and the nearby towns of Sechelt and Roberts Creek. The owner, Michele, has lovingly renovated the two guest suites—one on the ground level and one on the “Upper Deck,” in the complex in which she resides with her adorable French bulldog, Chloe.Each suite is bright and stylishly decorated with plush furnishings and marine-inspired décor touches (think seashells and a white and blue pastel colour scheme). Both guest units boast soaker tubs, TVs/Netflix, wifi and kitchenettes which are perfect for those wanting to stay for more than a couple of nights (and who wouldn’t want that when this adorable pup is one of your hosts?).

While the interiors are pristine and calming, the exterior space at The Seasalt Cottage is truly spectacular. Both suites have their own private patios where guests can enjoy a glass of wine while relaxing and enjoying the refreshing sea breeze. These terraces extend onto a huge garden filled where undulating pathways winding past lush bushes, vines and flowers.

Michele has created a few different seating areas nestled within the garden where guests can while away summer afternoons swaying in one of the suspended rocking chairs while taking in views of the sparkling sea and listening to the sound of water trickling from the fountains installed throughout the garden. Guests can also make use of the communal barbecue, grilling up seafood bought at the Gibsons Farmer’s Market (or caught on a fishing trip) and enjoying it in the outdoor dining area under a grapevine-covered arbour.

Wine & Dine: Just a three-minute walk down the hill from The Seasalt Cottage you’ll find an array of hip boutiques, coffee shops, restaurants and pubs at Gibsons Landing. My friend Fran and I arrived late on a Friday night and as soon as we dropped our bags in our suite we made a beeline to Tapworks pub, on Michele’s recommendation. The brewery has recently expanded from a hole-in-the-wall behind Gibsons Art Gallery to a two-level hotspot to see-and-be-seen while sipping locally crafted brews.

After ascending to the second floor, Fran and I made ourselves comfortable next to the firepit and ordered beer tasting flights, flatbread and spinach and artichoke dip from the snack menu. It wasn’t long before we had made friends with a couple of folks in their sixties who were visiting from West Vancouver and a group of twenty-somethings who were in town from Kitsilano. By the end of the night, we were playing board games with our new friends in the pub’s first-floor area. I mentioned to Fran later that night that it was Gibsons’ friendly small-town vibe that had likely inspired us to bond with complete strangers so quickly: if we had encountered the same people in a Vancouver bar we probably wouldn’t have connected in the same way.

Other notable (and super hip) dining experiences in Gibsons include Buono Osteria, a new Italian restaurant with a warm ambiance that overlooks the marina. Opened by Wally Buono’s son, the eatery serves traditional Italian fare with a modern twist, as well as excellent wines. Fran and I loved the locally foraged wild mushroom Bucatini with celery root and sherry cream. For happy hour drinks, super fresh oysters and a fun environment, head to Smitty’s Oyster House which is set right on the water. Next door Lunitas Mexican Eatery serves up beer, margaritas and excellent Mexican fare.

No trip to Gibsons is complete without a meal at the infamous Molly’s Reach restaurant which made its mark in the ’70s as one of the locations in the infamous Beachcombers series. On Day 2, Fran and I started our morning with a bacon and egg breakfast at the eatery while listening to Elvis tunes and overlooking Gibsons Marina.

Later in the day we had coffee at the locally owned and operated Beachcomber Coffee shop, an energetic little place located right on Gibsons’ Gower Point strip. I loved the unexpected, youthful vibe of the space known for its neon yellow and green branding and club-style music. On the last morning of my stay, after Fran had returned to Vancouver, I sat on the patio for a couple of hours, drinking coffee and snacking on pastries from Sandy’s Bake Shoppe down the street, people-watching, chatting with the locals and listening as they caught up on life.

Explore: The Sunshine Coast is a haven for nature-lovers so hiking, kayaking, fishing and beach-going are givens for visitors to the area. Soames Hill is a beautiful intermediate hike that we completed in about an hour and rewarded us with spectacular views of the Georgia Strait and Keats and Bowen Islands. Davis Bay is a beautiful beach to park yourself for the day with a blanket and a book. And for breathtaking sunsets Bonniebrook beach comes highly recommended by the locals I chatted with a Beachcomber Coffee.

But there is also lots to do right in Gibsons. You could spend a few hours visiting the many shops and boutiques along the strip which sell well-curated homewares and local art, as we did. And the Gibsons Public Market, opened in March 2017, is a fun place to pick up local cheeses, fresh fish, produce and flowers, and to visit the Nicholas Sonntag Marine Education Centre which temporarily holds local marine life in its tanks until they are returned to their natural habitat.

After spending a weekend getting to know Gibsons, it’s strange for me to think that it was once a town I’d drive through, without a thought, on my way to Sechelt. Now I realize it’s a gem in its own right—and I’ll definitely be back the next time I want a fun and laid back experience just a boat ride from Vancouver.

Card says being a successful real estate agent is all about building relationships and communicating with clients.

“When I’m working with a client I’m in pretty much constant communication with them, letting them know what’s going on, keeping them updated,” Card says. “I’m always available.”

That attitude is also reflected in his approach to community involvement. When Card isn’t putting houses on the market or closing a real estate deal, he is volunteering for a worthy cause.

Card is on the board of directors for the PLAY (Professional Live Arts for Youth) Society. He is also a sponsor of the Coquitlam Express and supports the Royal LePage Shelter Foundation.

Card, who grew up in Coquitlam, was Macdonald Realty’s 2015 Rookie of the Year before switching to Royal LePage West R.E.S. in 2016. He is also a certified negotiation expert.

Card sees himself primarily as a consultant, guiding his clients through the Lower Mainland real estate market with as little stress as possible.

As a consultant, Card doesn’t limit his conversations with clients to real estate. Buying or selling a home can be very taxing, and he is available to discuss anything that might worry a client during the process.

Whether he’s writing offers late into the night or taking potential buyers to see houses on a holiday, Card makes his clients’ goals his priority.

“A Realtor® is just as helpful when demand is high,” explains Phil Haig, award-winning Realtor® and the leader of Team Phil Haig.“A Realtor® handles all the negotiations, markets your home so as to generate the maximum number of offers, and does all the paper work. And most of all, they’re highly skilled at doing so. And as members of the Canadian Real Estate Association, they abide by an extensive Code of Ethics.”

In other words, even when the market is as hot as it is today in Vancouver, a Realtor® still makes the most sense.

“I’ve brought offers to people who are already happy with the offer they have,” says Phil. “But when they see that the offer I found is $125,000 higher than the one they have in-hand, they are happy to pay a small commission for the higher offer.”

Phil is also quick to point out that top Realtors® like those at Team Phil Haig have dedicated marketing directors, too.

“Gloria Lueck, our Marketing Director, has more than two decades of experience,” says Phil. “That makes a big difference when you’re trying to make sure your home gets the visibility it needs.”

Over 95% of Vancouver homes are sold by Realtors®, says Haig, and according to him, there’s no substitute, especially if the Realtor® has a background in construction.

“A realtor can tell you about the community, about the nearby facilities, shopping centres, and commute times,” says Haig. “But my team also knows about the houses themselves. Both Karan Sood, my Team Leader, and I come from a construction background, so we know houses from the ground up.”

“People are sometimes surprised at what a Realtor®can do,” Haig adds. “Often, people don’t see the benefit of a Realtor®until they experience it first-hand.”

""We support our veterans, for sure, but we also sponsor events in the community, including kids' sports, such as soccer teams and baseball teams.""

Legion volunteers work to raise funds for local hospitals, such as Eagle Ridge Hospital, and seniors' care homes, in addition to helping individual war veterans both young and old.

""We raised money for a service dog for one of our younger veterans who came back after a tour of duty in Afghanistan with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),"" Bob says. ""We've purchased a furnace for a veteran's widow and we've helped folks get hearing aids and assisted an older veteran with his rent.""

Local businesses can help the Legion by donating goods or services, either for use in the Legion itself or to benefit people in the community.

""Behr Paint came and painted the Legion,"" Bob notes, ""and a local auto mechanic has donated his services to help. We're very appreciative of any and all the help the community gives us.""

An easy way community members could help the Legion is by holding their own fundraisers at the Branch or by renting the facilities.

""We support local kids' sports teams,"" Bob explains, ""but I don't think Mom and Dad realize that when it comes time to hold their own fundraising events, we'd love to see them held here. We have everything you need for an event – a great kitchen, bar, and even entertainment.""

The Branch also has rooms to rent for local businesses that are looking for a place to hold a seminar or team meeting.

The unique new bounce park has so much going on, it can be hard to keep track of it all.

“Trampoline dodgeball is the most fun ever,” says owner Morey Chaplick.

article continues below

Ultimate dodgeball is not your gym teacher’s game. It happens on a trampoline court, with people bounding away from bouncing balls and having a great time doing it.

The jump park has regular pickup games and also holds Ultimate Dodgeball Tournaments for the truly dedicated.

But dodgeball isn’t the only sport improved by trampolines. Sky Zone also offers Sky Slam, where everyone finally has a chance to dunk a basket while getting some pretty fantastic air. The trampoline launch pads send jumpers flying 10 feet up.

“I’ve got guys who can basically do a 720 and dunk it behind their back,” Chaplick says. “That takes skill, though.”

Trampolines add a whole other aspect to regular fitness, as well, providing a low-impact workout. MMA fighters such as Randy Couture use trampolines in their training for that very reason.

But it’s not just for fighters in the UFC. SkyRobics at Sky Zone combines calisthenics, core exercises and strength-building aerobics for a workout ideal for just about anyone. Plus it burns up to 1,000 calories per hour, making it a highly effective form of exercise.

For those just looking for fun, Sky Zone has that, too. The Foam Zone gives people the chance to experience weightlessness by diving into a pit filled with 10,000 foam blocks. There are also free jump courts where jumpers can practice tricks in the wall-to-wall trampolines and just enjoy bouncing around.

And jumpers who can’t make up their mind are welcome, too. Open Jump gives jumpers the chance to try it all – the free jump courts, Ultimate Dodgeball, Sky Slam, and the Foam Zone.

Jumpers of all ages and abilities are welcome at the facility, so long as they’re willing to follow the rules, Chaplick says.

“There are so few places where you can go having literally no skill and still have a good time!”

Dr. Sun adds that her biggest priority is making sure that the client in her chair gets a service that meets their long-term needs. She says, ""A lot of people are embarrassed to come to the dentist because perhaps they haven’t been in in a long time. I really believe in a nonjudgmental approach.

Are you regularly experiencing pain, stiffness, swelling, redness, and/or an overall decrease in mobility?

Instead of reaching for the painkillers and anti-inflammatories—and before you decide on surgery—you should consider laser light therapy.

article continues below

An alternative treatment for osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and gout, laser light therapy is a highly effective treatment for arthritis and other causes of joint inflammation, and it’s been practiced locally by Dr. Pam Bennett and her team at Tri-City Laser Light Therapy in Coquitlam since 2008.

“We have numerous stories and experiences with patients who have regained a pain-free lifestyle,” says Dr. Bennett, who owns Tri-City Laser Light Therapy and leads the clinic’s team of five certified laser therapists. “In many instances, the patients have been able to avoid surgery altogether.”

Non-invasive and non-toxic laser light therapy works by applying light energy to the body, energizing cells to repair damaged tissues, and reduce inflammation and pain.

It’s a natural, non-destructive form of therapy that allows patients to avoid relying on pharmaceuticals or other types of more invasive treatment. In the five decades since laser light therapy was first introduced, no adverse side effects have been reported, says Dr. Bennett.

69 year old Dor Darwin underwent laser light therapy treatment for her severe neck pain.

""I was desperate for relief from the unrelenting pain in my neck,” says Dor. “I had previously tried acupuncture, massage, and botox injections all with no relief. After a few sessions of laser light therapy I was surprised at the relief I got, with diminished neck spasm, less headache and improving back spasms. I would highly recommend this procedure—it really works, is fast acting and is completely painless.""

Helping patients feel confident and comfortable with their smiles, Rav and the rest of the staff at Burke Mountain Denture Clinic know that there is more to dentures than just oral health.

“I’m really passionate about what I do, I really care about people’s mouths and their oral health and restoring smiles,” the denturist said.

Originally hailing from Edmonton, Alberta, Rav came to the west coast in 2001 and never looked back. He says it is the beautiful nature that surrounds him and the hometown feel that is native to the Tri-Cities that has kept him here. Yet, Rav says it is the people who make up the community that is truly special. “When I first came here to do my practicum, one of the first things I noticed about Port Coquitlam was the community’s sense of welcoming,” he said.

Rav, who has been the primary denturist at Burke Mountain Denture Clinic since 2007, understands that every patient is different. That is why every set of dentures is crafted by hand. “Every mouth is different and every smile is different,” he said. “We make sure we achieve that in our work where we create natural looking dentures and make people confident about their smiles again.” Likewise, a denture can help to fill in gaps that can start to show up in you teeth and restore your confidence and sense of well being. If you are concerned about the fit of a denture or you desire another option beyond a conventional denture, a great treatment of choice will be dentures over implants.

Helping people with their confidence and their ability to smile was something Rav was always interested in doing. When he learned the extent of just how much craftsmanship goes into being a denturist, he fell in love with his profession. Working with people, educating his patients about denture and dental care, and giving people options are three main tenets that make up his work philosophy.

The clinic provides complimentary consultations and free denture cleaning and polish to all new patients. To learn more about denture options, visit Burke Mountain Denture Clinic’s website, call 604-944-4910, or email bmdclinic@telus.net. You can also find them on Facebook.",[]

Dental care is just as important to pets as it is to people, and problems with the teeth and gums can indicate or even cause major health problems.

article continues below

The main sign of dental problems is bad breath, according to Dr. Leah Montgomery, owner and veterinarian at the Shaughnessy Veterinary Hospitalin Port Coquitlam.

“If you can smell that breath from across the room, your pet probably needs dental,” Montgomery says. “We’ll often look in the pet’s mouth and see the teeth are just caked with tartar.”

If an animal’s teeth aren’t properly cared for, it can lead to major extractions, infections and even heart disease.

According to veterinary dentists, the best way to protect an animal’s teeth is to brush them every day, using toothpaste meant specifically for pets. However, this can be a difficult task, especially with small dogs, which often have tiny mouths with crowded teeth.

If it’s a struggle to get that toothbrush in your pet’s mouth for a good cleaning, there are other products that can help, such as dental chews, dental formula diets and water additives. Need advice? A veterinarian can recommend the best products for your pet. And if a deeper cleaning is needed, the veterinarian can take care of that, too.

“Sometimes, even with all the dental work you do, if the teeth are crowded, routine dental cleanings under anesthetic are the best thing for them,” Crichton says.

Cleaning under anesthetic allows for a more thorough cleaning, with scaling and polishing, while also being less traumatic for pets. Vets can also do dental X-rays and check for gum disease.

Keeping pets’ teeth clean and taking them to regular dental checkups helps maintain their health and overall well-being. It can also prevent future health conditions and diseases.

“At the end of the day,” says Montgomery, “it’s well worth the time and effort it takes.”

“Our head chef has extensive experience with Italian, Persian, Central Asian, and East Asian food,” he adds. “Every dish is prepared with the same level of care, attention and love—and with such a diverse menu, we have something for every taste.”

“We operate according to the philosophy that the customer comes in happy, stays happy, leaves happy and comes back happy,” says Noori. “Customer satisfaction is what inspires us to serve the best possible food in the most enjoyable environment. It’s not easy to do—but it’s worth it when you see how happy our customers are.”

Birthdays, anniversaries, and grads… wine lovers, foodies, and sports fanatics. Michelle Di Tomaso of Bella Gift Baskets has custom designed gift baskets for nearly every type of occasion or personality type. Once she even created a gift basket for a newly published author that incorporated the book’s cover in the bow of the present!

So what does she think are the four top occasions when a gift basket really does say it all?

article continues below

1. The ‘So Sorry’ Basket. Di Tomaso recalls a customer who had invited a dozen friends golfing to Palm Springs. “It happened to be over Easter Weekend, so you know what he did? He sent gift baskets with beautiful flowers and gourmet products to the wives of the other golfers and a note that said ‘Sorry for taking your husbands away. Hope this makes up for it.’ It was perfect… and he was forgiven”

2. The Housewarming Basket. When a development company wanted to give unique housewarming gift baskets to owners in a new condo that featured a well-appointed communal BBQ, Di Tomaso came up with a gift basket that played on that theme. Using a double-handle aluminum folding green shopping basket, she included Fraser Valley Gourmet’s Almond Butter Crunch, Rick’s Rub Tuscan Seasoning, Chef Ann Kirsebom’s Whistler Gourmet BBQ Sauce, Efferve Sparkling Lemonade, two mason jar drinking mugs, a red and white checked picnic table cloth, BBQ tongs, BBQ hamburger flipper, skewers, BBQ brush, BBQ oven mitt and a corporate logo in the bow!

3. Executive Assistants Appreciation Day Baskets. The EA is the person who usually buys gifts on their boss’s behalf. But who buys for the EA on behalf of their boss? “I have seen executives become completely lost when their EA quits,” says Di Tomaso, “and the number-one reason EA’s leave is because they feel unappreciated. I have a few clients who order personalized baskets from me for their EA's birthday, Administrative Assistant Day and Christmas. The card is always personally signed by their boss and the basket is made specifically for the EA. It never fails to let them know that they’re important.”

4. Baby BasketsOur baby baskets are personalized to not just for baby, but for the family. We all have heard of the sibling who wasn’t exactly elated at the arrival of their little brother or sister. We solve that by including a gift for them as well. It has gone over so well. And if Dad has a favourite sports team, we have it covered from baby bottles to personalized baby jerseys. Mom is never forgotten as we add a little something beautiful just for her, such as her favourite flowers, hand cream, or her favourite treat. We personalize right down to the bow with the little one’s name.

The Tri-City Eagles Field Hockey Club wants to change that perception. Well over 50 percent of our Canadian Men’s and Women’s National Teams are from British Columbia!

In fact, the Club has been working for the last 17 years, since it was first founded in 2000 with the assistance of the City of Coquitlam, to culture an interest and involvement in the sport for girls and boys of all ages.

article continues below

Today, Brian Lewis, Club President, names increased participation by boys as a real accomplishment. Overcoming the notion of Field Hockey as a girls’ only sport has been a hard sell in a community with so many options for boys. The Club is also very proud of the Bursary Program it has developed where a total of $2,000 is awarded to a group of individual players who meet the following criteria: they’ve played junior field hockey, they’ve coached for the club, they’ve umpired for the club and they’ve played in the adult league. These bursaries are often used for post-secondary tuition, books or other academic materials, Lewis explains.

Overall Lewis feels that Tri-City Eagles Field Hockey provides a service to the community by existing as a hub that brings together kids and their parents as well as adult players. Says Lewis: “We’re proud of what we’ve done. We do it because we love the sport. We’ve been recognized by Field Hockey BC as contributing to the sport. We’ve got over 500 participants in field hockey after 17 years. Kids will go on to potentially get picked up on a national team. That’s the legacy, creating something kids can hold on to.”

A small portion of the hospital’s overall $27.6 million expansion, mainly focused on the Emergency, Cardiology and Community Outpatient Services departments, is a new Pacemaker Clinic. The Clinic is being designed to reduce wait times for patients whose number is growing due to an aging demographic.

article continues below

Once in place sometime next Spring, it will also make treatment and monitoring more convenient for patients - the majority of whom are seniors.

“Patients who require service and monitoring of their pacemakers will be able to stay in their community and have their needs met at their local hospital, Eagle Ridge, rather than travelling to another hospital like they would have previously,” says Charlene Giovannetti-King, Executive Director with Eagle Ridge Hospital Foundation.

The Foundation’s goal is to raise $84,800 in support of the new clinic that will be part of the expanded Cardiology Department.

Pacemaker patients are generally required to have their equipment checked every six months. “Checks are made to ensure their pacemakers are set to the proper benchmark settings for that particular patient, and to monitor the battery life of the unit,” Giovannetti-King says.

The Cardiology Department at Eagle Ridge Hospital currently spends approximately 15 hours/week on pacemaker care; time that is expected to more than double when the new Pacemaker Clinic opens. In addition, the coming changes are expected to add a fourth cardiologist to the hospital’s staff.

“I'm excited we'll be able to increase the services and continue to improve care we provide to this community, and hopeful we can keep building towards a goal of having a hospital where we can treat everyone's needs locally so people don’t need to travel in times of sickness,” says Dr. Cameron Dehoney, Head of Cardiology at Eagle Ridge Hospital. “The pacemaker clinic is a small part of that as we continue to expand what we can do for people in this community in a place they are comfortable.”

“The changes will impact so many people in a positive way,” Giovannetti-Kingsays, adding much of that is about being able to get quality care where patients live.

“As our community ages and grows, so will the incidence of heart disease,” says Dehoney. “Last year, we performed more than 19,770 tests due to cardiac-related visits to the Emergency Department.

“For those with pacemakers, the ability to have access to consistent follow-up care means faster diagnosis of issues when they do arise, such as irregular heartbeat and atrial fibrillation, leading to the prevention of strokes and heart failure,” he explains. “These expanded services mean better health outcomes for our entire community, something we all deserve.”

It is essential for your overall health and is connected to a myriad of different functions and parts of the body that you use every day. That being said, things you do and eat during the day can also affect how your body sleeps and ultimately impact the quality of your sleep.

Getting a good night’s sleep is important. But Roxanne Brooks, a Registered Holistic Nutritionist and Adult Sleep Coach who consults out of the CanSleep clinics by referrals from the Clinical Therapists, says that achieving good sleep hygiene can lead to completely different results. Sleep hygiene is a term that refers to practicing good habits to getting a good night’s sleep. There are many different rituals and guidelines that can be used to achieve good sleep hygiene, and the staff at CanSleep Services can help you choose the ones that fit within your lifestyle. With their help, you can achieve a quality deep sleep, which is crucial for your optimal health.

1. Turn off all electronics one hour before bed: The blue light given off by smartphones, televisions and computers have been shown to disrupt sleep by blocking the production of melatonin – the hormone that makes you sleepy.

2. Take a warm bath or shower: Relaxing your body in a steamy shower or calming bath can help prepare your body and mind for a good night’s sleep.

3. Drink herbal tea 45 minutes before bed: Brooks suggests passion flower, chamomile, or valerian root teas.

4. Try a relaxing activity before bed: Reading, puzzling, and colouring are activities that can help unwind your brain from the day’s busy activities.

5. Practice relaxation techniques: Brooks says yoga, breathing exercises, stretching, and practicing gratitude are all methods that can help you achieve good sleep hygiene.

The men, all in their thirties or forties at the time, wanted a Legion to honour lost friends and a place where they, wounded in both body and mind, could meet up, relax with like-minded people, and support other veterans.

article continues below

They set about organizing dances, holding draws, and selling refreshments in the old Holts Banquet House until they had the funds to put down money on the dilapidated Knights of Columbus property. A charter from the Royal Canadian Legion was obtained and in 1962 Branch 263 of the Legion was born.

The original focus of the Legion, both in Coquitlam and elsewhere in Canada, was to provide a strong voice for veterans of the two World Wars and to advise the federal government on issues affecting the vets. It grew into a place for veterans and their spouses to meet and socialize (who remembers the cheap beer?), and an organization where vets in need could go to for help.

""Many people still think that they need to be a member of the military, part of a military family, or connected to a veteran in some way to enjoy our services,"" says Bob Chapman, First Vice President of the Royal Canadian Legion, Coquitlam Branch. ""but that's no longer true. For sure, we welcome veterans of any war, but we also open our doors to the community at large.""

Gone are the old guys sitting around drinking cheap beer and reminiscing about the past, says Bob. Today, you're more likely to find live entertainment and an energetic dance happening, or a meat draw to support the local kids' baseball or soccer team, or even Music Bingo.

Music Bingo?

""It's great. People love it!"" laughs Bob. ""Instead of the usual 'under the I, number 5,' people have cards with the names of song titles on them. We play 45 seconds of a song, and they dob their cards just like a Bingo game. It's a lot of fun and very popular.""

That's not to say that the Coquitlam Legion has forgotten its roots or its veterans.

""We still honour and support our veterans from all wars as well as police officers and first responders,"" Bob says. ""And we're still a community service club at heart, but we also know how to have fun. Our doors are open for everyone. Come on down and check us out!""

“Inner peace is a stillness that can be experienced in every moment of our lives, regardless of what life brings us” says Regina Kaiser founding owner of Veracis® Meditation, Yoga & Wellness centre, one of the first non-denominational meditation centres in the Lower Mainland.

Kaiser believes that aligning spirit with body, mind, and soul can be attained through guided advanced meditations, yoga, and holistic services that she with a team of experienced professionals offer at her wellness centre in Port Moody. Classes are designed for everyone interested in self-empowerment.

There are 5 ways you can participate:

1. Holistic Energy Healing: This approach has been used for centuries to improve well-being from the inside out.

2. Intuitive Reading: Sessions provide information about the dynamics that presently influence your life. They are not predictive; rather, they help you understand yourself and life with greater clarity because the answers are inside you.

3. Meditation: Meditating connects you with your soul – but sometimes it can be difficult to achieve on your own. Guided meditations give you the chance to self-heal and discover the answers within yourself, with a helping hand. There are two ways to participate; meditation courses and ongoing meditation classes.

4. Healing Massage: Conscious touch encourages a state of inner-outer harmony as your mind centres on stillness and your body relaxes into peacful bliss.

5. Yoga: Traditional yoga classes nourish spirit, mind, body and soul. Plus, a smaller studio gives you personalized, caring direction and support.

“When I take my car in for repair and I know nothing about the inner workings of the engine, I have to believe what I’m told. If the answer is I need that I need something fixed, I don’t know if they are right or not. It can be very intimidating and uncomfortable. A visit to the dentist shouldn’t be like that.”

article continues below

Dr. Thorpe’s philosophy is to make sure that patients are fully informed of all their options so they can make the decision that’s right for them.

“It’s not about whether you want a Cadillac or a VW,” she explains. “It’s about the fact that there are choices. Your Cadillac might not be my Cadillac. We have to define what’s right for you and your teeth. What are your goals, your financial constraints? I feel that this kind of open, informative communication is one of the most important things in dentistry.”

When patients fully understand their options and the dental procedures available to them, Dr. Thorpe says, they feel empowered to make a decision. It also takes away a lot of the anxiety around dental crowns, tooth extractions, or cosmetic dentistry because the patient is informed and they have a better understanding of the work to be done.

“Patients will often come in and say ‘Okay, Dr. Thorpe, I trust you. Whatever you think is best is fine by me.’ I shy away from that. I always tell my patients about the choices they have – and there are always lots of choices—which is why one dentist might tell you that this procedure is necessary and another dentist might offer a different solution.”

The key, Dr. Thorpe says, is that the patient understand the benefits and the risks of each procedure. In the end, the choice of which dental procedure is appropriate is in the patient’s hands.

“I’m passionate about empowering my patients to make those choices,” she says.

article continues below

We’re the public’s one-stop-shop for fairness. Each year, we receive over 8,000 complaints and inquiries from the public about issues of unfairness. We work to help resolve their complaints in a variety of ways from guidance and referrals to investigations. If we find that the government treated a member of the public unfairly, we look for outcomes to help that person and fix the problem for the future. This, in turn, makes government operations more fair going forward.

You have jurisdiction over everything from school districts to ICBC to the Ministry of Health; what ties all that together?

We listen to complaints that the public has about most government organizations from provincial government ministries to local governments and crown corporations such as BC Hydro, ICBC and WorkSafeBC. We also investigate complaints about public schools, universities, self-governing professions and health authorities.

What if you don’t live in Victoria and want to speak with someone face-to-face?

People can contact us by telephone, online (www.bcombudsperson.ca), through the mail or by fax. Some people prefer to talk to us in person so we regularly take our office on the road. Our next event is from Monday, January 28th to Friday, February 1st. We will be hosting one-on-one meetings with the public in Burnaby, North Vancouver, Vancouver and Richmond to give residents an opportunity to discuss their complaints with us. No lines. No waits. Call us to schedule your free and confidential meeting 1-800-567-FAIR (3247).

What are the greatest challenges you face in your role?

Our broad jurisdiction. We have jurisdiction over the provincial government, Crown corporations, all of the agency boards and commissions in the province and over local governments, public schools, and universities. This wide range makes it convenient for the public.

On the other hand, it means that my staff and I need to stay current on emerging trends and changes in administrative best practices across a wide range of sectors. We work hard to be a highly efficient organization, and I am very proud of our staff who are dedicated to high standards of practice in our work and who strive continuously to improve our services.

What do you love about your job?

All our staff members are passionate about listening to the general public’s complaints and having the opportunity to improve how government works through investigating complaints about fairness. We get to listen to and help people and in doing so, we improve public services for everyone. It’s a win-win!

Many techniques to refinish cabinets took lots of time, money, vigorous sanding and harsh toxic chemicals. Booth's technique restores thecabinets to their former glory - all without the customer ever having to empty them out. Cabinets can be used within 6 hours.

""Cabinets get greasy, they get worn, and they get sticky, they start peeling,"" Booth says. ""With our process, we can restore them to get them new-looking again, without the mess.""

If around this point, you're feeling skeptical, Booth says he is used to it. He acknowledges that ""many people thought I was flaky, thought it was a gimmick. So I had to stay the course."" Today Gleam Guard has an A+ rating with BBB.

He says that after a while, the results spoke for themselves, and his business began to grow. Booth is so confident in his product that he put a five-year free touch up guarantee on all of his work.

""It's like your changing your car oil to protect your car engine. We refinish or refurbish kitchen cabinets so you don’t have to replace them. I have people who have had our work done on their cabinets 10, 15, 20, 25 years ago, and it still looks great.""

""Customers often ask, 'what should we do to prepare?' We say, open the door, and let us into your kitchen,"" says Booth.

""You get such a good refresh on the place. Our special finish is actually designed to walk on,"" Booth says, explaining that this is why his treatments last so long - they're stronger than regular cabinet finishing products and stains.

Booth says the entire cabinet process takes one to two days, and stresses that his clients do not have to unload their kitchen cabinets for his team to do their work.

""You've got to think of your cabinets as being an investment,"" says Booth. ""Most cabinets are somewhere in the range of 15 to 30 thousand dollars. For about a tenth of that, we'll keep them tip top for decades.""

“We have around 12 free-book libraries in our system,” says Kathleen Reinheimer, Manager of Parks for the City of Coquitlam, “and toys are a natural extension of the concept that provides an amenity for neighbours in our local parks.”

In 2015, the City experimented with placing toys in the local parks and found the idea was well received by the community.

“We just had them in storage tubs on the ground,” Kathleen recalls, “so we were looking for ways to make them a little more high profile.”

To that end, the City worked through its Park Spark program to put the toys in baskets with signage and offered local businesses and individuals the opportunity to sponsor a toy library.

Park Spark is a City initiative that works with businesses and the community to enhance Coquitlam parks. The local business community volunteers to fund the first batch of toys. And their staff members are involved in checking on the toys.

“They make sure the toys remain in a safe condition and commit to refilling the toy basket if needed,” Kathleen explains. “However, we noticed last year that at least one location ended up with more toys in the basket than it started out with. It was an indication to us of the community’s comfort around the program.”

According to Kathleen, the main message from the Little Toy Library, apart from offering toys for children to borrow or use in the park, is that Coquitlam parks are safe and a comfortable place to visit.

“We want the community get out into the parks,” she says, “to be physically active, and have fun.”

A good Realtor can make all the difference.

A Realtor can help right from the time a client starts considering home ownership or selling, according to Daniel Card, a Realtor with Royal LePage West. R.E.S. in Port Coquitlam.

“This gives us an opportunity to sit down and talk to the client about what they’re thinking, talk about what they’re feeling, and put a plan into place,” he says.

Real estate agents help with short-term to long-term planning – for those ready to enter the real estate market today, to those who are considering their options a year or two down the road.

Clients who work with a listing or buyer’s agent early in the process can come up with a customized plan that covers their specific goals, according to Card, whether they want to sell their property as soon as possible, or buy a starter home but need time to secure the financing.

Card suggests potential clients put together a list of questions before meeting with a Realtor. Realtors will make a presentation about the process of buying or selling a property that usually answers all of those questions, because anyone who wants to enter the real estate market needs to learn as much as possible to make the process easier.

First-time home buyers in particular need to learn all the steps to buying a home, Card says, whereas homeowners looking to sell usually have specific questions in mind, such as how fast homes in their area are selling, or if their home is likely to sell over asking price.

“It’s important to sit down with clients, clearly explain the process and make sure they don’t become overwhelmed,” Card says. “In the end, the whole process needs to be as easy and straightforward for the clients as possible.”

It was 1995, when Hope Lutheran Church in Port Coquitlam established its own school - a single classroom with eight kindergarten students. “It was a vision of Margaret Towriss, the pastor’s wife at the time,” says John Lok, Principal of Hope Lutheran Christian School’s elementary and middle schools, which currently have more than 300 students enrolled.

article continues below

“Christian education is a pillar of what we do in the school,” Lok says. “And through our Christian education we provide academic excellence.”

What makes Hope Lutheran Christian School (HLCS) stand out from the other schools is the supportive and nurturing environment that meets more than just the students’ educational needs. Diversity is a strong point – the needs, values and preferences of students and parents are met; individual potential, knowledge, skill and healthy attitudes are nurtured in a supportive environment that motivates and instills confidence. Individual educational needs are met and full resources are given to each student.

“We seek to educate the whole child”, Lok says. The teachers endeavour to develop close relationships with each family. Home visits are scheduled with every family, prior to the start of the school year to review registration requirements and answer any questions parents may have. The classrooms are open for observation at any time throughout the year with arrangements made in advance.

As they soon enter their 25th year, HLCS stays true to its mission of equipping each child to impact the world for Christ’s glory - they not only pursue strong academic standings, but produce young citizens who have a commitment to their community and beyond.

“We are trying to develop people who are sensitive and can impact the world as they learn about what the world needs,” Lok adds. “Much of our curriculum supports that. For example, in our chapel, we have offering time for our students, which teaches them the discipline of giving from a very early age. And that’s not directly to the school or the church, but to the community.”

As a result, the school has raised significant funds to support ministries such as the Union Gospel Mission, which supports people in need across Metro Vancouver.

“This past year, we also supported schools in Nicaragua,” Lok says. “All of this helps instill a sense of service in our students.”

They also engage the students by giving back to their local community in taking care of McLean Park in the “Adopt-A-Spot” civic program.

The school prospers from the independent school model, which allows for greater control of hiring quality staff while upholding curriculum standards accredited by external evaluators who inspect the school on a regular basis - a quality assurance mechanism that does not exist at public schools.

“We select and develop our teachers with greater ability to make changes that help us align with the core values of our school,” Lok says. “We have the ability to operate smaller class sizes while still offering a robust curriculum based on the BC Ministry of Education.

Like many other independent Christian schools, HLCS is more affordable than most people think. The school is partly funded by the Ministry and from student tuitions. Family rates also make it more affordable for families with more than one child studying at the school. In addition, as a faith-based school where religious education is part of daily learning, a portion of tuition fees are eligible for a tax credit every year. Attending an independent school is not just for the privileged and financially elite. There is a wide range of families from various socioeconomic backgrounds that make up the diversity of HLCS.

“It’s an easy way to improve your air quality,” says Moore & Russell Heating and Cooling owner, Serge Laredo. “Everyone should change their filters on a regular basis.”

article continues below

Ironically, changing your furnace filter is often far easier than changing the filters in your car. Furnace filters are typically located between the furnace and the venting so that they can trap air particles before they are circulated throughout your house. Changing the filter usually just amounts to sliding the old one out and sliding the new one in.

Furnace filters cut down dust, pet dander, bacteria and other matter that can find its way into the home environment. By changing the filter on a regular basis, it not only improves the air quality in your home, it improves the efficiency of your furnace.

And that means long-term savings on your fuel expense and lower repair bills down the road.

How often should you change your furnace filters? Lardeo says that homeowners should change their filters approximately every 3 months. These filters can now be order online for your convenience.

Not sure which filters to choose? Professionals like those at Moore & Russell Heating and Cooling can help you choose the right filter for your furnace and even install it for you if you’re still uncomfortable doing so.

Laredo suggests setting up a reminder or tying the job to another one to help you remember it. Because you need to change it once a season, tying it to seasonal jobs such as changing your snow tires or opening your pool might make it easier to stay on top of.

It is important to note that most insurance companies and all furnace manufacturers recommend that you complete an annual service and safety inspection to keep your warranty valid. Changing your filters regularly is an important part of that process.

While hundreds of people could be employed in positions relating to the games and hubs — such as security jobs, rink staff, food services and hotel housekeeping — the financial benefit of two bubble communities under tight seal would be ""modest"" at best, suggested Bank of Montreal chief economist Douglas Porter.

""When you think of how many tourists would normally be in Toronto during peak tourist season, I'm quite sure this is less than one per cent,"" he said.

""The reality is, it's not going to move the needle.""

But Porter, a lifelong hockey fan, said he anticipates a ""reasonably meaningful positive"" morale boost to Canadian sports fans who've been eagerly anticipating players returning to the ice in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The games are slated to start Aug. 1 with six Canadian teams qualifying for the 24-team resumption of play. No fans will be in the seats.

Edmonton and Toronto were confirmed as the NHL's hub cities on Friday night.

""The fact that part of our world is getting back to some kind of normal will help reinforce the sense that things, generally, are moving in that direction and could help support the recovery,"" Porter said.

The gradual comeback of major sporting events has drawn plenty of interest in recent weeks, with debates raging over the risks of putting players back into the games, even if spectators aren't allowed in the facilities.

Further questions have been raised over whether rigorous testing is enough to prevent outbreaks within the isolated community, which could potentially throw the whole plan into a costly disarray.

Many of these factors make placing a value on hockey's return especially difficult.

Michael Naraine, a professor at Brock University in St. Catharines, Ont., said the largest amount of money is on the line at large corporations, which he said is driving the return of major sporting events.

""The primary revenue driver for sports is broadcasting,"" said the assistant professor of digital sport management and marketing.

""They need television advertisers come back. The league itself needs to gain its revenue from NBC and Sportsnet here in Canada.""

Politicians have preferred to emphasize the positive aspects of a deal with the NHL.

Alberta Premier Jason Kenney eagerly promoted Edmonton as the ultimate hub city for the hockey league, posting videos on Twitter that prominently featured the Rocky Mountains and other popular destinations in the province.

Naraine said those public expressions by leaders are more an attempt to ""pander"" to their constituents than actually drive any meaningful economic impact. He said this is especially the case in Edmonton.

""Having major events come to town allows them to beat their chests and say, 'We exist. We're on the map. Come look at us,'"" he said.

""But the fact that the hub city will be in Edmonton is no different than whether the hub city would be in Toronto or Vancouver or elsewhere. It's not going to significantly drive tourism all of a sudden.""

Patrick Rishe, a sports professor at Washington University in St. Louis, said he sees value in showcasing a lesser known Canadian city on broadcast television with ""beauty shots"" of the locale. He said it may also sit well with NHL executives.

""You never know,"" he said. ""Doing and serving a good deed for the league now, this could pay dividends down the road.""

Any semblance of a regular hockey season would be welcomed by Dana Parris, owner of the Lockeroom sports bar in Barrie, Ont.

Even though her business is over 100 kilometres away from downtown Toronto, she anticipates the excitement would reverberate to her customers.

""If we could have sports come back and we hit Stage 3 (of Ontario's COVID reopening plan) around the same time, I will probably stop crying myself to sleep,"" she said.

""If those two come together it's just going to be the most beautiful thing.""

Coquitlam Metro-Ford Soccer Club held its first organized sessions for U13 to U18 players in late June, while Port Coquitlam Euro-Rite FC launches a four-week summer training program on July 6. Port Moody Soccer Club has yet to announce its plans, although it has opened registrations for fall programs.

CMFSC executive director Sara Maglio said the early workouts are expected to become the template for summer training camps in July and August, and likely into the new season in the fall.

PoCo soccer’s vice president Sean Walker said the short return to play that is free to players already registered for its fall season will likely be a preview of things to come.

“We want our kids to be on the ball and on the field getting some touches,” he said. “We don’t know what we’ll look like in the fall.”

CMFSC’s Maglio said for now, one of British Columbia’s biggest soccer organizations with 4,000 youth and adult players is thinking small, with an emphasis on skills development like passing and dribbling drills, with an eventual return to small-sided games that involve limited numbers of players on the pitch. She said the early returns have been encouraging.

“We definitely saw a lot of smiles,” she said. “The biggest thing was getting to be together with their teammates.”

In fact, Maglio added, other than the constant reminders from coaches for players to stay apart, the ubiquitous presence of hand sanitizer on the sidelines, and the careful attention being paid to the arrival and departure of players, soccer practice in the midst of a pandemic looks pretty much like regular training at any other time.

But whether players and families will be satisfied with just a constant diet of training in place of competition is still unknown.

Maglio said CMFSC extended its registration window for the fall season to give families a chance to see what that might look like before committing their money.

“We’re hopeful we’ll be into the next phase by September, which will allow us to do a few more things,” Maglio said.

Walker said the response to PoCo soccer’s truncated summer program has been encouraging, with more than 50 families signing on in the first hour of registration opening on June 27 and a couple hundred more quickly following. But, he added, registration for the fall season is behind the pace of previous years.

Walker said he suspects parents are being cautious about the trajectory of the public health emergency.

Like every amateur sports organization in the province, CMFSC and PoCo Euro-Rite are modelling their returns to play according to guidelines recommended by viaSport, as well as BC Soccer.

The first of three phases stipulated by BC Soccer, that allows for modified training, started on June 12.

There’s still no timeline for a move to the second phase that will permit some interclub or even regional competition with limited spectators.

Maglio said the uncertainty of the pandemic’s progression, and even what is meant by “regional play,” makes it difficult to plan ahead.

“We’re all unsure of where we’ll be in September,” she said, adding the organization is being careful not to make any missteps by getting too far ahead of itself.

“Just like anything new, you want to make sure you get it right.”

Walker said PoCo players participating in the summer program will be limited to working from designated areas on the pitch, and practising individual skills like ball handling as well as some passing.

“We’re allowed to use our feet,” he said. “But no one is allowed to pick up a ball, or a cone or a net.”

Maglio said the emphasis will be on making the return to soccer fun and enjoyable.

“That’s our number one priority,” she said.

And if that philosophy connects with families, it could have implications for years into the future, as players and coaches now have the time and motivation to focus on development rather than preparing for matches.

“The training-to-game ratio should be higher,” Maglio said,

Walker agreed.

“Any opportunity to touch the ball is an opportunity to learn,” he said.",[]

But even before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, her sophomore season was grounded by a Level 4 concussion she suffered last January.

The Heritage Woods secondary school grad is hopeful the forced time away from sport will allow her the opportunity to regain her health and form that earned Lew the Ontario University Athletics rookie athlete of the year as a freshman. But with OUA competition cancelled through the fall season, and the status of winter sports still uncertain, whether she’ll even be able to hit the sand pit in her junior year is up in the air.

U Sports, the national governing body for university athletics in Canada, announced the cancellation of all national championships for first term sports, like football, men’s and women’s soccer, and women’s rugby and field hockey, on June 8. The fate of individual sports such as golf, cross-country running and swimming will be determined by July 15.

Indoor track is a second-term sport. U Sports has said it will hold off making a decision on their seasons until Oct. 8.

And while that buys Lew some time, it doesn’t diminish the uncertainty of her immediate athletic future.

The public health emergency has put the competitive aspirations of student-athletes into limbo.

U Sports has said its student-athletes will still be eligible to receive financial assistance like athletic scholarships as long as they remain students in “good standing,” and they won’t lose a year of their eligibility to play.

But that assurance doesn’t make it any easier for families facing the prospect of sending their kids away from home to study and maybe compete. Especially if transmission of the novel coronavirus reinvigorates itself, as many experts predict is likely come fall.

“If there is a second wave, safety is our number one priority,” said Raquel Chin, Jasmine’s mom.

Her concern is especially heightened, as she has another daughter, Jade, who’s also headed to Toronto in the fall, on a field hockey scholarship at York University.

Chin said the girls’ coaches — Carl Georgevski at the U of T, and York field hockey coach Zeeshan Minhas — have been in constant communication, answering questions and providing training programs, but with Toronto more of a hotspot for COVID-19 infections than British Columbia, her optimism is guarded.

Jade Lew said some her trepidation about heading to Toronto in the fall is tempered by the fact she already knows some of her future teammates who are also from the Tri-Cities.

“I am sure that will help,” she said. “I think it is important to stay positive, but if I need to, I know that I can go home right away.”

While Jade already knows she won’t be playing a competitive season, she’s still training six days a week, often with her sister, at a gym they have set up in their Port Moody home. She said she’s hopeful the York U. field hockey team will be able to play some exhibition matches against nearby schools by next spring.

Jasmine said she’s anxious to get back to Toronto, where she expects she’ll have a bit more time to concentrate on her studies in kinesiology, which will be a combination of online lectures and on-campus classes. She also hopes she’ll have recovered from her concussion enough to increase the tempo of her training so she’ll be in top form again should her season resume.

Chin said she’s confident the schools and their athletic departments will do right by her daughters.

“They are very invested in their programs, and the care they have for their players is very evident,” she said.",[]

While Tilt said there’s no set timeline for that progression, CMSA is hoping to keep players active until the end of August, with the addition of a special program being developed by Softball BC for U6 and U8 players in mid-July.

“Moving to each of these steps will be done after careful consideration and evaluation” of the safety plan, Tilt said.

The plan, which follows guidelines set out in early June for all sports by viaSport, includes: tracking attendance at every organized session; specified arrival and departure times; the assignment of a “sanitizing champion” for each team who is responsible for cleaning equipment, bases, dugouts and even the latches on gates used to access the diamonds; limits on attendance at every diamond of no more than 50 players, coaches, officials and parents; and even directions on how to pick up the bat and pass it to the designated sanitizer before it can be used by another player.

Tilt said the strict procedures will help players, coaches and parents get comfortable with the new realities of sport in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“There is no doubt that the ‘fear factor’ will likely be the biggest challenge, at least initially,” he said. “Over time, things will return closer to normal, but we won’t rush it.”

Tilt said adherence to the new protocols will rest largely on the association’s volunteers, who’ve all been briefed on expectations.

“They understand the seriousness of the situation and the importance of doing this right,” he said, adding the association expects to make adjustments along the way as their base of knowledge of what works at the diamond and what doesn’t evolves.

Tilt said part of the organization’s cautious approach meant waiting several days to get back to playing ball after the city opened sports fields to registered users last Monday, so all the plans could be in place and properly communicated.

He said the months-long pause to the season that was supposed to start last April has led to 70 families pulling out, some of whom received full refunds while others deferred their registration fees to next year.

And now that the sound of the crack of the bat and balls snapping into leather gloves is imminent, Tilt said the anticipation is palpable.

“We have our fingers crossed that all the planning and work everyone has done at every level will give the kids a safe and enjoyable experience,” he said. “I think overall though, the kids are very excited to return to the field.”",[]

The Canadian Collegiate Athletic Association (CCAA) has announced the cancellation of its four national championships scheduled for the fall because of the ongoing uncertainty about the COVID-19 pandemic. The sports affected are: golf, men’s and women’s soccer, and cross-country running.

CCAA president Vince Amato said the safety of student-athletes was foremost in the organization’s decision and those competing in fall sports won’t lose a year of their eligibility.

A decision on championships for winter sports, like basketball and volleyball, will be made in the fall.

But in a statement earlier last week, the Pacific Western Athletic Association (PACWEST) that governs sports at eight colleges in British Columbia, including Douglas, said it remains hopeful some form of return to play can happen as public health guidelines allow.

The same day, the Ontario Colleges Athletic Association announced it was suspending fall sports at all of its 27 schools. The Atlantic Collegiate Athletics Association has also cancelled sports schedules of its 10 schools through the fall, while no decisions have been announced for conferences in Alberta, Manitoba and Quebec.

PACWEST said it has put together tentative schedules and contingency plans for the resumption of sports, but “we must proceed cautiously.”

On June 8, USports, that governs university athletics in Canada, announced the cancellation of national championships for its fall term programs, including football, men’s and women’s soccer, women’s rugby and field hockey.

Canada West, as well as conferences in Ontario and the Atlantic provinces, subsequently announced they were cancelling all team sport competitions in the first term, while a decision on individual sports like golf, swimming and cross-country will be made by July 15.",[]

The fields, which have been closed to organized activity since March 19, must be booked in advance and the sports organization has to have a sport-specific COVID-19 safety plan in place.

The plan details the precautions — like frequent hand washing, limiting the sharing of equipment and physical distancing measures — the group has put in place to mitigate the risk of participants being exposed or infected by the novel coronavirus. It must also be approved by the organization’s board of directors or its provincial sports association.

Organizations booking a field must also remind participants, coaches, officials and spectators of the guidelines, as well as ensure no one with symptoms of illness be involved in the activity.

“We know it’s been a tough few months, especially for kids,” said Coun. Steve Darling, who’s also the city’s designate for sports and recreation. “We are excited to be able to get some of our sports groups back out playing and returning to sport.”

But while soccer balls may be flying again, and baseballs caroming off bats, it will be awhile yet before competitive games can take place. Provincial health restrictions still in place limit sporting activity to focusing on drills and skill building to limit physical contact and maintain distancing.

In a message to school administrators and athletic directors, Jordan Abney, the executive director of BC School Sports that governs more than 70,000 student-athletes in Grades 8 to 12, said there are still more questions than answers regarding the challenges of resuming play after spring schedules were abruptly stopped because of the COVID-19 pandemic. He said the fall could offer anything from a full schedule of activities to a continued stoppage.

“I am hopeful we will still be able to offer some activities,” Abney said, adding, “I think it should be expected it is likely that any school sport activities will look very different in the coming year.”

Abney said while BC School Sports is able to take some direction from the return to sport guidelines published last week by ViaSport, a government funding agency, the 60 school districts and more than 100 independent schools that comprise his organization face some unique challenges.

Those include the possibility that schools may not be operating at 100% capacity when they return in the fall, or whether gyms will be repurposed to help maintain physical distancing.

Also a concern are insurance and legal considerations that could expose schools and athletic associations to damages and costs if they’re sued because someone has been exposed to COVID-19.

Abney said insurance providers are beginning to insert exclusion clauses for communicable diseases and pandemics into their policies.

“This has led to much discussion around the assumption of risk, and how to define COVID-19 as inherent risk and the validity of waivers and other risk management techniques,” he said.

But with summer break approaching, Abney said school sports administrators have the advantage of time and the ability to monitor the return to play protocols of various community sports organizations through the coming months to help inform their own strategies.

Abney said ultimately, it will be the novel coronavirus that decides the fate of school sports come September.

“A medical breakthrough or conversely, a new wave in the number of cases of the virus may change the trajectory of any plan quickly.”

The BC Hockey League has officially announced its 18th franchise, the Cranbrook Bucks, will be ready to play for the coming season. Although when that actually happens will depend on directives from Hockey Canada as well as provincial health authorities.

One of those hurdles was overcome last Thursday when the sport’s national governing body lifted its ban on sanctioned events.

Tom Renney, the CEO of Hockey Canada, said it will now allow each of its 13 regional members to determine when its safe to begin playing again.

“We expect the timing of each member’s return to hockey will be different,” he said in a statement, adding each will be based on advice from their government and public health authority.

To that end, the BCHL’s task force to plot its return to play has created various schedules for the coming season that start at different dates depending on the status of government restrictions still in place because of the COVID-19 pandemic. It’s also enhanced safety protocols for players, staff and fans.

Some of those measures could include full face shields for all players, as well as reduced seating at arenas.

Other initiatives recently announced by the league include a crackdown on fighting and the creation of a department of player safety that will assess and monitor infractions that could result in further penalties like suspensions.

Renny said the cumulative effect of the pandemic and measures to minimize exposure to the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 means “the game will look quite different” as it reinvigorates across the country.

The decisions affect football, men’s and women’s soccer, women’s rugby and field hockey.

Decisions on the fate of individual sports like men’s and women’s golf, cross country and swimming will be made by July 15.

Sports that span two terms, like hockey, volleyball and basketball won’t be able to commence their schedules until next January, with a determination to be made on their full seasons, as well as those sports played exclusively in the second term, by Oct. 8.

Although, said Clint Hamilton, the president of Canada West and the athletic director at the University of Victoria, without a vaccine “ it’s going to be hard to envision us playing a January to March season.”

All student-athletes will still be eligible to receive financial assistance like athletic scholarships as long as they’re students in “good standing” and they won’t be charged a year of their eligibility to play.

The decisions about the upcoming season weren’t easy ones to make, Hamlton said.

“Health and safety is at the forefront of everything we do,” he said. “Simply put, there was no way to adequately ensure the safety of everyone involved in university sport during competition this fall.”

Hamilton added while professional sports continue to plot ways to return to competition, university sport doesn’t have the resources to minimize the risk of infection during competition.

She’ll cap it the same way, as only the third female to be inducted as an individual player into the Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame (She’s already in there as a member of the 1983-’93 B.C. Selects).

article continues below

Bowyer, who lives in Burnaby and recently retired from her career as a probation officer based out of the Justice Institute in New Westminster, was a charter member of the first girls’ box lacrosse team in Port Coquitlam in 1972 when she was 15-years-old.

Having already played ice hockey, basketball and baseball, it wasn’t until Bowyer picked up a lacrosse stick that she felt an immediate, almost primal, connection to a sport.

“It was in my soul,” she said. “You felt a bit like a gladiator when you played.”

Bowyer said she loved the camaraderie that quickly developed with her teammates as they learned a new sport together and forged rivalries with teams in Coquitlam, Burnaby, North Vancouver and White Rock.

“We were good athletes, but we weren’t lacrosse players,” she said. “If you practised hard, you felt like you could be anything you wanted to be.”

But it was a sideways compliment after a game that she “played like a boy” that most affirmed her affection for lacrosse.

“It brought me out of my shell,” she said. “It was so invigorating.”

Seeking to elevate her play, Bowyer migrated to the Kirby’s Klipettes out of Burnaby that was coached by former pro, and future Hall of Famer, Dave Evans. The team won league, provincial and national championships.

“There was no going back after that,” Bowyer said.

But there was going outside.

In 1980, Bowyer discovered field lacrosse.

At first, the shallow basket on the stick and lack of body contact felt foreign to her, but she said she loved the ability to run up and down the expansive field in the open air from her position as a midfielder.

With the newly-formed B.C. Selects, Bowyer travelled across Canada and down to the United States to play in tournaments. She captained the team to 11 straight Canadian championships from 1982 to ’93. In fact, the team was so good, in 2014, it was the first female squad inducted into the Hall of Fame.

Bowyer also represented Canada at three world championships, in England in 1982, Philadelphia in “86 and Perth, Australia, in ’89.

A fractured vertebrae suffered in a ball hockey game ended Bowyer’s playing career after that, but she quickly transitioned into coaching at the provincial and national level.

Bowyer said she hopes her induction into the Hall of Fame will serve as a touchstone for other young women in the sport to show them what they can achieve, something she never had.

And while part of her regrets not being a decade or two younger so she could have enjoyed the scholarship opportunities that started emerging through the 1980s to play and get an education at big time American universities, she takes pride in having laid the groundwork for the young women who’ve followed in her wake.

It wasn’t easy, Bowyer said, as funding at the time was non-existent and every trip to a tournament or championship had to be earned not only on the floor or field but with countless hours washing cars or selling t-shirts.

“It makes you feel good that we worked as hard as we did,” she said. “I wouldn’t change a thing.”

The league, which cancelled its 2019/’20 season after the first round of the playoffs because of the COVID-19 pandemic and doesn’t yet know when it will be allowed to proceed this fall, has announced reduced tolerance for fighting majors, as well as new rules for charging and slew-footing penalties.

It’s also created a department of player safety that will review all penalties that can lead to further discipline like suspension as they accumulate to ensure the referee initially made the right call on the ice. Led by director of officiating and player safety, Brad Lazarowich, and executive director of events and competition, Steven Cocker, they will also visit each team during training camp to ensure players and coaches have a full understanding of expectations.

Some of those expectations include further discipline after a player gets into their second fight of the season. Instigator and aggressor penalties will also result in suspensions upon a first offence.

Cocker said the changes will enhance the safety of players.

“The game continues to evolve and move in the direction of speed and skill,” he said in a press release. “We want to be on the forefront of that movement.”

As well, the language of the BCHL’s charging rule has been broadened to include any hit with significant force that occurs from a player’s blindside. Such a penalty could also be reviewed by the department of player safety for further discipline.

Slew-footing will also result in a four-minute double minor penalty or a match penalty and could lead to supplemental discipline if a player accumulates several of them. If an opponent is injured by a slew-foot, the perpetrator will be automatically assessed a match penalty.

The league also announced each team must also have a defibrillator available at every game, practice and team event in case of an emergency. That’s in addition to the devices already located at arenas.",[]

Monday, the chairman of the BCHL’s board of governors, Graham Fraser, said a plan for a return to play has been submitted for review by the Minister of Tourism, Arts & Culture, Lisa Beare. Discussions have also been held with Premier John Horgan and Beare to secure financial support for the league.

“Our call with Premier Horgan was also positive,” Fraser said in a press release. “He understands the importance of the BCHL to its 18 communities, as well as the entire province.”

Commissioner Chris Hebb said a task force has created different scenarios for the coming season, including schedules that start at different dates depending on the status government restrictions still in place because of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as protocols that will ensure the safety of players, staff and fans.

Tuesday, Hebb told TSN1040 radio some of those protocols could include players wearing full face shields, as well as reduced seating at arenas. He said playing in front of empty seats is not an option, though.

“We’re bums in the seats,” he said. “It’s all sponsorship and ticket sales.”

Hebb said with the league’s uncertainty over its schedule, as well as the challenges faced by many businesses because of the pandemic, some of those sponsorships may be in peril.

“The uncertainty has hit every business,” he said. “They can’t commit because they don’t even know if there’s going to be a season.”

Still, Hebb said he remains confident all teams are committed to playing next season.

“Our league provides numerous jobs for residents of B.C., as well as education opportunities for hundreds of players,” Hebb said. “The BCHL has been around for 59 years and we look forward to continuing that tradition for years to come.”

Meanwhile, all Canadian Junior Hockey League teams have been given clearance by Hockey Canada to begin making acquisitions to put their rosters together for the coming season.

One of the first moves involved former Coquitlam Express forward Tyler Schleppe, who is now a Nanaimo Clipper after a three-way trade via the Merritt Centennials that completed a trade in January that had sent Joey Perkopec to the Express.

Schleppe scored 13 goals and added 19 assists in 56 games last season.

The deal was the latest in a series of moves by the Express since the team won the BCHL's regular season championship but was denied a chance at winning a league or national championship when the rest of the playoffs were called off after the first round because of the public health emergency.

At the end of March, coach and general manager Jason Fortier left the team after three years. He was replaced two weeks later by former major midget coach Dan Cioffi, who was once an assistant under Dave MacLellan when the Express was in Burnaby. MacLellan is now the team's president.

Farhad Javadian, who reopens his Rebels Boxing and Wrestling Club in Coquitlam on June 2 for limited individual workouts, said he has no idea when he or any of his stable of 12 boxers will be able to climb back into the ring to spar, let alone have a competitive bout.

Lance Gibson welcoms fighters back to his Gibson MMA gym in Port Moody on Monday, but they’ll only be able to work on their technique and fitness — no body contact allowed.

Kevin Van Veen, a taekwondo and Brazilian jujitsu instructor for 13 years, said he’s not yet comfortable reopening his Freemont Martial Arts studio in Port Coquitlam after closing on March 15.

He’s been conducting classes online and the remote sessions five nights a week are more about staying connected with his students than honing the fundamentals of their sport.

“You’re flying by the seat of your pants,” he said.

Kevin Van Veen is still not sure when he'll be ready to reopen his Port Coquitlam martial arts studio. - MARIO BARTEL/THE TRI-CITY NEWS

ViaSport British Columbia, which is guiding protocols and procedures for over 70 sports organizations in the province as they find their way back to the pitch, ice, mats and floor after being shut down for more than two months because of the pandemic, recommends contact activities not occur at all until at least September, after which they may be allowed to progressively loosen. A full return to contact, with no restrictions, is still undetermined.

That’s tough for Javadian, who was planning to head to Vietnam to make arrangements for his second professional fight when the crisis forced him to close his gym.

“With boxers, everyone wants to get into the ring,” he said. “When they don’t get that physical aspect, it’s hard to keep their interest.”

Like Van Veen, Javadian quickly took his instruction online, conducting 30- to 40-minute sessions on things like shadow boxing, technique and conditioning three times a week.

He said escalating that to in-person training at his gym will be guided by recommendations from Boxing BC. At the moment, that means scheduling sessions to minimize the number of people working out at any one time, limiting visits to three times a week, prohibiting drop-ins and hoarding as much hand sanitizer and disinfectant he can find.

But, Javadian added, advisories seem to change every day.

“It’s just so unknown,” he said. “I’m more nervous reopening the business that when I was first opening it.”

That uncertainty also has Gibson erring on the side of extreme vigilance and caution. Fighters will have to remove their shoes, dip them in sanitizer, seal them in a bag, and then step into a foot bath prior to entering the gym. Parents of younger athletes will have to watch their charges through the windows from outside.

“We’re kind of in unchartered territory,” Gibson said.

Van Veen said his own road to reopening is also less than straight and narrow as he considers factors like being able to keep young martial artists apart, the air flow in his facility and just how many students will buy into the different experience.

“We’re all trying to find our path,” he said.

Van Veen said current directives indicate he might be okay running classes with six students, instead of the usual 12 or 13.

But that’s not sustainable as a business, he added, so a hybrid of live and virtual instruction might be implemented so he can pay the bills.

Van Veen said without an organization of affiliated gyms guiding the way, several local martial artists gather on a Facebook group to share ideas and commiserate. But it’s hard to find common ground.

Instead, he said, they’re relying on martial arts’ resilience to survive thousands of years to get them through this challenging time.

“It will be different,” Van Veen said. “We will pivot and adapt.”",[]

Virtually, of course.

Irene Mah, who started playing the sport in 2015 and is now an instructor certified by the International Pickleball Teaching Professional Association, is part of a video project compiled by Ernie Medina Jr., of Loma Linda, California, that launched a perforated plastic ball on a journey across seven continents and more than 100,000 kms.

Or at least it looked that way when Medina edited together all the clips he received from pickleballers from around the globe relaying a ball off-camera, including one intrepid couple that had brought their paddles to Antarctica.

Other destinations included New Zealand, Hong Kong, Egypt, Colombia, Paris and Edinburgh, Scotland.

Port Moody’s Mah helped “propel” the ball from Alaska to a friend and fellow competitor in Beaverton, Ore.

""That was very cool to see her receive the ball,"" Mah said. ""The pickleball family is huge.""

Medina, a professor at the Loma Linda University School of Public Health, said the month-long effort was part passion project and part coping mechanism to ease his own anxieties over the COVID-19 public health crisis.

He said creating “a sense of community is a major source of stress management,” and his video is “a way to highlight this family of pickleballers globally.”

Medina, an official ambassador for USA Pickleball and the International Federation of Pickleball, said he reached out to friends he’s made since he started playing the sport in 2016, as well as posted messages to various Pickleball groups on Facebook, including the Pickleball Forum that has more than 32,000 members. He said finding players in Africa was the most challenging.

“Not that many pickleballers there.”

Pickleball is a racquet sport that combines elements of tennis, badminton and table tennis using hard wooden paddles and a plastic ball perforated with holes not unlike a whiffleball. It’s played on a court that looks like a compacted version of a tennis court.

Medina said while pickleball is normally associated with seniors, younger players are beginning to discover the sport, an aspect he was proud to capture in his video compilation.

“it’s catching on fast,” he said, adding he’s even taught the game to kids.

Though Medina’s project was a fun diversion from the current pandemic, he said it also has a serious message about the importance of staying active, especially during a time of crisis.

“While people are passionate and addicted about promoting pickleball because it’s fun and a great sport, I’m one who does it because I believe it’s one of the best public health interventions to get communities more active,” he said.

Mah said she's thrilled to be a part of the final video. She added her participation has also renewed her wish to get a dedicated pickleball court somewhere in the Tri-Cities.

""APT29 is likely to continue to target organizations involved in COVID-19 vaccine research and development, as they seek to answer additional intelligence questions relating to the pandemic.""

This assessment is supported by partners at Britain's Government Communications Headquarters' National Cyber Security Centre, the U.S. National Security Agency, and the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.

The CSE is urging Canadian health organizations to review a technical advisory on the threat and to take any necessary actions to protect themselves. ""We encourage them as well to contact the Cyber Centre if they suspect they have been targeted by cyberactors.""

The joint advisory says APT29 targeted COVID-19 vaccine research and development by scanning specific computer IP addresses of interest for vulnerabilities, a tactic that can help the group obtain login credentials to systems.

""This broad targeting potentially gives the group access to a large number of systems globally, many of which are unlikely to be of immediate intelligence value,"" the advisory says.

""The group may maintain a store of stolen credentials in order to access these systems in the event that they become more relevant to their requirements in the future.""

It’s easy to understand why — it’s crispy on the outside, juicy in the middle and served with a flavourful sauce (or two).

It’s essentially a breaded chicken cutlet that could be sliced and served with side dishes. But in recent years, it’s also become a very popular thing to stuff into a sandwich, what I did in today’s recipe.

article continues below

To make my sandwiches, large, boneless, skinless chicken thighs are pounded until fairly thin. They are coated in flour, dipped into a beaten egg mixture, then thickly coated with panko, coarse Japanese-style breadcrumbs.

In restaurants, the chicken katsu is often deep-fried once coated. But in my recipe, I opted to shallow-fry it in oil in a skillet until golden, crispy and cooked through.

Many recipes for chicken katsu sandwiches ask you to use a soft style of sliced white bread — something you can easily bite through to get to the flavourful chicken inside.

I instead chose to use a tender hamburger bun, which I find yields a more attractive-looking sandwich.

That said, you likely wouldn’t be looking at the sandwich long before devouring it. That’s because the chicken is flavoured with two addictive sauces. One is a fresh ginger-flavoured mayo that you spread on the cut sides of the buns.

The other is tonkatsu sauce, a kind of Japanese-style barbecue sauce that you drizzle on the chicken. You can buy that sauce at Japanese food stores and in the Asian-foods aisle of some grocery stores, but I made my own simple version.

You can coat the chicken and make the sauces many hours before cooking the chicken and making the sandwiches. Keep everything refrigerated until needed. You could also do the same with the cucumber and radish quick pickles I served with the sandwiches.

Chicken Katsu Sandwiches

Japanese-style chicken that’s crunchy on the outside and juicy in the middle stuffed into buns with two flavourful sauces and refreshing lettuce. The panko needed for the chicken is sold in grocery stores, often in the Asian-foods aisle.

Preparation time: 40 minutes

Cooking time: Six minutes

Makes: Four servings

For ginger mayo (see Eric’s options)

1/2 cup mayonnaise

1 tsp finely grated fresh ginger

2 tsp soy sauce

2 tsp rice or cider vinegar

1 tsp granulated sugar or honey, or to taste

1/2 tsp sesame oil

Combine ingredients in a small bowl. Cover and refrigerate until needed.

For tonkatsu sauce

3 Tbsp ketchup

1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce

1 tsp soy sauce

1/2 tsp granulated sugar or honey

Combine ingredients in a small bowl (see Eric’s options). Cover and refrigerate until needed.

For chicken katsu sandwiches

4 large boneless, skinless chicken thighs (about 325 to 350 grams)

• salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

2 large eggs

1/4 cup milk

1/3 cup all-purpose flour

1 3/4 cups panko

• vegetable oil, for frying

4 tender hamburger buns, split and warmed

1 cup shredded head or leaf lettuce, or to taste

Set a chicken thigh flat on a work surface, smooth-side-down. Cover with a double layer of plastic wrap. Using a kitchen hammer, pound chicken until it’s about 1/4-inch thick, then set on a plate (see Eric’s options). Pound the other chicken thighs this way. Season the chicken with salt and pepper.

Place eggs and milk in a bowl large enough to dunk the chicken in and beat to combine. Place flour and panko in separate wide plates. Set out a baking sheet to set the chicken on once coated.

Coat one chicken thigh in flour. Dip it in the egg mixture, evenly coating it. Coat chicken in panko, thickly pressing it on. Set coated chicken on the baking sheet. Coat the remaining chicken thighs in this fashion.

Preheat oven to 225 F. Set out a second large baking sheet. Pour 1/4 inch or so of oil into a large skillet set over medium, medium-high heat.

When oil is hot, add two of the chicken katsu to the skillet and cook about three minutes per side, until golden and cooked through. (Keep a close eye on the chicken and lower the heat if it overly darkens as it cooks.)

Drain chicken katsu on paper towel, then set on the second clean baking sheet.

Cook the other two chicken katsu as you did the first two and set them on the baking sheet. Put chicken into the oven to keep warm.

Spread the cut sides of each bun generously with the ginger mayo. Top each bottom bun with some shredded lettuce.

Remove chicken katsu from the oven and, at a slight angle, cut each one, widthwise, in half. Now set two half pieces of chicken katsu on each bottom bun. Drizzle chicken katsu with the tonkatsu sauce. Set on top buns and serve.

Eric’s options: For spicy tonkatsu sauce, add sriracha or other spicy chili sauce, to taste.

If you don’t have a kitchen hammer, try using the bottom of a heavy skillet or rolling pin to pound the chicken thighs.

Cucumber and Radish Quick Pickles

Easy and quick sweet and tangy pickles you can serve with the chicken katsu sandwiches.

Preparation time: 15 minutes, plus salting time

Cooking time: A few minutes

Makes: About 1 1/2 cups

3/4 cup water

3 Tbsp rice or cider vinegar

2 tsp granulated sugar

1 cup thinly sliced radishes (see Note)

1 cup thinly sliced mini English cucumbers

1 tsp salt

Place water, vinegar and sugar in a small pot. Bring to a simmer over medium heat for 30 seconds, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Remove from the heat and cool vinegar mixture to room temperature.

Meanwhile, place radishes and cucumber in a fine sieve. Sprinkle with the salt and toss to coat the vegetables. Set sieve over a bowl or sink and let stand at room temperature 30 minutes.

When the 30 minutes are up, rinse the vegetables with cold water, drain well, then pat dry with paper towel. Place the vegetables in a two-cup jar. Pour in the vinegar mixture. Push on the vegetables to submerge them. Cover and refrigerate pickle until ready to serve with the chicken katsu sandwiches.

Note: About two mini cucumbers and 10 radishes, depending on size, should yield the amounts needed here.

Halibut, salmon, albacore tuna, ling cod, crab, sablefish, oysters, clams and mussels are just some of the tasty choices we have and there’s much to celebrate about that.

But for many seafood lovers in this province, the party hits its peak when spot prawns are in season. This year’s fishery began in early June and according to Mike Atkins, Executive Director of Pacific Prawn Fishermen’s Association, will likely last four to six weeks.

article continues below

Although you can buy good quality frozen spot prawns year round, they really are at their best when ultra fresh. They have sweet tasting, almost buttery, succulent meat and part of their allure is that they are only available for a few weeks each year. So when you do have them you really appreciate their fine flavour and recognize what a treat they are.

Despite their name, spot prawns are the largest of the shrimp species commercially harvested off the B.C. coast. They are named after the distinctive white spots you’ll find on their tails.

You are most likely to find spot prawns for sale at stand-alone seafood stores and, occasionally, at some supermarkets, depending on availability. In some coastal locations you can also buy them direct from the fisher.

Depending on where you buy them, you’ll see fresh spot prawn tails with their heads removed, and whole live or recently live spot prawns for sale.

When buying spot prawn tails, choose bright-looking, firm tails that have few or no black spots and smell of the sea. It’s best to cook fresh spot-prawn tails the day you purchase them. But, if they are very fresh and you keep them well chilled on a bed of ice in the refrigerator, you could store them for one day or maybe two.

According to information on the Pacific Prawn Fishermen’s Association website, bcprawns.ca, when buying live spot prawns, look for lively, almost translucent specimens. The tail should be straight in line with the head, and the head should be firm to the touch.

When going out to buy live prawns, bring a cooler with ice in it to put them in for the ride home. Once home, refrigerate them until ready to cook.

Don’t leave live or recently live prawns for more than a few hours before cooking them or removing the heads. Spot prawns have an enzyme that will permeate into the tail and causes their quality to deteriorate quickly. You’ll know the prawns have started to deteriorate if the head is showing a black colour and is soft or mushy when touched, an unappealing quality the meat will also have.

If you need to store the prawns for more than a few hours, you can remove the heads by swiftly turning and pulling them away from the tails. After the heads are removed, the tails should be thoroughly rinsed and, as noted above, kept refrigerated until ready to cook.

Spot prawns can be prepared in ways similar to other large shrimp and prawns. I used them in an aromatic, colourful and tasty Cajun-style sheet pan dinner for two.

Spot Prawn Sheet Pan Dinner for Two

Here’s a nicely spiced, peel-and-eat, Cajun-style way to prepare B.C. spot prawns that sees them cooked on a sheet pan with bits of sausage, potatoes, onions and peppers. For a filling meal, serve with cornbread or corn on the cob.

Preparation time: 25 minutes

Cooking time: 23 to 27 minutes

Makes: two servings

8 to 10 B.C. nugget potatoes, halved

3 Tbsp olive oil

2 Tbsp lemon juice

1 large garlic clove, minced

1 1/2 tsp paprika

1 1/2 tsp oregano

1/2 tsp dried thyme

• freshly ground black pepper, to taste

1 tsp hot pepper sauce, such as Tabasco, or to taste

14 to 16 whole live spot prawns, or spot prawn tails (see Eric’s options)

1 cured (about 5-inch long) chorizo or other tasty sausage, sliced (see Note)

1/2 medium onion, sliced

1/2 medium red bell pepper, sliced

1/2 medium green bell pepper, sliced

• sea salt, to taste

• chopped fresh parsley, to taste

• lemon slices, for garnish

• remoulade sauce (optional, see recipe)

Boil potatoes until just tender, about eight to 10 minutes. Drain well, set on a large plate and cool to room temperature.

Preheat oven 400 F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper, unless it’s non-stick.

Combine oil, lemon juice, garlic, paprika, oregano, thyme, black pepper and hot pepper sauce in a large bowl. Add prawns, sausage, cooked potatoes, onions and bell peppers and use a spatula to toss and coat them with the oil mixture.

Set prawns, sausage and vegetables on the baking sheet, spreading them out so that they sit in a single layer. Drizzle any oil mixture left in the bowl over them and then sprinkle lightly with salt.

Roast the sheet pan dinner 15 to 17 minutes, or until the prawns are cooked and sizzling. Sprinkle with parsley, garnish with lemon slices and, if desired, serve with remoulade sauce.

Note: Ready-to-eat chorizo sausages are sold at supermarkets, butcher and charcuterie shops and European-style delis.

Eric’s options: The prawns used in today’s recipe came from Oak Bay Seafood (oakbayseafood.com). No matter where you shop, it’s best to call ahead to see if they are stocking spot prawns that day. When spot prawns are not available, simply use another type of wild prawn tail in this recipe.

Remoulade Sauce

Here’s a tangy southern-style sauce that you can dollop alongside the prawns and other items in the sheet pan dinner once plated.

Preparation time: five minutes

Cooking time: None

Makes: about 1/2 cup

1/3 cup mayonnaise

1 Tbsp finely chopped sweet mixed pickles or sweet green relish

2 tsp fresh lemon juice

1 tsp capers, finely chopped

1 tsp Dijon mustard

1 tsp chopped fresh parsley

• pinch dried tarragon and paprika

1/4 tsp hot pepper sauce, such as Tabasco, or to taste

Combine ingredients in a small bowl. Cover and refrigerate until needed for the sheet pan dinner.

Blair partly credits the complimentary coffee – lattes, mochas, cappuccinos, or just a fresh brew – for the great experience and his talented hairstylists for the amazing results.

“We believe that education is the key to an amazing look,” Blair explains. “Our team of stylists are highly educated and are constantly attending courses to learn the latest styling and colouring methods and techniques.”

Blair opened Eclipps in 1994 with just himself and five empty salon chairs. Today, Eclipps Hair Café boasts of 14 accomplished hairstylists.

“Our salon invests back into our team to help them stay on top of the ever-changing world of hair care, trends, and products.” Blair says.

When considering a hairstylist, Blair suggests taking both their competence and confidence into account.

“Obviously, you want someone who is educated in the techniques of hairstyling, hair colouring, extensions, and the various hair treatments,” he says, “but more than that, you need someone who is confident in their skills and able to advise you on what would best suit you and your hair.”

Asked to describe the difference between that $15 haircut and what you can expect at Eclipps Hair Café, Blair reflects on his team and the products they use.

“Our team at Eclipps are all experienced, well-qualified professionals who strive to provide a refined yet ever-changing atmosphere to give you a unique salon experience,” he says. “We also use the highest quality products available for colouring, treating, and maintaining your hair.

“Dim sum for breakfast or brunch is part of a typical Chinese lifestyle,” says Howie Zhang, owner of the acclaimed Grand River Seafood Restaurant in Coquitlam. “It’s light and you get a variety of dishes to choose from.”

article continues below

Opening this past spring, Grand River Seafood Restaurant specializes in dim sum, a style of Chinese Canton cuisine prepared in small bite-sized portions and served in steamer baskets, and in deliciously prepared seafood.

The dim sum tradition began in Cantonese-speaking southern China, Howie explains. It’s linked to yum cha, meaning “drink tea” in Cantonese, where teahouses were set up along the Silk Road for travellers needing a place to rest. Over the centuries the tradition transformed from a calm refuge to the happy, busy restaurants people experience today.

So, what should you look for when choosing a spot?

Due to its roots, tea is an important component of dim sum and a good spot will offer a variety of teas to choose from, including green, oolong, jasmine, and chrysanthemum. If you’re going for breakfast or brunch, be sure to order tea instead of coffee.

Dish staples should also be on the menu, such as steamed stuffed buns and dumplings. Other popular dishes also include congee, a sticky, rice porridge, and sou, a flaky pastry. Flavours should rely on the freshness of the ingredients rather than heavy spices.

“Dim sum is all about variety and sharing,” says Howie, who advises that customers should order a wide array of dishes to enhance the experience.

“But make sure you know who your server is,” he adds, laughing. “And only order from your server when you’re ready for more dishes!”

Here’s how to stay safe,[],,"Up until the 1960s, knob and tube electrical wiring was the standard in housing construction. You might recognize it by the porcelain insulating tubes and the cloth that covers the copper wire.

Today, many insurance companies will not provide coverage to houses with K & T wiring. If a home owner can get insurance, they are charged extremely high premiums.

article continues below

“Knob and tube wiring is very unpredictable,” explains Shawn Willis who, with Darren Martin owns AJ’s Electrical, which provides residential electrical services throughout most of the Lower Mainland. “It’s one of the worst systems out there. In its day it was fine, and as long as you don’t touch it, it’s okay, but today people are buying plugs and switches to put onto this older system. As soon as you do that, and you’re not an electrician, it’s a fire hazard.”

AJ’s Electrical will “fish” new wiring through walls and ceilings and bring the house up to code.

“We have tricks we use so we don’t do damage to the architectural look of your house and to the plaster walls,” Martin says.

Another fire hazard is aluminum wiring. From 1974 to 1976, the price of copper wiring shot through the roof so home builders turned to aluminum as a less expensive option.

Cheaper, yes. Safer, no. After problems arose, aluminum wiring was quickly phased out.

Fast forward to today. All the plugs and switches you buy at a hardware store are copper rated. “When they are used in a house with aluminum wiring, the wiring gets hot and starts to arc because aluminum is a softer metal and the connection isn’t good,” Martin says. “This causes the device to burn.”

Understandably, insurance companies do not like houses with aluminum wiring.

But don’t worry — you don’t have to completely re-wire your house to make it safe, Willis says.

“We put proper copper tails onto the aluminum with properly designed marrettes that adhere to Canadian electrical code and CSA requirements. We change all the plugs and switches, including all the light fixtures. We hook it all back together and write a letter to insurance companies to say it’s done properly and to code.”

You could choose cremation, burial, or green burial. But out here on the West Coast, the trend towards cremation has been increasing.

""Many people choose cremation because they feel it is the cleanest form of disposition,"" says Keith Louw, Location Manager for First Memorial Burkeview.. ""Cost is also a consideration. Depending on what your request is for disposition of the cremated remains, a cremation might be a more cost effective option than a burial.""

article continues below

Options for disposition of the cremated remains range from a full in-ground burial, to placing them in an urn niche in a cemetery, to scattering them either in a cemetery's Garden of Remembrance, or somewhere significant to the deceased.

There are also a number of options for the type of service you can have for your remains, or those of a loved one.

""A very popular service for cremations is the remembrance service,"" says Keith. ""This is also called a Celebration of Life or a Memorial Service. Here, the cremation takes place at a different time than the service. Often, if death occurs in the winter, the cremation happens within a few days, but the memorial service is postponed until the spring or summer.""

A full service occurs in a church or the funeral home chapel.

""The Full Service Option typically involves the funeral service followed by the funeral party attending the cemetery for the interment or in some cases the crematorium for the cremation,"" Keith explains.

There's also a growing trend towards the ""no service"" option.

""The No Service Option,"" Keith notes, ""is where the family choose not to have a service in a church or chapel and instead make their own arrangements. It could be held in the common area of a strata building, or a gathering at a home, or a simple remembrance by a favourite place of the deceased. While the funeral home does not host the event we can support the family by creating memorial folders or creating a photo slideshow, to assist in personalizing the event.""

To arrange a cremation, Keith recommends contacting First Memorial Burkeview, or another professional funeral service provider of your choice.

""There are a number of legal requirements to be taken care of on death and before cremation,"" Keith says. ""At First Memorial Burkeview, we work with the family to complete the appropriate paperwork, register the death, and advise on the options for the disposition of the remains.""

“Our winters are not as cold as they used to be,” says Dr. Leah Montgomery, owner and veterinarian at Shaughnessy Veterinary Hospital in Port Coquitlam. “Because of this, fleas aren’t dying off during the winter months.”

article continues below

And fleas aren’t the only parasites affected by the changing climate. Heartworm is creeping up from California and over from the Interior, according to Montgomery.

Preventing parasites is much easier than treating them, and it’s much more affordable in the long run.

Here are Dr. Montgomery’s top 5 tips for keeping your pet parasite-free:

1. Control your animal. Get your pet on flea control or a worm prevention product as soon as possible. Flea control products may seem expensive, but not in comparison with treating fleas, which is both costly and extremely difficult to do successfully.

2. Check pets over.Once your pet is using a product, make sure that it’s effective. Keep an eye on your animal and whatever you do, don’t stop using the product because they don’t have fleas.

3. Get a checkup. Parasite control products work best when they are tailored specifically to the animal being treated, and dosages are determined by weight. Take your pet to the veterinarian for an annual exam. The vet can ensure the product is working, and check your pet’s weight to see if the dosage needs to be changed.

4. Use products properly. Parasite control products are only effective if they’re used correctly. Go over the directions with staff at your animal hospital or clinic, and follow those directions to the letter once you get home.

5. Don’t turn to the pet store. Pet store products may seem more affordable, but some are also ineffective. Veterinarians know which parasite control products work, and which ones work safely, too. The products offered at veterinary hospitals and clinics are the best possible options for your pets. Check with your vet before treating your animal for any health condition.

If you suspect your pet does have a parasite, contact your veterinarian as soon as possible, and make sure you clean up after your animal – parasites can be passed on to other animals and children through your pet’s poop.

Yet, only three years - and several accolades - later, Dinakis Mediterranean Grill is living up to its acclaim.

What’s the family’s recipe for success? Samira says its simple: “it all comes down to the service and food.”

She said that if it is quality Mediterranean food, like zingy, crispy Calamari or slow-roasted, falling off the bone lamb that customers want, that is what they will get.

Though, it was not as easy as it sounds. Hailing from Afghanistan as new immigrants to Canada, Samira says that it all would not be possible without her brother, Sadat, and her father, Zaman.

“I’m really proud that of the fact that we just landed here and almost right away we got our own business,” Samira said. “We all work together, standing beside each other and helping each other.”

The sentiment is shared with Samira’s father, Zaman. He said that it is “really interesting” having involved his family in the business. “We are all sharing ideas, working together on initiatives and ultimately,” Zaman continued, “we are always looking for ways to make the restaurant better than before.”

There might be a serious disease or condition forming, even before symptoms become obvious.

Annual animal checkups are extremely important and can detect everything from heart conditions to arthritis, but many pet owners don’t head to the veterinary hospital or clinic until they see something that worries them.

article continues below

“Sometimes animals seem healthy on the outside but things are starting internally,” says Dr. Leah Montgomery, owner and veterinarian at Shaughnessy Veterinary Hospitalin Port Coquitlam. “We find so many things on routine checkups that pet owners wouldn’t notice.”

Here are six reasons why Dr. Montgomery says an annual trip to the veterinarian is well worth the cost:

1. It may be the only vet visit you need. Pets that get regular checkups are often treated on the spot, before a health condition becomes a major problem, and only have to come in once a year. It saves the animal from suffering, and it is less expensive in the long run.

2. Many health conditions are hard to spot.The majority of diseases and conditions that affect animals are difficult for owners to pick up on. Blood work can detect internal issues, and a veterinarian can recognize other problems with a thorough exam.

3. Prevention and early treatment are more successful. Just like humans, animals have a better outcome the sooner a health problem is detected. For instance, routine blood work can detect the beginning stages of kidney failure, and the vet can then recommend supplements or dietary changes to slow the condition and improve your pet’s quality of life.

4. Chronic conditions can be better managed. If a pet has a chronic health condition, the vet can stop it from getting worse. In the case of arthritis, which affects many animals, a veterinarian can recommend affordable treatment options that help minimize pain and discomfort.

5. Better health overall. Animals that have an annual exam have better outcomes when a disease or condition is spotted, but they also have better overall health. Potential problems are spotted in advance and monitored, helping prolong the life of your pet.

6. An important relationship is maintained.Even if your pet is perfectly healthy now, it is important for the veterinarian to have a good relationship with both pet and owner. That way, the pet owner knows who to turn to when their pet’s health declines.

She’s lived in Coquitlam ever since, working as a family therapist, predominantly for SHARE Family and Community Services. Until 2007, she had no interest in a career in politics. “I was always orientated around how we make things better for people so family therapy was the natural place for me. One of the things I observed in my career was that the people who do better are those who are connected to others,” she says.

In 2007, she gave a speech in favour of the Cold Weather Mat program in Coquitlam. “Afterwards, some people asked me to run for council and I did and won a seat for the New Democrats,” she says. “I began to learn what goes into making a community function – planning, recreational facilities, costs, how we can work to ensure people’s lives are rich and fulfilling, and that they know their neighbours.”

Ms Robinson ran provincially and became MLA for Coquitlam-Maillardville in 2013. She was appointed Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing after the 2017 election, and her love of community continues to be a guiding principle. “I remember asking developers when I was on council why they were building 600 sq ft apartments when they were not places for families live in,” she says. “I look after a number of things that all fit together into an affordability piece. For example, if you have good transit you don’t need a car and parking, and that can lower the cost of living and housing.”

The young family that brought Ms Robinson to Coquitlam is now grown and she’s always interested in her kids’ perspectives on issues in their community. “I’m so excited to see young people getting into politics,” she says. “I worry that they’re working so hard to pay rent that they don’t have time to engage, but I encourage them to write letters, make phone calls. They have to show up, they have to talk, and they have to tell us what their biggest concerns are so we can build strong and resilient communities together.”

""I basically grew up on a construction site thanks to my Dad and his family,"" Lisa laughs, ""And my years in nursing taught me how to understand people's needs and emotions.""

Choosing Lisa as a real estate professional means signing up for the full service treatment.

""I don't just sell your house,"" Lisa explains. ""I work with you beforehand to prepare you for selling and buying a new home, and I follow up after the fact to make sure everything is working out.""

As an award-winning realtor with RE/MAX All Points Realty Group, Lisa uses marketing, both web-based and mail outs, to ensure that her clients' listings receive maximum exposure.

""That's one benefit of using a professional realtor,"" Lisa says. ""When you sell your home yourself, it's unlikely that it will get the same exposure that I can offer. Also, we're dealing with legal contracts. It's helpful to have someone with experience take care of things so you're protected.""

If you're in the market for a new home, Lisa recommends getting pre-approved for financing first.

""That way, you know exactly what you can afford. It can be really disappointing to have your heart set on a home, only to find out that you can't afford the monthly payments. Once a client is preapproved for financing, then we can look at homes in the appropriate price range.""

Once an offer is made, Lisa often helps clients find contractors for renovations or offers suggestions for design ideas.

""Because of my connection with the construction industry, I have a lot of contacts,"" she says. ""When clients ask about who to hire for renovations, I can make some personal recommendations. I can direct them to people who can provide suggestions and make sure they get the product that fits their needs.""

A testament to Lisa 's client service is the fact that people come back to her after buying a house.

""I had a client recently who bought a home through me a couple of years ago,"" she says. ""They've saved a little money and are ready to do some updates and renovations. They contacted me for suggestions and ideas and I was able to help point them in the right direction.""

Nicole Renwick, Executive Director of the Memorial Society of British Columbia, uses the analogy of the pilgrims crossing America to describe a green burial.

article continues below

""Imagine the pilgrims making their way across America,"" she says. ""When someone died, they simply wrapped the person in a blanket and buried them. There was no embalming fluid, no burial liner, zero affect on the environment. The body was left to decompose in the ground.""

With today's interest in the environment, the green burial is enjoying a resurgence in popularity. Nicole outlines four things you should know about a green burial:

1. It's completely natural

A green burial is a process that allows for the natural decomposition of human remains without the inclusion of chemicals.

""As a minimum,"" Nicole explains, ""for a burial to be considered green, the Memorial Society of B.C. requirements include a biodegradable coffin, no embalming, and no grave liner.""

Preferably, there should be plants or shrubs planted on the grave. The highest form of a green burial would include interment in a natural setting.

2. Green burials are gaining in popularity

""It's a very popular option,"" says Nicole. ""With today's interest in conserving the environment, people are thinking more and more about avoiding the use of chemicals and chemical liners in their burial.""

3. There are various levels of ""greenness""

""At the Memorial Society of B.C.,"" explains Nicole, ""we recognize that people have different interpretations of what constitutes a ""green"" burial. We're actively working throughout British Columbia to ensure that all levels of green burials are available around the province.""

4. Recyclable plots

A major benefit of a green burial in this time of land scarcity on the Lower Mainland is the fact that the plot is reusable.

""With a green burial,"" Nicole explains, ""you don't purchase the plot. You lease a small piece of land. In 25 years, that plot can be reused for another burial because your remains have decomposed into the earth as part of the natural life cycle of the planet.""

The Memorial Society of British Columbia is a non-profit, member-based, volunteer-driven organization that has been helping British Columbians with end of life planning decisions for more than 60 years. For a nominal one-time membership fee, the Society will record your wishes for the disposal of your remains as well as assist your loved ones secure a discount on funeral services with an approved funeral homes throughout the province.

Experts say that regularly-scheduled maintenance and a few simple practices are the key to avoiding costly car repairs down the road.

“Staying on top of routine maintenance is really important for the safety and efficiency of your car,” says Westwood Honda’s General Manager, Colin Case. “It sounds cliché but small maintenance costs now really can save thousands of repair costs down the road.”

article continues below

While specific maintenance requirements can vary from model to model, Case says these 6 basic tips can really help keep your car running smoothly:

• For new vehicles, oil and filter changes are generally recommended every 8,000kms.

• It’s important to periodically check- and flush- your car’s systems. The braking system should be checked every year for wear and to ensure it is functioning properly — brake fluid should also be flushed after 2 years to ensure proper braking and prevent failure of braking components. The cooling system should be checked for leaks every year

• Whether you drive a manual or automatic transmission, both systems need a fluid change about every 50,000kms. Repairing or replacing a damaged transmission can be expensive; keeping up with regular transmission fluid changes will prolong the life of your transmission and keep things shifting smoothly.

• The air filter helps promote optimum fuel economy and overall performance and should be replaced every 30-40,000kms depending on their condition. Cars with replaceable fuel filters should have a filter change every 100,000kms.

• Small but mighty, the spark plug is essential to keeping your car’s ignition working and should be inspected regularly. Some spark plugs can last up to 160,000kms before needing replacement, your dealer will let you know how yours are doing.

• Belts and rubber hoses should be checked periodically for wear and cracking, and replaced as needed – generally about every four to five years, or 80,000 to 100,000kms.

Staying on top of regular routine maintenance will ensure your vehicle is road worthy and running smoothly.

“You don’t see this dish in many Indian restaurants around here or any place else, for that matter,” says Bhatt, whose award-winning Port Moody restaurant added Prawn Dilwala about a year ago. “It’s not very well known, so it comes as a very pleasant surprise for those who are looking for something different.”

Starting with jumbo black tiger prawns which are cooked in a creamy sauce with onions, ginger, garlic, tomatoes, grated cottage cheese and cashew nuts, the Prawn Dilwala delivers an experience unlike any other item on the menu because of its unique combination of flavours, says Bhatt.

“You just don’t see many dishes with cream, cashew nuts and cottage cheese,” he points out. “It’s rich and creamy, but our staff is very experienced and know how to get it just right. All together, it creates a taste experience that is really quite unforgettable.”

Bhatt says Indian restaurants can get a reputation for only serving spicy or saucy food items, but insists that’s definitely not the case at Aroma Indian Restaurant and Lounge in general, or with Prawn Dilwala in particular.

While he admits that Prawn Dilwala is a sauce-based dish, he is quick to point out that his chef, who learned his craft in 5-star restaurants in India, knows how to balance the dish to perfection.

“We’ve had people from all different walks of life – with all sorts of preferences – order Prawn Dilwala and so far, whoever has tried it has been very happy they did!” he says.

Instead, she pursued a degree in dental medicine (DMD) through the University of British Columbia, graduating in 1985. She opened her Coquitlam dental practice, just a block away from her home, straight out of university.

“Dentistry is a good fit for me,” Dr. Thorpe explains, “because it’s a unique profession. You use your brain for diagnosis but you also need good hand-eye coordination, and I enjoy both aspects of the profession.”

A creative person by nature—she paints and plays the piano—Dr. Thorpe operates a family-oriented dental practice with her associate, Dr. Stalinjeet Gill. Together, they offer a broad-range of dental services including check-ups, root canals, bridges, and extractions, and various forms of cosmetic dentistry.

“I love the aesthetic side of dentistry,” confesses Dr. Thorpe, “I love giving people beautiful smiles and I really enjoy working with children. In addition to general dentistry, Dr. Gill also enjoys complex procedures like root canals and extractions, so we make a good team.”

Dr. Thorpe notes that her dental office has the sort of relaxed atmosphere patients really enjoy, and she makes a point of injecting her love of smiles into her practice.

Although its record in North America is relatively new, acupuncture has been practiced throughout continental Europe, Russia, and Japan for centuries. With a rich history that spans past 6000 BCE, acupuncture is not only the world’s oldest medical practice, it is one that is being increasingly more used throughout modern medicine.

Dr. Jane Wang, a local acupuncturist in Coquitlam, says the main reason for this healing technique to outlast millennia is simple: it is a painless, basic method to treat pain that is effective and bears no side effects. This practice of inserting fine needles into specific areas of the body to stimulate sensory nerves under the skin and in muscle tissue has been used to treat a myriad of pain-related issues.

At Jane’s Acupuncture Clinic, Dr. Wang has seen and treated countless people within her community. Having spent 23 years at this clinic, her colleague, Mike Lee, says it feels like there isn’t something she hasn’t seen. With Dr. Wang’s own extensive history with acupuncture, which includes studying, practicing, and teaching it, she said she hopes to continue to make many more people happy. Below is a list why you may be one of those people.

1. You have headaches or migraines

2. You have joint pain or arthritis

3. You want to boost your immune system

4. You get muscle aches or stomach aches

5. You suffer from various sores and pain

6. You want to try an ancient Chinese medicine technique safely and feel great afterwards

Though it may seem like haphazard list, it is actually a highly condensed one – acupuncture, among the medical community, is well known for healing and treating various pain issues, even when the symptoms or source is unknown. The list of medical issues Jane’s Acupuncture Clinic specializes in, let alone treats, is just a small portion of medical issues that yield to acupuncture treatment.

That’s exactly what happened to Wayne Dick, a Tri-Cities realtor who was supposed to be a teacher before finding his dream career that allowed him to help people buy and sell their dream homes.

In 1983, Wayne signed on as an auxiliary firefighter in the Tri-Cities area. Two years later, he became a realtor, selling 25 houses in his first five months in business. When the opportunity to work as a firefighter full-time came up, he had a change of heart, deciding instead to continue on the realtor path while still working as an auxiliary firefighter part-time.

Wayne now runs his real estate firm, Team Wayne Dick with RE/MAX All Points Realty, alongside his daughter, Brittany Dick, who joined in 2007 and has personally been involved in over 900 sales. The team also recently welcomed Holly Power, a newly licensed associate who has been with the team since March 2017.

Quite a lot has changed in the industry since Wayne started back in the ‘80s. “There used to be 4,000 realtors in Greater Vancouver. Now there are 20,000,” he says. While Wayne’s firm is based in the Tri-Cities area, he says 60 percent of his transactions are Tri-Cities-based while 40 percent occur in other parts of the Lower Mainland.

One of the things Wayne loves most about being a realtor is helping people achieve their dreams. “I like helping (clients) get into the market and understand the market,” he says. Wayne also loves the challenge real estate offers: “Last night I finally won my client a house after seven bids.”

For Wayne, being a realtor is about client relationships first, and sales second. Most of his sales are based on past client referrals and he is now working with the children of clients he began relationships with years ago. “(Our philosophy is) looking after client’s need first and building relationships for life. It’s not just selling the house, it’s like a friendship. Because we actually do care,” he says.

But one of the challenges I’ve come across with non-toxic products is that what I gain in natural ingredients, I often lose in effectiveness. (It took much trial and error to finally find a natural deodorant that works, and now I’m hooked on Sola). I’m a huge fan of SPF for its melanoma- and wrinkle-preventing properties (I wear at least SPF 15 on my face year-round), but up until now I haven’t come across a non-toxic sunscreen line that is free of harsh chemicals.

When it comes to evaluating whether a product is safe to put on my skin and hair, I use the Environmental Working Group’s Skin Deep database. I simply type in the name of the product and the database provides a rating from 1 to 10 (1 being the least toxic and 10 being the most).

article continues below

Dr. Mark Lupin of Cosmedica in Victoria says when shopping for a non-toxic sunscreen or sunblock you should look for a formula that uses mineral active ingredients such as zinc oxide and/or titanium dioxide, instead of the chemical filters oxybenzone, avobenzone, octisalate, octocrylene, homosalate and octinoxate included in most sunscreens on the market. Also, look for the words ""Broad Spectrum” on the sunscreen label as this indicates that, in addition to UVB protection represented by the SPF rating, the product also protects from UVA rays which can contribute to skin cancer and premature aging.

Here are four non-toxic suncare brands I recommend trying this summer:

1) Beautycounter, the skincare and makeup line known for its commitment to using non-toxic ingredients, has just launched a line of non-toxic suncare products for body and face formulated with non-nano zinc oxide and antioxidant-rich California Poppy. Most of the products boast EWG ratings of 1 and are available in mist, lotion and stick formulas, perfect for the whole family to use.

2) Vancouver-based natural product brand A Healthy Beginning makes a zinc oxide-based SPF 25 Whipped Mineral Sun Butter which contains raspberry seed oil to boost sun protection and hydrate the skin. All ingredients have a low EWG rating, the product packaging uses minimal plastic, and the butter can be used on the face and body (and is perfect for kids, too).

3) Josie Maran loves her argan oil and she makes a beautifully scented, chemical-free facial oil that protects with an SPF of 47, and is available at Sephora.

4) Also available at Sephora with EWG ratings between 1 and 3 is Coola's range of non-toxic SPF products which includes a White Tea Face Sport SPF 50 and an SPF 30 Sunscreen Spray Pina Colada.

Whichever sunscreen you choose, be sure to apply 30 minutes before sun exposure, reapplying every two hours, and after swimming.

Dr. Ian Hyams qualified as a doctor more than 20 years ago and until recently was located in West Vancouver. He moved to Port Coquitlam recently to be closer to family, and is now the head of Elicare Hyams Medical Clinic, a brand-new clinic at Fremont Village Shopping Centre.

The clinic will eventually offer walk-in and specialty services, but for now, the emphasis is firmly on family medicine. Dr. Hyams has a special interest in chronic pain management and treatment of fibromyalgia, and will be joined by three other GPs from different specialties and backgrounds.

“Dr. Hyams is looking forward to putting down roots in the Port Coquitlam community and getting to know the people who live here,” says Richard Wang, director of operations for Elicare, which is partnering with the doctor in the new clinic. “He’s known for his caring, genuine approach and his thoroughness – so important in a family doctor, as well as his expertise in helping people deal with chronic pain, which can be such a difficult condition to live with.”

Elicare Hyams Medical Clinic will be reaching out to other clinics and healthcare practitioners in the PoCo area. “We want to be part of the medical community here, getting to know our colleagues and seeing how we can be of service to them,” says Wang. “It’s part of our commitment to creating a strong, healthy community in Port Coquitlam.”

Elicare Hyams Medical Clinic is at 105 Fremont Village Shopping Centre, 1250 Dominion Ave, Port Coquitlam and is open 9am-5pm Monday to Saturday, plus selected Sundays. To find out more, visit Elicare.ca/port-coquitlam, or email info@elicare.ca.",[]

The solution? According to Jacques, looking for pet-friendly flooring in Coquitlam is the first step.

“Pet-friendly carpeting can help to prevent spills, keep strains from seeping in, and can help make clean-up easy,” says Jacques, whose award-winning business has served the Tri-Cities area since 1986. “Not only will it make your life easier, it will help preserve your flooring for years to come.”

Here are 4 benefits of pet-friendly flooring to keep in mind:

1. Liquid-repelling properties: “Liquid-repelling properties work to surround each fiber to help protect the entire carpet—from the tips of the fiber to the carpet backing—and keep stains from seeping in,” says Jacques. “It helps stop urine and vomit from seeping into the fiber and becoming permanent.”

2. Easier cleaning: “The more repellant a carpet is, the easier it is to clean,” says Jacques. “Spills are less likely to penetrate to the base of the yarn and will typically wick back to the top, making them up much easier to remove. The fiber has hair repelling technology on it so the hair is easier to vacuum off.”

3. Protecting your padding and subfloors: “An added benefit of stain-resistant carpeting—and one many pet-owners are not aware of—is a special carpet cushion or Scrim Layer that has a moisture barrier to help keep liquids such as pet urine from penetrating the padding and subfloors,” says Jacques.

4. Reducing odors: Keeping their home smelling fresh is always a challenge for pet-owners. Odor-reducing carpet treatments can really help. “Odor-reducers continually work to eliminate common pet smells that might come from your carpeting,” says Jacques.

Offering an impressive range of flooring styles, colours, textures and finishes—not to mention installation warranties—Nufloors Coquitlam is located at 1100 Landsdowne Drive, Coquitlam.

The 18-year veteran quarterback headlines the Canadian Football Hall of Fame's 2020 class that was unveiled Thursday. Burris, 45, got the nod in his first year of eligibility, becoming just the 21st player ever to do so but second in as many years after Calgary running back Jon Cornish in 2019.

article continues below

Joining Burris in the player category are offensive linemen Clyde Brock and Freddie Childress and quarterback Greg Vavra. John Hufnagel, the Calgary Stampeders president/GM, and Larry Uteck (posthumously), the former head coach/athletic director at Saint Mary’s University, were both named as builders.

Burris's family — wife Nicole and sons Armand and Barron — had known of his induction since February but managed to keep quiet about it until about two and a half weeks ago when the Hall of Fame informed Burris. Even then, the Burris clan was very nonchalant in asking the former quarterback to take in what he thought was a run-of-the-mill video.

Instead, Burris watched Hall of Famer Damon Allen (2012) outline his pro football journey to Canada, which drew a rather bewildered look from Burris. Then Allen detailed Burris's stellar CFL career before Mark DeNobile, the Hall of Fame's executive director, delivered the big news.

And the player, affectionately dubbed Smilin' Hank because of his outgoing personality, was lost for words as tears streamed down his face.

""Yeah, they got me good,"" Burris said with a chuckle. ""What's funny is whenever I've told the boys to keep anything quiet, they've always gone back to their mother and yet they didn't say a peep about this.

""I was lost for words just because to hear it shows you that people appreciated the things you did throughout your career. This is the way for the league and all the organizations and the fans saying, 'Thank you,' and for me I'm humbled by it . . . there's so many guys in there (Hall of Fame) who I looked up to and now to be able to join them is a dream come true.""

The six-foot-one, 190-pound Burris, a native of Spiro, Okla., played 20 pro seasons, 18 in the CFL with the Calgary Stampeders (1997-99, 2005-11), Saskatchewan Roughriders (2000, 2003-04), Hamilton Tiger-Cats (2012-13) and Ottawa Redblacks (2014-16). Burris also spent time with the NFL's Green Bay Packers (2001) and Chicago Bears (2002).

Burris appeared in five Grey Cups, winning three (1998, '08, '16) and being named the MVP twice (2008, '16). The CFL's outstanding player on two occasions (2010, 2015), Burris amassed 63,639 passing yards and 373 TD passes — both third all-time.

Burris retired shortly after leading Ottawa to a thrilling 39-33 overtime Grey Cup upset win over Calgary. He threw for 461 yards and three TDs despite suffering a knee injury during warmups.

Burris said his Hall of Fame induction is as much a testament to his family's resilience and perseverance as it is his on-field accomplishments.

""I had to take my wife all over Canada, drag my kids all over Canada and force them to make new friends just for dad to be able to play this game called football,"" said Burris, whose family still calls Ottawa home. ""And for them to understand and see just the emotions that ran through me . . . it just shows how big that moment is, just kind of when your whole life flashes before you.""

Burris and the other inductees will have to wait for their day in the sun due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2020 class will be honoured alongside the 2021 inductees next August.

When Burris is formally honoured, he'll be joined by former teammate Childress and Hufnagel, who served as Calgary's head coach (2008-2015) before moving into the front office full-time. Burris won Grey Cups with both ('98 with Childress, '08 with Hufnagel).

""Calgary is a machine right now and it all started in 2008 when Huf came in and we got that Grey Cup in his first year,"" Burris said. ""Calgary has always had double-digit wins and been in the playoffs each and every year Huf has been there, they've always been a strong contender for the Grey Cup and there's one reason why.""

Hufnagel, a 68-year-old native of Coraopolis, Pa., spent 12 seasons as a CFL quarterback with Calgary (1976-79), Saskatchewan (1980-83, 1987) and Winnipeg (1984-86) before getting into coaching. A five-time Grey Cup champion, Hufnagel also earned a Super Bowl ring as an assistant with the New England Patriots (2003).

Hufnagel amassed a 102-42-1 record as Calgary's head coach, his .712 win percentage being the highest among coaches with more than 100 games. He's been named the CFL's coach of the year twice (2008, 2014).

Childress, a 53-year-old native of Little Rock, Ark., played 13 CFL seasons with Shreveport (1994), Birmingham (1995), Calgary (1996-03) and Saskatchewan (2004-06). A former second-round pick of the NFL's New England Patriots, Childress won two Grey Cups with the Stampeders (1998, 2001) and in 1998 was named the CFL's top offensive lineman.

Brock, 79, of Los Angeles, played 12 seasons with Saskatchewan (1964-75), helping the club win its first Grey Cup in 1966. The former Dallas Cowboy-San Francisco 49er appeared in 169 regular-season CFL games and four times was named a league all-star before being inducted into Saskatchewan's Plaza of Honour in 1995.

Vavra, 59, of Red Deer, Alta., helped the Calgary Dinos win the Vanier Cup in 1983, his final season at the school. That year, he also became the first player in the program's history to capture the Hec Crighton Trophy as Canadian university football's top player and still holds the U Sports record for most passing yards in a game (627).

Vavra was drafted by the Calgary Stampeders in 1984 and also spent time with the B.C. Lions (1986-87) and Edmonton Eskimos (1988).

After playing seven CFL seasons as a defensive back with Toronto (1974-76), B.C. (1977), Montreal (1978-80) and Ottawa (1980), Uteck became an assistant coach at Saint Mary’s University in 1982. He was promoted to head coach the following year, a position he held until 1997.

Over that span, Uteck was named the Atlantic University Athletic Association coach of the year five times and twice Canadian university football's top coach.

Uteck served as athletic director from 1995 to 2002 and the Huskies captured two Vanier Cups (2001-02). The native of Thornhill, Ont., passed away Dec. 25, 2002 of Lou Gehrig's disease at the age of 50.

The Atlantic Bowl was renamed the Uteck Bowl in 2003.

The joint study by researchers at the B.C. Centre for Disease Control, University of B.C., LifeLabs and public health scientists is posted on the health research website medRxiv and a news conference on the findings is scheduled for Thursday morning.

article continues below

The authors say the findings indicate successful suppression of community transmission in B.C., with an estimated overall infection rate of less than one per cent.

The study looked at anonymous blood samples collected for reasons unrelated to COVID-19 by LifeLabs in March and May, before and after public health measures were introduced.

The first samples in March found two of 869 specimens were positive, for a prevalence of 0.28 per cent, while the May sample found a prevalence of 0.55 per cent.

Health Minister Adrian Dix described the estimated infection rate as ""very low"" and says it shows the effectiveness of British Columbia's public health measures and co-operation of the public.

""It reinforces the fact that we're on the right track,"" Dix says.

""Of course, this is as the study suggests a dual-edged question, a low level of transmission but also very few people with antibodies to deal with potential future spikes of COVID-19.""

If the study's prevalence rate is applied to the whole provincial population, it could mean about 28,000 people have had the novel coronavirus, while 3,149 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed to date, however Dix noted the results are specific to the Vancouver area.

Health officials have repeatedly said that more people have been infected with the virus than have tested positive and Dix calls the estimated prevalence rate in B.C. ""encouraging.""

""Overall the level of infection in B.C. was low and that's due to the actions of people in B.C. That said, there are more people who were infected with COVID-19 than tested positive and that's something we've said clearly, especially in the period of March and April when we were focusing our testing program particularly on specific groups including health-care workers,"" Dix says.

The study is the first of its kind in Canada, he says.

The study is also important because it involved people who did not self-select for COVID-19 testing, so they likely didn't believe they had the virus, Dix says.

The study was authorized by provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and approved by the clinical research ethics board of the university. It has not yet been peer reviewed.

British Columbia recorded 21 new cases Wednesday and no new deaths. There are 207 active cases while 2,753 people who tested positive have recovered, the government said in a news release.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons is expected to take Sidoo into custody on September 23 and release him from a Pacific Northwest area facility just before Christmas.

article continues below

Sidoo, 61, appeared online via Zoom in front of United States District Judge Nathaniel Gorton of the United States District Court for District of Massachusetts, as well as his lawyers and prosecutors. He wore a plaid suit while sitting in an office space inside his $31.7 million home in Vancouver’s Point Grey neighbourhood.

Sidoo, now a convicted felon, initially pled innocent to fraud and money laundering charges; he teared up before being sentenced and read a prepared statement:

“The last several months have been the hardest in my entire life and today I accept the court’s decision without reservation. No words can express how sorry I am for my decisions and actions that led to this day. I make no excuses, your honour. I broke the law and pled guilty and I now must pay for my actions.

“To my wife and boys, all I ever wanted was your love and respect and to be a good role model. And I know I have made a terrible mistake that has deeply affected our family. To my friends and colleagues and former teammates over the years, I am deeply ashamed today. To the young men and women who looked up to me as a role model, you deserve better. To the court and all of you, I wish to apologize for my actions.

“I will serve my sentence and am committed to returning to the community and doing everything possible to make a positive impact. I hope in time people will not judge me for the worst mistake in my life but for the work in the days, weeks and years ahead in which I am committed to being a better man.”

Gorton told Sidoo he was “impressed” by the businessman’s “obvious remorse.”

But Gorton pointed out two omissions in Sidoo’s statement.

“You expect to put this behind you and go forward and make up for what you called mistakes. I would call it a crime, not a mistake, but nevertheless, it is important that you acknowledge it and realize how many constituencies you have disappointed,” said the judge.

Sidoo also did not explicitly acknowledge that his crimes resulted in two students missing an opportunity to attend the universities his sons, Dylan Sidoo and Jordan Sidoo, were admitted to.

“What you accomplished, along with getting them into college, is to deprive two other deserving students of admittance into those universities — an act that is the very antithesis of one you want to be known for,” said Gorton.

Likewise, United States Attorney Andrew Lelling submitted to Gorton: “Sidoo engaged in serious criminal conduct involving fraud and deception that stretched over multiple years.

“His crimes warrant significant punishment. By engaging in the scheme, with [scheme mastermind Rick Singer] and others, Sidoo was able to steal two college admissions slots for his sons, including one from the University of California at Berkeley, one of the top public universities in the nation.”

Sidoo, said Gorton, “committed a crime that displayed an unbelievable lack of integrity, morality and common sense.

“You have let your selfish desire, your pride and your enormous wealth overcome all of what you apparently want to stand for with your works of charity,” Gorton told Sidoo.

Sidoo’s philanthropy, derived from his earnings in the capital markets, was central to his sentencing defense. According to Sidoo he has donated several million dollars to charitable causes, such as the University of B.C. football program.

In pleading guilty to fraud, Sidoo avoided a maximum prison term of 20 years and prosecutors subsequently agreed to 90 days behind bars, plus a $250,000 fine and one-year of supervised release, which will not be enforced in Canada by the U.S. Probation Department. Prosecutors also agreed to drop the money laundering charge.

The prison Sidoo goes to is expected to have harsher conditions since his options are limited due to his foreign citizenship. His attorney Martin Weinberg said he is expected to spend 14 days in isolation in a “maximum security setting,” due to COVID-19.

Sidoo will get four days credit for time already served. If he serves the full 90 days he will be released December 17 but will have to spend 14 days in isolation at home should B.C. public health rules for international travellers and COVID-19 continue into the fall.

Gorton said Sidoo’s crime would normally warrant more time in jail but there are mitigating circumstances, such as his remorse, lack of criminal record, philanthropy and “collateral consequences,” such as not being able to enter the U.S. as a felon and being stripped last month of his Order of B.C. medal for community service. Sidoo’s attorneys also previously noted he did not directly pay the universities but that his fraud was limited to cheating on the tests.

The former B.C. Lions football player worked as a stock broker in the 1990s and an investment banker between 2000 and 2010. Since 2010 he has made millions of dollars directing a handful of public companies that have failed to generate wealth for retail investors.

Sidoo was arrested March 8, 2019, in San Jose, California, on charges by the U.S. Department of Justice of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering related to the high-profile U.S. college admissions and bribery scandal, brought to light by a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe dubbed Operation Varsity Blues.

One of dozens of parents to be charged, Sidoo initially pled innocent to paying $200,000 total to scheme mastermind William ‘Rick’ Singer, who hired corrupt exam expert Mark Riddell to take Dylan and Jordan’s SAT exams, in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Sidoo also helped falsify one of his son Jordan’s university applications in October 2013 with an essay that originally included a fake claim of Jordan being held up at gunpoint by gangsters, while he was purported to be an intern for an anti-gang organization.

Co-conspirators Singer and Riddell pled guilty last year in exchange for cooperating with the government’s investigation.

The guilty parties in the case, who used Singer’s criminal services, were generally well-off individuals. Celebrities such as actress Lori Loughlin and her clothing designer husband Mossimo Gianulli and actress Felicity Huffman also pled guilty for related crimes and brought much media attention to the investigation.

Sidoo’s sons had no involvement in their father’s crime.

Jordan is now a 2018 history graduate from University of California Berkeley. Dylan graduated in cinematic arts in 2016 from the University of Southern California (USC). The two previously attended Vancouver’s prestigious St. George’s School.

Neither university has announced whether or not their degrees will remain valid. Dylan, according to the sentencing documents, had scored a 1,460/2,400 SAT score until Riddell, using a fake ID in December 2011, bumped up the score to 1,700, which was high enough for Dylan to enter Chapman University (and later transfer to USC). Riddell then scored 2,280/2,400 for Jordan in December 2012, paving the way to Berkley.

Riddell also took a high school test for Dylan. The B.C. Ministry of Education has issued no statement on how its testing process was so vulnerable to fraud.

Both sons have since entered into penny stock promotion with their father.

With COVID-19 and physical distancing requirements cancelling events all over the Lower Mainland, organizers are coming up with creative ways to celebrate.

article continues below

To that end, Port Coquitlam is not only offering an afternoon of performances, but has organized a series of community projects that people can do online as well.

“We know how much May Days means to our community and I’m pleased we’re able to keep this important tradition alive in some way, even though it will look different than past,” said Mayor Brad West, who will host the event.

“What we hope won’t change, however, is the community coming together to celebrate and show their PoCo Pride. By pivoting to an online event this year, Port Coquitlam is holding on to our traditions and our resolve to adapt to challenging times. I commend all our community partners who have stepped up to help pull this off and a special thank you to this year’s Royal Party who had been working hard prior to our plans changing.”

Residents are encouraged to plan an online viewing party with family, friends and neighbours and tune into www.portcoquitlam.ca/maydays for a live broadcast on May 9, from 3 to 5 p.m.

This year’s online festivities replace the iconic annual parade, Party in the Square and other events that draw thousands into downtown Port Coquitlam and were cancelled this year in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The lineup on May 9 will feature a variety of safely pre-recorded local music and performance acts that will be introduced by the mayor and May Days committee chair, Bob Lee, along with interesting May Days trivia, and other interactive activities and surprises.

The city is encouraging viewers to participate by:

• Shopping local and ordering take-out from Port Coquitlam restaurants and pubs while watching the performances (check website for participating businesses); and

• Hosting virtual viewing block parties by video conference to get to know their neighbours better and share some laughs, art, stories or even ideas about how to cope.

“I encourage everyone to gather with their families, watch the show virtually and support our local businesses,” added Mayor West. “Like our typical May Days, we want this year’s festival to promote a sense of community, where we all care about and look after each other.“

The festivities kick off on May 6 with community performances and activities being shared at www.portcoquitlam.ca/maydays or www.pocomayday.ca.

“This is a great way for the city to celebrate and support our local arts while keeping everyone safe,” said Coun. Nancy McCurrach, council’s designate for arts, culture and heritage. “It’s important that we continue to provide our community with ways to uplift their spirit, stay positive and support each other.”

Other activities being planned include:

Flash Fiction Contest

The City and Terry Fox Library are inviting residents to write a short adventure story (less than 750 words) that takes place in Port Coquitlam. Writer Kevin Spenst will be hosting a virtual writing workshop for teens on Friday, May 8 and for adults on Sunday, May 17. The contest will run May 4 to June 4. For details visit www.portcoquitlam.ca/maydays.

May Days: A Community Legacy

Although Port Coquitlam’s celebration dates back to 1923, May Days’ roots go back centuries. In ancient times, May was a time of outdoor celebration, and May Day was celebrated by the Romans with flower-decked parades in honour of Flora, their goddess of flowers. While the festival has evolved and grown over the years, it has maintained many of its original traditions, including – in other years – Maypole dancing and the crowning of local children as part of the May Days Royal Party.

May Days is organized in partnership with the May Days Committee and the Port Coquitlam Centennial Rotary Club and is funded by Canadian Heritage.

But a Port Moody academy that coaches young debaters is trying to help them find the positive amidst all the anxiety and despair. Along the way, they’re also helping Food Banks Canada.

article continues below

The Fostering Debate Talent Academy is hosting a virtual public speaking contest for orators across the country in grades four to 12. The younger kids, up to grade 7, will speak about the heroes of COVID-19, while the senior debaters will pontificate about the world after quarantine.

They’ll be competing for $10,000 in prize money and FDT’s founding director, Frankie Cena, said the company is donating $5 for every entry to help food banks, up to $10,000.

Cena, who started the academy in 2018 to help cultivate in others the passion he developed for competitive debating when he was attending elementary school in Burnaby, said the contest is a way to give back as his instructors have been able to continue serving clients after quickly pivoting to virtual coaching. He said it’s also a way “to try to find as much goodness in this weird time.”

While debate competitions are usually held in packed auditoriums, gymnasiums or classrooms that add an element of pressure to perform, the virtual competition will rely on video submissions to YouTube of three to five minutes in length from participants.

Each entry will then be reviewed by FDT’s instructors as well as its extensive roster of alumni who’ve been in the debate hot seat themselves. Each entrant receives a written critique of their delivery, content, organization and overall impression. Finalists in each category then compete against each other in a live debate on May 20 over the Zoom online meeting platform, with cash prizes up to $3,000 going to the top three.

Cena said making the debate topics relevant to the world’s current crisis gives young people an opportunity to express themselves in a meaningful way about a difficult situation.

“We want to be a beacon of hope,” he said. “We want to have everyone feel like this can be okay.”

Cena said public speaking helps kids learn critical thinking skills and develop confidence.

“They learn to find their voice,” he said, adding that voice should be unique, thought-provoking and maybe even make the judges laugh a bit.

For instance, Cena recalled, the first speech he gave in competition, on the topic of perfect jobs, was about being an elementary school janitor. He won, and the confidence he developed from that experience just kept snowballing into a career as an entertainer, host and even gameshow contestant.

“it’s just the most valuable life skill,” Cena said.

We want to hear your questions, stories and concerns. Here's how you can get in touch?

A Port Coquitlam teacher and three students have found a way to express their love of art, swimming and the resurgence of nature during the COVID-19 pandemic by painting a giant mural poolside at Aggie Park.

The project’s genesis began with the trio of grade 12 girls, who also compete with the Marlins swim team. They dreamed up the idea as part of a graduation project, approaching teacher and professional mural artist, Shannon Thiesen, to help make it a reality.

“After helping the girls grid and draw their design on the wall, we took to our separate sides (good timing given the social distancing protocols) and focused on painting our own half,” wrote Thiesen in an email.

The teens took the Marlin side, being emblematic of their years training in the pool, while Thiesen painted the salmon. Together, the mural represents the community and its natural beauty, and serves as a reminder of how the arts can connect communities and bring people through times of crisis.

Support from the city of Port Coquitlam came with the caveat that the project reflect the city’s natural environment. The salmon immediately jumped out at Thiesen, as it reflects the Coast Salish origins of the word Coquitlam: kʷikʷəƛ̓əm or “red fish up the river.”

As the COVID-19 crisis inflicts pain and financial hardship on people across the community, Thiesen points to nature's ""silver lining” and how it's “recovering and reclaiming its power.”

With the design and painting of the project carried out during the current pandemic, Thiesen said she spent a lot of time reflecting on the meaning of her work.

“My hope is the healing trend we are currently seeing in our natural world will continue. The reduction of greenhouse gases and noise pollution, orcas returning to previously traversed waters, improved air quality due to a reduction in industry and traffic,"" she said.

""Hopefully [this] bring the sockeye back to the Coquitlam River.”

But now firefighters want to hide it from view.

The gleaming red vehicle with a finicky double clutch is driven in parades, displayed at community events and used to collect donations for the annual Christmas toy drive. When it’s not out and about, it occupies pride of place in its own windowed parking bay at Inlet station where passersby can admire it.

Jeff Scallion, a lieutenant with the department, is hoping to collect enough drawings, pictures, cards and posters of thank you messages to front-line workers to plaster the expansive windows of the antique pumper’s parking spot to hide it from view.

The contest, which runs until April 30, is open to kids up to Grade 5, and prizes are going to be awarded in each age category.

But, more importantly, Scallion said it’s part of the department’s ongoing efforts to boost morale in the community as it struggles with the stresses and restrictions brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.

He said firefighters are acutely aware of the impact the public health and economic emergency is having on everyone. They’re reminded every time they respond to a call and have to thoroughly parse a mental checklist to ensure they’ve donned all the proper protective equipment to minimize their own risk of exposure to the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19.

Scallion said firefighters embrace the cohesive role they play in the community, not only being there in their time of need, but also bringing people together to help each other.

That’s why it’s often an all-hands effort for their annual blood donor clinic, pancake breakfast or even promoting the upcoming Hometown Heroes lottery that supports the BC Professional Firefighters’ Burn Fund.

But with most of those efforts now on hold, Scallion said firefighters are finding new ways to connect with the community they serve, like participating in the nightly cacophony of noise that rises from windows, doorways, balconies and stoops to remind front-line workers how much their contribution to the battle against COVID-19 is appreciated. They're even offering to do drive-by parades for kids' birthdays.

“We’re still bringing people together, but now we’re staying apart,” Scallion said.

His boss, fire chief Ron Coulson, said firefighters have the capability to the current pandemic crisis into a “teachable moment” that reminds people of the importance of looking out for each other and their community.

“We’re doing our small bit to support public safety,” he said.

• Entries to Port Moody Fire Rescue’s contest to hide its antique pumper with thanks for frontline workers can be dropped off in a box at the front door of Inlet station, 150 Newport Dr., by 3 p.m., April 30. Drawings can be up to 11 X 17.",[]

Heather Nyberg, of Coquitlam, said she noticed the stress and anxiety of working behind a plexiglass shield and having to be mindful of every interaction seemed to be taking a toll on a favourite Westwood Plateau IGA cashier, whose till she always made a point of visiting with her purchases.

She said she wanted to cheer him up — but she didn’t even know his name.

Nyberg reached out to the Tri-City Mom Group on Facebook to see if any of its approximately 9,000 members had any ideas.

It turns out many of them also loved the cashier and they knew his name: Kyle.

From there hatched an idea to collect all the kind words being posted about the ponytailed, baby-faced longtime IGA employee to help brighten his day in these tough times.

Nybergsaid the response was overwhelming.

“It just turned out people knew who he was,” she told The Tri-City News, adding she ultimately had to turn off her Facebook notifications as she couldn’t get any work done because her phone was buzzing so frequently.

Several of the tributes were captured on video.

“I especially try to choose your lane,” one mom said in a message to Kyle.

“Although you think you’re not making a difference, you’re appreciated and you’re loved in the community,” said another.

One shopper even composed a little song, “Kyle is a good guy, we like him so much.”

Written posts were equally filled with praise.

“You can’t help but smile leaving the store,” said one.

“He makes my day when I go in there,” said another.

Many of the messages were compiled and edited into a 10-minute video by another member of the moms’ group, Cindy Dalglish, that was to be presented to Kyle.

Nyberg said more than $350 had also been donated by appreciative customers, many of whom are struggling with economic challenges brought on by job loss or cutbacks.

“That’s so heartwarming, they’re still willing to give,” Nyberg said, adding the brief interactions at the grocery store and the attention and gratitude they’ve received have been a welcome distraction from the daily onslaught of bad news and anxiety since the pandemic escalated into a public health crisis.

We’re living history right now, in the midst of the massive societal and economic upheaval brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, said one of the museum’s coordinators, Markus Fahrner.

And he said he’s hoping Port Moody residents will record their thoughts and observations to be donated to the museum’s collection so future generations can get a sense of what it was like to live through the current health crisis and the changes in daily routines it has precipitated.

“Over the years, we have learned how important it is to have a wide variety of voices involved in history telling,” Fahrner told The Tri-City News, adding that the exercise can even prove therapeutic.

“By encouraging people to focus on the history at hand, it helps them to focus energy into creating these documents rather than simply mulling over the negative and scary aspects.”

Brianne Egeto, a manager and curator at the museum, said personal documentation of such a momentous event offers an “intimate glimpse” of its impact that can’t easily be captured in traditional recorders of history-on-the-fly like newspapers.

She said that documentation can comprise personal journals, letters or emails to family members, even photos of “the busy place that is now empty.” All materials donated to the museum will be catalogued for future exhibits and research, and in accordance with regulations in the Privacy Act of Canada.

Fahrner said as much as the pandemic has made people anxious and fearful, it has also fostered a newfound sense of collective spirit.

“It will give a sense of belonging and stitching together,” he said.

Between the rising daily infection toll and stories of economic doom, it can sometimes be hard to see a silver lining in the current health crisis.

But in one corner of Port Moody, a group of children have done just that, coming together — though no closer than two metres — to spread random uplifting messages to anyone lucky enough to pass by.

“It’s cool 2 B Distant,” read jet-black letters bursting against a green, turquoise, purple and violet rainbow.

“U R Strong,” reads another poster pinned to a fence.

The public messages calling on the community to come together — while staying apart — are the work of six neighbours aged seven to 13 years old: Lily Varga, Casey Hanson, Hannah Green, Sophie Cordos, and Gillian and Olivia Schneider.

“They just wanted to create some love, you know? Some positivity,” said Erin VanBolderen-Schneider, whose two daughters took part in the project.

The day before The Tri-City News photographed the posters, VanBolderen-Schneider said the garbage truck driver was honking the horn and waving at the kids along Forest Park Way in the Heritage Woods neighbourhood. Others passing by were impressed enough to pull over.

“This morning, I was having my coffee on my deck. People would get out of their cars to take pictures,” said Lily Varga’s mother, Alyssa Parsons. “It’s just nice to make people smile.”

The handful of families are among thousands across the Tri-Cities trying to figure out how to occupy themselves in a new, unfamiliar reality.

“It just kind of happened really quickly. Like it was just a small thing at first but now it's gotten really big,” said 10-year-old Gillian Schneider.

This is Gillian's last year at Aspenwood elementary school and the sting of not seeing the inside of her classroom is settling in.

“It’s kind of sad that I won’t be able to see my teacher again,” she said.

She and her sister Olivia have been filling their time catching up on TV shows, riding bikes and going on walks. But that can all get a little boring after a while, she said. So the girls have taken to doing math questions every other day just to keep busy.

“I didn't believe it at first,” said Olivia Schneider. “’Til September? If someone at the beginning of the year said, ‘Oh, we’re not going to school for four months,’ we’d be happy. But now that it’s actually happening, I’m going to miss school.”

By one estimate, there nearly a third of the world’s population, 2.5 billion people, are currently under some form of self-imposed quarantine or isolation. That’s a lot of missed milestones for a lot of children, among them, Gillian Schneider, whose grandparents won’t be making their annual trip out from Ontario for her birthday this April.

“It’s okay. We have FaceTime, I guess. But it’s kind of a bummer, too,” she said.

But for her older sister, making the signs brought some sense of focus to their daily wanderings.

“In the summer, we have a lot of just, like, playing outside, like painting rocks, but this time I felt like there's kind of like a purpose to it,” said Olivia Schneider.

Parents on the block said they’re concerned about what happens when spring break is over, how they’re going to continue their children’s education while still trying to work. For some of them working in public service or sales, that means rewriting the rules at home. Others, like the firefighter father who remains on-call or the mother who is trying to keep her small business afloat, taking care of the kids is a complicated proposition.

In the meantime, Parsons said she and the neighbours will continue to look for any opportunity to educate.

“We’re just talking to the kids a lot about social responsibility and what we can do to protect one another, that the decisions that are being made are for the greater good,” she said, pointing to the posters across the street.

“We thought that’s a way they can take some of the anxiety and the uncertainty that they're feeling and put it into [something] positive to help the community as well.”

And the community is paying attention.

Only a couple blocks away, someone else had picked up that mantle and etched a string of messages across an entire neighbourhood’s sidewalk in chalk.

“BE GOOD TO EACH OTHER,” reads one accompanied by a rainbow.

“THANK YOU FRONTLINE WORKERS,” reads another.

“Together we can do anything.”

While hundreds of people could be employed in positions relating to the games and hubs — such as security jobs, rink staff, food services and hotel housekeeping — the financial benefit of two bubble communities under tight seal would be ""modest"" at best, suggested Bank of Montreal chief economist Douglas Porter.

article continues below

""When you think of how many tourists would normally be in Toronto during peak tourist season, I'm quite sure this is less than one per cent,"" he said.

""The reality is, it's not going to move the needle.""

But Porter, a lifelong hockey fan, said he anticipates a ""reasonably meaningful positive"" morale boost to Canadian sports fans who've been eagerly anticipating players returning to the ice in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The games are slated to start Aug. 1 with six Canadian teams qualifying for the 24-team resumption of play. No fans will be in the seats.

Edmonton and Toronto were confirmed as the NHL's hub cities on Friday night.

""The fact that part of our world is getting back to some kind of normal will help reinforce the sense that things, generally, are moving in that direction and could help support the recovery,"" Porter said.

The gradual comeback of major sporting events has drawn plenty of interest in recent weeks, with debates raging over the risks of putting players back into the games, even if spectators aren't allowed in the facilities.

Further questions have been raised over whether rigorous testing is enough to prevent outbreaks within the isolated community, which could potentially throw the whole plan into a costly disarray.

Many of these factors make placing a value on hockey's return especially difficult.

Michael Naraine, a professor at Brock University in St. Catharines, Ont., said the largest amount of money is on the line at large corporations, which he said is driving the return of major sporting events.

""The primary revenue driver for sports is broadcasting,"" said the assistant professor of digital sport management and marketing.

""They need television advertisers come back. The league itself needs to gain its revenue from NBC and Sportsnet here in Canada.""

Politicians have preferred to emphasize the positive aspects of a deal with the NHL.

Alberta Premier Jason Kenney eagerly promoted Edmonton as the ultimate hub city for the hockey league, posting videos on Twitter that prominently featured the Rocky Mountains and other popular destinations in the province.

Naraine said those public expressions by leaders are more an attempt to ""pander"" to their constituents than actually drive any meaningful economic impact. He said this is especially the case in Edmonton.

""Having major events come to town allows them to beat their chests and say, 'We exist. We're on the map. Come look at us,'"" he said.

""But the fact that the hub city will be in Edmonton is no different than whether the hub city would be in Toronto or Vancouver or elsewhere. It's not going to significantly drive tourism all of a sudden.""

Patrick Rishe, a sports professor at Washington University in St. Louis, said he sees value in showcasing a lesser known Canadian city on broadcast television with ""beauty shots"" of the locale. He said it may also sit well with NHL executives.

""You never know,"" he said. ""Doing and serving a good deed for the league now, this could pay dividends down the road.""

Any semblance of a regular hockey season would be welcomed by Dana Parris, owner of the Lockeroom sports bar in Barrie, Ont.

Even though her business is over 100 kilometres away from downtown Toronto, she anticipates the excitement would reverberate to her customers.

""If we could have sports come back and we hit Stage 3 (of Ontario's COVID reopening plan) around the same time, I will probably stop crying myself to sleep,"" she said.

""If those two come together it's just going to be the most beautiful thing.""

The survey of 1,401 member businesses from groups including the BC Chamber of Commerce, Greater Vancouver Board of Trade and Business Council of B.C. indicates owners want a bold, long-term recovery plan.

Only 16 per cent of businesses were confident in B.C.'s restart plan and 47 per cent were not.

Two-thirds of those surveyed were relying on some form of government support and owners were braced for a ""second wave"" of shutdowns or other problems if programs expire too quickly.

Some 28 per cent believed they'll return to normal once programs end, 32 per cent expected to cut workers' hours, 27 per cent anticipated layoffs, and one business in every 10 forecast either temporary or permanent closure.

Owners say payroll and wage supports must remain key components of B.C.'s recovery plan, along with fee and tax cuts.

The survey also identified expectations that the province must create better investment conditions.

Bridgitte Anderson, president and CEO of the Greater Vancouver Board of Trade, says business viability hinges on those measures.

Val Litwin with the BC Chamber of Commerce urges policy-makers to ""stay sensitive"" to the vulnerability of the business sector.

""A bold economic recovery plan that helps small businesses compete is non-negotiable for a prosperous B.C., and when small businesses thrive so do communities and people,"" Litwin said in a statement.

""Governments must keep focused on delivering their recovery plans swiftly.""

Canada's Communications Security Establishment says the malicious cyberactivities were very likely undertaken to pilfer information and intellectual property relating to the development and testing of vaccines for the novel coronavirus.

The cyberspy agency says the clandestine activity is hindering response efforts at a time when health-care experts and medical researchers need every available resource to help fight the pandemic.

The CSE's Centre for Cyber Security assesses that APT29, also known as ""the Dukes"" or ""Cozy Bear,"" was responsible, and almost certainly operates as part of Russian intelligence services.

""The group uses a variety of tools and techniques to predominantly target governmental, diplomatic, think-tank, health-care and energy targets for intelligence gain,"" says a joint advisory from the CSE and its allies.

""APT29 is likely to continue to target organizations involved in COVID-19 vaccine research and development, as they seek to answer additional intelligence questions relating to the pandemic.""

This assessment is supported by partners at Britain's Government Communications Headquarters' National Cyber Security Centre, the U.S. National Security Agency, and the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.

The CSE is urging Canadian health organizations to review a technical advisory on the threat and to take any necessary actions to protect themselves. ""We encourage them as well to contact the Cyber Centre if they suspect they have been targeted by cyberactors.""

The joint advisory says APT29 targeted COVID-19 vaccine research and development by scanning specific computer IP addresses of interest for vulnerabilities, a tactic that can help the group obtain login credentials to systems.

""This broad targeting potentially gives the group access to a large number of systems globally, many of which are unlikely to be of immediate intelligence value,"" the advisory says.

""The group may maintain a store of stolen credentials in order to access these systems in the event that they become more relevant to their requirements in the future.""

“We accept good credit, bad credit or even no credit,” says Shameer Dada, President of C.A.I. Financial in Port Moody. “We are here to help you regardless. It all boils down to collateral.”

C.A.I. Financial is the largest private lending company in Canada catering to people without using credit or employment checks, and loaning from $1,000 to $25,000 in a simple, hassle-free manner.

“Just about anyone with proper collateral is approved for a loan,” Dada says. “It’s a very straightforward process.”

Collateral could be any major vehicle –a car, truck, motorcycle, boat, RV, tractor or ATV. Once accepted, the collateral is bound to the loan.

However, unlike some loans, the company does not take over the title of the vehicle used. And you can continue to use the vehicle for a fee.

Once the loan is repaid, all contracts are void.

Worried about the application process? No need. Applying is easy. Applications can be started online or over the phone, followed by a visit to the Port Moody office to fill out some simple paper work.

When applicable, approval is instant and in most cases the funds are available in as little as 15 minutes.

“I’ve seen very positive results in patient recovery since introducing laser light therapy to our clinic,” says Bennett. “It has proven to be an extremely safe and highly effective treatment for pain relief and repair of damaged tissue, sports injuries, or degenerative conditions like arthritis.”

Laser light therapy, or low-intensity laser therapy as it is sometimes called, involves the application of light energy tuned to specific wavelengths on a particular area of the body. The laser stimulates the body’s natural repair process.

“People assume that cold laser is dangerous, or is a new, unproven therapy,” says Dr. Bennett. “But cold laser was developed over 50 years ago, and in millions of patient treatments, there has never been a single adverse event or side effect.”

Cells respond to laser treatment by releasing beta-endorphins (natural painkillers), beta cortisol (natural anti-inflammatory hormones), and growth hormone. These are released at levels that stimulate the repair of damaged tissues, the reduction of inflammation, and ultimately, pain reduction.

“After using laser light therapy, our patients are usually able to reduce the use of pharmaceutical pain medication, have improved function of damaged tissues and joints, and return to a more active lifestyle,” says Dr. Bennett.

As the light is applied at a low level, it does not destroy or cut the tissue. Rather, it stimulates and encourages cells to function, promoting positive functions such as collagen formation, cellular metabolism, angiogenesis, lymphatic flow (reducing swelling), and energy production.

The treatment, says Dr. Bennet, is both a cost-effective alternative to pharmaceuticals and comes with no side effects.

Tri-City Laser Light Therapy Inc., is now the largest laser clinic in the Tri-Cities area. Located in Coquitlam, the clinic boasts a team of five certified laser therapists including a registered physiotherapist and Dr. Bennett, Doctor of Chiropractic.

But just because it’s possible doesn’t mean it’s the best idea, according to REALTOR® Daniel Card.

“You’re always better off to go with a REALTOR®,” says Card, a Realtor with Royal LePage West R.E.S. in Port Coquitlam. “Not only do REALTORS® protect the client’s interests at all times, they invariably make the client more money.”

article continues below

There are 6 reasons listing with a REALTOR® is a safer, faster and less expensive process, Card says:

1. Serious buyers expect to pay less. Buyers looking for homes for sale by owner expect the commission cost to be cut from the price, and will adjust their offer accordingly.

2. Realtors have insurance.Selling a home is a complicated financial transaction. Realtors have insurance to cover all contingencies in case anything goes wrong in the process. Omissions or errors in a contract can be costly mistakes without insurance.

3. Realtors have a network to rely on. Every Realtor has an extensive list of contacts. The MLS listing site is available to all Realtors – about 13,000 in the Greater Vancouver area. Those Realtors also email listings to clients looking for a specific type of property.

4. Realtors have specific skills and resources. There are many things Realtors do in the selling process, from listing the property on MLS, to marketing and staging the home, to creating feature sheets for the property.

5. Realtors know what makes a serious buyer. It can be hard for a homeowner to tell lookers from buyers. Realtors are trained to do so, and most prequalify their buyers before taking them to look at a property.

6. Realtors are trained negotiation experts.They’re trained in techniques that will get sellers the most money. The average property For Sale By Owner will sell for significantly less than it would through a Realtor.

“We have always stayed true to our roots at Dinakis,” he says proudly. “Preparing amazingly fresh, homemade and authentic dishes is what we do.”

article continues below

But that’s not all.

“What makes us different from an ordinary western Mediterranean restaurant is the way in which we incorporate love- that’s right, love—in every single dish we serve, from our famous Greek salad to our Tiramisu.”

Still need a reason to visit Dinakis Mediterranean Grill? How about three:

1. Food and flavours: The authentic Greek cuisine is what ultimately brings people to the restaurant, says Noori. “All of our food is made from scratch,” he adds, “and each dish is presented in a way that is unique. We offer a wide range of items that are tough to find elsewhere in the Lower Mainland—garlic infused hummus, spinach and ricotta cheese stuffed ravioli, lamb soulaki—and we are also always looking to improve.”

Dinakis recently tweaked their popular Dinakis burger, for example, and the new fusion of flavours is something Noori is sure his customers will love.

2. Happy employees, happy customers: “Our customer service starts by creating a first-class work environment,” says Noori. “When your staff are happy, it catches on with the customers, too.” Case in point: Dinakis Mediterranean Grill was voted the best Greek restaurant for six years in a row—from 2011 to 2016—for the Tri-Cities area.

“Based on the reviews posted on sites like TripAdvisor and Google,” says Noori, “we continue to deliver great value, exceptional customer service, and delicious authentic food. And that’s what counts.”

3. Customer engagement: At Dinakis Mediterranean Grill customer feedback is not only encouraged but acted upon, giving the restaurant a community-centric quality.

“Our vision was always to serve our community well by creating a place where families can enjoy quality time together,” says Noori. “Along the way we have added some items to our menu just because our customers have asked for them.”

""Our Chair Massage course is for anyone who is interested in providing massage services,"" says Kathy Bell, Director of Education at Integra College. ""Graduates can work from home or take their portable massage chair out into the community, to seniors' residences, workplaces, farmers' markets, or even public events like festivals.""

article continues below

Among the people who have found the chair massage training beneficial are stay-at-home moms.

""Very often, stay-at-home moms have free time between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m.,"" Kathy explains, ""and they want to do something meaningful and still be home later for their kids and families. Becoming a chair massage provider is the perfect way to operate a small business on your schedule, where you want, and with the clients you choose.""

With a maximum class size of 12, students work through a 20-hour online component and then benefit from six days intensive training in the classroom.

""The classroom time is spent learning three massage routines and is a very important component of the course,"" says Kathy. ""Students are then required to develop their skills by providing massage services to 20 people. The last massage is videotaped and uploaded for evaluation, rather like a final exam.""

The chair massage course is certified and was developed by Integra College founder and president, Bob Hanley.

""Chair massage is a completely portable service,"" explains Kathy, ""and it's an excellent way to encourage health and wellness in your clients. Seniors especially respond positively to massage; that type of touch can be extremely beneficial to their emotional well-being.""

As part of the Chair Massage course, students also receive access to the Business Start-up Kit to help them with the tasks needed to run your own business: how to market yourself, advertising, and getting new clients.

""What Bob has found over the years,"" Kathy says, ""is that people who are very caring and empathetic, such as teachers, nurses, or caregivers, lack confidence in running their own business. The Business Start-up Kit offers support and guidance on setting up and running a home-based business.""

Offered online, the Business Start-up Kit uses the same education platform as SFU online courses and provides a wealth of marketing and business development resources.

“The kit has everything we’ve learned over the last 13 years about building a successful chair massage practice,” says Kathy. “As a result, we save our graduates the normal trial-and-error that goes along with building a new business.”

So he knows that you need a wide variety of spices, flavours and meats to satisfy local taste buds.

“A common misconception is that all Indian foods are spicy,” says Bhatt. “But here at Aroma Indian Restaurant and Lounge, we put that notion to rest pretty quickly. We have something for every taste, no matter how mild. In fact, there are lots of Indian dishes for people who don’t typically eat spicy food.”

article continues below

Here are five delicious suggestions Bhatt says everyone can and should try:

1. Butter Chicken: This ‘classic’ Indian dish is one of the safer bets if you are new to Indian restaurants says Bhatt. The sauce is nice and creamy with tomatoes and cardamom making it very flavourful,” he says. “It’s mild too so it’s very kid-friendly – it gets along with a lot of people!”

2. Reshami Kabab: This Indian food is a great choice for the more health-conscious customer. “It’s a light meal that’s ideal for people who are very active,” Bhatt says. “The chicken is a nice source of protein, as well, and we marinate it in a creamy yogurt and garlic sauce then cook it in a tandoori clay oven, it is served with a salad. For many other meals, you’ll likely want to add rice or bread. But Reshami Kabab can stand alone.”

3. Aloo Gobhi: Bhatt says the simplicity of this dish- based on potatoes and cauliflower- is what attracts people most. “It can be served vegan-friendly and it’s not very saucey, nor spicy so the flavours aren’t overwhelming,” Bhatt points out. “And a dish of rice or tandoori bread as a nice complement.”

4. Vegetable Manchurian: One of Aroma Indian Restaurant and Lounge’s highest-selling appetizers on the menu, even for people who don’t typically reach for the vegetables. “For people who are not veggie-lovers this is a great dish,” says Bhatt. “The vegetables are finely chopped up and formed into balls, then deep fried and then sautéed with onion, ginger, garlic bell peppers and some Indian spices.”

5. Fish Goa Curry: A unique combination of Alaskan cod cooked in an onion, coriander coconut curry, this exotic dish native to the western Indian state of Goa—home of some of India’s finest beaches—comes a delicious sauce.

1. No job is too big or too small

Typically, tree and shrub specialists focus either on large jobs, such as deforesting a whole area prior to development, or small ones, like hedge trimming. A1 Tri-Craft will do the lot. “We’ll do anything from grooming a hedge to dropping a huge tree, and we’ll give as much care and attention to both,” says Pynn. “We’re fully insured, and we also give discounts for very small and very large jobs.”

2. It operates all year round

Most arborist companies are fairweather friends – they’ll shut down during the winter months. That means if you’re a business that needs work throughout the year, or a tree comes down on your property after a winter storm, you might struggle to find experts to help out. A1 Tri-Craft is open all year round. “It’s especially good for stratas or commercial organizations because they want people who are familiar with their property and ways of doing things,” says Zepedeo.

3. It can turn things round, fast

Generally speaking, quotes can be delivered within two days, and a project of any scale, including new development clearing, can be started within the week. “We typically have two or three crews available at any time, and access to all equipment including heavy machinery like excavators, so we’re ready for anything,” says Zepedeo.

4. It has more than 20 years of history in the community

The company was set up around 30 years ago, then taken over by Andrew Baba 20 years ago. He died suddenly last year, aged just 42, and his good friends Pynn and Zepedeo decided to take over the business in order to help out his family, customers and staff. “Some of our customers and staff members have been with the business for many years. We pride ourselves on continuing Andrew’s legacy of strong, lasting, friendly relationships built on trust and honesty,” says Pynn.

“First and foremost, we’re a service-based company,” says Niki Jacques, President of Nufloors Coquitlam. “Our customers know that we’re here to help them make the right long-term flooring decision for their home.”

“The flooring industry isn’t a high margin industry,” she points out. “So in a tough economy, you end up with a lot of cheap options at the bottom end of the market. That’s the last thing you want with flooring, where cheap off-shore products can end up costing homeowners thousands of dollars down the road.”

Nufloors Coquitlam, which has held an A+ rating with the BBB for over 27 years, takes a different approach.

“We carry the best quality for the best price,” says Jacques. “And we offer comprehensive support and service to our customers. We’ve been here for three decades, so it’s clearly an approach that works.”

Nufloors Coquitlam is a family-owned business where half the staff have at least 25-years of experience. Voted the favourite flooring store by Tri-City News in 2015, Nufloors Coquitlam is deeply connected to the Coquitlam community, sponsoring minor league hockey and local rotary clubs.

“Flooring is a major part of any renovation project,” says Jacques. “I can’t tell you how many times I’ve spoken to people who had to replace their new floors in 3-4 years because they bought an inferior product with little to no warranty.”

At Opus Art Supplies, there's a third option: DIY custom framing with a little help along the way.

With seven locations across B.C., including one in historic Maillardville, Opus Art Supplies has been helping both artists and art enthusiasts frame their pictures and photos for more than forty years.

article continues below

Crissy Arseneau, Manager of Marketing &Mail Order at Opus, outlines three reasons why this might be a great choice for framing your artwork or photos:

1. Cost savings

""Custom DIY framing can give the customer a reduced price over professional framing as there are no labour charges,"" says Crissy. ""We help you select the materials from our wide selection of frames, mats, glazing, and backings. When you're ready to frame, you're welcome to use our tables and tools, or take your materials back to your studio or home and complete the job at your leisure. Either way, we're here to answer any questions about the process or techniques.""

2. Sense of pride and accomplishment

People enjoy DIY projects for the sense of achievement and accomplishment at the end of the work. Framing is no different.

""At Opus, we'll guide you in the process if you've not done it before,"" Crissy explains, ""but we don't do it for you. You choose the materials, measure the artwork, and assemble the framed work. When you hang the art on your wall, or display a photo on the mantel, there's a sense of satisfaction that you had a big part in the creative process.""

3. Custom-made piece

Opus Art Supplies also has ready-made frames available for sale, some of which have been designed and made by Opus staff. But there's nothing quite like having your artwork or photo enhanced by a frame made specifically for the work.

""Custom framing allows you to design a family of frames to complement the décor of your home, business, or store,"" says Crissy. ""There are also different types of framing that give different levels of archival quality. This can be important if the sentimental or monetary value of your work is high.""

But one of the challenges I’ve come across with non-toxic products is that what I gain in natural ingredients, I often lose in effectiveness. (It took much trial and error to finally find a natural deodorant that works, and now I’m hooked on Sola). I’m a huge fan of SPF for its melanoma- and wrinkle-preventing properties (I wear at least SPF 15 on my face year-round), but up until now I haven’t come across a non-toxic sunscreen line that is free of harsh chemicals.

When it comes to evaluating whether a product is safe to put on my skin and hair, I use the Environmental Working Group’s Skin Deep database. I simply type in the name of the product and the database provides a rating from 1 to 10 (1 being the least toxic and 10 being the most).

article continues below

Dr. Mark Lupin of Cosmedica in Victoria says when shopping for a non-toxic sunscreen or sunblock you should look for a formula that uses mineral active ingredients such as zinc oxide and/or titanium dioxide, instead of the chemical filters oxybenzone, avobenzone, octisalate, octocrylene, homosalate and octinoxate included in most sunscreens on the market. Also, look for the words ""Broad Spectrum” on the sunscreen label as this indicates that, in addition to UVB protection represented by the SPF rating, the product also protects from UVA rays which can contribute to skin cancer and premature aging.

Here are four non-toxic suncare brands I recommend trying this summer:

1) Beautycounter, the skincare and makeup line known for its commitment to using non-toxic ingredients, has just launched a line of non-toxic suncare products for body and face formulated with non-nano zinc oxide and antioxidant-rich California Poppy. Most of the products boast EWG ratings of 1 and are available in mist, lotion and stick formulas, perfect for the whole family to use.

2) Vancouver-based natural product brand A Healthy Beginning makes a zinc oxide-based SPF 25 Whipped Mineral Sun Butter which contains raspberry seed oil to boost sun protection and hydrate the skin. All ingredients have a low EWG rating, the product packaging uses minimal plastic, and the butter can be used on the face and body (and is perfect for kids, too).

3) Josie Maran loves her argan oil and she makes a beautifully scented, chemical-free facial oil that protects with an SPF of 47, and is available at Sephora.

4) Also available at Sephora with EWG ratings between 1 and 3 is Coola's range of non-toxic SPF products which includes a White Tea Face Sport SPF 50 and an SPF 30 Sunscreen Spray Pina Colada.

Whichever sunscreen you choose, be sure to apply 30 minutes before sun exposure, reapplying every two hours, and after swimming.

But with the assistance of an experienced and compassionate team from First Memorial Funeral Services in Port Coquitlam, the process can be eased.

article continues below

To begin, First Memorial is able to accommodate any wish for the type of ceremony or event their clients wish to hold.

“That can be from cremation only, to a fully-fledged church service,” says Brett Ray, manager with First Memorial Funeral Services.

Any religious denomination is welcomed, and staff work closely with those officials to ensure all needs and requirements are met.

The character of a service can also be customized to meet a client or family’s wishes.

“One of the things we are excited about within our company is something we call ‘A Life Well Celebrated,’” Ray says. “That’s basically full personalization of any service customers want.”

A playful example recently was a service for a keen golfer whose guests at their service were each handed a golf ball as they entered with the person’s name and personal message printed on them.

“It appears, people are open toward a celebration of life because it opens up the doors for more personalization and that’s what we are able to assist in - to bring the personality of the individual to the guests,” Ray explains.

“And what better way to do that than fill up the room with things that remind them of their loved one.”

Clients can also help reduce the anxiety around organizing a funeral service by planning ahead.

“When you lose a loved one, it’s understandably a fragile time,” Ray says.

By pre-planning a service or celebration, the majority of the decisions are made in advance by the family with one of their family service counsellors, leaving only small details, such as dates and times, etc., to be decided upon at the time of need with a funeral director.

“It allows us to do what we really take pride in, which is to let the family have peace of mind knowing that the wishes of their loved ones are in place, and to spend time with them. When we are needed, we will be there to take care of everything that needs to be done.”

Pre-planning can also help reduce possible financial burden.

“Planning ahead locks clients into today’s price, something they can pay for monthly over a period of five, to say 15 years,” Ray says.

Dinakis Mediterranean Grill has added a take-out menu for families and customers on the go, and also offers free delivery to all of Port Coquitlam and some areas of Coquitlam, as well as a catering service.

“We hope to one day build a program that would provide a day of complimentary food for servicemen and women, such as our police officers and firefighters in the Tri-cities area,” says Noori. “We are just really passionate about authentic Greek food, great service, and connecting to the community around us.”

Soon after he settled into this new chapter of life with his young family, he started searching for occupational health and safety jobs. With his 25 years of industry experience in Iran, he was confident that he would land a job quickly. “Unfortunately this was not the case,” said Lara Marchionni, Career Coach at Douglas College.

Mohammad’s calls to potential employers went unreturned and recruiters consistently informed him he lacked Canadian experience. Looking for a transitional job, so he could support his family, Mohammad was offered a position as a security guard. This story is a common one among skilled and educated immigrants coming to Canada. Statistics Canada reports that in 2006, “43 per cent of internationally-educated immigrants [in Canada] were working in occupations for which they were over-qualified, while another 16 per cent were simply not working.”

Since then, the provincial government has made strides to improve this figure by funding programs that tap into the skilled labour pool of newcomers to Canada.

In the spring of 2017, Mohammad attended an information session about the Career Paths for Skilled Immigrants Program at Douglas College. The program aids skilled immigrants coming into Canada, with pre-landing experience and education in their fields, who want to find work in that same field.

Mohammad enrolled in the program straight away. With the support of his career coach, Marchionni, he engaged in a systematic and strategic job search. He attended different training sessions focusing on job search strategies and learned how to use professional networking platforms to connect with organizations and promote himself. He also enrolled in the Occupational Health and Safety Legislation course at the British Columbia Institute of Technology, for which the Career Paths Program provided funding.

After Career Paths referred Mohammad to the Immigrant Employment Council of B.C. for a two-month mentorship program, he learned how to navigate the job market in the Greater Vancouver area and was provided with much professional and emotional support from his mentor. Mohammad was soon offered a job as a Safety Analyst, an occupation that perfectly aligns with his previous experience, skillsets and qualifications. Mohammad’s is just one story of a tide of changing immigrants’ narratives, thanks to Douglas College’s Career Paths Program.

Nicole Renwick, Executive Director of the Memorial Society of British Columbia, uses the analogy of the pilgrims crossing America to describe a green burial.

article continues below

""Imagine the pilgrims making their way across America,"" she says. ""When someone died, they simply wrapped the person in a blanket and buried them. There was no embalming fluid, no burial liner, zero affect on the environment. The body was left to decompose in the ground.""

With today's interest in the environment, the green burial is enjoying a resurgence in popularity. Nicole outlines four things you should know about a green burial:

1. It's completely natural

A green burial is a process that allows for the natural decomposition of human remains without the inclusion of chemicals.

""As a minimum,"" Nicole explains, ""for a burial to be considered green, the Memorial Society of B.C. requirements include a biodegradable coffin, no embalming, and no grave liner.""

Preferably, there should be plants or shrubs planted on the grave. The highest form of a green burial would include interment in a natural setting.

2. Green burials are gaining in popularity

""It's a very popular option,"" says Nicole. ""With today's interest in conserving the environment, people are thinking more and more about avoiding the use of chemicals and chemical liners in their burial.""

3. There are various levels of ""greenness""

""At the Memorial Society of B.C.,"" explains Nicole, ""we recognize that people have different interpretations of what constitutes a ""green"" burial. We're actively working throughout British Columbia to ensure that all levels of green burials are available around the province.""

4. Recyclable plots

A major benefit of a green burial in this time of land scarcity on the Lower Mainland is the fact that the plot is reusable.

""With a green burial,"" Nicole explains, ""you don't purchase the plot. You lease a small piece of land. In 25 years, that plot can be reused for another burial because your remains have decomposed into the earth as part of the natural life cycle of the planet.""

The Memorial Society of British Columbia is a non-profit, member-based, volunteer-driven organization that has been helping British Columbians with end of life planning decisions for more than 60 years. For a nominal one-time membership fee, the Society will record your wishes for the disposal of your remains as well as assist your loved ones secure a discount on funeral services with an approved funeral homes throughout the province.

“We’re a service provider but we’re also part of a civil rights movement,” says Lusignan, a dedicated volunteer in the not-for-profit sector for over 20 years. “Not that long ago, people with disabilities were put away in institutions. In 1980, they began eliminating institutions in B.C.—so that was an important step in the process.

“The next step is all about making our communities more accessible and inclusive,” he says. “That means including people with disabilities in society so they don’t feel isolated or lonely.”

Based in Port Moody, Community Ventures Society has helped children and adults with disabilities find meaningful life activities within the Lower Mainland for over 40 years.

Community Ventures Society provides a wide range of support services for people with disabilities and their families including foster families, summer camps, respite, life skills, community inclusion and shared living services.

They also offer unique literacy and life-long learning programs that encourage as much independence as possible.

“We’ve worked with other agencies in a collaborative way on many projects and continue to have a big focus on employment,” says Lusignan. “Ten years ago employment for people with disabilities was off the radar. Now it’s a concentrated effort and improving every year.”

Community Ventures Society’s long history of partnerships with fellow advocacy-based agencies continues during B.C.’s official Community Inclusion Month this October.

“It’s a great time to raise awareness for the movement toward inclusive communities—where everyone belongs and has an opportunity to contribute,” says Lusignan. “It’s another step in the right direction.”

Check out Grand River Seafood Restaurant in Coquitlam for what owner Howie Zhang promises to be an authentic Chinese seafood experience.

“Our recipes are served as they are in China,” says Howie, “and most Chinese like that.”

article continues below

According to Howie, westernized Chinese dishes are those that have been adjusted to suit westernized taste buds. For example, they’re less spicy, less starchy and more sweet, using ingredients that are more familiar to many Canadians.

Instead of Westernizing their dishes, Grand River Seafood Restaurant focuses on the authenticity of the dining experience, offering a non-buffet style, traditional Chinese cuisine.

Although the Grand River Seafood menu contains some favourites for Western culture, such as spring rolls, fried rice, and wanton soup, the preparation of each dish is different than what you’ll find in a more Westernized restaurant.

Chinese cuisine varies greatly by region with Sichuan food leaning heavily on the spice, Cantonese opting for sweet, and Shandong going for the salty and crispy.

In general, authentic Chinese seafood — Grand River’s specialty — is lighter in flavour where ingredients such as chili, ginger and salt are added to give it sufficient taste. The food is usually cooked by steaming with these ingredients bringing out the natural sweetness of the seafood.

Other seasonings such as soy sauce, spring onion, and rice wine are also used in more traditional dishes. Ultimately, the fresher the seafood, the lighter the seasonings, as chefs want patrons to experience the seafood’s natural flavours.

Zhang encourages patrons of Grand River Seafood to experience a traditional meal, regardless of their background.

“We have great ambiance here and excellent service,” Howie says. “But most of all, we have exceptionally fresh, authentic food.”

Grand River Seafood Restaurant also has a 10 per cent discount for Dim Sum on weekdays (not available on weekends or holidays).

There are so many styles and cuts to choose from: mid-rise, low-rise, skinny jeans, slim, straight, bootcut, flares andtrousers.

article continues below

Then you’ve got thewashes: dark wash, medium wash, light wash, black, khaki or distressed jeans.

And of course, every brand fits differently.

We asked Nancy Gattey of Port Coquitlam’s Creekside Fashions for the skinny on jean trends and how to choose the right pair.

“Trending right now is the distressed jean but that doesn’t work for everybody,” she says. “Skinny jeans are still really strong and I don’t think they are going away because women really love them and they’ve become almost a classic. Trousers are coming back now too. As are flares – but the flares will come and go.”

Gattey says one of the most popular women’s jeans lines in her store is French Dressing Jeans’ new collection called Love Denim.

“It’s a best-seller,” she says. “Four-way stretch with 35 per cent lycra makes them fit well and they’re extremely comfortable to wear. They just seem to work on everybody.”

Gattey says the key when deciding on jeans is that they are comfortable and the right fit. “When your jeans fit right, you look and feel fantastic.”

So how many jeans should you have in your closet?

“Today it’s such a denim society I think one pair is definitely not enough,” Gattey advises. “But if someone was only wanting one I would suggest that they choose a darker wash because it’s a little dressier and more versatile. It could be something that is good for business casual and could be a better choice than a lighter wash which is definitely more casual.”

What about Gattey, herself?

“Me? I have lots because I wear them all the time,” she says. “I think probably three would be great but I have many!”

When he started serving lattes and mochas at Eclipps Hair Café in 1994, coffee shops like Tim Horton’s and Starbucks had barely gotten off the ground.

“Lattes were a fairly new concept on the West Coast back then,” he says. “I’ve always had a love of drinking coffee, so we styled the café portion of the hair salon after a coffee shop. It has become a big part of what we’re known for – serving great coffee with fantastic looks.”

Barely into his mid-twenties, Blair had a dream of owning his own business.

“I had been in the hairstyling trade and I saw this opportunity to open up my own business. I had a vision to open up a casual, friendly hair salon.”

Blair found a location and started with just him and five empty salon chairs.

“I had lots of room to grow,” he laughs. “I renovated the space myself, bought some equipment, and worked six days a week for the first two years.”

Thanks to a good business acumen and a love of customer service, Eclipps Hair Café grew in size and reputation.

“I was determined that people should be able to get an amazing look while having a great experience in the process.”

After four years, Blair moved his then team of six stylists from Eclipps’ original 1,000-square-foot location to its present day location.

Now, having worked at Basic Eyewear Optical for two decades, Manocha continues to bridge that gap in the eyewear service industry, something that he saw lacking in the community of Coquitlam. He uses the philosophy of putting the customers’ needs first to guide his practice. “That’s just something you’ll get when you come to a smaller store like our own,” Manocha said.

Though, Manocha and his team at Basic Eyewear Optical provide the community much more than just a wide selection of eyeglasses, sunglasses, contact lenses, and accessories – the company is deeply rooted in its charitable involvement within the community.

“Over the years, just being involved with the community and building the business itself has allowed me to get into the actual community of Coquitlam, and we’ve been building the business that way ever since,” Manocha said.

Whether it’s donating prizes and products to dry grads in the area, or it’s heading the Business Improvement Association that helps to increase business and beautify the neighbourhood, Basic Eyewear Optical tries to give back to the community anyway it can. “For the most part, anybody who really needs to fundraise typically just comes on in and I help them out with that,” he said.

Manocha says that it is a two-way street; the more he seems to give back to the community, the more support he receives as a small business. “You know, people really want to help small businesses and we’re just happy to be able to help them out in return.”

His successful real estate practice, Team Wayne Dick RE/MAX All Points Realty, which he has run with his daughter since 2007, is based on long-term relationships with his clients, whom he calls friends.

So it’s no surprise that Wayne dedicates quite a bit of his time and energy to giving back to the community. Each year the Coquitlam Firefighters Charitable Society hosts a masquerade ball at the Hard Rock Casino, and Team Wayne Dick is a sponsor for the event. All the money raised here goes to feed low-income children in Coquitlam schools including Rochester Elementary and Cape Horn Elementary. “We served over 4,000 meals last year,” Wayne explains.

In 2017, Team Wayne Dick also donated a portion of every real estate transaction to support the Children’s Miracle Network.

Wayne started out studying to be a teacher in 1979 - studying locally at Langara College and University of British Columbia, as well as internationally at University of Grenoble (France) and the University of Chicoutimi (Quebec), “but there were no teaching jobs in 1979 so I ended up driving a truck,” he explains. In 1983, he signed on as an auxiliary firefighter with the Coquitlam Fire Department, also getting his realtors’ license. After selling 25 homes within the first five months, he decided not to go into firefighting full-time, and instead to divide his time between working as an auxiliary firefighter and a realtor, fighting about one fire a week. Today he trains auxiliary firefighters: “I’ve trained over 400 auxiliaries to become full-time firemen,” Wayne says.

Dick has also built up a very successful real estate business over the years. “When I first started I used to knock on a 100 doors a week,” Wayne says. Today most of his clients are past clients or referrals from them.

With Wayne’s commitment to charitable causes, success for Team Wayne Dick Realty means success for the community as a whole.

COVID recovery plan, seek bold response: survey",[],,"VANCOUVER — The latest survey of businesses in British Columbia reveals few are confident the province's $1.5-billion recovery plan will help them survive or succeed.

The survey of 1,401 member businesses from groups including the BC Chamber of Commerce, Greater Vancouver Board of Trade and Business Council of B.C. indicates owners want a bold, long-term recovery plan.

article continues below

Only 16 per cent of businesses were confident in B.C.'s restart plan and 47 per cent were not.

Two-thirds of those surveyed were relying on some form of government support and owners were braced for a ""second wave"" of shutdowns or other problems if programs expire too quickly.

Some 28 per cent believed they'll return to normal once programs end, 32 per cent expected to cut workers' hours, 27 per cent anticipated layoffs, and one business in every 10 forecast either temporary or permanent closure.

Owners say payroll and wage supports must remain key components of B.C.'s recovery plan, along with fee and tax cuts.

The survey also identified expectations that the province must create better investment conditions.

Bridgitte Anderson, president and CEO of the Greater Vancouver Board of Trade, says business viability hinges on those measures.

Val Litwin with the BC Chamber of Commerce urges policy-makers to ""stay sensitive"" to the vulnerability of the business sector.

""A bold economic recovery plan that helps small businesses compete is non-negotiable for a prosperous B.C., and when small businesses thrive so do communities and people,"" Litwin said in a statement.

""Governments must keep focused on delivering their recovery plans swiftly.""

Canada's Communications Security Establishment says the malicious cyberactivities were very likely undertaken to pilfer information and intellectual property relating to the development and testing of vaccines for the novel coronavirus.

The cyberspy agency says the clandestine activity is hindering response efforts at a time when health-care experts and medical researchers need every available resource to help fight the pandemic.

The CSE's Centre for Cyber Security assesses that APT29, also known as ""the Dukes"" or ""Cozy Bear,"" was responsible, and almost certainly operates as part of Russian intelligence services.

""The group uses a variety of tools and techniques to predominantly target governmental, diplomatic, think-tank, health-care and energy targets for intelligence gain,"" says a joint advisory from the CSE and its allies.

""APT29 is likely to continue to target organizations involved in COVID-19 vaccine research and development, as they seek to answer additional intelligence questions relating to the pandemic.""

This assessment is supported by partners at Britain's Government Communications Headquarters' National Cyber Security Centre, the U.S. National Security Agency, and the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.

The CSE is urging Canadian health organizations to review a technical advisory on the threat and to take any necessary actions to protect themselves. ""We encourage them as well to contact the Cyber Centre if they suspect they have been targeted by cyberactors.""

The joint advisory says APT29 targeted COVID-19 vaccine research and development by scanning specific computer IP addresses of interest for vulnerabilities, a tactic that can help the group obtain login credentials to systems.

""This broad targeting potentially gives the group access to a large number of systems globally, many of which are unlikely to be of immediate intelligence value,"" the advisory says.

""The group may maintain a store of stolen credentials in order to access these systems in the event that they become more relevant to their requirements in the future.""

The joint study by researchers at the B.C. Centre for Disease Control, University of B.C., LifeLabs and public health scientists is posted on the health research website medRxiv and a news conference on the findings is scheduled for Thursday morning.

article continues below

The authors say the findings indicate successful suppression of community transmission in B.C., with an estimated overall infection rate of less than one per cent.

The study looked at anonymous blood samples collected for reasons unrelated to COVID-19 by LifeLabs in March and May, before and after public health measures were introduced.

The first samples in March found two of 869 specimens were positive, for a prevalence of 0.28 per cent, while the May sample found a prevalence of 0.55 per cent.

Health Minister Adrian Dix described the estimated infection rate as ""very low"" and says it shows the effectiveness of British Columbia's public health measures and co-operation of the public.

""It reinforces the fact that we're on the right track,"" Dix says.

""Of course, this is as the study suggests a dual-edged question, a low level of transmission but also very few people with antibodies to deal with potential future spikes of COVID-19.""

If the study's prevalence rate is applied to the whole provincial population, it could mean about 28,000 people have had the novel coronavirus, while 3,149 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed to date, however Dix noted the results are specific to the Vancouver area.

Health officials have repeatedly said that more people have been infected with the virus than have tested positive and Dix calls the estimated prevalence rate in B.C. ""encouraging.""

""Overall the level of infection in B.C. was low and that's due to the actions of people in B.C. That said, there are more people who were infected with COVID-19 than tested positive and that's something we've said clearly, especially in the period of March and April when we were focusing our testing program particularly on specific groups including health-care workers,"" Dix says.

The study is the first of its kind in Canada, he says.

The study is also important because it involved people who did not self-select for COVID-19 testing, so they likely didn't believe they had the virus, Dix says.

The study was authorized by provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and approved by the clinical research ethics board of the university. It has not yet been peer reviewed.

British Columbia recorded 21 new cases Wednesday and no new deaths. There are 207 active cases while 2,753 people who tested positive have recovered, the government said in a news release.

The province has now recorded 3,149 cases since the novel coronavirus first appeared in B.C. in late January.

More than 87.4% of those infected, or 2,753 people, have recovered. Of those who haven't, 189 people have died and 207 people are actively fighting the virus. Only 14 people are hospitalized, with five of those in intensive care units. The rest are self-isolating at home. There were no new deaths recorded in the past 24 hours.

Recording at least 20 new COVID-19 cases in a 24-hour period has become common in B.C., and Henry said yesterday that she found that number ""distressing,"" even though, she added, the good news is that the province knows where the clusters of infection are, many of the infections are linked and the number is not really that large given the province's population of more than five million residents.

The numbers in the past week were:

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12;

• 21 new cases on July 13;

In June, the number of daily new cases many times was in the single digits.

""There is one active community outbreak, in addition to several community exposure events,"" Henry and Dix said. ""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks.""

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

Wisdom from Dr Bonnie Henry

We may have to live with C19 for months or years. Let's not deny it or panic. Let's not make our lives useless. Let's learn to live with this fact. You can't destroy C19 viruses that have penetrated cell walls, by drinking gallons of hot water you'll just go to the bathroom more often. Washing hands and maintaining a two-metre physical distance is the best method for your protection. If you don't have a C19 patient at home, there's no need to disinfect the surfaces at your house. Packaged cargo, gas pumps, shopping carts and ATMs do not cause infection. If you wash your hands, live your life as usual. C19 is not a food infection. It is associated with drops of infection like the 'flu. There is no demonstrated risk that C19 is transmitted by food. You can lose your sense of smell with a lot of allergies and viral infections. This is only a non-specific symptom of C19. Once at home, you don't need to change your clothes urgently and go shower! Purity is a virtue, paranoia is not! The C19 virus doesn't hang in the air for long. This is a respiratory droplet infection that requires close contact. The air is clean, you can walk through the gardens and through parks (just keeping your physical protection distance). It is sufficient to use normal soap against C19, not antibacterial soap. This is a virus, not a bacteria. You don't have to worry about your food orders. But you can heat it all up in the microwave, if you wish. The chances of bringing C19 home with your shoes is like being struck by lightning twice in a day. I've been working against viruses for 20 years — drop infections don't spread like that! You can't be protected from the virus by taking vinegar, sugarcane juice and ginger! These are for immunity not a cure. Wearing a mask for long periods interferes with your breathing and oxygen levels. Wear it only in crowds. Wearing gloves is also a bad idea; the virus can accumulate into the glove and be easily transmitted if you touch your face. Better just to wash your hands regularly. Immunity is greatly weakened by always staying in a sterile environment. Even if you eat immune boosting foods, please go out of your house regularly to any park/beach. Immunity is increased by EXPOSURE TO PATHOGENS, not by sitting at home and consuming fried/ spicy/sugary food and aerated drinks.

Be smart and stay informed!

Live life sensibly and to the fullest.—

Dr Bonnie Henry

The list isn't new to the internet, with roots going back to mid-May and a connection to a U.S. physician in Maryland. However, the list is newly showing Dr. Henry as its author.

That doctor is Dr. Faheen Younus, the Chief of Infectious Diseases, University of Maryland Upper Chesapeake Health. The list actually has its roots in the multiple tweets Dr. Younus shared into May on his personal Twitter feed. The paraphrased format first appeared, and was widely shared, thanks to an article on the site TheAZB.com.

If you take the first piece of ""wisdom,"" in the now-circulating Dr. Henry-attributed posts, it reads: ""We may have to live with C19 for months or years. Let's not deny it or panic. Let's not make our lives useless. Let's learn to live with this fact.""

TheAZB.com begins their recap of Dr. Younus' tweeted items as follows: ""He Tweets We will live with Covid19 for months. Let’s not deny it or panic. Let’s not make life unnecessarily difficult. Let us learn to be happy and live with that fact.""

Similarly, the items in the list are paraphrased and tweaked as they are adapted by each re-poster or re-formatter of the list. For example, while The AZB.com summarizes a thought attributed to Dr. Younus as ""You cannot be protected from the virus by drinking / eating vinegar, sumac, soda and ginger."" The Dr. Henry-attributed phony list reads as follows: ""You can't be protected from the virus by taking vinegar, sugarcane juice and ginger! These are for immunity not a cure.""

Dr. Younus himself discredited the viral post, which moved rapidly on WhatsApp, in a tweet on June 6:

IMPORTANT:



These are not my words. There are errors and typos in this viral post on FB/WhatsApp that someone adapted from my tweets without approval.



I share COVID info only on twitter. Just read through my TL here if you’d like accurate info.



Spread the word please. Thx pic.twitter.com/tplGscusMh — Faheem Younus, MD (@FaheemYounus) June 6, 2020

On July 15, a site called The Dallas Orthodox Jewish Life presents the list as ""Dr. Bonnie Henry’s Down to Earth Advice,"" featuring an image taken without permission from the New York Times' recent profile of B.C.'s top doc.

Forms of the list show up on Google as being reproduced all over, with varying attribution or none at all, from church newsletters to personal blogs.

Many B.C. residents are sharing the list on their Facebook pages today, however many more are trying to get the word out that the list is not Dr. Henry's.

Dr. Henry's COVID-19 provincial case media updates are published on the Province of British Columbia's website, and reputable sources readily cover the regular press conferences here in B.C. Further, B.C. has a robust online section dedicated to COVID-19, which includes reliable and accurate information.

There is no press conference scheduled for Wednesday, July 15. A representative who assists with media requests for Dr. Henry said the following via email to V.I.A.: ""[T]he information was not developed by Dr. Henry nor anyone in her office. While some of the recommendations are similar to her remarks over the past several months, there are inaccuracies and errors in the guidance that is provided. She rather recommends British Columbians refer to the excellent guidance found on the B.C. Centre of Disease Control’s website at www.bccdc.ca and share that information through their social networks.""",[]

The Federal Bureau of Prisons is expected to take Sidoo into custody on September 23 and release him from a Pacific Northwest area facility just before Christmas.

Sidoo, 61, appeared online via Zoom in front of United States District Judge Nathaniel Gorton of the United States District Court for District of Massachusetts, as well as his lawyers and prosecutors. He wore a plaid suit while sitting in an office space inside his $31.7 million home in Vancouver’s Point Grey neighbourhood.

Sidoo, now a convicted felon, initially pled innocent to fraud and money laundering charges; he teared up before being sentenced and read a prepared statement:

“The last several months have been the hardest in my entire life and today I accept the court’s decision without reservation. No words can express how sorry I am for my decisions and actions that led to this day. I make no excuses, your honour. I broke the law and pled guilty and I now must pay for my actions.

“To my wife and boys, all I ever wanted was your love and respect and to be a good role model. And I know I have made a terrible mistake that has deeply affected our family. To my friends and colleagues and former teammates over the years, I am deeply ashamed today. To the young men and women who looked up to me as a role model, you deserve better. To the court and all of you, I wish to apologize for my actions.

“I will serve my sentence and am committed to returning to the community and doing everything possible to make a positive impact. I hope in time people will not judge me for the worst mistake in my life but for the work in the days, weeks and years ahead in which I am committed to being a better man.”

Gorton told Sidoo he was “impressed” by the businessman’s “obvious remorse.”

But Gorton pointed out two omissions in Sidoo’s statement.

“You expect to put this behind you and go forward and make up for what you called mistakes. I would call it a crime, not a mistake, but nevertheless, it is important that you acknowledge it and realize how many constituencies you have disappointed,” said the judge.

Sidoo also did not explicitly acknowledge that his crimes resulted in two students missing an opportunity to attend the universities his sons, Dylan Sidoo and Jordan Sidoo, were admitted to.

“What you accomplished, along with getting them into college, is to deprive two other deserving students of admittance into those universities — an act that is the very antithesis of one you want to be known for,” said Gorton.

Likewise, United States Attorney Andrew Lelling submitted to Gorton: “Sidoo engaged in serious criminal conduct involving fraud and deception that stretched over multiple years.

“His crimes warrant significant punishment. By engaging in the scheme, with [scheme mastermind Rick Singer] and others, Sidoo was able to steal two college admissions slots for his sons, including one from the University of California at Berkeley, one of the top public universities in the nation.”

Sidoo, said Gorton, “committed a crime that displayed an unbelievable lack of integrity, morality and common sense.

“You have let your selfish desire, your pride and your enormous wealth overcome all of what you apparently want to stand for with your works of charity,” Gorton told Sidoo.

Sidoo’s philanthropy, derived from his earnings in the capital markets, was central to his sentencing defense. According to Sidoo he has donated several million dollars to charitable causes, such as the University of B.C. football program.

In pleading guilty to fraud, Sidoo avoided a maximum prison term of 20 years and prosecutors subsequently agreed to 90 days behind bars, plus a $250,000 fine and one-year of supervised release, which will not be enforced in Canada by the U.S. Probation Department. Prosecutors also agreed to drop the money laundering charge.

The prison Sidoo goes to is expected to have harsher conditions since his options are limited due to his foreign citizenship. His attorney Martin Weinberg said he is expected to spend 14 days in isolation in a “maximum security setting,” due to COVID-19.

Sidoo will get four days credit for time already served. If he serves the full 90 days he will be released December 17 but will have to spend 14 days in isolation at home should B.C. public health rules for international travellers and COVID-19 continue into the fall.

Gorton said Sidoo’s crime would normally warrant more time in jail but there are mitigating circumstances, such as his remorse, lack of criminal record, philanthropy and “collateral consequences,” such as not being able to enter the U.S. as a felon and being stripped last month of his Order of B.C. medal for community service. Sidoo’s attorneys also previously noted he did not directly pay the universities but that his fraud was limited to cheating on the tests.

The former B.C. Lions football player worked as a stock broker in the 1990s and an investment banker between 2000 and 2010. Since 2010 he has made millions of dollars directing a handful of public companies that have failed to generate wealth for retail investors.

Sidoo was arrested March 8, 2019, in San Jose, California, on charges by the U.S. Department of Justice of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering related to the high-profile U.S. college admissions and bribery scandal, brought to light by a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe dubbed Operation Varsity Blues.

One of dozens of parents to be charged, Sidoo initially pled innocent to paying $200,000 total to scheme mastermind William ‘Rick’ Singer, who hired corrupt exam expert Mark Riddell to take Dylan and Jordan’s SAT exams, in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Sidoo also helped falsify one of his son Jordan’s university applications in October 2013 with an essay that originally included a fake claim of Jordan being held up at gunpoint by gangsters, while he was purported to be an intern for an anti-gang organization.

Co-conspirators Singer and Riddell pled guilty last year in exchange for cooperating with the government’s investigation.

The guilty parties in the case, who used Singer’s criminal services, were generally well-off individuals. Celebrities such as actress Lori Loughlin and her clothing designer husband Mossimo Gianulli and actress Felicity Huffman also pled guilty for related crimes and brought much media attention to the investigation.

Sidoo’s sons had no involvement in their father’s crime.

Jordan is now a 2018 history graduate from University of California Berkeley. Dylan graduated in cinematic arts in 2016 from the University of Southern California (USC). The two previously attended Vancouver’s prestigious St. George’s School.

Neither university has announced whether or not their degrees will remain valid. Dylan, according to the sentencing documents, had scored a 1,460/2,400 SAT score until Riddell, using a fake ID in December 2011, bumped up the score to 1,700, which was high enough for Dylan to enter Chapman University (and later transfer to USC). Riddell then scored 2,280/2,400 for Jordan in December 2012, paving the way to Berkley.

Riddell also took a high school test for Dylan. The B.C. Ministry of Education has issued no statement on how its testing process was so vulnerable to fraud.

Both sons have since entered into penny stock promotion with their father.

That characterization comes one day after Britain became the last of Canada's ""Five Eyes"" intelligence-sharing allies to ban the Chinese telecommunications firm from its 5G wireless internet.

article continues below

The next generation of wireless internet technology is to be dramatically faster than the current standard, with more bandwidth and faster response times. It's expected to be crucial to technologies such as autonomous vehicles and remote medicine.

Alykhan Velshi, Huawei Canada's vice president of corporate affairs, says the company hopes the Trudeau government's ongoing 5G review steers clear of political machinations by administration of U.S. President Donald Trump to undermine the company.

""We see ourselves as being caught in the middle of the U.S.-China trade war. Canada is also unfortunately caught in the middle of it,"" Velshi said in an interview on Wednesday.

""That is the context in which a lot of announcements and decisions are made, as the Trump administration is demanding that everyone pick a side whether it is actually in their interest to go all in on one side or that other.""

Britain's decision brought it firmly in line with Trump's campaign to have Huawei banned from allied countries, including Canada.

The United States views Huawei as a security threat and says its equipment and technology would serve as a back door for China's communist leaders and military to spy on other countries as they adopt 5G technology — a charge the company firmly denies.

The Trudeau government has delayed a long-awaited decision on whether to allow Huawei to participate in Canada's new 5G network largely because of China's ongoing imprisonment of two Canadian men, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.

Kovrig and Spavor were arrested nine days after Canada detained Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, on an American arrest warrant in December 2018. That move is widely seen as retaliation by China to force Canada to release Meng.

Velshi, a lawyer and former Conservative political staffer, called the case against Meng a ""politically driven"" prosecution by Trump, and pointed to a 2018 musing by the president that she could be used as a bargaining chip in his trade negotiation with China.

He said Meng will be vindicated by the Canadian courts when the extent of Trump's political motivation is properly presented.

(The Green party issued a statement along the same lines Wednesday, saying the United States is abusing its extradition treaty with Canada for political purposes and calling on the Canadian government to demand U.S. charges against Meng be dropped.)

But at the same time, Velshi also expressed sympathy for Kovrig and Spavor and reiterated the view of the Canadian arm of his company that diplomats can somehow win their freedom.

""Like all Canadians we're concerned about their detention, we're concerned about their treatment and we want to see them home as soon as possible.""

The tensions between Beijing and Washington intensified on Wednesday following Tuesday's announcement by Britain that Huawei would be excluded from work on the 5G network because U.S. sanctions made it impossible to ensure the safety of Chinese-supplied equipment.

The Trump administration decided in May to block non-U.S. companies from using American technology to produce processor chips and other components for Huawei without Washington's approval.

On Wednesday, the Chinese government accused Britain of colluding with the U.S. to hurt Huawei. The Trump administration fired back by announcing travel bans on employees of Huawei and other Chinese companies that the U.S. determines are assisting authoritarian governments in violating human rights, including against Uighurs in western China.

Velshi said Huawei has faith in the Canadian government's ongoing 5G review and the company has nothing to say about how long it has taken for a decision to be made.

In the meantime, Velshi said that despite the tensions between Beijing and Ottawa, Huawei's revenues in Canada grew in 2019, as did its workforce, which stands at about 1,200 employees. Velshi said the company has not yet made public its 2019 financials.

""We attribute that growth to the fact that our customers … have largely stood by us and continued to buy our products,"" said Velshi.

David Reed, Britain's deputy high commissioner to Canada, had no comment on what Canada should do next, but noted the two countries enjoy strong co-operation in the Five Eyes, which also includes Australia and New Zealand.

Reed said all countries must focus on allowing more companies to thrive in the 5G market.

""The reason we're in this position is there's a global market failure,"" Reed said in an interview. ""That's the conversation we started, particularly with Five Eyes partners, earlier in the year and we're trying to make progress on that.""

John Power, the spokesman for Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains, gave no indication as to when the government would make its decision on which companies can sell 5G gear in Canada. He reiterated that the government would ""not compromise on matters of national security"" but declined to reference specific companies.

""Our government's review will consider technical and security factors, including advice from our security agencies and consider decisions from our allies and partners,"" he said in a statement, adding that it would take into account ""important domestic and international considerations.""

Melanie Mark says $1.5 million will be distributed equally between 20 public post-secondary schools to strengthen supports for students with cognitive, mental health or physical disabilities.

She says the province is investing $275,000 in the new BCcampus website to further develop online resources and tools focused on well-being for students, staff and faculty.

The resources include videos and webinars on topics such as adapting to online learning, stress management and navigating financial supports.

Mark says the province is also providing another $400,000 to support the development of more resources covering a wide range of courses and subjects in B.C.'s growing open textbook collection.

The minister says students may also now apply to StudentAid BC to be automatically considered for a free access grant announced in this year's provincial budget.

She says the grant means more than 40,000 eligible low- and middle-income students could receive up to $4,000 per year to help with costs associated with degree, diploma and certificate programs.

""This is double the funding and the number of students who were supported through grants under the former government,"" Mark said at Camosun College on Wednesday.

The B.C. access grant is open to part-time students, she added.

The amount students receive would depend on their family income, the length of their program and whether it's full or part time.

That discovery was reported in an email to the community police station, which was closed, and by the time police received the email, the evidence had been thrown away and an investigation was impossible.

Photos of the lemons show they were cut in half, the rinds skewered with long sewing needles, and each was tied to tree limbs.

The Commissioner of Canada Elections says the investigation didn't turn up any evidence the federal parties knew the money represented illegal indirect contributions from companies.

Most of the money has now been returned and the firm will pay upwards of $139,000 to the government and has also instituted a series of internal reforms to guard against further breaches.

The commissioner released the information today along with a series of findings about two other entities that didn't comply with election financing rules in the last federal election.

One, the United Conservative Party of Alberta, handed out free bumper stickers campaigning against the Liberal prime minister, and the second was labour union Unifor, which held a pancake breakfast to support a local NDP candidate.

The 8,000-kilogram, armour-plated truck — equipped with a rotating roof hatch, eight gun ports and a powered battering ram — looked like it was ready for the worst of war zones.

article continues below

However, when the purchase was scuttled by city council last month, Mayor Mike Savage made it clear the brawny vehicle had become a symbol of oppression, particularly for Halifax's Black community. The mayor said the money would be used instead for anti-Black racism programs.

""There has been in this province a history of systemic racism, and we have to do better,"" Savage said at the time.

The decision was seen as a step forward by those who have long complained that Canada's police forces are becoming paramilitary organizations that act more like occupying armies than community-based partners.

""This announcement sends a positive message,"" said Akwasi Owusu-Bempah, a sociology professor at the University of Toronto. ""I have no doubt that what we call defunding of police ... will take hold in Canada.""

Owusu-Bempah, whose work examines race, crime and policing, cited the July 6 decision by Edmonton city council to cut $11 million over two years from the Edmonton Police Service budget. That money will be spent on housing, social services and a safety task force.

The professor, who also works with the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, said there is a growing movement to ""de-task"" the police, which means reducing the scope of their responsibilities and reallocating the savings.

He said mental-health organizations should be given the resources to deal with people facing mental-health crises rather than poorly trained front-line officers.

In the same vein, police should not be expanding their duties to include what the military is trained to do, because it transforms peace officers into soldiers who see members of the public as enemy combatants, he said.

""Poor, Black and Indigenous people then become the enemies in the war on drugs. It further entrenches the problems of racial injustice,"" Owusu-Bempah said. ""(Police) feel like they're in battle, as opposed to serving a community.""

The Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police did not respond to a request for an interview.

Meanwhile, there are others who say the about-face in Halifax was just a distraction from a much larger problem.

Kevin Walby, an associate professor of criminal justice at the University of Winnipeg, said there's more to militarization than the purchase of armoured vehicles, automatic weapons and tactical gear.

""In terms of defunding, they're actually the smallest piece of the puzzle,"" he said. ""So I wouldn't say the decision (in Halifax) means that Halifax police are off the hook when it comes to militarization, because it could still be happening in other ways.""

As an example, Walby points to the increasing use of heavily armed emergency response team members in routine, everyday policing.

Using information gleaned through access to information laws, Walby has found that police forces across Canada are increasingly using SWAT members to serve low-risk warrants.

""It is happening all the time, but we don't see it,"" he said. ""And they even assign SWAT team members to do mental-health checks.""

As well, Walby said he has been tracking a more insidious form of militarization known as ""community policing.""

It involves teams of officers fanning out in neighbourhoods to ask residents questions about their safety concerns and problems with their neighbours. The information is later used to compile detailed community profiles.

Though it may sound like a tame, feel-good strategy, Walby said community policing is anything but.

""Community policing has morphed into this kind of intelligence-gathering activity,"" he said. ""The militaries in Afghanistan and Iraq used community policing models to ... collect intelligence and feed it back into military operations. Canadian police are now using the very same tactic.""

In the United States, where the militarization of police has been more overt, an academic paper in the journal Research and Politics found that the increasing use of military equipment has led to more violent police behaviour.

The article, published in June 2017, cites a U.S. Department of Defence program that has made excess military weapons and vehicles available to local law enforcement agencies since the late 1990s.

The study revealed a statistically significant relationship between military transfers to police in four states and fatalities from officer-involved shootings.

""As militarization seeps into their cultures, (law enforcement agencies) rely more on violence to solve problems,"" the paper says. ""The mechanism mirrors psychology's classic 'Law of the Instrument,' whereby access to a certain tool increases the probability that the tool is used for problems when other tools may be more appropriate.""

Owusu-Bempah said police in the United States routinely use armoured vehicles for low-level drug raids.

""In the United States, we saw police with armoured vehicles pulling down the front walls of houses with a battering ram to execute warrants,"" he said. ""When you have the militarized type of policing, it creates an environment in which the warrior cop is allowed to exist.""

In January 2015, U.S. President Barack Obama cited concerns over the militarization of police when he signed an executive order that prohibits law enforcement agencies from acquiring certain military equipment, including tracked armoured vehicles, bayonets, grenade launchers and large-calibre weapons.

Obama's order came a few months after the shooting by police of Michael Brown, an unarmed Black youth in Ferguson, Mo., whose death sparked protests across the country — not unlike the protests that followed the death of George Floyd, the Black man in Minneapolis who died May 25 as a police officer was kneeling on his neck.

The disturbing video showing Floyd's violent arrest gave rise to a global movement that, among other things, is calling for the defunding and demilitarization of police departments — and an end to police brutality and systemic racism.

Plenty of cities across Canada already have armoured vehicles like the one Halifax rejected, including Ottawa, Fredericton, Saskatoon, Winnipeg and Sault Ste. Marie, Ont.

The Department of National Defence confirmed in 2014 it had donated five armoured vehicles to police agencies since 2007: a Grizzly armoured personnel carrier to Edmonton police in 2007; two Cougar armoured vehicles to the B.C. RCMP in 2010; and one Cougar each to the police in New Glasgow, N.S., and Windsor, Ont., in 2013.

The Cougar sent to New Glasgow was given away in 2017 because it was never put to good use, the police chief said at the time.

Still, the police departments that have these vehicles argue they are necessary because they offer protection to officers and the public during mass public shootings, hostage takings and other high-risk scenarios.

Ottawa lawyer Michael Spratt doesn't buy that rationale.

""Our police forces look more like military organizations — with automatic rifles and riot shields and tanks,"" said Spratt who specializes in criminal law and policing. ""There's no need for any police force to have a tank.""

The Ottawa Police Service, for example, has an imposing armoured vehicle known as a Lenco Bearcat, which Spratt says has rarely seen service since it was purchased in 2010.

""When we're talking about defunding the police ... this is really low-hanging fruit,"" said Spratt. ""Even if there is some marginal benefit in some rare circumstances, the cost of having these vehicles — and inherent harm of having a militarized police force — vastly outweighs any potential benefit.""

Members of the navy as well as the public at large will be able to vote online on two alternatives starting Friday, with both variants substituting ""sailor"" in place of ""seaman"" in different ways.

Police said they found evidence Wednesday night Martin Carpentier was in a trailer in the area where police have focused their search since the bodies of Norah and Romy Carpentier, aged 11 and 6, were discovered Saturday.

Carpentier took items from the trailer, suggesting he may visit other barns, sheds or cottages in the region, police said in a news release.

""We are dealing with an individual who is probably desperate and who must be looking for equipment to ensure his survival,"" Sgt. Audrey-Anne Bilodeau said in a pre-recorded audio message sent to reporters.

Police asked residents of Lotbiniere and surrounding areas west of Quebec City to check their cottages, trailers or buildings for signs of a break-in, such as missing or moved clothing, food, or equipment. Hunters who have set up cameras in the woods are also being asked to check their recordings.

Police are also suggesting worried citizens search in groups or with a police escort and to call 911 with any relevant information.

Sgt. Ann Mathieu, another provincial police spokeswoman, told reporters Thursday there's no evidence to suggest Carpentier poses a danger to the general population.

""It's an individual who is currently, if he is still alive — and the elements we have lead us to believe he is — is looking to ensure his survival and to hide,"" she said.

Investigators have said the girls and their father were believed to have been in a serious car crash on Highway 20 in the Quebec City suburb of St-Apollinaire July 8, but there was nobody inside the vehicle when they arrived on scene.

An Amber Alert was issued last Thursday but cancelled two days later after the bodies were found.

In recent days police have focused their search on a 50-square-kilometre wooded area around St-Apollinaire, where ""items of interest"" were found on Sunday.

Autopsies were performed on the two girls, but police said they won't reveal the cause of death until Carpentier is found.

Mohammed Shahed, a member of the governing party who regularly appeared on TV talk shows, was arrested Wednesday by the Rapid Action Battalion near the Indian border after a nine-day manhunt.

Shahed is chairman of the Regent Group and owner of two Regent hospitals in the capital, Dhaka.

Abdul Baten, a commissioner of the Detective Branch in Dhaka, said Shahed admitted after his arrest that his hospitals did not have proper equipment to conduct coronavirus tests.

A court in Dhaka on Thursday allowed investigators to keep Shahed in custody for 10 days for questioning.

Officials said the hospitals had issued more than 10,000 coronavirus test results and about 60% were fake even though patients were charged for them. The hospitals allegedly arranged for the remaining tests to be conducted by another hospital.

The two hospitals had not renewed their medical licenses for years, but the Ministry of Health nevertheless signed a deal with Shahed to dedicate the hospitals to coronavirus testing and treatment as the number of cases rose in Bangladesh.

Bangladesh on Thursday was nearing 200,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, including 2,496 deaths. Public health experts say the actual number is much higher because only about 70 testing facilities are available in the country of 160 million people.

Shahed belongs to the governing Awami League party headed by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and is a member of its foreign affairs subcommittee. He has more than 50 illegal cases pending against him across the country on various charges including forgery and cheating.

Another doctor and her husband were also arrested recently on similar charges of falsifying test results.

Local media reports say the scams could hurt Bangladesh’s earnings from overseas workers. Last week, Italy suspended all flights from Bangladesh to Rome after some Bangladeshis reportedly presented fake negative test reports for the coronavirus.

Bangladesh earns about $19 billion a year from about 10 million overseas workers. Authorities said about 15,000 Bangladeshi workers with jobs in Italy remain stranded in Bangladesh and it is unclear whether they will be able to travel to the European country.

The TV host and producer wrote earlier a lengthy Facebook post defending himself and criticizing his firing for what the company deemed ""bigotry"" and ""anti-Semitism,"" prominent members of the U.S. Jewish community said the post fell well short and demanded an apology.

""It’s not enough to say, ‘I’m not a racist, I’m not a bigot,’"" Cooper had told the AP earlier. ""The statements he made are hurtful, and they’re false.""

Cooper said Cannon should read and heed the words of Martin Luther King Jr., who ""dedicated his life for civil rights for all and a colour-blind America."" Cooper also had advised him to seek out the guidance of basketball Hall of Famer-turned-writer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who has condemned several sports and entertainment celebrities for anti-Semitic posts.

In the hour-plus episode of ""Cannon's Class"" released last month that prompted his firing, Cannon and Richard ""Professor Griff"" Griffin, formerly of the rap group Public Enemy, contended that Black people are the true Hebrews and Jews have usurped that identity.

Cannon then argued that lighter-skinned people — ""Jewish people, white people, Europeans"" — ""are a little less"" and have a ""deficiency"" that historically caused them to act out of fear and commit acts of violence to survive.

""They had to be savages,"" he said.

""When I first heard about the comments Mr. Cannon made, it was very, very disappointing,"" said Oren Segal, director of the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism. ""We’re in a time where hatred of all kinds is very much apparent. It’s in the news every day.""

""Anti-Semitism in particular over the past several years has been something that we've seen in increase , as well as racism and other issues,"" Segal added. ""So when you hear an individual who has a public profile, who has influence over people, make statements that are highly offensive to the Jewish community, the first reaction is disappointment.""

Anti-Semitic violent attacks rose worldwide by 18% in 2019 compared with the previous year, according to a report published in April by Tel Aviv University’s Kantor Center for the Study of Contemporary Jewry.

Segal said some members of the Black Hebrew Israelite movement see themselves as the true ""chosen people,"" and believe that Blacks, Hispanics and Native Americans are the true descendants of the 12 Tribes of Israel. He noted that not all spew hateful rhetoric, although many adhere to an extreme set of anti-Semitic beliefs.

Bruce D. Haynes, a professor of sociology at the University of California, Davis, who has been studying Black Jews for more than two decades, agreed that the remarks echo the ideas of extreme Black Hebrew Israelites and of Minister Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam leader who last year referenced ""Satanic Jews"" in a speech denying allegations of anti-Semitism. But Haynes took a more nuanced view.

""The danger is that those groups get confused with other self-identified Israelites like (Rabbi) Capers Funnye, who has a congregation in Chicago, and who is very much involved with the Ashkenazim Jewish community. So I want to make clear that the term 'Israelites' is a tricky term,"" he said.

""Is it anti-Semitic to say Black people are the real Israelites or the real Jews? I’m not sure I’d call it anti-Semitism,"" Haynes said. ""It’s not a good reading of history, but I wouldn’t call it anti-Semitism. On the other hand, some of those groups that call Jews impostors certainly cross the line.""

Until his firing, Cannon produced ""Wild ’n Out,"" a comedy improv series for VH1, the ViacomCBS-owned cable channel.

In an earlier Facebook post, he had said that he welcomes being held accountable and takes responsibility for his words, while also accusing the company of trying to silence an ""outspoken black man"" and demanding full ownership of the ""Wild ’n Out"" brand.

""I do not condone hate speech nor the spread of hateful rhetoric. ... The Black and Jewish communities have both faced enormous hatred, oppression persecution and prejudice for thousands of years and in many ways have and will continue to work together to overcome these obstacles,"" he wrote.

Cooper had said that Cannon should reject Farrakhan’s hate speech and ""reduce the long statement to two sentences"" — a simple apology, which he did after their conversation.

""I just had the blessed opportunity to converse with Rabbi Abraham Cooper director of global social action @SimonWiesenthal. My first words to my brother was, I apologize for the hurt I caused the Jewish Community"" Cannon tweeted.

""On my podcast I used words & referenced literature I assumed to be factual to uplift my community instead turned out to be hateful propaganda and stereotypical rhetoric that pained another community For this I am deeply sorry but now together we can write a new chapter of healing.""

""My hope is that this series can be a place to explore meaningful topics together and sort through so many of the questions we’re all trying to answer in our own lives,"" Obama said in a statement.

The new podcast is the first title in the ongoing collaboration between Spotify and Higher Ground, a production company founded by Barack and Michelle Obama. Last year, the former president and first lady partnered with Spotify to produce exclusive podcasts for the platform.

Michelle Obama’s new podcast expects to hold candid and personal conversations with a focus on topics concerning relationships and health. She expects to have several guests on the series including talk-show host Conan O’Brien and Valerie Jarrett, business woman and former senior advisor to Barack Obama.

""Perhaps most of all, I hope this podcast will help listeners open up new conversations — and hard conversations —- with the people who matter most to them,"" she said. ""That’s how we can build more understanding and empathy for one another.""

Obama released her Netflix documentary ""Becoming"" in May. The project was an extension of her 2018 bestselling memoir of the same name and a kind of authorized filmic portrait of Obama.

But for the third straight year, the racial diversity of LGBTQ characters has waned and transgender characters again went unseen.

GLAAD called the decrease in non-white LGBTQ characters ""concerning."" In 2019, 34% of LGBTQ characters were people of colour. That's down from 42% in 2018 and 57% in 2017.

article continues below

""GLAAD is ?calling on the studios to ensure that within two years at least half of their LGBTQ characters are people of colour,"" said the advocacy group that tracks representation of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in the media.

For the third year in a row, transgender characters were also absent from major studio releases.

But overall, GLAAD found higher rates of inclusion than it has in the eight years its been tracking studio films. Of the 118 films studied, 22 (18.6%) included lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or queer characters. That's a slight increase from 18.2% in 2018.

But none of the studios studied — the Walt Disney Co., Warner Bros., Universal Pictures, Lionsgate, Paramount Pictures, Sony Pictures, STX Films and United Artists Releasing — received a ""good"" or higher grade for LGBTQ representation. Sony and Disney received ""poor"" grades. STX Films, which released ""Hustlers,"" ""21 Bridges"" and ""Uglydolls"" last year, failed GLAAD's test since their 2019 movies featured zero LGBTQ representation.

GLAAD has sought that studios reach inclusion of LGBTQ characters in 20% of their films by 2021 and 50% by 2024. Paramount, Lionsgate, Disney and United Artists reached the 20% level last year.

Screen time is also an issue. In many of Hollywood’s biggest films, LGBTQ characters — when included — came and went. Only nine of the 22 films with an LGBTQ character featured one with more than 10 minutes of screen time.

""Despite seeing a record high percentage of LGBTQ-inclusive films this year, the industry still has a long way to go in terms of fairly and accurately representing the LGBTQ community,"" said GLAAD President and CEO, Sarah Kate Ellis. ""If film studios want to stay relevant to today’s audiences and compete in an industry that is emphasizing diversity and inclusion, then they must urgently reverse course on the diminishing representation of LGBTQ women and people of colour, as well as the complete absence of trans characters.""

The bank's report says 1.5 million women lost their jobs in the first two months of the pandemic.

The report found that women tend to work in industries hardest hit by the crisis, their employment level has been slower to rebound as the economy reopens and they are more likely to fall out of the workforce in the long-term.

The study says one-third of women who lost jobs between February and June did not seek work, putting them at higher risk of long term job-separation and future wage penalties.

Employment among women with toddlers or school-aged children fell seven per cent between February and May, compared with a four-per cent decrease for fathers of children the same age.

Single mothers with a toddler or school-aged child saw their employment drop 12 per cent between February and June, compared with a seven per cent decrease for single fathers.

The study says women accounted for about 45 per cent of the decline in hours worked over the downturn, but will only make up 35 per cent of the recovery.

The Toronto-based miner says gold production in the three months ended June 30 fell by about eight per cent to 1.149 million ounces from 1.25 million in the previous quarter, mainly due to COVID-19 related disruptions at its Veladero mine in Argentina.

It warns that second quarter gold all-in sustaining costs per ounce are expected to be seven to nine per cent higher than in the first quarter, while copper costs are to rise by four to six per cent.

Barrick says the average market price for gold in the second quarter was US$1,711 per ounce, up from its realized price of US$1,589 per ounce in the first quarter.

Copper production, meanwhile, rose to 120 million pounds from 115 million in the first quarter, and the average market price was US$2.43 per pound, up from a realized price of US$2.23 in the first quarter.

CEO Mark Bristow says Barrick is positioned well to achieve its guidance for the year.

In May, 2020 gold guidance was adjusted lower by about 200,000 ounces to between 4.6 and five million ounces to account for the suspension of its Porgera gold mine amid a dispute with the federal government in Papua New Guinea.

The Toronto-based company says it has reassigned about 220 of the complex's 475 workers elsewhere within its Canadian organization since the suspension began in April.

However, Kirkland Lake Gold says it now believes that the best course of action is to provide severance packages for the remaining employees who can't be reassigned.

The mining and milling complex near Matheson, Ont., was designated as non-core to Kirkland Lake Gold's business in mid-February.

That was followed by a suspension of operations as of April 2 under protocols that Kirkland Lake Gold put into effect to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Holt, Taylor and Holloway mines and Holt mill accounted for nearly 12 per cent of the 975,000 ounces produced last year by Kirkland Lake Gold, according to its website.

But closing those sales has been problematic, Rivera says, since the Alberta government ended a rebate program that had covered as much as 35 per cent of the initial cost of a typical system.

article continues below

""I've been in the solar business long enough to watch it slowly, slowly increase, then once the grant program was there, it increased quite sharply for the residential market,"" says the president and co-founder of Calgary's GreenLight Power, which was founded in 2008.

""But, once the grants disappeared (last fall), we saw that sharp increase drop drastically. We had 21 customers signed up — the day they cancelled the grant, all but one cancelled their contract with us.""

The financial argument for investing in a home solar power array in Canada depends, experts say, on how much sun your house receives, how much it costs for electricity from the public grid, the capital cost of installation and, of course, which way the political wind blows.

In Alberta's case, the United Conservative Party cancelled a program put in place by the New Democrats. Similarly, after a 2018 provincial election, Ontario's Progressive Conservatives put an end to the main solar rebates program, implemented by a previous Liberal-led government.

Shifting policy and power prices make it difficult to estimate how long it will take for energy savings to pay off the capital cost of a home system, said Nicholas Gall, director, distributed energy resource for CanREA, the Canadian Renewable Energy Association.

Abundant — and cheap — hydroelectric power in Quebec, for instance, makes it more difficult to justify home solar power on a cost-saving basis there, he said.

Still, the declining cost of solar panels makes them a much better deal today than they were a decade ago.

""Costs for solar panels have fallen by about 55 per cent between 2008 and 2018,"" he said, citing the most recently available numbers.

""Those costs will represent anywhere from 20 to 45 per cent of the total installed cost. There are fixed costs that haven't come down as much, for labour and permitting and design, but the hardware is continuing to decrease in price.""

Installations are long-lived, he said, noting some installed in the 1980s are still producing plenty of electricity and panels installed today are expected to last at least 30 years.

The systems work best if your roof faces south but east or west can work, too, he said. (Roofs that are shaded by neighbours or trees make poor solar power collectors.)

Most provinces have programs where excess power from residential systems is purchased for distribution on the grid, he added, but the compensation varies widely from one jurisdiction to another.

Asked which Canadian province is the best in which to buy a solar power system now, Gall was quick to identify Prince Edward Island, which has a ""generous"" rebate of $1 per watt.

""That's around 40 per cent of the total installed cost for a typical system, up to a maximum of $10,000,"" he said.

Nova Scotia has a slightly less generous rebate program that pays 60 cents per watt, up to 25 per cent of system costs, to a maximum of $6,000, he added.

There are a hodgepodge of other programs across the country. The Northwest Territories, for instance, will pay up to 50 per cent of the cost of a solar system but only for buildings that are off the grid.

Some municipal governments also offer solar rebates — Medicine Hat is an example in southern Alberta. In Calgary, residents can lease their solar power system.

Prospective homebuyers in Edmonton and Calgary, meanwhile, have the option to buy solar power as an included component of their new house — Jayman Built Homes has been putting six-panel, two-kilowatt solar systems on all of its homes since early 2019.

The Calgary-based company built 811 homes last year and expects to add more than 700 this year, said Jayman president and chief operating officer Dave Desormeaux.

The withdrawal of the provincial rebate program last year meant an additional cost to Jayman of about $1,500 per home, he said, but after much thought, the company kept its solar program going.

""We're not making the margins we used to but we don't want to change the brand unless we absolutely had to. And so far that strategy is working,"" said Desormeaux.

He estimates the panels result in annual utility bill savings of about $200 to $250 per home.

GreenLight's Rivera says a full-sized home system should generate eight to 12 kilowatts at a non-subsidized capital cost of between $2 and $3 per watt, or $16,000 to $36,000.

He said he's fielding plenty of calls these days asking about adding battery storage to improve system reliability, independence from the grid on cloudy days and power quality.

But, although battery costs are falling, storage adds thousands of dollars to the cost of the system.

""As soon as you add batteries, you're doubling if not tripling the cost of solar because the battery technology is so expensive,"" he said.

""It's a tonne of interest — but not a tonne of sales.""

While hundreds of people could be employed in positions relating to the games and hubs — such as security jobs, rink staff, food services and hotel housekeeping — the financial benefit of two bubble communities under tight seal would be ""modest"" at best, suggested Bank of Montreal chief economist Douglas Porter.

""When you think of how many tourists would normally be in Toronto during peak tourist season, I'm quite sure this is less than one per cent,"" he said.

""The reality is, it's not going to move the needle.""

But Porter, a lifelong hockey fan, said he anticipates a ""reasonably meaningful positive"" morale boost to Canadian sports fans who've been eagerly anticipating players returning to the ice in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The games are slated to start Aug. 1 with six Canadian teams qualifying for the 24-team resumption of play. No fans will be in the seats.

Edmonton and Toronto were confirmed as the NHL's hub cities on Friday night.

""The fact that part of our world is getting back to some kind of normal will help reinforce the sense that things, generally, are moving in that direction and could help support the recovery,"" Porter said.

The gradual comeback of major sporting events has drawn plenty of interest in recent weeks, with debates raging over the risks of putting players back into the games, even if spectators aren't allowed in the facilities.

Further questions have been raised over whether rigorous testing is enough to prevent outbreaks within the isolated community, which could potentially throw the whole plan into a costly disarray.

Many of these factors make placing a value on hockey's return especially difficult.

Michael Naraine, a professor at Brock University in St. Catharines, Ont., said the largest amount of money is on the line at large corporations, which he said is driving the return of major sporting events.

""The primary revenue driver for sports is broadcasting,"" said the assistant professor of digital sport management and marketing.

""They need television advertisers come back. The league itself needs to gain its revenue from NBC and Sportsnet here in Canada.""

Politicians have preferred to emphasize the positive aspects of a deal with the NHL.

Alberta Premier Jason Kenney eagerly promoted Edmonton as the ultimate hub city for the hockey league, posting videos on Twitter that prominently featured the Rocky Mountains and other popular destinations in the province.

Naraine said those public expressions by leaders are more an attempt to ""pander"" to their constituents than actually drive any meaningful economic impact. He said this is especially the case in Edmonton.

""Having major events come to town allows them to beat their chests and say, 'We exist. We're on the map. Come look at us,'"" he said.

""But the fact that the hub city will be in Edmonton is no different than whether the hub city would be in Toronto or Vancouver or elsewhere. It's not going to significantly drive tourism all of a sudden.""

Patrick Rishe, a sports professor at Washington University in St. Louis, said he sees value in showcasing a lesser known Canadian city on broadcast television with ""beauty shots"" of the locale. He said it may also sit well with NHL executives.

""You never know,"" he said. ""Doing and serving a good deed for the league now, this could pay dividends down the road.""

Any semblance of a regular hockey season would be welcomed by Dana Parris, owner of the Lockeroom sports bar in Barrie, Ont.

Even though her business is over 100 kilometres away from downtown Toronto, she anticipates the excitement would reverberate to her customers.

""If we could have sports come back and we hit Stage 3 (of Ontario's COVID reopening plan) around the same time, I will probably stop crying myself to sleep,"" she said.

""If those two come together it's just going to be the most beautiful thing.""

The 18-year veteran quarterback headlines the Canadian Football Hall of Fame's 2020 class that was unveiled Thursday. Burris, 45, got the nod in his first year of eligibility, becoming just the 21st player ever to do so but second in as many years after Calgary running back Jon Cornish in 2019.

article continues below

Joining Burris in the player category are offensive linemen Clyde Brock and Freddie Childress and quarterback Greg Vavra. John Hufnagel, the Calgary Stampeders president/GM, and Larry Uteck (posthumously), the former head coach/athletic director at Saint Mary’s University, were both named as builders.

Burris's family — wife Nicole and sons Armand and Barron — had known of his induction since February but managed to keep quiet about it until about two and a half weeks ago when the Hall of Fame informed Burris. Even then, the Burris clan was very nonchalant in asking the former quarterback to take in what he thought was a run-of-the-mill video.

Instead, Burris watched Hall of Famer Damon Allen (2012) outline his pro football journey to Canada, which drew a rather bewildered look from Burris. Then Allen detailed Burris's stellar CFL career before Mark DeNobile, the Hall of Fame's executive director, delivered the big news.

And the player, affectionately dubbed Smilin' Hank because of his outgoing personality, was lost for words as tears streamed down his face.

""Yeah, they got me good,"" Burris said with a chuckle. ""What's funny is whenever I've told the boys to keep anything quiet, they've always gone back to their mother and yet they didn't say a peep about this.

""I was lost for words just because to hear it shows you that people appreciated the things you did throughout your career. This is the way for the league and all the organizations and the fans saying, 'Thank you,' and for me I'm humbled by it . . . there's so many guys in there (Hall of Fame) who I looked up to and now to be able to join them is a dream come true.""

The six-foot-one, 190-pound Burris, a native of Spiro, Okla., played 20 pro seasons, 18 in the CFL with the Calgary Stampeders (1997-99, 2005-11), Saskatchewan Roughriders (2000, 2003-04), Hamilton Tiger-Cats (2012-13) and Ottawa Redblacks (2014-16). Burris also spent time with the NFL's Green Bay Packers (2001) and Chicago Bears (2002).

Burris appeared in five Grey Cups, winning three (1998, '08, '16) and being named the MVP twice (2008, '16). The CFL's outstanding player on two occasions (2010, 2015), Burris amassed 63,639 passing yards and 373 TD passes — both third all-time.

Burris retired shortly after leading Ottawa to a thrilling 39-33 overtime Grey Cup upset win over Calgary. He threw for 461 yards and three TDs despite suffering a knee injury during warmups.

Burris said his Hall of Fame induction is as much a testament to his family's resilience and perseverance as it is his on-field accomplishments.

""I had to take my wife all over Canada, drag my kids all over Canada and force them to make new friends just for dad to be able to play this game called football,"" said Burris, whose family still calls Ottawa home. ""And for them to understand and see just the emotions that ran through me . . . it just shows how big that moment is, just kind of when your whole life flashes before you.""

Burris and the other inductees will have to wait for their day in the sun due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2020 class will be honoured alongside the 2021 inductees next August.

When Burris is formally honoured, he'll be joined by former teammate Childress and Hufnagel, who served as Calgary's head coach (2008-2015) before moving into the front office full-time. Burris won Grey Cups with both ('98 with Childress, '08 with Hufnagel).

""Calgary is a machine right now and it all started in 2008 when Huf came in and we got that Grey Cup in his first year,"" Burris said. ""Calgary has always had double-digit wins and been in the playoffs each and every year Huf has been there, they've always been a strong contender for the Grey Cup and there's one reason why.""

Hufnagel, a 68-year-old native of Coraopolis, Pa., spent 12 seasons as a CFL quarterback with Calgary (1976-79), Saskatchewan (1980-83, 1987) and Winnipeg (1984-86) before getting into coaching. A five-time Grey Cup champion, Hufnagel also earned a Super Bowl ring as an assistant with the New England Patriots (2003).

Hufnagel amassed a 102-42-1 record as Calgary's head coach, his .712 win percentage being the highest among coaches with more than 100 games. He's been named the CFL's coach of the year twice (2008, 2014).

Childress, a 53-year-old native of Little Rock, Ark., played 13 CFL seasons with Shreveport (1994), Birmingham (1995), Calgary (1996-03) and Saskatchewan (2004-06). A former second-round pick of the NFL's New England Patriots, Childress won two Grey Cups with the Stampeders (1998, 2001) and in 1998 was named the CFL's top offensive lineman.

Brock, 79, of Los Angeles, played 12 seasons with Saskatchewan (1964-75), helping the club win its first Grey Cup in 1966. The former Dallas Cowboy-San Francisco 49er appeared in 169 regular-season CFL games and four times was named a league all-star before being inducted into Saskatchewan's Plaza of Honour in 1995.

Vavra, 59, of Red Deer, Alta., helped the Calgary Dinos win the Vanier Cup in 1983, his final season at the school. That year, he also became the first player in the program's history to capture the Hec Crighton Trophy as Canadian university football's top player and still holds the U Sports record for most passing yards in a game (627).

Vavra was drafted by the Calgary Stampeders in 1984 and also spent time with the B.C. Lions (1986-87) and Edmonton Eskimos (1988).

After playing seven CFL seasons as a defensive back with Toronto (1974-76), B.C. (1977), Montreal (1978-80) and Ottawa (1980), Uteck became an assistant coach at Saint Mary’s University in 1982. He was promoted to head coach the following year, a position he held until 1997.

Over that span, Uteck was named the Atlantic University Athletic Association coach of the year five times and twice Canadian university football's top coach.

Uteck served as athletic director from 1995 to 2002 and the Huskies captured two Vanier Cups (2001-02). The native of Thornhill, Ont., passed away Dec. 25, 2002 of Lou Gehrig's disease at the age of 50.

The Atlantic Bowl was renamed the Uteck Bowl in 2003.

""We are thrilled to welcome Jaime McMillan to the club,"" Bezbatchenko said in a statement. ""Jaime played a critical role in the front office, simultaneously managing and executing high-level projects during her time with Toronto FC as it became a perennial MLS Cup contender, and I know she will be a great asset to the Crew as we continue to grow our ambitions and elevate the club in this new era.""

McMillan will oversee Columbus' administration and management in non-technical areas, including soccer operations administration, facilities and budgeting.

The Crew said her role ""will also include a focus on player and staff administration, academy administration and other club support areas.""

Toronto enjoys a reputation as one of MLS' best teams at helping players settle off the field, with McMillan leading the way.

McMillan joined Toronto in 2010 as co-ordinator for business operations. She went on to become senior manager of team development (2013-15), director of team development (2015-16) and director of administrations and operations (2016-18) before taking on the role of senior director of administration and operations.

Toronto won one MLS Cup (2017), one Supporters' Shield (2017) and six Canadian Championships (2010, 2011, 2012, 2016, 2007, 2018) during McMillan's tenure.

The Super League announced its revamped schedule for the resumption of rugby league play, with Toronto playing its remaining games on the other side of the Atlantic.

""Regrettably for the Wolfpack the challenges around travel, international border protocols and the hosting of public events in Toronto have proved too significant for the team to be able to host games at Lamport Stadium this season,"" Toronto CEO and chairman Bob Hunter said in an open letter to fans.

""This is not a decision that has been taken lightly, and we vow to return to Toronto bigger and better than ever before in 2021.""

Toronto has not played at home since Oct. 5, 2019, when it won promotion to the Super League with a 24-6 victory over Featherstone Rovers in the Million Pound Game before an announced sellout crowd of 9,974 – a Wolfpack record — at Lamport Stadium.

Rubbing salt in the wound, Toronto fans also woke up to the news Thursday that winger Liam Kay, the team's all-time leading scorer and first-ever player signing, had left to join Wakefield Trinity.

The Wolfpack, 0-6-0 in their first season in the top-tier Super League, have not played since March 11, when they blanked Huddersfield 18-0 in the fifth round of the Challenge Cup. Play was suspended five days later.

Super League features 12 teams — 10 in England, one in France and the Wolfpack.

Play resumes Aug. 2 in England with Toronto playing Hull Kingston Rovers as part of a tripleheader at Leeds Rhinos' Emerald Headingley Stadium. The rest of August sees weekend tripleheaders played over two days behind closed doors — initially at Headingley and St Helens' Totally Wicked Stadium.

""Today's fixtures announcement finally brings the 2020 season back to life,"" Super League executive chairman Robert Elstone said in a statement.

The schedule grows more crowded near the end of the season with Toronto playing its final six games over three weeks.

That's a concern given the physical nature of the sport. It's more of a worry for Toronto, which has a small squad and is facing a looming visa issue involving New Zealand star Sonny Bill Williams and six other imports.

Australia's Josh McCrone, Darcy Lussick and Blake Wallace, Australian-born Samoan international Ricky Leutele and New Zealand's Williams, Chase Stanley and Bodene Thompson have visas that allow for six months in England over a year.

That's not a problem when the Wolfpack are spending part of the season in Canada. But the global pandemic has kept the players in England and the visas are slated to expire at the end of the month.

Because the Wolfpack are Canadian-owned, they require different visas than overseas players employed by English clubs.

Super League said it will review dates and venues ""in the back end of the campaign ... in line with government advice and in discussion with our host broadcaster, Sky Sports.""

The hope is the teams can eventually host games with fans in their home market — with the exception of Toronto.

The playoffs, featuring the top four in the 12-team league, are scheduled for mid/late-November with the Grand Final scheduled for the end of November.

The championship game was originally slated for Oct. 10.

Super League said clubs will be back in training by the end of next week.

Under the original 2020 schedule, nine of Toronto's first 10 games were to be played in England with the other in France — with the late start due to the Canadian winter and the bubble over Lamport Stadium yet to come down. The Wolfpack were to play 11 of their last 19 games at home, with the season wrapping up Sept. 11.

Three other home games were to be played at neutral sites in England.

The Irish international is also one of only five players left from Toronto's inaugural 2017 squad to have taken part in the Wolfpack's rise from the third-tier League 1 to the elite Super League.

article continues below

With the Super League season set to resume Aug. 2 after a pandemic hiatus, Kay joins Wakefield initially on a loan agreement through the end of the season. He has signed a two-year deal covering the 2021 and 2022 campaigns.

Toronto has faced a salary cap crunch in recent times and is currently dealing with a visa issue that could leave New Zealand star Sonny Bill Williams and six other imports on the sidelines when the team resumes play next month in England.

Assigned the Wolfpack's heritage jersey No. 1 with the club, Kay is a pacey winger with a nose for the try-line. He scored 65 tries for Toronto, upping his career total to 159.

""While the fans will remember Liam for his incredible strike rate for games played and tries scored, everyone inside the Wolfpack bubble will also remember his commitment to the cause for the first-ever transatlantic professional sports team,"" Toronto coach Brian McDermott said in a statement.

""We all wish Liam well, and I'm sure I speak for everyone in expressing our gratitude to his efforts over the last four years.""

The move to Wakefield takes the 28-year-old Kay back to where he began his career in 2012. Kay has made more than 150 career appearances for Wakefield, Doncaster (on loan), Leigh Centurions and Toronto.

He was signed by Paul Rowley, Toronto's first coach, who had worked with him at Leigh.

Speaking in 2017, Kay said he committed to Toronto because Rowley ""sold this dream to me."" Several other former Leigh teammates also signed on.

""We kind of jumped into the unknown, when I didn't know what it was,"" said Kay, a native of Leeds. ""I have no regrets. I'm glad I did it.""

Kay made his mark in plenty of games.

He scored in the club's first-ever fixture, a 2017 pre-season friendly against Hull FC. He added two more tries in the Wolfpack's opening 2017 League 1 match against the London Skolars.

And he helped the Wolfpack earn promotion to the second-tier Championship by scoring in five of seven post-season fixtures in 2017.

Kay scored 27 tries that year, which remains a club record. Fellow winger Matty Russell tied the mark in 2019.

Kay opened the 2018 season with a three-try performance against Leigh before a left ankle injury ended his season prematurely. He was involved in a tackle in a game against Halifax when his studs caught in the mud and his ankle rolled the wrong way.

After the ankle did not respond to rehab, he had to undergo surgery that delayed his start to the 2019 campaign. He still finished with 12 tries, helping the team win promotion to the Super League.

This season, he wasted little time scoring Toronto's first-ever try in the top tier — chasing down a Hakim Miloudi kick to touch down in the corner three minutes into Toronto's opening game against Castleford.

Easy to spot with long locks that often did not stay totally in place during games, Kay was a fan favourite.

""I would just like to thank all the fans for your loyal commitment over the last four years, that's including Wolfpack fans in the U.K. and of course the ones in Canada,"" Kay said in a statement. ""It has been a privilege to represent you and I have cherished every moment of it.""

445,tricitynews,https://www.tricitynews.com/eric-akis-chicken-sandwich-japanese-style-1.24154475,"Eric Akis: Chicken sandwich, Japanese style",['Eric Akis'],,"Chicken katsu is a Japanese-style panko-coated piece of fried chicken that’s become a popular dish around the world. It’s easy to understand why — it’s crispy on the outside, juicy in the middle and served with a flavourful sauce (or two).

It’s essentially a breaded chicken cutlet that could be sliced and served with side dishes. But in recent years, it’s also become a very popular thing to stuff into a sandwich, what I did in today’s recipe.

article continues below

To make my sandwiches, large, boneless, skinless chicken thighs are pounded until fairly thin. They are coated in flour, dipped into a beaten egg mixture, then thickly coated with panko, coarse Japanese-style breadcrumbs.

In restaurants, the chicken katsu is often deep-fried once coated. But in my recipe, I opted to shallow-fry it in oil in a skillet until golden, crispy and cooked through.

Many recipes for chicken katsu sandwiches ask you to use a soft style of sliced white bread — something you can easily bite through to get to the flavourful chicken inside.

I instead chose to use a tender hamburger bun, which I find yields a more attractive-looking sandwich.

That said, you likely wouldn’t be looking at the sandwich long before devouring it. That’s because the chicken is flavoured with two addictive sauces. One is a fresh ginger-flavoured mayo that you spread on the cut sides of the buns.

The other is tonkatsu sauce, a kind of Japanese-style barbecue sauce that you drizzle on the chicken. You can buy that sauce at Japanese food stores and in the Asian-foods aisle of some grocery stores, but I made my own simple version.

You can coat the chicken and make the sauces many hours before cooking the chicken and making the sandwiches. Keep everything refrigerated until needed. You could also do the same with the cucumber and radish quick pickles I served with the sandwiches.

Chicken Katsu Sandwiches

Japanese-style chicken that’s crunchy on the outside and juicy in the middle stuffed into buns with two flavourful sauces and refreshing lettuce. The panko needed for the chicken is sold in grocery stores, often in the Asian-foods aisle.

Preparation time: 40 minutes

Cooking time: Six minutes

Makes: Four servings

For ginger mayo (see Eric’s options)

1/2 cup mayonnaise

1 tsp finely grated fresh ginger

2 tsp soy sauce

2 tsp rice or cider vinegar

1 tsp granulated sugar or honey, or to taste

1/2 tsp sesame oil

Combine ingredients in a small bowl. Cover and refrigerate until needed.

For tonkatsu sauce

3 Tbsp ketchup

1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce

1 tsp soy sauce

1/2 tsp granulated sugar or honey

Combine ingredients in a small bowl (see Eric’s options). Cover and refrigerate until needed.

For chicken katsu sandwiches

4 large boneless, skinless chicken thighs (about 325 to 350 grams)

• salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

2 large eggs

1/4 cup milk

1/3 cup all-purpose flour

1 3/4 cups panko

• vegetable oil, for frying

4 tender hamburger buns, split and warmed

1 cup shredded head or leaf lettuce, or to taste

Set a chicken thigh flat on a work surface, smooth-side-down. Cover with a double layer of plastic wrap. Using a kitchen hammer, pound chicken until it’s about 1/4-inch thick, then set on a plate (see Eric’s options). Pound the other chicken thighs this way. Season the chicken with salt and pepper.

Place eggs and milk in a bowl large enough to dunk the chicken in and beat to combine. Place flour and panko in separate wide plates. Set out a baking sheet to set the chicken on once coated.

Coat one chicken thigh in flour. Dip it in the egg mixture, evenly coating it. Coat chicken in panko, thickly pressing it on. Set coated chicken on the baking sheet. Coat the remaining chicken thighs in this fashion.

Preheat oven to 225 F. Set out a second large baking sheet. Pour 1/4 inch or so of oil into a large skillet set over medium, medium-high heat.

When oil is hot, add two of the chicken katsu to the skillet and cook about three minutes per side, until golden and cooked through. (Keep a close eye on the chicken and lower the heat if it overly darkens as it cooks.)

Drain chicken katsu on paper towel, then set on the second clean baking sheet.

Cook the other two chicken katsu as you did the first two and set them on the baking sheet. Put chicken into the oven to keep warm.

Spread the cut sides of each bun generously with the ginger mayo. Top each bottom bun with some shredded lettuce.

Remove chicken katsu from the oven and, at a slight angle, cut each one, widthwise, in half. Now set two half pieces of chicken katsu on each bottom bun. Drizzle chicken katsu with the tonkatsu sauce. Set on top buns and serve.

Eric’s options: For spicy tonkatsu sauce, add sriracha or other spicy chili sauce, to taste.

If you don’t have a kitchen hammer, try using the bottom of a heavy skillet or rolling pin to pound the chicken thighs.

Cucumber and Radish Quick Pickles

Easy and quick sweet and tangy pickles you can serve with the chicken katsu sandwiches.

Preparation time: 15 minutes, plus salting time

Cooking time: A few minutes

Makes: About 1 1/2 cups

3/4 cup water

3 Tbsp rice or cider vinegar

2 tsp granulated sugar

1 cup thinly sliced radishes (see Note)

1 cup thinly sliced mini English cucumbers

1 tsp salt

Place water, vinegar and sugar in a small pot. Bring to a simmer over medium heat for 30 seconds, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Remove from the heat and cool vinegar mixture to room temperature.

Meanwhile, place radishes and cucumber in a fine sieve. Sprinkle with the salt and toss to coat the vegetables. Set sieve over a bowl or sink and let stand at room temperature 30 minutes.

When the 30 minutes are up, rinse the vegetables with cold water, drain well, then pat dry with paper towel. Place the vegetables in a two-cup jar. Pour in the vinegar mixture. Push on the vegetables to submerge them. Cover and refrigerate pickle until ready to serve with the chicken katsu sandwiches.

Note: About two mini cucumbers and 10 radishes, depending on size, should yield the amounts needed here.

446,tricitynews,https://www.tricitynews.com/eric-akis-a-sheet-pan-dinner-with-in-season-spot-prawns-1.24150942,Eric Akis: A sheet-pan dinner with in-season spot prawns,['Eric Akis'],,"When it comes to seafood in B.C. we are spoiled. Halibut, salmon, albacore tuna, ling cod, crab, sablefish, oysters, clams and mussels are just some of the tasty choices we have and there’s much to celebrate about that.

But for many seafood lovers in this province, the party hits its peak when spot prawns are in season. This year’s fishery began in early June and according to Mike Atkins, Executive Director of Pacific Prawn Fishermen’s Association, will likely last four to six weeks.

article continues below

Although you can buy good quality frozen spot prawns year round, they really are at their best when ultra fresh. They have sweet tasting, almost buttery, succulent meat and part of their allure is that they are only available for a few weeks each year. So when you do have them you really appreciate their fine flavour and recognize what a treat they are.

Despite their name, spot prawns are the largest of the shrimp species commercially harvested off the B.C. coast. They are named after the distinctive white spots you’ll find on their tails.

You are most likely to find spot prawns for sale at stand-alone seafood stores and, occasionally, at some supermarkets, depending on availability. In some coastal locations you can also buy them direct from the fisher.

Depending on where you buy them, you’ll see fresh spot prawn tails with their heads removed, and whole live or recently live spot prawns for sale.

When buying spot prawn tails, choose bright-looking, firm tails that have few or no black spots and smell of the sea. It’s best to cook fresh spot-prawn tails the day you purchase them. But, if they are very fresh and you keep them well chilled on a bed of ice in the refrigerator, you could store them for one day or maybe two.

According to information on the Pacific Prawn Fishermen’s Association website, bcprawns.ca, when buying live spot prawns, look for lively, almost translucent specimens. The tail should be straight in line with the head, and the head should be firm to the touch.

When going out to buy live prawns, bring a cooler with ice in it to put them in for the ride home. Once home, refrigerate them until ready to cook.

Don’t leave live or recently live prawns for more than a few hours before cooking them or removing the heads. Spot prawns have an enzyme that will permeate into the tail and causes their quality to deteriorate quickly. You’ll know the prawns have started to deteriorate if the head is showing a black colour and is soft or mushy when touched, an unappealing quality the meat will also have.

If you need to store the prawns for more than a few hours, you can remove the heads by swiftly turning and pulling them away from the tails. After the heads are removed, the tails should be thoroughly rinsed and, as noted above, kept refrigerated until ready to cook.

Spot prawns can be prepared in ways similar to other large shrimp and prawns. I used them in an aromatic, colourful and tasty Cajun-style sheet pan dinner for two.

Spot Prawn Sheet Pan Dinner for Two

Here’s a nicely spiced, peel-and-eat, Cajun-style way to prepare B.C. spot prawns that sees them cooked on a sheet pan with bits of sausage, potatoes, onions and peppers. For a filling meal, serve with cornbread or corn on the cob.

Preparation time: 25 minutes

Cooking time: 23 to 27 minutes

Makes: two servings

8 to 10 B.C. nugget potatoes, halved

3 Tbsp olive oil

2 Tbsp lemon juice

1 large garlic clove, minced

1 1/2 tsp paprika

1 1/2 tsp oregano

1/2 tsp dried thyme

• freshly ground black pepper, to taste

1 tsp hot pepper sauce, such as Tabasco, or to taste

14 to 16 whole live spot prawns, or spot prawn tails (see Eric’s options)

1 cured (about 5-inch long) chorizo or other tasty sausage, sliced (see Note)

1/2 medium onion, sliced

1/2 medium red bell pepper, sliced

1/2 medium green bell pepper, sliced

• sea salt, to taste

• chopped fresh parsley, to taste

• lemon slices, for garnish

• remoulade sauce (optional, see recipe)

Boil potatoes until just tender, about eight to 10 minutes. Drain well, set on a large plate and cool to room temperature.

Preheat oven 400 F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper, unless it’s non-stick.

Combine oil, lemon juice, garlic, paprika, oregano, thyme, black pepper and hot pepper sauce in a large bowl. Add prawns, sausage, cooked potatoes, onions and bell peppers and use a spatula to toss and coat them with the oil mixture.

Set prawns, sausage and vegetables on the baking sheet, spreading them out so that they sit in a single layer. Drizzle any oil mixture left in the bowl over them and then sprinkle lightly with salt.

Roast the sheet pan dinner 15 to 17 minutes, or until the prawns are cooked and sizzling. Sprinkle with parsley, garnish with lemon slices and, if desired, serve with remoulade sauce.

Note: Ready-to-eat chorizo sausages are sold at supermarkets, butcher and charcuterie shops and European-style delis.

Eric’s options: The prawns used in today’s recipe came from Oak Bay Seafood (oakbayseafood.com). No matter where you shop, it’s best to call ahead to see if they are stocking spot prawns that day. When spot prawns are not available, simply use another type of wild prawn tail in this recipe.

Remoulade Sauce

Here’s a tangy southern-style sauce that you can dollop alongside the prawns and other items in the sheet pan dinner once plated.

Preparation time: five minutes

Cooking time: None

Makes: about 1/2 cup

1/3 cup mayonnaise

1 Tbsp finely chopped sweet mixed pickles or sweet green relish

2 tsp fresh lemon juice

1 tsp capers, finely chopped

1 tsp Dijon mustard

1 tsp chopped fresh parsley

• pinch dried tarragon and paprika

1/4 tsp hot pepper sauce, such as Tabasco, or to taste

Combine ingredients in a small bowl. Cover and refrigerate until needed for the sheet pan dinner.

He’s returned to the charts in 2020, working on songs for rising and established rap stars, including Lil Wayne, Juice WRLD, Saweetie and Doja Cat.

The songmaster, who has been entangled in a bitter lawsuit with former collaborator Kesha since 2014, has produced and co-written Saweetie’s new single ""Tap In,"" the follow-up to her double-platinum smash ""My Type."" Dr. Luke also co-wrote and co-produced Juice WRLD’s ""Wishing Well,"" taken from the rapper’s first posthumous album ""Legends Never Die,"" released last week.

article continues below

The recent successes mean all three major U.S. record label companies have worked with Dr. Luke this year, even if he hasn't always put his widely recognizable professional name to the new collaborations.

Dr. Luke marked a major comeback this year with the success of the Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hit ""Say So"" by rapper-singer Doja Cat, who is signed to Dr. Luke's Kemosabe Records. Dr. Luke, born Lukasz Sebastian Gottwald, produced several songs on Cat’s sophomore album ""Hot Pink,"" including single ""Like That,"" which is No. 5 on Billboard’s Hot R&B songs chart. He is the only producer with two songs in the Top 10 on the latter chart (""Say So"" sits at No. 2).

For his work with Cat, he used the alias Tyson Traxe. He used the same pseudonym for his production credit on Toronto rapper-singer Benny Mayne’s ""Hokey Pokey,"" released this year. For Lil Wayne’s ""Shimmy,"" a track featuring Cat on the deluxe edition of his latest album ""Funeral,"" Dr. Luke used the name Loctor Duke.

Label representatives for Saweetie, Juice WRLD, Lil Wayne and Cat didn’t immediately reply to emails seeking comment. Neither did a representative for Dr. Luke.

Luke has sprinkled his comeback among the major labels. Cat is signed to Sony Music’s RCA Records, while Saweetie is part of the Warner Music family. Lil Wayne releases music through his Young Money imprint and Republic Records, a division of Universal Music Group.

Before Dr. Luke topped the charts this year with ""Say So,"" he last had a No. 1 with Katy Perry's ""Dark Horse"" in 2014. Months later, Kesha accused him of sexual assault during their yearslong partnership (Dr. Luke has vigorously denied the allegations.)

A New York court dismissed Kesha’s sexual abuse-related claims in 2016 because of legal issues, without ruling on whether the allegations were true. Kesha lost another round in February, when a New York judge said she made a defamatory statement about Dr. Luke on a different occasion: a 2016 text message telling Gaga the producer had also raped Perry. Both he and Perry have denied it, and the judge said there was ""no evidence whatsoever"" to support the claim.

Kesha’s lawyers have said they plan to appeal the ruling, but it didn’t resolve other aspects of his defamation and breach-of-contract suit, including the crucial question of whether Kesha’s allegation that he raped her is true. The judge said that’s for a jury to decide at trial.

Outside of rap in 2020, Dr. Luke has produced music for pop singer Kim Petras, using the pseudonym MADE IN CHINA.",[]

Some critics online questioned whether the masked vigilante should be the primary focus after DC announced the sequel ""Rorschach"" on Wednesday. Others have slammed the decision to bring on Batman writer Tom King to write the 12-issue series, which will debut in October.

article continues below

King's approach to the Dark Knight's comic book story line he's written has been divisive. With ""Rorschach,"" he said the new series will take a compelling look at politics similar to that of HBO’s ""Watchmen"" and the original comic in 1986. The comic will also be worked on by artist Jorge Fornés, colorist Dave Stewart and letterer Clayton Cowles.

The HBO series earned acclaim for delivering a story about race relations in America. But some are concerned about whether the story about the anti-hero Rorschach, who wears a trenchcoat, fedora and white mask with morphing inkblots, will be as relevant today.

King believes it will be.

""This is a very political work."" he said in a statement. ""It’s an angry work. We’re so angry all the time now. We have to do something with that anger. It’s called ‘Rorschach’ not because of the character Rorschach, but because what you see in these characters tells you more about yourself than about them.""

The sequel is set 35 years after the ""Watchmen"" comic series when Dr. Manhattan turned Rorschach into dust.

A plot summary released on DC's website asks: ""So what does it mean when Rorschach reappears as part of a pair of assassins trying to kill the first candidate to oppose President Robert Redford in decades? Follow one determined detective as he walks backward in time, uncovering the identities and motives of the would-be killers, taking him deep into a dark conspiracy of alien invasions, disgraced do-gooders, mystical visions, and yes, comic books.""",[]

A representative for West filed the necessary paperwork and paid the $35,000 filing Wednesday afternoon, which was the deadline for a spot on the state's Nov. 3 presidential ballot, said Oklahoma Board of Elections spokeswoman Misha Mohr. He was one of three independent presidential candidates to pay the filing fee prior to the deadline, she added. The others were concert pianist Jade Simmons and cryptocurrency entrepreneur Brock Pierce.

The filing came a day after New York Magazine's ""Intelligencer"" quoted West adviser Steve Kramer saying ""he's out"" and noting that the staff he had hired were disappointed.

However, TMZ reported that the West campaign had filed a ""Statement of Organization"" Wednesday with the Federal Election Commission, stating that a Kanye 2020 committee would serve as principal campaign committee for a West candidacy.

West has already missed the deadline to qualify for the ballot in several states, and it’s unclear if he is willing or able to collect enough signatures required to qualify in others.

West, who is married to reality television star Kim Kardashian West, initially announced his candidacy on July 4. Days later, he told Forbes magazine that he, who once praised President Donald Trump and said the two share ""dragon energy,"" was ""taking the red hat off"" — a reference to Trump’s trademark red ""Make America Great Again"" cap.

Perhaps grab your binoculars or camera and head for Colony Farm Regional Park at the southern end of the city, which is known as one of the best destinations for birdwatching in Metro Vancouver.

Or go down to Town Centre Park for one of the several colourful festivals and sports tournaments just steps from the SkyTrain and walking distance from an array of businesses and fine restaurants.

“It’s our biggest signature park where people can fish, play outdoor foosball, table tennis, or take part in Tai Chi,” Kalnins said. “And it’s five minutes from city centre, Coquitlam Centre and SkyTrain that will get you to the other side of Coquitlam.”

“I like to tell people to connect the dots,” Kalnins said, adding many activity destinations in Coquitlam are located close to an array of other services.

For those seeking indoor pursuits and don’t mind getting wet, the City Centre Aquatic Complex has a wave pool, a water slide, a lazy river and an eight-lane, Olympic-sized pool.

Financial Services Authority (BCFSA) said June 16.

“The current state of the strata insurance market is unhealthy,” said authority vice-president and deputy superintendent for regulation Frank Chong.

Minister of Finance Carole James said rising condo and apartment building costs are serious issues for thousands of British Columbians.

“This is especially true with many people facing additional financial pressure related to the COVID-19 pandemic,” she said. “We knew this was a complex issue, and now we have a clearer picture of the different local, national and global factors affecting cost and availability within the insurance market.”

Among key report findings, based on a survey of 6,000 strata and townhouse properties, are:

• an average increase of 40% year-over-year to strata insurance premiums province-wide;

• a 50% increase in Metro Vancouver;

• 54% of strata properties experienced a premium increase of less than 30% compared to premiums the previous year;

• 31% of strata properties saw increases in the 30-50 % range;

• 9% faced year-over-year increases of 50 -100%; and

• 6% saw increases in excess of 100% compared to the previous year.

“Price pressures will continue,” the authority said in the report to James. “Buildings considered to be higher risk are expected to face the most significant increases as well as the possibility of not being able to obtain full, or in rare cases any, insurance coverage.""

The data is in an interim report done at the direction of the provincial government. Further findings will be released in the fall after continued stakeholder consultations, Chong said.

The authority regulates the province’s insurance industry, among other things.

CEO Blair Morrison said the market is failing to meet goals of sustainability, affordability and availability.

“Despite large increases already being felt, the situation has not yet stabilized, meaning many stratas, particularly those in buildings considered to be higher risk by insurers, can expect to face further pricing pressures as well as the risk of not being able to obtain full strata property insurance coverage,” Morrison said.

The industry generates about $300 million in premiums, covering more than $100 billion of insured property value. Coverage is mandatory under B.C.’s Strata Property Act, the authority told James.

Insurance under the act, which must provide full replacement value of the common strata property and assets, does not cover individual unit insurance, which owners need to ensure under individual policies.

The authority said earthquake coverage is not required under the act, but it is often included in strata property coverage.

“Strata corporations that choose not to purchase earthquake coverage are still covered for fire damage following an earthquake,” the authority told James. “An estimated 1.5 million residents live in strata properties in BC and properties can range from under $1 million to over $200 million in insured value.”

The investigation found evidence showing the industry has been incurring losses over the past three years from mostly minor claims, particularly from water damage, due to poor building maintenance.

“The data suggests that strata insurance has also been used to fill in the gaps left by other forms of protection such as home warranties for new buildings and maintenance programs for older buildings,” the authority said.

Further complicating things is the exposure to risk insurers have to earthquake damages in B.C. which has prompted many to reduce the amount of insurance they offer, the study found.

“With this reduction in capacity comes upward price pressures,” the authority said.

“It’s clear there is no quick fix for this problem,” James said. “It’s important to recognize that the dynamics driving these increases are playing out in the private insurance industry – government does not set insurance rates or regulate pricing.”

She said the government is reviewing the report and will be bringing in legislation this summer as a first step to help tackle this problem, while the authority continues its engagement with the sector.

While legislation details won’t be released before being introduced in the Legislature, Liberal Party Opposition Leader Andrew Wilkinson has called on James to take action.

“Skyrocketing strata insurance costs represent one more unexpected hit to the wallets of British Columbians, with a growing number truly at risk of losing their homes. Action by your government is needed now,” Wilkinson said in a June 16 letter to James.

Wilkinson suggested the following actions be taken:

• implementation of a temporary tax holiday on the 4.4% Insurance Premium Tax applicable on strata property to leave money in the pockets of strata owners;

• Extension on a temporary basis the Property Tax Deferment Program to enable strata owners facing extraordinary additional expenses to defer a portion of their property taxes;

• changes to Strata Property Act and regulations that ensure annual contributions are made to a strata corporation’s consolidated revenue fund at levels acceptable considering a building’s age, claims history and other unique circumstances;

• require strata corporations to have a depreciation report detailing necessary maintenance every year;

• require a strata corporation to inform owners and tenants of any material change in insurance coverage, including an increase in any deductible, as soon as feasible;

• develop a mandatory education and training program for strata council members, with particular emphasis on risk mitigation;

• review the B.C. Building Code and implement new requirements focused on the prevention and severity of water damage events, and;

• require the B.C. Financial Services Authority to make public the data and information it is gathering from insurance companies to better understand the current climate of rapidly rising strata insurance.

Condominium Home Owners' Association of B.C. CEO Tony Gioventu in March warned that uninsured condo owners could find themselves bankrupt and homeless if they didn’t maintain suites and personal insurance as strata insurance costs skyrocket.

Birds Nest Properties handles condo and townhouse rentals in Vancouver, Burnaby and Richmond. Director Alvin Cheung said the situation is putting pressures on both strata corporations and individual owners.

Cheung said some buildings have seen deductibles rise from $250,000 to $750,000, situations that have led to special levies for unit owners.

“What if all the owners can’t pay the special levy? What happens then?” he asked.

That could lead to cases of buildings not triggering their insurance leaving owners to pay for repairs or upkeep just not being done.

“It would be a neglected building,” he said.

And that could cause future insurance coverage problems, he agreed.

As well, Cheung said, landlords have seen their landlord insurance premiums leap, in some cases from $500 to $4,000 a year.

And for many in the Greater Vancouver area, that means buying their dream home. There’s no need to extoll the virtues of living in our beautiful region. It’s the perfect mix of city and nature, meaning there’s something for everyone.

Owning a home in one of the many cities across our region is something many strive for. Whether you’ve just moved to the area, are starting a family or downsizing because of a newly empty nest, you might be feeling overwhelmed by the variety of homes in markets across the region. Old or new, apartment or detached house – the options seem endless.

article continues below

A new development is an opportunity for more than just getting into the real estate game. Often, new apartment and townhouse complexes are being built with more than housing in mind – in many cases there’s also a community focus. In addition, on many occasions new owners have the opportunity to add bespoke touches. Some developers offer different floorplans or let you choose unique finishes.

Although there’s much to be said about buying a new development as an investment – the real investment is in your future. A home where you can create new memories, a place you can fill with friends and family, and feel a sense of comfort every time you walk in the door.

But it seems like every other block has a new apartment or townhouse complex being built. How can you find one that combines quality and integrity with the lifestyle and community you’re looking for?

Glacier Media Real Estate has curated this Showcase of New Homes. Here you can explore new developments in several growing communities across the area. Each development will be part of a vibrant community. Find the one that aligns with yours.",[]

At least for one local developer.

Most of the centres that also serve as model homes to give prospective buyers a sense of what their new home might look like are closed because of the public health emergency, so developers are discovering new ways to engage customers.

For Kush Panatch, whose scheduled launch of pre-sales for the second phase of his 50 Electronic Avenue project in Port Moody was derailed by the pandemic, the rejig to the traditional way of selling condos has led to some startling revelations. Like questioning the value of spending up to $1 million to design, build and furnish a sales centre for every project

Panatch said that as soon as the B.C. government ordered a shutdown of all non-essential businesses, his sales team created a video walk-through of the model one- and two-bedroom homes that it was able to post to the project’s website. They also set up an online chat service to answer questions from virtual visitors and made arrangements for the processing of digital sales contracts.

Panatch said using virtual sales tools has been a challenge.

“None of us had a playbook for this,” he said. “This is a business you have to touch and feel.”

Not that giving clients the chance to open and close cupboard doors and peer into closets is totally out of the question. Panatch and marketers for several other projects in the Tri-Cities, like Beedie Living’s The Heights project in Coquitlam and Onni’s The Grande in Port Moody, are opening their sales centres to exclusive pre-arranged appointments so interested clients can walk through the show homes and sign documents.

Panatch said the extra effort has slowed the process, though.

“It’s taking longer,” he said. “There’s a lot of exchanging information. You have to go into detail about every little thing.”

The upside is once buyers get to that intense inquiry stage, they’re usually motivated to see their interest through to an actual purchase, Panatch said, adding it’s not unusual for less than 5% of visitors to a sales centre being converted into buyers.

“You’re not getting many looky-loos. They’re pretty serious about buying a home in the current environment.”

The depth of information and virtual experience a developer is able to offer online is also opening marketing opportunities further afield.

“People are willing to do a lot more stuff online and distant,” Panatch said. “Not everything has to be done in person.”

Which has him questioning the value of spending so much money on a full-size sales centre near every project when he could build a modular centre at a central location that could be repurposed and reconfigured as various projects evolve.

“When adversity hits you, you have to be willing to learn and ready to pivot,” Panatch said.",[]

They were also 63% lower than the 10-year sales average for the month - a direct result, said the board, of social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

article continues below

“Predictably, the number of home sales and listings declined in April given the physical distancing measures in place,” Colette Gerber, REBGV’s president-elect said. “People are, however, adapting.”

According to Gerber, this adaptation is coming in the form of “using different technology to showcase homes virtually, assess neighbourhood amenities with their clients and handle paperwork electronically.”

Across the region, 1,109 homes changed hands last month. This is a 39.4% drop year-over-year and a 56.1% decline compared with March 2020.

The number of new listings for all residential property types was 2,313 in April, which is a 59.7% drop compared with April 2019 and a 47.9% decline compared with March 2020, when 4.436 homes were listed.

The benchmark price for all homes across the region is $1,036,000, which is 2.5% higher than it was one year prior.

“Home prices have held relatively steady in our region since the COVID-19 situation worsened in March,” Gerber said.

A total of 388 detached homes sold in April, which is 33.8% lower than the 586 homes of this type sold in April 2019. The benchmark price for detached homes is $1,462,100 - up 2.3% year-over-year.

In April 2020, 503 apartments were sold, which is 43.2% lower than the 885 homes sold in the same month last year. The benchmark price for apartments is $685,500, up 2.7% from April 2019.

For attached homes, sales reached 218 - a 39.1% decline year-over-year. The benchmark price was $796,800 - up 2.8% compared with the same month last year.

REBGV data includes sales and prices for Vancouver, West Vancouver, North Vancouver, Burnaby, New Westminster, Coquitlam, Port Coquitlam, Richmond, Port Moody, the Sunshine Coast, Whistler, Squamish, Pitt Meadows, Maple Ridge and South Delta. It does not include Langley or Surrey.

Kathleen Vincent, Coquitlam’s manager of corporate communications, said in an email that while most trail users are following the rules, “we recognize that some people are still not getting the message about the need to maintain physical distance from others, and to limit the size of their group to two to three people from their immediate household.”

Last month, the city announced that it would be implementing one-way traffic on the Crunch — going up the east staircase and down west staircase — to give trail users more space. Signs are in place to remind people to keep their distance, with city staff stationed along the path from 8 a.m. to dusk.

“Since implementing the unidirectional flow and installing signage, the city has been encouraged to see those on the Coquitlam Crunch trail taking the necessary precautions,” the city said in a statement. “However, the situation is being monitored and the city is prepared to close its trails if users don’t use the trail responsibly.”

However, the vast majority of those transactions were in the first half of the month, and many of those deals reflect pre-pandemic buying activity, due to the reporting lag.

“The first two weeks of the month were the busiest days of the year for our region, with heightened demand and multiple offers becoming more common,” said Ashley Smith, REBGV president. “Like other aspects of our lives, this changed as concerns over the COVID-19 situation in our province grew.”

REBGV said April 2 that residential sales on the region’s MLS averaged 138 per day during the first ten business days of March, and 93 during the final ten business days of the month.

“Many of the sales recorded in March were in process before the provincial government declared a state of emergency. We’ll need more time to pass to fully understand the impact that the pandemic is having on the housing market,” Smith added.

Kevin Skipworth, a realtor with Dexter Realty, said, “This month’s numbers for Greater Vancouver are a tale of what could have been, not so much what will be… There is a time lag between when the contract is written and when it is reported. A degree of [March’s] activity came from transactions that were initiated prior to the increased attention to COVID-19.”

Cameron McNeill, partner and executive director at real estate marketing firm MLA, predicted that the market would see a hiatus until the pandemic is over, but then would rebound later. “While it is too soon to determine the real effects COVID-19 will have on the Greater Vancouver real estate market, we certainly expect significantly slower sales volumes in historically active spring months ahead. The speed and timing of recovery is uncertain, but long-term housing demand for the region will likely be heightened by Canada’s COVID-19 response, and supply constraints.”

Sellers still listing

Despite the pandemic, sellers continued to list their homes in March. There were 4,436 homes listed for sale in Metro Vancouver in March, which is 10.4 per cent lower than March 2019 but a 10.8 per cent increase compared with February 2020 this year, reported the board.

“I was surprised at the number of new listings,” said Skipworth. “It dropped off in the last week of the month but people are still coming to market. Perhaps some people who had been planning on selling decided to do so before the situation gets any worse. We’re also seeing some listing cancellations and re-lists of those properties, so that accounts for some of the new listings.”

With overall sales increasing more than new listings, the sales-to-active listings ratio for March 2020 increased to 26.3 per cent. By property type, the ratio is 21.1 per cent for detached homes, 33 per cent for townhomes, and 28.9 per cent for apartments. These figures indicate a seller’s market, which is defined as more than 20 per cent for a sustained period.

Prices and property types

Home prices in the region also increased again last month. The composite benchmark price for all property types combined in Metro Vancouver is currently $1,033,700. This is a 2.1 per cent increase over March 2019, and a 1.3 per cent rise over February 2020.

Story continues below

Sales of detached homes in March 2020 reached 852, a leap of 61.1 per cent over the 529 detached sales recorded in March 2019. The benchmark price for single-family properties is $1,450,700, which is 0.7 per cent higher than March 2019, and a 1.2 per cent increase compared with February 2020.

March saw 493 attached homes trade hands, which is a 51.7 per cent jump compared with the 325 sales in March 2019. The attached-home benchmark price is now pegged at $791,800, a 2.5 per cent rise from March 2019, and a 0.9 per cent uptick compared with February.

Condo transactions hit 1,179 in March 2020, a 35.1 per cent increase over the 873 sales in March 2019. The benchmark price of an apartment property now stands at $687,000, which is 2.9 per cent higher than in March 2019, and a 1.4 per cent month-over-month rise.

One question mark is whether the no-eviction rule applies retroactively to tenants in recently purchased homes, where the new owner intends to occupy the property, or whether existing eviction notices served before the announcement have been grandfathered in.

article continues below

Now, a leading real estate lawyer in Vancouver has offered clarification on this issue, following advice he received directly from the B.C. government.

Richard Bell of Bell Alliance told Glacier Media Real Estate on Monday, “Up until today [March 30], if an eviction notice has already been given to the tenants to vacate because the buyers are to take possession, that eviction still stands. However, any new home purchase contract, from today onwards, you will not be able to evict the tenant, under any section of the legislation.”

He added, “That was a big concern for us, as we [at Bell Alliance] are working on lots of purchase contracts where the notice of eviction for tenants had already been given. Those purchases can now go ahead.”

However, the eviction ban may significantly affect sales of currently tenanted homes, now that any new buyers wouldn’t be permitted to evict sitting tenants from March 30 onwards, until the ban is lifted.",[]
462,tricitynews,https://www.tricitynews.com/real-estate/buyers-can-t-get-out-of-home-purchase-contracts-because-of-covid-19-1.24109720,Buyers can’t get out of home purchase contracts because of COVID-19,['Joannah Connolly'],,"If you’re in the process of buying a home but have lost income due to COVID-19, don’t assume that you’ll be able to get out of your signed purchase contract, a leading real estate lawyer has warned.

Home buyers who have paid their deposit and signed a purchase contract, who may now want to get out of the purchase since the pandemic hit, do not have a standard “Force majeure” or “Act of God” clause that will let them walk away, said Richard Bell of Bell Alliance in Vancouver. Such a clause would need to have been specifically written into the purchase contract to be applicable, which is unlikely, he said.

article continues below

What’s more, if the buyer walks away from a purchase contract, even if they have lost their job and can no longer afford the home, they could be liable for much more than simply losing their deposit.

“If a buyer loses their job – well, that could happen any time,” Bell told Glacier Media Real Estate March 30. “If they can’t complete the deal, they become liable for at least the deposit. But there could be a further, knock-on liability, if the seller then resells for less than the original amount. The buyer who caused the original deal to collapse could also be liable for the difference.”

Bell added, “Then the question becomes, if the collapse of the original deal causes a series of deals in a chain to collapse, how remote is the original buyer’s liability? How many links in that chain is the buyer liable for? That’s when you get into a legal battle.”

A purchase contract can, however, be rendered void under the doctrine of “frustration” whereby the deal can’t go ahead and collapses under extraordinary circumstances, through no fault of either party. However, this requires the explicit agreement of both parties to the contract, explained Bell.

For example, a buyer may not want to go ahead with a home purchase due to lost income, and the vendor may equally not want to sell anymore because they can no longer afford to upsize, also due to lost income. Under such circumstances, the buyer and seller can come to an agreement whereby the contract is cancelled and the buyer’s deposit returned.

Cold feet a symptom of COVID-19

Vancouver realtor Kevin Skipworth of Dexter Realty is seeing a lot of nervousness among buyers who have signed purchase contracts. He told Glacier Media Real Estate March 31 that he had one buyer with cold feet because of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated concerns about the economy, but after discussion with their conveyancing lawyers, the deal finally went ahead.

“There’s really nothing in the contract that allows for a buyer to walk away from a transaction because of the virus pandemic, but that doesn’t stop anybody from trying. For us as realtors, it’s not our place to try to negotiate out of a contract, that’s where legal advice is the first place to go.

He agrees with Bell that there can be much pricier ramifications than merely a lost deposit. “Everybody seems to think you can walk away and just lose your deposit and that will be fine, but that’s not the case. Sellers can go after you for damages, and more.”

Bell said he is seeing some collapsed home purchases at his law firm, but this is not currently his key concern in terms of real estate conveyancing. He pointed to rules of social distancing and quarantining making it virtually impossible to comply with legal requirements that home buyers and mortgage consumers be present in person to sign contracts, along with their government ID.

“It’s a major roadblock to closing home purchases right now,” said Bell. “Different lenders require different things. But some are literally requiring that we go round to quarantined clients’ homes and have them show their ID to us through the window. It’s ridiculous. Hopefully it will change before long, so we can do it by video. We’re trying to get this up the chain of command.”

‘Force majeure’ in construction

One sector that may have some luck in claiming “force majeure” when failing to complete a contract due to COVID-19 is the construction industry, where sites have had to close due to the outbreak – depending on such a clause being in the contract.

Whether or not a judge under Canadian common law would grant “force majeure” varies greatly from case to case, said Sahil Shoor, a Waterloo, Ontario-based civil litigator for Gowling WLG, in a legal bulletin to the construction sector on March 20.

That is because while some contracts include “force majeure” clauses that clearly states diseases, plagues, epidemics or quarantine restrictions as applicable conditions (beyond the typical “acts of God” events such as natural disasters, fires, floods and wars), other make no such distinctions. Some other contracts yet, Shoor said, may not have a “force majeure” clause at all, further complicating the issue in court.

“In order to successfully rely on a force majeure clause, the relying party [contractor] has the burden of establishing Force Majeure Event and proving that the Force Majeure Event has effectively prevented the party from fulfilling its obligations under the construction contract,” Shoor said in the bulletin, adding the court will assess the merits of the case based on whether the COVIC-19 outbreak qualifies as a force majeure, whether the risk of not being able to complete the contract was “foreseeable and able to be mitigated,” as well was whether it was really impossible to complete the contract.

In cases where there is no clear description of an epidemic or disease as force majeure, a judge will often hinge decisions on the availability of an “alternative method of performance” – even if the alternative is significantly more expensive for the contractor applying for relief.

“As an example, are the party’s employees ill due to the virus and unable to work, or simply afraid to work and choosing not to attend?” Shoor said, adding that cases without a force majeure clause will follow similar lines of legal logic under the doctrine of frustration.

This is the third 50-basis-point cut this month as the bank does what it can to ease the cost of borrowing during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

The unscheduled rate decision brings the bank’s policy interest rate down to 0.25 per cent. At 0.75 per cent, it was the highest such rate among the central banks of G7 countries.

On Friday, Canada’s central bank also announced two new programs to bring greater liquidity to Canadian markets: the Commercial Paper Purchase Program (CPPP), and a quantitative easing program.

Under the latter, the bank will purchase a minimum of $5 billion in Government of Canada securities per week, starting April 1. The program will continue until Canada’s economic recovery is “well underway.”

Over the next 12 months, the CPPP will see the bank undertake primary and secondary market purchases of commercial paper issued by Canadian firms, municipalities and provincial agencies that have an outstanding commercial paper program. Poloz said the program will “help to restore a key source of short-term funding for businesses.”

“The intent of our decision today is two-fold: to immediately support the financial system so it keeps on providing credit, and, over the longer term, to lay the foundation for the economy’s return to normalcy,” Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz said in an opening statement to media.

Although existing variable-rate mortgage holders will enjoy additional discounts from the BoC's new rate, whether or not the cuts will be passed on to new mortgage consumers remains to be seen. Thus far, despite two previous recent rate reductions of 50 basis points each, mortgage rates for new customers have been rising, not falling.

“This is a very uncertain time for banks and lenders, just as it is for consumers,” said Alex Conconi, CEO of Lendesk. “While the normal consequence of a Bank of Canada prime rate cut is to pass that on to borrowers, at the end of the day, banks control their own prime rate and it cannot be taken for granted amid COVID-19. Moreover, until recently, it wasn’t unusual to see variable rates that were prime minus something: now that has all but evaporated, and we’re seeing prime plus a spread. The consequence is that the banks are able to shore up some margin, which may be necessary if they are to take losses in other parts of their business. Meanwhile, consumers aren’t necessarily paying any less than they would have been paying a few months ago.”

Tenant advocates are openly wondering if it even makes sense to pay rent.

In a response to the COVID-19 crisis, the March 25 announcement by the provincial government will end virtually all rental evictions – including those currently in process – freeze rental increases, and pay $500 direct to landlords to help tenants battling job and income losses over the next three months.

""This is not the time to seek rent increases and there is just zero per cent chance of that happening,"" said Premier John Horgan. “Landlords will be prevented from legally raising rents starting April 1. Increases slated to take effect on April 1 will no longer be applied.”

Despite the good intentions, many say the unprecedented program is wide open to abuse. This is apparently recognized by the provincial government whose models concede that 100 per cent of B.C.’s 500,000 renters could theoretically qualify for assistance.

The new rental supplement is in addition to federal and provincial programs announced to offer financial aid to those who lose income due to the health crisis.

Mark Goodman, a multi-family real estate specialist with Goodman Commercial Inc. Vancouver, estimates B.C.'s rental aid package could add up to more than $1 billion over the next three months, but argued it is landlords who could end up paying the most. The $500 paid directly to the landlord will not compensate for losses from the rental increase freeze, Goodman said.

This is particularly evident in Metro Vancouver, he said, where the average rent is now $2,351, according to Rentals.ca.

While the $500 payment direct to landlords is welcome, David Hutniak, CEO of LandlordBC, said that, with no potential for evictions, landlords have little protection if a tenant refuses to pay the balance owing.

“This is wide open to potential abuse,” Hutniak said. He added he hoped common decency would keep abuses in check.

“Two-thirds of landlords in Metro Vancouver are mom-and-pop situations,” Hutniak said, which includes people renting out a basement suite or a condominium to help cover the highest mortgages cost in the country. These owners are also struggling during the current crisis, Hutniak said.

According to a December 2019 survey by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp., there are 67,000 rental condos in Metro Vancouver.

Hutniak also noted a naivety in the potential of landlords qualifying for a mortgage payment deferral. Premier Horgan encouraged banks to provide this, but Hutniak doubts most landlords would qualify or could afford such a deferral.“We have heard advocates speak about landlords getting mortgage deferrals so they can 'pass those savings onto renters.' But a mortgage deferral by a bank does not constitute any savings to the landlord. It has to be paid back with compound interest on the deferred amount. In other words, interest upon interest,""Hutniak explained. Any deferred amount is added to the mortgage principal, whereas a landlord doesn’t have any security for deferred rent from a tenant, he noted, or from the loss of legal rent increases.

Angela Calla, mortgage broker with Dominion Lending Centres, said landlords are unlikely to get approved for a deferral from some mortgage lenders, even if their tenants can’t pay rent due to lost income. “Deferrals are not being approved on rentals at this time,” she said on March 25. “If/when they are, it will come with additional costs for the landlord, once determined.” However, she updated this information March 26 with the news that Scotiabank is now allowing deferrals regardless of occupancy, and other banks may follow suit.

""It is the government’s expectation that all renters, including those renters impacted by the COVID-19 crisis, who have the capacity to pay rent do the responsible thing and pay their rent,” Hutniak added.

But the Vancouver Tenants Union noted that Premier Horgan conceded he could not guarantee that any rental aid will actually be paid by April 1, when the next rent is due.

“Every person should think towards the future, see where they are going to be in a few months and decide if it makes sense to pay rent,” said Mazdak Gharibnavaz, a steering committee member of the Vancouver Tenants Union, in a March 25 interview on CiTR 101.9 FM’s station at the University of British Columbia.",[]

But with phone lines jammed, and websites unable to process applications that are assessed on a case-by-case basis, many homeowners looking for a deferral or seeking answers have had little success.

Confusion reigns over what makes a homeowner eligible for an emergency deferral, how the program works, whether interest is payable and whether deferring payments will affect credit scores. Unfortunately, with the situation changing on a daily basis, and lenders forced to make up rules as they go, it has been impossible for most people to get any information.

To clear up some of these issues, Glacier Media Real Estate spoke with five mortgage experts who offered their insights and advice on some frequently asked questions.

Would deferring my mortgage payments damage my credit score?

As long as the proper arrangements are made in advance, your credit score should not be affected. Atrina Kouroshnia, mortgage broker with Dominion Lending Centres, says, “I don't think deferring payments will have the same impact as [it did] before, as it's a global [pandemic] and, especially if your job is affected, you are making a proactive choice.”

Peter Kinch, best-selling author and award-winning mortgage broker, agrees, “I do not see a situation wherein this will have any impact on your credit score.”

The number-one most important thing? Never assume that you’ll be able to get the deferral and simply not pay your mortgage when it’s due, as this will damage your credit score. “The worst thing would be to just skip your payments,” warns Kouroshnia.

Angela Calla, also with Dominion Lending Centres, cautions, “If you miss the payment without an agreement or your lender does not approve you, it can impact your credit score and could significantly increase your cost of borrowing at renewal. Each borrower should confirm with the lender before they agree to the deferral.”

How can I get through to my lender?

For those trying to make such arrangements but having trouble getting through, Calla says it’s important to give the banks time. “Unless you have a payment due in the next five days [that you can’t pay], they ask that you delay calling at this time [due to overwhelming call volumes]. Email is preferred, or some lenders have portals they have created to assist with this. Look at your lender’s website for updates.”

Alisa Aragon, also with Dominion Lending Centres, recommends speaking first to your mortgage broker, if you have one. “Lenders are experiencing an overwhelming amount of calls and it is very hard to get through. If people have questions, it is best that they talk to their mortgage expert, as we are getting information from most lenders and we might be able to answer their questions faster.”

Should I apply, and would I be approved, for a deferral?

Once you’ve managed to get through to your lender, you’ll likely only be approved for a payment deferral if you’ve lost income due to the COVID-19 pandemic, say the brokers.

If you’re still working and can afford your mortgage, don’t attempt to get a deferral. Not only will you likely be wasting your time and that of the overstretched lenders, the program should only be used as an emergency last resort. That’s because deferring payments will cost you more money in the long term (see “How would a mortgage payment deferral work?” below).

Only those truly unable to pay their mortgage right now, due to lost income from the pandemic, should apply. “The deferral program is really for homeowners that are experiencing financial hardship due to the COVID-19 virus,” says Aragon. “If you are still employed and earning an income, then lenders will not be assisting those borrowers at this time. This program is for people that really need it.”

For those who feel they meet the requirements, it’s worth applying, and each application will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. “It also depends on the lender,” adds Aragon. “Each lender has its own requirements on what has to be provided.”

Landlords may not get approved for a deferral with some banks, even if their tenants can’t pay rent due to lost income, according to Calla. “Deferrals are not being approved on rentals at this time [March 25],” she says. “If/when they are, it will come with additional costs for the landlord, once determined.” However, Calla has an update of this information as of March 26, with the news that Scotiabank is now allowing deferrals regardless of occupancy, and other banks may follow suit.

One relief for landlords is that tenants unable to pay rent due to lost income can now apply for the new $500-a-month rent supplement, to be paid directly to their landlord via BC Housing, which was announced March 25. However, the accompanying temporary ban on evictions may mean leave landlords without options if tenants don't pay their rent at all.

If I were approved, how would a mortgage payment deferral work?

Make no mistake, a mortgage payment deferral is an emergency, temporary measure that will cost you more in the long term, caution the brokers. What’s more, the longer you defer payments, the more it will cost you, as interest will be payable at your contract rate during the deferral period, and will add up.

Kinch explains, “Your principal and interest payments do not have to be made for a period of [up to] six months. However, the banks will accrue your monthly interest payments and add that amount onto your current mortgage balance. As such, after the six-month deferral period, you will have a larger mortgage balance and your monthly payment will be adjusted accordingly to compensate. So you end up with a cash-flow break today, but you’ll have to make up for it in six months. To be clear – this is a ‘deferral’ not a ‘loan holiday’.”

Kinch’s colleague Jonathan Barlow adds, “Every lender will be different in how they manage it. Ones with deep pockets may allow for the deferral to continue until renewal, when they simply renew with the higher balance. Others may structure a repayment plan. Again, this is untrodden ground for the lenders, so they will all approach it differently.”

Calla says, “You are responsible to pay the deferral [interest] taken on the remaining payments on the term with most lenders. This is why it’s approved only for those who can’t make a payment due to not having the financial means. Everyone’s amounts per month and total interest cost will be different based on mortgage amount, rate and term remaining.”

What if my mortgage is with a monoline lender?

The Big Six Canadian banks, plus some credit unions such as Vancity, have been vocal about offering their mortgage payment deferral programs to those in need. But many Canadian homeowners have their mortgages with alternative specialist mortgage lenders, also known as monoline lenders. So are they offering the same payment deferral program?

Barlow says, “Monolines are supporting the deferral program as well, but because they are single service providers (mortgages only), their monetary base is much smaller. So they will be much more strategic about who they offer it to. They’ll certainly ask more questions, but you’ll likely get a much better plan and collaboration from them.”

As with all mortgage types, for more information about deferring payments, go to your lender’s website and talk to your mortgage broker before braving the long hold times on the customer service lines.",[]

Premier John Horgan announced Wednesday that B.C. will also freeze rent increases and evictions until the current crisis has passed, with some exceptions to the latter.

“This is not the time to seek rent increases and there is just zero per cent of that happening,” he said. Landlords will be prevented from legally raising rents starting April 1. Increases slated to take effect on April 1 will no longer be applied.

Horgan said the province is assuming its rental supplement will see 100 per cent pick-up, and that the province is then “working back from there” on the understanding that not everyone will need it. He added that there are around 500,000 tenant households in the province.

“[Uptake] will depend on the depth of the pandemic and the time it will take us to recover,” Horgan said.

The additional rental assistance program will be delivered through BC Housing. Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing Selina Robinson confirmed that the funds are intended to help pay the rent of low- and middle-income renters who have seen a “significant reduction” in income directly related to the spread of COVID-19, such as reduced hours or layoffs.

The supplement will be paid directly to landlords.

Robinson added that the province is granting landlords the power to regulate the use of multi-purpose and amenity spaces to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Existing eviction orders with B.C.’s Residential Tenancy Branch have been halted.

With few exceptions, landlords will also be prevented from entering tenants’ homes without tenants’ consent.

Vancouver-West End MLA Spencer Chandra Herbert, former chair of B.C.’s Rental Housing Task Force, confirmed that the Residential Tenancy Branch will continue to operate to address questions and concerns.

“The stress is off the charts right now. We need to give people security and safety in their rental housing,” he said.

The announcement comes a week before April 1 rental payments are due.

The measures are part of the province’s $5 billion COVID-19 response plan – which was announced on Monday – and follow tax and payment deferral options from governments, Crown corporations and banks intended to ease the financial burdens Canadians’ may be facing.

Earlier today, the federal government announced a new $2,000 monthly benefit for Canadians, which replaces and expands two previously announced emergency benefits.

“It is the inevitable next step,” said Jon Stovell, president and CEO of Reliance Properties and past chair of the Urban Development Institute.

Quebec announced the extended shutdown of the majority of construction sites as it ramped up efforts to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus. Quebec's construction unions had called for a work stoppage, saying many sites lack proper hygiene control and require working close to others.

B.C. is second only to Quebec in the number of residents infected by COVID-19.

On March 22, six days after B.C. banned large gatherings, its COVID-19 Joint Information Centre released guidelines that allow for construction to continue, provided no more than 50 workers are working in any one space at a time.

Dr. Bonnie Henry, provincial health officer, has issued a set of guidelines regarding hygiene on construction sites.

Stovell’s company has two big building projects underway, an office tower and a condominium project, and he said his contractors are “going beyond” the provincial measures to assure worker and public safety.

But he believes that all B.C. construction work, aside from infrastructure projects deemed essential, will soon be ordered to close.

A request for comment from the provincial health officer was not received by the Western Investor deadline.

Ron Rapp, CEO of the Homebuilders Association of Vancouver, sent a memo to members this week.

“I told them we have the privilege to continue to work and to make darn sure they all meet the criteria of the provincial health guidelines,” he said.

But Rapp warned that much of the private sector construction in Metro Vancouver – estimated to be worth $10 billion to the B.C. economy and employing up to 130,000 people – could be forced to close regardless of legislation.

A lack of key building supplies due to a broken trade chain, especially from Asia, and the number of people who can’t or won’t report to work is among the problems, he said. He noted that one local supplier, a fabricator, had 25 per cent of its staff test positive for COVID-19.",[]

Reports include inadequate access to washroom facilities, a disregard for social-distancing and workers showing up to job sites sick. On more than one site, workers have no access to hand sanitizer or hand-washing facilities. Multiple workers shared that they risk losing their jobs if they leave, even though colleagues are showing up to work with flu-like symptoms.

Last week, the BC Building Trades Council asked construction workers to report working conditions on job sites during the COVID-19 outbreak. BC Building Trades (BCBT) is now urging WorkSafeBC to enforce mandatory and provincially recommended health and safety practices after reports of unsafe and unsanitary worker conditions.

“Workers are pleading for help – this is urgent,” said BCBT executive director Andrew Mercier in a news release.

“I have been in direct contact with the top brass at WorkSafeBC about this. We need more hand-washing stations. We need better social distancing. Regulations on paper mean nothing if they are not being enforced on the ground.”

One worker who emailed BIV said there are at least 50 people using four washrooms on his Port Moody job site every day, and he has yet to see them cleaned on a daily basis.

Another individual told BIV that a Vancouver site superintendent told workers that he doesn’t care about social distancing: “Either to go to work, or go home.“

A number of the workers who reached out to BCBT – and whose responses have been anonymized – expressed concerns about both continuing to work and about losing their jobs if they chose to stay home or self-isolate. Some have called for non-essential work sites to be shut down.

“The fact no one is shutting these sites down right now is unreal... Well over 200 people sharing this one water hose... No hot water. No hand sanitizer, and five to six bathrooms for the whole site,” wrote one respondent.

Last week, the Urban Development Institute (UDI) said government confirmed that B.C.’s limit on gatherings of more than 50 people does not apply to construction sites. Sites must still follow WorkSafeBC standards and COVID-19 prevention protocols. The latter include additional hand-washing stations and social distancing of one to two metres between workers.

Not so, according to mortgage experts. In fact, advertised interest rates for new mortgage applications have been climbing significantly over the past few days.

article continues below

In its March 19 update, mortgage comparison website RateSpy.com wrote as an example that TD Bank had just increased its advertised rates:

• three-year fixed: from 2.69 per cent to 2.89 per cent

• five-year fixed (high ratio): from 2.69 per cent to 2.79 per cent

• five-year variable: from 2.85 per cent to 2.95 per cent (no discount on the bank’s prime lending rate)

Alisa Aragon, mortgage broker with Dominion Lending Centres Mountain View, told Glacier Media in an interview March 20, “Lenders started increasing rates last Friday [March 13, the same day that the Bank of Canada made its emergency cut to the overnight interest rate]. That includes major lenders such as Scotiabank, TD, RBC. They’ve also been reducing variable-rate mortgage discounts on the prime rate, which is currently 2.95 per cent, so the discount on most variable rates is barely anything. In the future, we could see no discounts at all.”

She added, “The fixed rates are usually connected to the bond market, but because banks need liquidity right now, they’re increasing the rates.” The bond market had previously dropped in line with the central bank’s interest rate, but has also rebounded over the past couple of days.

Liquidity for the banks is a key issue for the federal government right now, which announced March 20 that it is introducing “changes will help provide stable funding and liquidity to financial institutions and mortgage lenders and support continued lending to Canadian businesses and consumers.”

This follows an announcement by the Ministry of Finance that it is launching “a $50 billion Insured Mortgage Purchase Program (IMPP)... The amendments allow mortgage lenders to pool previously uninsured mortgages into National Housing Act Mortgage-Backed Securities for CMHC to purchase these securities through the IMPP. The impact of this measure will provide financial institutions with more liquidity. This, in turn, will allow financial institutions to continue lending to businesses as well as individuals, while assisting customers who face hardship and need flexibility, on a case by case basis.”

By insuring previously uninsured mortgages, the government is essentially taking on the risk associated with those loans, freeing up banks’ balance sheets to provide more liquidity. The moves are intended to support banks while they offer such programs as six-month deferrals of mortgage payments to customers facing financial hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, Aragon said that the program would not necessarily prevent banks from raising mortgage interest rates. “It depends on the bank’s balance sheets, every bank is different,” she said. “These are unprecedented times.”

Even though rates for new mortgages are currently rising, applicants are rushing to get a mortgage on the back of news that the Bank of Canada has slashed its overnight rate.

RateSpy’s March 20 update added, “Nearly every long-time mortgage broker we’ve talked to is swamped, with some saying they’re having their highest application volume ever for a March.”

Aragon is one such busy mortgage professional. She told Glacier Media she is also fielding countless calls from people who are asking about possible mortgage deferrals, even when they haven’t lost their jobs. She added that some are hoping to stop paying their mortgages so they can use the money to invest in the stock market while it is depressed. “That’s not how you do it,” she added. “These deferral programs are really for people who are struggling financially due to the pandemic, and those customers will be required to provide proof of hardship.”

RateSpy’s March 20 update confirmed this trend, saying, “We’re hearing of cases where people are using HELOCs [home equity line of credit] to buy stocks. These are presumably (hopefully) well-qualified, risk-tolerant clients with financial safety nets. It’s definitely not a strategy for the overwhelming majority.”",[]

The board said that it was making “this explicit recommendation today with the support of real estate brokerages, and after an assessment of the latest information and commentary from public health and other government authorities.”

REBGV said that, earlier in the week, it had also “removed the rule requiring that properties listed on MLS be made available for showings.”

Ashley Smith, REBGV president said, “Realtors want to do their part to help prevent the spread of illness in our communities and to meet the housing needs of residents in a responsible way. We’ve heard from some in the community who are unhappy that their Realtors are not holding Open Houses. To those people, we ask for your understanding given the public health crisis we all face today.”

The board said that “anyone looking to buy or sell a home in today’s environment is encouraged to discuss COVID-19 preparedness with their Realtor” and offered some key tips for buyers and sellers. These include:

• If you recently travelled abroad and/or are unwell, do not view a property, and stay home.

• If you’re a seller, talk with your Realtor about alternative approaches to open houses, such as virtual showings and other technology-based solutions.

• If you’re a buyer, only visit a property when others are not present, sanitize your hands before and after a showing, and avoid touching doorknobs and other surfaces in the property.

The REBGV is also offering other tips for buyer and sellers at www.rebgv.org.

Construction must go on

Announced the same day was approval to B.C. construction companies to continue site operations, as the ban on gatherings of more than 50 people does not apply to construction sites, according to the Urban Development Institute.

The UDI said in a March 19 statement that “a senior provincial government official has contacted UDI president and CEO Anne McMullin to assure our industry and membership the 50-person limit does NOT apply to construction sites. The provincial government official confirmed that all sites can and should remain operating… Sites must continue to conform to Worksafe BC practices and current COVID-19 prevention protocols. That means additional handwashing stations should be made available, that workers should maintain their social distance of 1-2 metres from one another and during any on-site meetings.”

The UDI statement added, “In addition, the Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said during the March 17 news conference… that ‘Construction work outside is not as much of a risk that we are concerned about... but anyone who’s sick should not be going to work.’”

The Homebuilders Association of Vancouver (HAVAN) also sent out a statement March 19 offering advice to construction employers on site safety during the pandemic.

In a combined press release, all six big banks said they were also working with commercial customers to provide “flexible solutions” for Canadian businesses struggling because of the virus outbreak.

On the same day, credit union Vancity announced that it was also implementing mortgage payment deferrals of up to six months for struggling homeowners.

It wrote in a statement: “Vancity initially responded by introducing a three-month loan deferral program for our members. It is clear the effects of the pandemic will last longer, so today we are announcing an extension of that deferral program for a term of up to six months. This includes mortgages and other loans and will support members facing financial uncertainty and vulnerability from the fallout of coronavirus.”

Vancity said that personal banking and business customers should contact their customer service line to find out how the credit union can help.

It wrote: “Each case will be assessed individually to help people through these difficult times… Other support for Vancity members facing financial difficulties owing to the virus include providing emergency working capital [and] buying back foreign currency at the rate it was sold, for customers impacted by travel disruption, to ensure they do not suffer financial loss.”

During a press conference, Premier Horgan said these are among the many issues the province has on its plate, and government is looking at next steps, using a cross-governmental approach.

article continues below

""It's not just individual renters that are concerned. Businesses who have rents to pay and no customers coming in the door are equally concerned. So we have a whole range of issues that are piling up and we're looking at what mechanisms we have to assist these individuals,"" he said at the press conference March 17.

""But I want to stress, as I did on Friday, the objective of our government is to provide services for people. That's why we're here. We do not want to come up short. I've made that clear to deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland in our daily discussions — that we all need to work on this together.""

Chandra Herbert, meanwhile, headed up the three-person rental housing task forced that criss-crossed the province in 2018 to come up with recommendations to modernize the Rental Tenancy Act.

Chandra Herbert is now reaching out to many of the same people and groups he dealt with on that file to make short-term and long-term recommendations with respect to the impact coronavirus will have on renters and rental housing.

“It's quick work in terms of short-term [recommendations] given rents come due at the end of the month. We'll have to be looking at that as an issue. We're looking at how to support renters, but also landlords — there's a number of smaller landlords [for whom] the rent cheque is often also the mortgage cheque,” he told the Courier March 17.

“Tomorrow, I understand, the federal government will be making major announcements around rents, in part. We don’t have an early preview of that, but it will inform the work.”

Chandra Herbert has already put out calls to organizations such as the B.C. Non-Profit Housing Association, the Tenant Resource and Advisory Centre and LandlordBC. Within government, he’ll be checking in with B.C. Housing, as well as Vancouver and Victoria’s rental advisory committees.

“It’s not everybody under the sun — we have to work faster than that — but I'm doing my best to get out to as many folks that have key experience in this work,” he said. “I’ve set my own deadline — as soon as possible. The sooner we can get action, the sooner people have some peace of mind, which is in short supply right now.”

Challenges are numerous as April 1 approaches and rent becomes due. Some workers have already lost jobs while others are at risk of losing them. Some residents are in quarantine or self-isolation. Landlords of smaller and larger buildings, meanwhile, as well as those who rent suites in their homes, face mortgage payments.

“[Some renters] may not be able to get rent money because they're not working or they may have been laid off — if you're a casino worker or somebody in the entertainment industry, for example — the film business,” Chandra Herbert said. “In many cases, people are one paycheque away from not being able to afford rent.”

But, he added, some relief sooner than later, depending what the federal government announces Wednesday.

“CMHC on the federal level has said they're looking at mortgage deferrals and questions like that. But really, [after] we hear what the federal cabinet is announcing tomorrow, we'll see what we, as a province, needs to do,” he added.

“They have a considerable fiscal firepower at their disposal. We'll watch them and then see what more we can do. Certainly, we've been encouraging the federal government to look at the challenge of renters, of course, the challenge with mortgage holders, people in the gig economy who might not qualify for EI, and that kind of thing.”

Under the province’s current Residential Tenancy Act, meanwhile, evictions are still possible — an issue renters’ advocates want addressed. Changes could come.

“Most folks aren't paying rent until the end of this month, so it's all on the table,” Chandra Herbert said.

Real Estate Association predicted March 17.

The tentative forecast by the BCREA admitted that “nobody knows” what will happen, but it ran a series of economic models under four scenarios.

article continues below

All four scenarios predicted home sales in the province would drop in the spring and early summer. The market would then likely rebound in the second half of the year “contingent on the outbreak resolving.” However, only one of the scenarios found that home sales in the province would recover to a point of activity higher than if there had been no pandemic, with the other three forecasting a more muted recovery (see graph above).

Although some industry pundits have suggested that the dramatic interest rate cuts in response to the crisis would fuel housing sales, the BCREA said that the suspension of the planned relaxations of the mortgage stress test would “mute the impact of falling interest rates for the BC housing market.”

The BCREA went further by saying that a national recession was possible due to the pandemic-related uncertainty, and in particular its impact on oil prices.

The authors wrote, “The additional shock to the Canadian economy due to a collapse in oil prices – itself the by-product of a price war between the world’s largest oil producers due to COVID-19 – makes the probability of a recession in Canada that much higher.”

Financial aid needed

BCREA also applauded the CMHC’s move to work with mortgage lenders to help homeowners defer payments, but said it was not enough, and that financial aid packages would be needed for households, especially renters.

The report said, “An unfortunate but unavoidable product of recessions is losses in employment and incomes, which may put some financially vulnerable families in an even more precarious position. The CMHC announced that it would be working with lenders to defer mortgage payments by up to six months if needed, which should stem potential mortgage defaults and foreclosures. However, there is still a need to address lost income for those who cannot afford to practice social distancing by staying home from work, and for those who have to make monthly rent payments and can’t take advantage of payment deferrals. For those individuals and families, cash is king. That means these households will need government cash transfers to meet their financial priorities during this time, and we hope this will be part of the yet-to-be-announced stimulus package from the Canadian government.”

James Laird, co-founder of Ratehub.ca and president of CanWise Financial mortgage brokerage, said of the CMHC’s mortgage deferment program, “Any Canadian who will be unable to make an upcoming mortgage payment should reach out to their lender before they miss the payment to discuss options and come up with a plan that works for their financial situation. The goal of lenders and CMHC is that no one will default on their mortgage as a result of COVID-19.""",[]

The federal financial regulator had previously announced that the stress test would be relaxed for insured-mortgage applicants. The new qualifying rate for insured mortgages (those with less than 20 per cent down payment) would have calculated at the weekly median five-year fixed rate from mortgage insurance applications, plus two per cent. This was intended to replace the current calculation, which is the Bank of Canada’s average posted interest rate, or the mortgage applicant’s contracted rate plus two per cent, whichever is the higher.

However, following the Bank of Canada’s emergency interest-rate cut on March 13 of 50 basis points, the second such cut in nine days in response to COVID-19, OSFI has suspended the change indefinitely.

The new lower interest rates may have a similar effect as the planned stress test relaxation, and OSFI may be attempting not to compound the effect.

However, many mortgage lenders have not yet passed on the first of the two BoC rate cuts to their customers, and some have even increased fixed mortgage rates.

Jeremy Rudin, the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, said in a statement, “OSFI is focusing its efforts on issues in the environment that require continued vigilance. OSFI is committed to being a risk-based and agile regulator that calibrates responses that are fit for purpose.”

OSFI is also lowering the Domestic Stability Buffer requirement for domestic systemically important banks by 1.25 per cent of risk weighted assets, effective immediately, according to the Department of Finance. Such banks were supposed to see their buffer increased to 2.25 per cent, but this increase is now cancelled.

The department said is a statement, “This action will increase the lending capacity of Canada’s large banks and support the supply of credit to the economy during the period of disruption related to COVID-19. The release of the buffer will support in excess of $300 billion of additional lending capacity.”

Finance minister Bill Morneau stated, “The government is preparing a significant stimulus program, to stabilize our economy, support businesses and protect Canadians… To all Canadians, our government wants you to know that we have your back. We will take every necessary step to give you confidence.”",[]

""This unscheduled rate decision is a proactive measure taken in light of the negative shocks to Canada’s economy arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and the recent sharp drop in oil prices,"" the central bank stated. The statement added the bank’s governing council is ready to further lower rates if that is necessary ""support economic growth and keep inflation on target.”

When questioned, Bank of Canada Stephen Poloz said even a negative interest rate is on the table but told reporters it would likely not be needed “because of our financial firepower.”

The leading rate reductions are part of a $10 billion stimulus package announced March 13 by the federal government.

The rate cut immediately reduced the BoC lending rate to 0.75 per cent, the lowest since the global financial crisis more than a decade ago.

“Those borrowers who have stuck with variable rate mortgages now look like geniuses,” said Vancouver mortgage broker Peter Kinch, “Someone who has a variable rate mortgage at minus 1 per cent would be paying a 1.95 per cent rate for a mortgage today” he said.

The rate cut will also affect the mortgage stress test, which was scheduled to be modified on April 6 to make it reactive to the average contract rate for five-year mortgage loans at big banks. The stress test had required a borrower to qualify at the posted five-year mortgage rate, plus 2 per cent, or at the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. rate of 5.19 per cent, whichever was higher.

Now, the mortgage stress test will be linked only to the current average contract rate available at federally regulated banks.

A BIV survey March 13 showed this five-year rate is in an average of 2.42 per cent, which means a homebuyer would need to qualify at 4.42 per cent, the lowest level since the mortgage stress was expanded in January 2018 to include all home buyers.

“The housing market in Vancouver is already heating up and these rate cuts will add fuel to the fire,” said Kinch, head of the Peter Kinch Mortgage Team with Diversifi Alternative Investments Ltd.

Housing sales in Metro Vancouver soared 44.9 per cent in February compared to the same month a year earlier and were up 36.9 per cent from January, according to the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver, The composite benchmark price for a home is now $1.02 million, up 2.7 per cent from six months ago.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau, appearing on live national TV March 13 with Poloz and Canada’s banking regulator Jeremy Rubin, said he would deliver a fiscal stimulus package next week that will include an additional $10 billion in new funding to the country’s two business financing agencies — the Business Development Bank of Canada and Export Development Canada. The financial aid could be expanded: Morneau said the government would “do whatever it takes.”

Kinch said rumours are rife in the mortgage and banking sectors that one measure being considered is an 18-month suspension of the mortgage stress test.",[]

A new report from Zoocasa says a downpayment for a detached home in Coquitlam is now $234,660, down $20,920 from two years ago. The cost fell $14,400 in Port Moody and $3,380 in Port Coquitlam.

Penelope Graham, who compiled the data, said values were based on the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver's benchmark home price while the downpayment amounts were calculated based on a 5% for homes valued at or under $500,000, 10% for homes between $500,000 and $1 million, and 20% for homes over $1 million. She added that the two-year timeline tracks changes in real estate taxes and federal mortgage stress tests implemented in late 2017 and early 2018.

""After these new changes were put in place throughout the tail end of 2017 and start of 2018, the market underwent a notable shift as both buyers and sellers became skittish about searching for, or listing, home sales,"" she wrote. ""That led to considerable market chill, with sales plunging by upwards of 30% year over year until well into 2019, accompanied by softening prices.""

The Tri-Cities was far from seeing the biggest declines.

According to the analysis, the cost of a downpayment on a detached home in Surrey fell $127,090, while a similar drop was seen in West Vancouver ($119,500) and the city of Vancouver's west side ($117,320).

But attached properties were a different story over the last two years, particularly in Coquitlam, where the cost of a 10% downpayment on condos and townhouses has increased from $27,530 to $28,900. Port Coquitlam saw a $650 drop from $23,400 to to $22,750 while Port Moody fell $2,110 from $41,830 to $39,720.",[]

There were 5,741 residential unit sales were recorded by B.C.’s MLS last month, which is an increase of 26.3 per cent from February 2019

Added to that, the average MLS sale price in B.C. last month was $758,863, a 12 per cent increase from one year previously.

However, all that improvement is in comparison to the weak activity seen in early 2019, and merely brings the provincial real estate market back to normal levels.

“Housing markets in BC continued to trend near long-term average levels in February,” said Brendon Ogmundson, BCREA’s chief economist. “Recent declines in mortgage rates and favourable changes to mortgage qualifying rules may provide a boost to home sales heading into the spring, although there is significant economic uncertainty lingering over the outlook.”

With total B.C. MLS home listings down 8.3 per cent year over year, and sales increasing, the ratio of sales-to-active residential listings across B.C. rose to 20.3 per cent. It is considered a seller’s market only when the ratio is above 20 per cent for several months, so the market is still considered balanced at this point.

As ever, the picture changes dramatically when looking at individual real estate markets, with some recovering more than others, and some struggling.

Greater Vancouver saw the biggest sales increase (but not the biggest price rises), while the small markets of Northern Lights and Powell River both saw fewer sales than in February last year. Of the larger markets, only B.C. Northern reported a decline in transactions compared with its active market of one year ago.

Average sale prices rose on an annual basis in every B.C. market except Powell River, which is small enough to see wild percentage changes in sales and prices, and therefore does not indicate a trend. Of the larger markets, the highest average annual price rise was in the Fraser Valley, up 9.4 per cent, followed by Okanagan Mainline and Vancouver Island.

Mark Ostry, a principal at Vancouver-based Acton Ostry Architects, said the use of timber materials in the construction of multi-storey and highrise buildings meshes nicely with the project’s goals for sustainability and respect for environmental sensitivity.

article continues below

“We know first-hand mass timber has many benefits,” he said. “It’s clean and it’s green.”

Ostry’s firm designed the Brock Commons Tallwood House at the University of British Columbia. At the time the 18-storey student residence was completed in 2017, it was the tallest mass timber tower in the world. That record has since been eclipsed by a building in Norway that’s more than 32 metres taller.

Ostry said mass timber construction, which utilizes large solid wood panels for walls, floors and roofs, is fast (the tower at UBC took only 66 days to erect), creates less waste, is more efficient for recycling and requires less transporting of materials through neighbourhoods. He added it also creates an “incredibly quiet” living environment for residents.

Acton Ostry is working with Vancouver developer Edgar Developments on the plan to transform Woodland Park’s 200 rental townhomes in 19 low-rise buildings into a community of approximately 2,000 homes in a mix of buildings ranging from four to 26 storeys in Port Moody’s Seaview neighbourhood along Cecile Drive.

Peter Edgar, the company’s president, said he would “love to explore” the mass timber option as a way to set a “new standard for responsible development.”

He said his company’s proposal to build 325 non-market rental homes in the first of the project’s seven phases is “unprecedented,” and would comprise a significant component of more than $52 million in community amenities for Port Moody. Those include the dedication of new parkland and active trails, improvements to pedestrian and cycling infrastructure in the neighbourhood, and a 5,000-sq. ft. daycare to accommodate 37 children.

Edgar said the non-market housing would be built in partnership with BC Housing and current residents in the complex, which was built in the 1960s, would have first dibs on units. The other phases, one of which includes retail spaces, would follow, with full completion scheduled for 2034.

Ostry said the plan for the development protects wetlands and urban forest in the neighbourhood as well as its sloping topography, with the tallest buildings to be built at the lowest point to minimize their visual impact on residents higher up the hill.

“The landscape is an outdoor living room for the entire community,” Ostry said, adding new buildings will be situated on the footprint of existing structures as much as possible, all parking will be located in underground parkades, a community garden will be located on the roof of the central amenity building and significant trees will be retained.

He said the project will also include a 1.5-km multi-use trail around its perimeter, active and passive green spaces between buildings and even a natural amphitheatre area to support outdoor concerts and community activities.

But Port Moody’s senior planner, Doug Allan, cautions the project still faces major challenges, not the least of which is significant increases in density and building heights than is allowed for the neighbourhood in the city’s current official community plan.

Allan said the project’s distance from transit is also problematic.

“Access is a key issue,” he said, adding the city’s strategy is to encourage densification around transit stations.

Ostry said residents in the project will be “fairly well-served,” with transit connections a 10-minute walk away. As well, it will introduce electric bicycle and car share programs to ease congestion and build a new traffic signal at Clarke Street and Barnet Highway.

The proposal has yet to be presented to council. It received its first assessment by the city’s community planning advisory committee on March 3.",[]

A reverse mortgage is a mechanism for those who have paid off their mortgages to tap into their home’s equity, receiving a monthly or lump-sum payment. It is popular among retirees as it allows them to stay in their home while giving them an income. It is usually only payable upon sale of the home, or death, which means that it is paid off before the rest of the estate is passed to the beneficiaries.

The latest OSFI data shows that there was $4.01 billion in reverse mortgage debt in December 2019, up 0.69 per cent from November 2019, according to Better Dwelling.

This is a 13 per cent increase from one year previously and the first time in Canadian history that reverse mortgage debt has topped $4 billion.

However, the blog pointed out that the rate of growth for reverse mortgage debt is slowing, as the 13 per cent year-over-year increase for December was the lowest growth rate in many years (see graph below). It added that residential mortgage credit is growing at 5.1 per cent as of January 2020.

Vast majority of older homeowners want to stay in their home,['Joannah Connolly'],,"Downsizing – often referred to these days as “rightsizing” – may be considered a trend among older Canadian homeowners, but perhaps not if you actually ask them.

A new survey found that 86 per cent of older, urban, adult homeowners said they would like to live in their current family home as long as possible.

The Aging in Place report, from polling firm Mustel Group and real estate brokerage Sotheby’s International Realty Canada, also found that this dream is not realistic for everybody. More than one third (36 per cent) of respondents said they are likely to sell their current home and move to a new residence within their lifetime.

Of those respondents planning to sell their home, 76 per cent expect they will reinvest in the real estate market by buying a replacement primary residence. More than half (54 per cent) of those with plans to move to a new primary home expect to choose a condo.

With so many homeowners hoping to stay in their homes as they age, the survey also asked them about their needs for aging in place.

It found that less than half of respondents (46 per cent) said they had considered their needs in terms of aging in place, when buying their current primary home. Of those who had, the report said, “45 per cent considered safety as a key priority in their chosen neighbourhood, while features supporting single-level living factored the most heavily in their home selection. Condominium owners most commonly prioritized having an elevator, indoor fitness and wellness amenities and security services.”

Don Kottick, president and CEO, Sotheby’s International Realty Canada, said, “Our research reinforces the fact that this generation will continue be a dominating influence in our country’s key markets, and that government, the real estate industry and individual homeowners will need to contend with increasing pressure to make homes, neighbourhoods and cities age-friendly for current and future generations of older people.”

The Aging in Place report is the first in a multi-part series focused on baby boomers and older adults, and is based a survey of 1,764 homeowners ages 54 years and above in Metro Vancouver, Greater Calgary, Greater Toronto and Greater Montreal.

Josh O’Neill, general manager of Mustel Group, said, “This is one of the first studies in Canada to focus on the housing aspirations, expectations and realities of the baby boomer generation, as well as those who are older, with findings based on homeowners already invested in the housing market. Results from the survey reflect the latest trends within one of the country’s most influential demographic cohorts.”",[]
481,tricitynews,https://www.tricitynews.com/real-estate/inside-an-airbnb-bait-and-switch-1.24092962,Inside an Airbnb bait-and-switch,['Brandon Barrett'],,"Sarah was relieved to move with her family to their new home in Brio. After living next to one of those typical Whistler flophouses packed to the rafters with seasonal renters, she was eager to get away from the loud late-night parties and piles of trash left outside. Little did she know then just how much of a nightmare her neighbours would eventually turn out to be.

""It was wrecking our home life,"" said Sarah, whose name Pique has agreed to change. ""They were listing it [on Airbnb] as a four-bedroom house and they would have upwards of 12, sometimes 15, 20 people using it as a party house every weekend.""

article continues below

Sarah wasn't alone in her frustrations.

Since the spring of 2017, dozens of complaints have poured into the municipal bylaw department about the property, not just for the noise and mess, but because the rotating cast of people streaming through the house every weekend seemed to indicate it was being rented illegally on Airbnb. The property owner, initially unaware of the rental scam, was ultimately fined multiple times, totalling $2,500.

As it turned out, that was just the tip of the iceberg.

Tourist hubs across the globe have had to wrestle with the proliferation of short-term rental platforms such as Airbnb — and Whistler is no exception. Years into its own affordable housing shortage, local legislators have had to tighten regulations on illegal nightly rentals. That, of course, has not stopped the practice from running rampant. Currently, hundreds of dwellings in the resort are listed on Airbnb, despite only a handful of neighbourhoods being zoned for it.

Through conversations with the property owner, neighbours, nightly renters, and dozens of pages of bylaw documents and photographs obtained through a Freedom of Information request, Pique offers a rare look inside one of these illegal nightly rentals, as well as the ""bait-and-switch"" scam one of the property's tenants used to allegedly con one woman out of more than $3,000.

Barriers to enforcement

Over the span of just a few months in the spring and summer of 2017, Whistler's Bylaw Services collected reams of evidence against the Panorama Ridge property, including screenshots of the alleged Airbnb listing and numerous photos showing the home's driveway jammed with cars, garbage and cigarette butts littering the grass, a black bear on the deck rummaging through discarded food, and even a naked man firing up an outdoor grill.

A screenshot of the purported Airbnb listing from that period advertised the residential-zoned property as ""The Family ModLodge,"" available for $900 a night.

""Luxurious, bright and modern cabin with all the comforts of home,"" read the listing, which was posted by an Airbnb user with the profile name ""Shawn."" When contacted by Pique, the Vancouver-based homeowner, Shawn Pozer, denied ever renting the property illegally.

""That was not me,"" he said, adding that it was his tenants who listed the home on Airbnb without his knowledge.

""I thought I had long-term renters in there before,"" he added. ""We've maintained that we've tried to follow the bylaws to a T from Day 1, and we have long-term renters in there now.""

Although the home was on the RMOW's radar, initially at least, bylaw officers' hands were tied, despite the clear evidence it was being advertised on Airbnb.

Until a new tourist accommodation bylaw was adopted in July 2017, there was no policy against advertising nightly rentals in a residential zone. Once the new regulation went into effect, the RMOW no longer needed proof that rental activity was taking place, and could enforce against ""illegal marketing"" of a property.

In an Aug. 1, 2017 email to one of the neighbours who had filed a complaint, a bylaw officer said the listing had been deactivated and they expected ""no future nightly rentals from this residence.""

That could not have been further from the truth.

Ghost listing

On March 29, 2018, a Brio resident emailed Bylaw Services to urge them to reopen the file on the property, believing it was once again being rented illegally.

""The renting has been going on for the past few months. This week's current renters today confirmed they are renting the property,"" the neighbour wrote. The responding bylaw officer replied that the home had been brought into compliance the previous summer and allegations of illegal nightly rentals since then had been determined to be unfounded.

Things appeared to cool off over the following year, and neighbours were heartened to learn that a local couple, Liyna Boucher and her partner, had moved into the property in the spring of 2019.

But all was not as it seemed. ""When we met the couple, who we thought was a couple, we were really excited because the owners... said they had rented it for a year to a family. We thought, 'Great, a family in a family neighbourhood,'"" Sarah said. ""Then we learned they weren't a family. That was just a front, and they were doing the same thing... renting it on Airbnb.""

An exasperated Pozer confirmed the couple moved in in May 2019, and he later learned they had listed the home on Airbnb on weekends without his knowledge, even employing a common rental scam known as ""ghost listing,"" which involved the tenant advertising a different, more luxurious home only for a guest to arrive and discover it was not what they paid for.

According to one email sent to Bylaw Services in July 2019, a woman said her daughter-in-law booked the Brio property only to realize upon arrival that it ""looked nothing like the pictures posted on Air B&B [sic] and the address was different than the one she had been told."" The email also claimed that an individual, whose name is blacked out in the bylaw records, told the woman's daughter-in-law that ""she was waiting for changes to zoning in order to rent the home and that in the meantime, she requested that we tell the neighbours that we were friends staying with her"" in order to avoid undue attention from authorities.

This aligns with a notice posted inside the property, a photograph of which was included in Bylaw Service's evidence, urging guests to ""respect the premises and your neighbours,"" and to specifically watch out for a particular neighbour ""of primary concern."" The notice also informed guests that any bylaw fines incurred during their stay would be their responsibility to cover and would result in an additional $1,000 charge per night.

Rebecca, whose name Pique has agreed to change, was another one of the unfortunate few who thought she was booking a spacious, modern cabin for her family's trip to Whistler last summer only to find it was not as advertised.

""I booked a place on Airbnb, this beautiful 4,000-square-foot log cabin,"" she said when reached by phone. ""We showed up and it was that [place] on Panorama Ridge. We were like, 'Is this the right place?'""

Rebecca's ordeal started months before arriving in the resort. On first contacting the Airbnb ""host,"" Boucher — one of the tenants at the Panorama Ridge home — Rebecca was told the house had already been rented. Boucher then allegedly offered a discounted rate if Rebecca wanted to re-book at a future date. When Rebecca contacted Boucher two months later, it was suggested that to ""save some money, we can do [a deal] on the side,"" outside of Airbnb.

Rebecca gave her credit card details to Boucher, who, according to a screenshot obtained by Pique, charged her $3,079.70. The charge was listed under ""I.E. Natural Spa Care Whistler BC."" A LinkedIn profile listed to Boucher names her as the director of spa operations at inspirEarth Natural Spa Care, based in Whistler.

Furious to find the place she thought she booked bore no resemblance to the home in Brio, Rebecca posted about the apparent scam to the popular Whistler Summer Facebook group.

In a screenshot of a text from the same number Pique reached Boucher at, she told Rebecca the whole thing could be chalked up to ""a sincere accident."" Boucher goes on to write that she was trying to arrange a refund, but the money was ""not immediately available"" because of the unexpected expense of Rebecca ""choosing to be dissatisfied with the home and leave."" Boucher also claimed that the cleaning costs — for a property that was never actually occupied — came out to almost $1,000.

Boucher then complained of Rebecca's ""public online harassment, degradation of character and hate speech against me,"" and claimed she would refund the balance if Rebecca removed the Facebook post and agreed not to pursue the issue further. She still has yet to get the money back.

Pozer, the property's owner, said it was only through the five fines he was issued over the course of a nine-week span last summer that he learned the property was being rented again illegally on a nightly basis.

He evicted the couple last fall.

Explaining why it took so long to evict the tenants after receiving multiple fines, Pozer said it was because ""the bylaw people are incredibly incommunicative and very slow in letting you know what's going on, [they] hid behind the Freedom of Information Act and would not release any details of what was going on... I had no information on which to terminate the lease, even though I was asking them.""

Asked for clarity, a municipal spokesperson emailed that: ""A property owner would not receive details about who made the complaint or certain specific details of the investigation. That is information they would need to submit a [Freedom of Information request] for. If they choose to go through the Bylaw adjudication process, they would receive an evidence package from the RMOW as part of the adjudication process.""

Ultimately, it is the responsibility of the property owner to ensure that their tenants are complying with all the applicable local bylaws, something that provincial adjudicator Tajda Mitha with the Residential Tenancy Branch agreed with in an October ruling over Pozer's dispute of an earlier bylaw fine. Mitha was ""satisfied that there is compelling and convincing evidence"" to show that the property was being operated illegally as a tourist accommodation business. In his dispute, Pozer said that the lessees had agreed in writing to cover the cost of the fines. To that, Mitha wrote that Pozer is responsible for any ""unauthorized activities"" on the property, but that he might have a claim for indemnity against his lessees. When reached by phone in December, Boucher confirmed she had rented from Pozer, but wouldn't explicitly say whether she listed the property illegally on Airbnb.

""A lot of homes rented on Airbnb have dual purposes, providing long-term rental for Whistler residents and also helping offset the costs of high rent,"" she said before hanging up.

Playing catch-up

On Jan. 31, two longstanding issues for the City of Toronto — housing and gun violence — converged in a downtown condo, which doubled as a popular weekend party rental on Airbnb, when three young men were killed in a late-night shooting.

The tragedy prompted a quick response from Airbnb, which announced it would begin testing new regulations across Canada to ban local guests under the age of 25 from booking entire homes, an effort to curb so-called ""ghost hotels.""

This followed another shooting that killed five at an Orinda, Calif. Airbnb rental during a Halloween party.

After that mass shooting, as well as an extensive Vice Media investigation last fall that uncovered a U.S.-wide scam run by a prolific grifter (or grifters) exploiting the platform's loosely written rules and enforcement, Airbnb vowed to institute a series of major changes in an effort to regain users' trust. Chief amongst them is a year-long effort the company has committed to that would involve verifying each of the seven million properties listed on Airbnb, part of a dawning realization that ""we have to take more responsibility for stuff on our platform,"" according to CEO and co-founder Brian Chesky, speaking at the DealBook conference in November.

Chesky suggested Airbnb would start asking more specific questions to guests upon checkout, putting the onus on renters to help verify what happens on the platform. While it remains to be seen exactly what it will look like, Airbnb told Vice that the worldwide verification will use a combination of ""Agent reviews and algorithmic screening of the listing contents, pictures, etc., guest verifications of specific feature of a listing, in-person inspections, and virtual walk-throughs.""

If a guest checks into a listing that doesn't meet Airbnb's accuracy standards, Chesky said, they will either be rebooked into a similar listing or receive a full refund.

Matt Hick, CEO of B.C.-based vacation rental service alluraDirect, which boasts more than 270 legitimate Whistler properties for rent, believes verifying the accuracy of a rental property would be easy enough — but he wants Airbnb to go a step further.

""I don't believe they're going to do it, but they could do it, which is verifying the zoning of the property and then verifying if it actually has a legitimate business licence in place,"" he explained.

""So you put the onus back on the company to verify that the business licence is legitimate and that the zoning is correct. We have enough information. As rental companies, we have the full address of the unit, we know who is saying they own the unit. We can check with the RMOW if [a property owner] has a licence in place. We already do this.""

Following the Jan. 31 shooting in Toronto, Airbnb said it would also establish a 24/7 neighbourhood support hotline to connect residents with ""rapid response agents"" to deal with any concerns.

Hick said the effectiveness of such a hotline would depend on how it was set up.

""If the hotline is simply a phone number that phones someone in India or something, and their job is to figure out how to stop the party, really, what they're going to do is call the property host on file, and if they can get ahold of them, then great. Then they're just going to pass the buck to the owner,"" he said. ""But if they can't get ahold of the owner, what's the next step? The next step would obviously be contacting security or police. How are they going to scale that? How are they going to know every security company in every location? It's logistically impossible.""

The added challenge will come when owners have set up their rental property exclusively for the purpose of hosting parties.

""It's next to impossible when the property owners themselves know what's happening,"" Hick said. ""When the properties are set up that way, with cheap furniture, a high damage deposit and they list it at a really high rate, they know what's happening. So how do you curb that?""

Asked how Airbnb's year-long verification process might impact Whistler, Mayor Jack Crompton said it was a step in the right direction. ""It should mean less fraud, and a better overall guest experience,"" he said. ""I don't expect Airbnb's verification will significantly change Whistler's enforcement strategy. If anything the adjustment creates greater alignment between Airbnb and Whistler's tourist accommodation.""

The mayor also believes measures the RMOW has put in place to crack down on properties in neighbourhoods not zoned for nightly rentals is beginning to catch up with the technology.

""It's improving,"" he said. ""A lot of the tools that were in place five years ago were built for a pre-digital era. Much of the work we're doing now is to modernize the tools we have to enforce existing bylaws. The bylaws themselves carry a lot of value when met with a modernized enforcement tool.""

At press time, there were roughly 1,700 Whistler properties listed on Airbnb, and 1,000 or so on VRBO.

The cost of catastrophes, construction, claims and reinsurance has pushed insurance premiums on many British Columbia strata corporations, or condo owner groups, through the roof.

article continues below

The concern for individual owners is not having their own suite insurance to handle unforeseen crises, said association executive director Tony Gioventu.

If something from a suite causes damage to common property, the suite owner would be responsible for the deductible of the corporation, he said.

Korecki Real Estate Services Inc. manages 7,500 strata units in dozens of Lower Mainland buildings. Of the strata corporations that have recently renewed their insurance, around 90% saw premium increases of 50-100%, Korecki property manager Mike Alavi said. “We saw half of the stratas get hit on December 31, and the other half are going to get hit on April 30,” Alavi said.

Those jumps are above the Insurance Bureau of Canada’s provincial average of 35%, but below some of the jaw-dropping 300-600% increases Gioventu has heard of.

And, with building insurance rates soaring, so are deductibles, payments an individual could find themselves responsible for.

“Those deductibles are no longer $25,000,” Gioventu said. Instead, an owner could face a bill ranging from $100,000 to $750,000.

A problem, Gioventu said, is many people no longer face the condition of insurance for a mortgage once the latter is paid off. And some don’t reinsure, leaving themselves vulnerable.

Moreover, some don’t maintain their suites, leaving themselves open to huge bills if something goes wrong.

“I am amazed at the number of people who don’t purchase homeowner insurance when they live in condos,” Gioventu said.

He cited an issue of people hanging clothes from fire sprinkler heads.

“These types of claims can easily reach $1 million,” he said.

“You could lose your home.”

Gioventu also stressed the need for strata corporations – especially those in aging structures - to be proactive in maintaining their buildings. Neglect is a recipe for incurring a claim that will make reinsurance harder and more costly, he said.

He said some stratas have received insurance notices with massive increases the day before they are due.

“We have stratas that are in a real crisis,” he said.

Gioventu stressed the importance of depreciation reports that can point a strata corporation toward future problems that should be planned for. But, he said, the provincial government has allowed corporations to opt out of such reports, leaving inspections neglected and planning not done.

“The object is to make sure properties are being maintained or repaired,” he said. “They are restricted by what the owners won’t pay for funding.”

Part of that, he explained, is that strata councils need to remember “ they are a board of directors of a company and [they should] behave like that.”

And, that would make getting insurance harder as claims rise.

“The strata is going to end up paying the cost,” he said. “It could potentially end up bankrupting a community.”

Gioventu said the government has a role in mitigating the problems condo owners face.

One plan might be for government to amend legislation to allow stratas to negotiate insurance fee charges.

This is the first time that the Bank of Canada has cut its overnight target rate by 50 points in a single move since the 2008 economic recession.

article continues below

The Bank of Canada said in a statement, “Before the outbreak, the global economy was showing signs of stabilizing. While Canada’s economy has been operating close to potential with inflation on target, the COVID-19 virus is a material negative shock to the Canadian and global outlooks, and monetary and fiscal authorities are responding.”

Phil Soper, CEO of national real estate brokerage Royal LePage, said, “Today the Bank of Canada joined other central banks in cutting its target interest rate, an appropriate step that it believes will mitigate the damage caused by the coronavirus. This new health scare has impacted families in many countries around the world and in the process has introduced new risks to our economies. While Canadians have been largely spared the full brunt of this health crisis to-date, the global community is coming together to address this international challenge.”

Brett House, vice-president and deputy chief economist at Scotiabank, who predicted today’s rate cut, said, “The scope and scale of the novel coronavirus epidemic are both now much greater than the Bank of Canada anticipated in January.”

Mortgage rate reductions

The move will likely prompt home financing lenders to cut their variable-rate mortgages by a corresponding amount – although, as James Laird, co-founder of RateHub.ca and president of mortgage brokerage CanWise Financial, stated, “there have been times when lenders have not passed along the full savings to their customers.”

RateHub.ca said that, if receiving the full 50-point cut, a mortgage holder with a variable rate of 2.6 per cent and a monthly payment of $2,102 would see their rate decreased to 2.1 per cent and their monthly payment reduced to $1,987. This means the homeowner would save $115 per month, or $1,380 per year on their mortgage payments, compared with what they were paying before the rate cut.

Fixed-rate mortgages, which approximately 80 per cent of Canadian homeowners hold, will not be immediately affected. However, as Laird added, “The bank’s stance will cause bond yields to continue to decrease, which means Canadians shopping for a fixed-rate mortgage can expect rates to fall and will likely approach the record lows of 2016. Anyone shopping for a home should check rates frequently as they will continue to decrease through the spring.”

More buying power

Cuts in variable rate mortgages, and predicted cuts in fixed rates, will give home buyers more buying power, but only in the short term. This effect, combined with the easing of the mortgage stress test qualification level coming into play April 6, could create greater demand for housing, at a time when there is already increasing demand in many markets. In turn, this could push up home prices, eventually cancelling out the increased buying power initially created by the lower interest rates.

Laird said, “The home buying process will become even more difficult as the low rates will increase buying power and bring more demand into the already hot market.""

Soper added, “I have previously spoken to the paradox that interest rate cuts, made in response to economic weakness, can bolster housing markets. Many of our major cities are enduring structurally persistent housing shortages. This excess of demand for housing compared to the supply of homes available, be it for rent or for purchase, puts constant and often unhealthy upward pressure on prices… These moves will be welcomed in markets that are struggling with inconsistent growth, such as in Calgary or St.John’s, and potentially spurn uncomfortably high home-price inflation in our hottest markets.”",[]
484,tricitynews,https://www.tricitynews.com/real-estate/no-rental-zoning-for-port-moody-1.23648063,No rental zoning for Port Moody,['Mario Bartel'],,"Port Moody won’t be restricting four multi-family properties in the city to rental only after all.

At its meeting Tuesday, Port Moody council heeded a staff recommendation that it not proceed with a bylaw it was considering last December for such zoning for properties at 3370 Dewdney Trunk Rd., where PC Urban has been approved to build 229 market-rental and five below-market-rental units; and another project to be built by Woodbridge Homes at 3131-3137 St. Johns St.

article continues below

Two other properties council was considering for rental zoning are already occupied by rental townhouse complexes; Moray Place is a non-market 52-unit complex owned by Metro Vancouver Housing; and Woodland Park, on Cecile Drive, is a 200-unit market rental development.

Coun. Hunter Madsen said zoning properties for rental-only where rental projects are already in existence, or where new rental projects have been approved, seems redundant and not in the spirit of the power municipalities had been granted by the provincial government last May to create rental-only zones.

In his report to council, Port Moody’s social planner, Liam McLellan, said the developers of the two new rental projects that council approved last year have already made agreements with the city to protect their rental status for at least 20 years. He added that even after those agreements expire, council could still reject any application to convert the properties to strata.

In a letter to council, Robert Cadez, the director of development for PC Urban, said if its property on Dewdney Trunk were rezoned, it would have significant less value than its current zoning and could jeopardize financing for the rental units it intends to build there.

“This change creates unnecessary duress to our project,” Cadez said.

James Howard, president of Woodbridge Homes, told council rezoning his project to rental only would present an additional burden by changing the rules just as construction is about to begin. Instead, he suggested, council should focus on incentives to builders that would make the construction of rental projects more financially viable, like streamlining the approval process.

“This is the conversation we should be having,” he said.

Coun. Diana Dilworth suggested municipalities could throw that ball back to the province by challenging it to change the way rental properties are assessed so they don’t lose value but, rather, increase in value “because of what they bring to the community.”

Coun. Meghan Lahti agreed, adding if that doesn’t happen, “we’re never going to be able to get on the other side of this.”

In his report, McLellan also said the city already has several tools — such as its rental protection, strata conversion and tenant relocation policies — that could be used to protect rental housing like Woodlands Park, which was recently purchased by rental housing developer Edgar Development. And it could have even more input if the owners apply for any changes to the land use.

“Existing policies… would also enable council to control the process to ensure existing residents are not displaced,” McLellan said, adding only New Westminster has so far rezoned six properties that had specific conditions into rental-only while Burnaby has created rental zones in that city but has yet to apply them to any properties.

At council’s request, McLellan said staff will continue to look at ways to create incentives for new rental units as well as research how best to apply the power municipalities have been given to zone for multi-residential rental housing.",[]

Amacon Developments is proposing a 44-storey tower for North Road and Foster Avenue, with a separate six-storey rental at the south end of the property. Council approved first reading Monday and residents will get their chance to weigh in on the application at an upcoming public hearing.

article continues below

This is not the first time Amacon has gone before the city with its plans for the Burquitlam site.

A 41-storey project was first proposed in 2018 but was sent back to staff over council concerns that it did not take advantage of incentives in Coquitlam's Housing Affordability Strategy

""At that time, the applicant did not propose any below-market or non-market rental units,"" said a city staff report this week. ""In response to comments from council, the applicant has since revised their application.""

The 44-storey project includes 12 non-market units in the tower podium that would be run by the YWCA, 24 market rentals located on floors four to seven in the tower and another 86 units located in the mid-rise building. - CITY OF COQUITLAM

Close to two years later, the project is now 44 storeys and includes 12 non-market units in the tower podium that would be run by the YWCA.

Another 24 market rentals would be located on floors four to seven in the tower while the mid-rise building would contain another 86 units. The proposal also includes seven market rental townhouses facing North Road and one commercial unit.

Last year, dozens of residents at 500 Foster Ave. were displaced when their building burned down.

A staff report acknowledged the supports Amacon offered to residents following the blaze, noting some people were relocated to a second building on the site — 633 North Rd. — which was a former strata complex.

An emergency compensation package was also given to residents consisting of up to $1,000 in moving expenses and:

• three months rent plus $1,000 for anyone who lived on the property for less than one year;

• four months rent plus $1,000 for residents with one to five years on the property;

• and five months rent plus $1,000 for anyone who lived in the building for more than five years.

Still, one council member voiced concerns about replacing existing mid-rise buildings with new highrise developments.

Coun. Bonita Zarrillo said she would not support the application, noting that people who were moved from the burned building to the other strata building were being displaced.

""I'm at the end of feeling good about people losing their homes in buildings,"" she said, later adding: ""I'm not kicking people out of their homes along the Burquitlam SkyTrain line anymore until we have housing built… I am just done with the wheeling and dealing putting density here and taking it from here. It is not fair. It is not fair to the residents.""

She added that she would like to see a new project adhere to the current zoning for the property instead of the large mixed-use development proposed by Amacon.

Mayor Richard Stewart disagreed with Zarrillo's assertions that people were being displaced. He said he did not want to see a developer penalized for offering up the vacant strata units to people who were burned out of their homes in the fire.

""I don't want to see us having a dialogue about essentially punishing the landlord that rents out the strata wind-up, particularly if they rent them out on a compassionate basis,"" he said.",[]

There were 2,150 transactions on the residential resale market in February 2020, a 44.9 per cent rise over February 2019, and 36.9 per cent higher than the 1,571 homes sold in January 2020.

article continues below

Even though February’s total sales was 15.9 per cent below the 10-year average for the month, the supply of available homes for sale was unable to meet demand.

“Home buyer demand again saw strong year-over-year increases in February while the total inventory of homes for sale struggled to keep pace,” said Ashley Smith, REBGV president. “This was most pronounced in the condominium market.”

(Story continues below)

This lack of competition increased the pressure on home prices, with the benchmark composite price of a Metro Vancouver home rising slightly again last month. The benchmark price for all residential properties combined, across the region, now stands at $1,020,600, which is a 0.3 per cent increase over February 2019 and a 2.7 per cent increase over the past six months.

(Story continues below)

Although new listings in February were 3.4 per cent higher than in January, the total number of homes for sale as of the end of February was 20.7 per cent lower than the same month last year, at 9,195 units.

The sales-to-active listings ratio in February 2020 was 23.4 per cent. It is deemed to be a seller’s market if the measure is more than 20 per cent for several consecutive months. By property type, the ratio is 17.3 per cent for detached homes (a balanced market), 26.9 per cent for townhomes, and 28.4 per cent for apartments (both now seller’s markets).

Smith added, “Our Realtors are reporting increased traffic at open houses and multiple offer scenarios in certain pockets of the market. If you’re considering listing your home for sale, now is a good time to act with increased demand, reduced competition from other sellers, and some upward pressure on prices.”

Sales and prices by property type and area

Although detached homes in Metro Vancouver saw the lowest sales-to-listings ratio, it was the submarket to see the most rapid sales growth in February. There were 685 single-family home sales across the region last month, which is a jump of 52.9 per cent year over year.

The benchmark price for a detached Metro Vancouver house has not recovered its recent losses yet, but it is recovering. The benchmark price for a detached home in the region is now $1,433,900. This is 0.7 per cent lower than in February 2019 but a 1.9 per cent increase compared with the low point seen around six months ago.

Whistler and Squamish were again the markets to see the biggest annual jump in typical detached home values, up 15.7 per cent and 10.1 per cent respectively. The steepest price loss in the REBGV’s jurisdiction was seen in Bowen Island, where typical detached prices are down 8.4 per cent year over year, followed by the Sunshine Coast, down 7.8 per cent.

Sales of attached Metro Vancouver homes such as townhouses and duplexes totalled 404 in February, a 45.8 per cent increase compared with the 277 sales in February 2019.

A typical attached home in the region now sells for $785,000, according to the board. This is 0.6 per cent higher than in February 2019 and a 1.7 per cent increase over the past six months.

As with detached homes, Whistler and Squamish townhome prices have seen the biggest increases in the region, up 7.5 and 7.2 per cent respectively. Once again, resale townhome prices in Ladner (down 5.0 per cent) and Tsawwassen (down 4.5 per cent) dropped the most year over year, although those declines are not as steep as they have been recently.

Some 1,061 Metro Vancouver condos traded on the MLS last month, which is a 39.8 per cent increase over the 759 sales in February 2019.

With the demand for condos highest of all the property types, and supply not keeping up, the price of a typical Metro Vancouver condo has recovered the most so far. The benchmark price of an apartment property now stands at $677,200, which is 0.9 per cent higher than in February 2019 and a 3.6 per cent increase over the past six months.

Surprisingly, given the rise in detached and townhome prices in the area, Squamish condos saw the region’s biggest annual condo price drops, down 6.8 per cent. Port Moody and Coquitlam were the areas with the biggest benchmark condo price rises, up four and three per cent year over year respectively.

Tick. Tick. Tick. Welcome to life at Highpointe—an innovative collection of 153 condominium residences offering a whole new level of urban park-side living in Maple Ridge.

Breaking ground this spring, Highpointe is nestled into a quiet residential community on a ridge adjacent to seven acres of parkland. It boasts amazing views of the Fraser River to the south and west, mountain views to the north, and beautiful Mount Baker to the south-east.

All of your local amenities are just steps away, including the Maple Ridge Town Centre, new Evergreen Line express bus and the West Coast Express to Vancouver. There are also fresh markets, restaurants and cafes, the Arts Centre, library and a leisure and fitness centre nearby.

Those who seek adventure will love Maple Ridge’s outdoor offerings including hiking, biking and equestrian trails, as well as fishing and boating in the many lakes and streams including Golden Ears Provincial Park.

Advanced superior construction

Aside from its fantastic location, Highpointe’s hallmark is its superior construction—the only one of its kind currently underway in the Fraser Valley.

“Its 100 per cent steel and concrete construction,” says Wayne Lyle, the sales and marketing director. “It’s simply better, more energy-efficient and safer construction than wood frame. There’s no shrinkage or warping, it’s mould- and fire-resistant, and provides better insulation and soundproofing.”

Local developer Concordia also opted for an environmentally friendly heat recovery system that allows each home to be heated or cooled to the ideal temperature all year long.

“As a first-time buyer or an empty nester, you know you are making a solid investment for years to come,” says Lyle.

Elevated design features

The interior design of Highpointe homes also marks a higher standard of living. Each home boasts nine to 18-foot ceilings, large windows, Silestone counters, a five-element gas cooktop, wall ovens, Kohler fixtures, Napoleon fireplaces and innovative Lumon solariums.

“In winter, you have a fully enclosed solarium where you can still enjoy the feeling of being outside while expanding your interior living space,” says Lyle. “Then in summer, just retract the glass and you’ve got an open breezy balcony.”

New homeowners also have plenty of choice when it comes to layout. The development features two-storey city homes, two-storey top floor sky lofts, as well as close to 30 unique one-level plans including studios, one-bed and two-bed plus den options.

And there’s always room for guests thanks to Highpointe’s amenities, which include both a fully equipped guest suite and communal office hub.

With pricing starting from the high-$200,000’s, it’s no surprise that the building is already over one third sold in just a few short weeks.

To celebrate its grand opening, Highpointe is inviting everyone to a ground-breaking ceremony on March 14 from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. There will be some draw prizes including fly-fishing lessons, equestrian trail rides, and golf passes – all to highlight Maple Ridge’s unique outdoor lifestyle.",[]

Air Canada's chief medical officer, Dr. Jim Chung, wrote that the restrictions are severely impacting the airline, its customers and employees, as well as an overall recovery.

He says the proposed measures mirror those adopted by the European Union, Britain and other jurisdictions.

What is COVID-19?

COVID-19 symptoms are similar to other respiratory illnesses, including the flu and common cold. They include cough, sneezing, fever, sore throat and difficulty breathing.

The best way to prevent potential transmission is to wash your hands for at least 20 seconds, avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth, cough or sneeze into a tissue or your sleeve, avoid contact with people who are sick, and stay home if you are sick.

This is a developing story.

In one cluster, at least 17 cases have been traced to a group of people who met up in Kelowna, some from the Interior and Alberta, others from the Lower Mainland.

“There are a number of people who have been exposed in those events,” said Henry Tuesday.

More troubling still is the emergence of new cases at the Krazy Cherry Fruit Company in Oliver, where two have been identified among migrant workers. They were among 62 cases identified in B.C. between Friday and Monday.

“Public health teams are monitoring the situation closely and have placed restrictions on those living and working on the farm to limit the potential for further transmission,” said Dr. Henry in a written statement today.

But others have expressed concerns that not enough is being done to prevent outbreaks among vulnerable groups. Where newly arrived immigrants were disproportionately affected at earlier outbreaks at poultry plants in Coquitlam, others say migrant agricultural workers still run higher risks due to inadequate housing.

“As anticipated,” said Byron Cruz of Sanctuary Health, an organization that works to protect migrant workers from predatory practices. “We knew that something was going to happen because the situation for housing in that farm is terrible. They were all crowded.”

‘WAY ABOVE MY COMFORT ZONE’

Yesterday, Dr. Henry warned 25 cases a day was “distressing” and “cautionary to us.” And while not unexpected due to the increased travel and social interaction of phase 3, she said “That’s way above my comfort zone.”

Dr. Henry urged anyone who attended Canada Day parties in the vicinity of the Kelowna cluster to self-monitor for even the mildest of symptoms, noting that anyone can be tested should they feel they’ve been exposed.

Just how quickly a province or state can backslide has been painted in stark relief among our neighbours to the south.

In comments to the press Tuesday, Health Minister Adrian Dix pointed to surges in several U.S. states where record breaking daily caseloads in several states have led jurisdictions like California to re-introduce physical distancing protocols, in what Dix described as “lockdown 2.0.”

“All our neighbouring jurisdictions continue to see an increase, whether it’s our neighbouring province to the east, Alberta, or others, Washington, Oregon and California, in Nevada, Arizona and in other American states — we’ve seen record days of new cases of COVID-19 recently,” said Dix.

Here in B.C., Henry said that on Monday, she checked how weekly caseloads are tracking with the province’s modelling that suggests British Columbians keep their social contacts to 65% of normal.

“We are still skirting that line. The RT, the reproductive number, is hovering around one… which is sort of pushing the limits of where we need to be,” she said.

While health officials work to contain the outbreak in Oliver, it’s unclear how a potential surge in cases will affect that calculation, and Byron Cruz of Sanctuary Health said he expects more cases to crop up in coming days due to their tight living quarters.

What is clear is the more cases are contained to a single cluster, the easier they are to track.

“This is going to be our dance over the next few months, where we do what we can do, we travel, we have those social interactions, but we do it in a thoughtful way so we do it with the people we know we’re with,” said Dr. Henry.",[]

The question is whether strong summer sales — driven in part by delayed purchasers waiting to buy since spring's lockdown — will carry forward to fall, experts said.

article continues below

The Canadian Real Estate Association on Wednesday reported that June sales were up 63 per cent on a month-over-month basis, and 15.2 per cent higher than the same time last year. Prices also rose from June 2019, up 6.5 per cent to an average $539,000.

""Home sales, prices and starts have effectively regained all the ground lost during the shutdown,"" BMO chief economist Douglas Porter wrote in a note to clients.

""However, fair point that some of this outsized strength is simply pent-up demand for the lost sales from the key spring season.""

The real estate industry came to a near standstill earlier this year as non-essential businesses closed to help slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. CREA said the jump in sales returned them to ""normal levels"" for June, noting they were up 150 per cent from where they were in April.

Porter said the housing market now must keep up its momentum headed into autumn. Though at a glance, the numbers appear to suggest nothing ""amiss in the economy whatsoever,"" the market will have to balance slowing immigration levels, low interest rates and short housing supply, he said in the note. This tension will come with lasting scars, he said.

Also on Wednesday, the Bank of Canada released its quarterly outlook, forecasting an uncertain economic recovery ahead, and suggesting housing activity will slow over the next few years.

Royal LePage CEO Phil Soper said that the ""pent-up demand"" in the market has been boosted by first-time homebuyers looking for bargains during the downturn. That can crunch the number of new listings, since first-time owners don't have a home to sell, he said, noting CREA's data showed housing inventory at a 16-year low. The association said that the number of newly listed properties climbed 49.5 per cent from May to June.

If there are too many home buyers and too few listings available, that can drive up prices, said Soper. Soper predicts that more existing homeowners may list their homes in the fall, which may cause price increases to level off.

""We're seeing upward pressure on prices, and the highest levels of demand in Ontario and Quebec,"" said Soper. ""Things are good in other parts of the country, but they're quite calm, where the number of people looking for homes and the number of homes available for sale are roughly equal.""

Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Dominion Lending Centres, said in a client note that home prices are declining in Calgary, while elsewhere on the prairies, prices are either flat or rising.

Tim Otitoju, a Regina, Sask.-based real estate agent and chairperson of the province's real estate association, said that while the supply of homes for sale is steady and a bit low, sellers are getting more comfortable with the provincial measures to re-open business.

""We saw a surge in demand in June — we are actually attributing that to the buyers that held off during the shutdown,"" said Otitoju. ""It seems that buyers and sellers are showing a lot of confidence in the provincial reopening plan. Sellers are starting to put their houses back on the market.""

Soper said that he was reassured by the recovery in the West, given oil price volatility and regulatory changes in British Columbia. If immigration does slow, said Soper, it may be a few years before the long-term impacts surface, since homeownership for new Canadians spikes between three and seven years after arrival.

While home sales may be hitting ""normal levels,"" the overall housing market is ""obviously not back to normal at this point,"" said Shaun Cathcart, CREA's senior economist.

""The market has recovered much faster than many would have thought, but what happens later this year remains a big question mark,"" said Cathcart in a statement.

""That said, daily tracking suggests that July, at least, will be even stronger.""

The Canadian Federation of Independent Business surveyed more than 4,500 small business owners online from June 26 to July 2 and found that 2,100 respondents took on an average $135,000 in debt ($285.4 million for the responding group as a whole).

article continues below

Laura Jones, the executive vice-president of the organization that represents at least 110,000 small businesses, said debt has ballooned as 58 per cent of small businesses re-opened fully.

About 35 per cent are back to full staffing but only 24 per cent are back to normal revenue, she said.

""I've talked to many businesses that are open again, but are worried about being able to outrun the debt they have accumulated, particularly with sales still down,"" Jones said in a statement.

At the national level, that debt amounts to billions of dollars.

To finance COVID-19 revenue shortfalls and extra costs, the CFIB survey found 37 per cent of businesses are relying on personal savings, 34 per cent on credit cards, 18 per cent on bank loans, 11 per cent on retirement savings and 9 per cent each on mortgages and loans from families and friends.

Josie Rudderham, a co-owner of Cake and Loaf Bakery in Hamilton, Ont., wasn't surprised by the findings because her 12-year-old company was hit hard when COVID-19 began.

Cake and Loaf temporarily closed one location, permanently shut down a second and laid off workers right as the company's busiest season — Easter — hit. It emptied out what treats it had ready for sale and sent them home with employees or over to health care workers and food banks.

""A lot of expenses didn't stop, the overhead really didn't slow down that much, insurance itself is a big chunk of what we pay and that didn't get reduced. In fact, it went up,"" she said.

Rudderham, who has since reopened a location for curbside pickup, had to take out a loan to deal with cash flow issues and said many of her fellow small business owners did the same because they don't have the cash reserves larger companies do.

""I anticipate it will take us more than a decade to pay off some of this debt that we've had to take on because we are never aiming for profit,"" she said. ""We're aiming to break even every year and then every year we also increase wages because living wage gets recalculated every year.""

James McIntosh, the founder of Meaford, Ont.-based Duxbury Cider and chair of the Ontario Craft Cider Association, also stumbled on troubles when bars and restaurants were forced to close in March.

Duxbury's sales dropped 53 per cent, but McIntosh still considered himself fortunate because his family operates the farm and only has a few workers on staff.

He took out a loan and later, when patios reopened saw about a fifth of his licensed business came back.

Others borrowed money and didn't have such luck. They could be trying to cover what they lost for far longer, he said.

""Some of the smaller guys were really hurt because they didn't have an LCBO or grocery store (selling arrangement),"" he said. ""They were basically relying on what business they could drum up locally with bars and restaurants.""

According to the polling industry's generally accepted standards, online surveys cannot be assigned a margin of error because they do not randomly sample the population.

“The decision about criminal jury trials is entirely in the hands of the chief justice of the Supreme Court and the judiciary,” David Eby said. “On our end, the sheriffs and court services branch are working very closely with the judiciary to support the courts in getting jury trials up and running as soon as we can.”

article continues below

The court is expected to make an announcement on criminal jury trials this week.

The pandemic has created a significant backlog in court cases, Eby said. Four thousand cases were adjourned when in-person hearings were restricted in B.C. Supreme Court. The provincial court has adjourned more than 10,000 cases, including traffic tickets, family matters, minor prosecutions and small claims.

To help deal with the backlog, Eby has proposed a one-year restriction on civil jury trials.

But people accused of a criminal offence have a constitutional right to a jury trial. It’s considered the key to a fair and just system. To choose a jury, whether civil or criminal, requires the assembling of a significant number of people, Eby said.

“Potential solutions include larger venues for jury selection and doing tiered selection, where you bring in one group of people, and then another group of people, as opposed to typically bringing in around 200 people and selecting from the pool,” he said.

The order of the provincial health officer limiting all public gatherings to 50 people makes it a challenge, he said.

At the Victoria courthouse, defence lawyers have been setting criminal jury trial dates for the fall, even though they believe it’s unlikely their trials will go ahead.

Criminal defence lawyer Jordan Watt said it’s difficult to conceptualize getting 12 people together, approximately one foot apart from each other, to listen to the evidence throughout a trial which could last one week or up to three or four months.

“Then to get them to deliberate together without there being some type of massive construction to the current courtroom setup that we have right now, it’s just not going to happen,” Watt said.

“Even if you go a step further, I think you’re going to have problems getting people to come to court in order to be selected as jurors.”

All the provinces are struggling with the issue, said Eby, who is part of a national committee co-chaired by Chief Justice Richard Wagner and federal Justice Minister and Attorney General David Lametti.

The committee offers national guidance to chief justices, judges and court administration officials on the gradual resumption of court operations across Canada. The action committee is dealing with the challenges of jury trials and hearings in small court rooms, circuit and remote courts. It has released a document around best practices for jury trials and how to try and conduct jury trials in the COVID-19 era.

Eby has repeatedly asked Lametti to give increased discretion to judges under the Criminal Code around jury trials to address the realities of COVID-19.

“He’s indicated that he’s willing to look at those things, but the earliest they could be in the legislature is in the fall, so we’ve got quite a period of time before that happens,” Eby said.

The provincial attorneys general have also been asking the federal government for guidance on the timelines of the Jordan decision during COVID-19, Eby said.

In July 2016, in R. v. Jordan, the Supreme Court of Canada created new limits of 18 months from the time a charge is laid until the trial is completed in provincial courts and 30 months in superior court. Anything longer violates the accused’s right to be tried within a reasonable time, unless the prosecution can show exceptional circumstances.

“It’s clear that in exceptional circumstances you can go beyond the Jordan timelines,” Eby said. “The question for everybody is how long is the exceptional circumstance in relation to COVID.”

He hopes the federal government can give the provinces a legislated COVID-19 period that is deemed to be an exceptional circumstance “so we don’t end up with different exceptional circumstances across Canada and different standards of access to justice for the accused.”

Eby is calling for mandatory arbitration of ICBC claims to deal with the backlog.

“There were already a significant number of people waiting a long period of time for their trials,” he said. “Now we’re looking at allowing plaintiffs to require ICBC to enter into a binding arbitration process so they can have their matter heard sooner and relieve pressure on the court.”

Another strategy would allow people to appear virtually in both traffic and family matters. This would free the court from restrictions on how many courtrooms and how much spacing is needed, he said.",[]

That’s been the automatic response in most of the world. It’s undeniably effective, and an overwhelmingly popular approach. So Finance Minister Carole James committed Tuesday to carrying on. But her fiscal update vividly illustrated what the government is up against.

article continues below

Her February budget was balanced, with a few hundred million in reserve.

The new estimate is a deficit this year of $12.5 billion, the biggest ever, and one that developed almost instantly.

That’s not a forecast. The situation is so wildly unpredictable they’ve give up doing forecasts. They’re just “scenarios” now. So it could go higher.

As James said: “That's why we've developed a scenario, rather than a typical forecast, because of the unprecedented nature of COVID-19 and the uncertainty regarding the magnitude of the economic decline caused by the pandemic.”

She’s acknowledged there will be deficits for at least the next three years. But it’s more likely to be a decade or more.

(Two years ago officials marked the elimination of just one component of B.C.’s debt, the operating debt stemming mostly from accumulated deficits. It took 40 years to accomplish that.)

The federal government did a similar update last week. Its projected deficit of $34 billion has jumped to $343 billion because of the pandemic.

So the on-going federal-provincial plan to keep helping people is based on borrowing more and more money to pay for it.

Rock-bottom interest rates will ease some concern about the hole they’re digging.

And there are projections that the economic collapse will only last for a year. So an optimistic outlook would be a one-year catastrophe followed by a bounce back in 2021, followed by years of whittling deficits back down to size.

Government finances obviously depend entirely on the private sector economy. James’ briefing included an exhaustive list of crises in different sectors.

Roughly half the new deficit is the new spending to help people cope ($5 billion in direct aid, $1.3 billion in deferred taxes and extensions). The other half arises from a collapse in government revenues.

There is a billion less in personal income tax, another billion less in corporate income tax and $1.3 billion less in sales tax, as examples. That’s all due to retail sales dropping 24 per cent, home sales down 45 per cent, 235,000 fewer jobs, corporate profits down 36 per cent and a seven to eight per cent drop in the provincial GDP, all in the last five months.

“No one has a playbook for dealing with this,” James said. So the plan they’ve fashioned is based on the fervent hope this is a one-year nightmare.

She has plans to announce a “recovery plan framework” in September, which would outline the expectations for how $1.5 billion in stimulus spending might be used.

But all the “scenarios” depend on the COVID-19 daily counts. Any sustained increases or outbreaks could delay recovery plans. That would make economic calamity even grimmer and more protracted than it already is.

Whatever the virus does in the next while, COVID-19 will be around for years as an economic factor.

Just So You Know: James spent 60 minutes detailing the extent of the economic catastrophe. She ran through 24 slides showing devastating impacts on every single aspect of the economy.

But the official news release covering her update was a study in deliriously-upbeat positivity. It was headed: “B.C.’s strong fiscal response, economic foundation support people.”

It rehashed all the previous good news announcements, ignored all the alarms and buried the stunning news there “could be” a $12.5 billion deficit.

It’s probably a firing offence for communications staff to write anything that leaves a negative impression in these sorts of releases.

But in a world where governments are spending more than ever, getting their own news out and covering themselves on all platforms as they see fit, the release is a reminder: It’s good to get an independent view.

Amendments to the Workers Compensation Act would increase the maximum insurable earnings to $100,000 from $87,100.

article continues below

The government says it is aiming for at least 90 per cent of workers to have 100 per cent of their earnings covered if they are can't work because of an injury suffered on the job.

The bill would also allow the safety agency to obtain search and seizure warrants when it investigates workplace safety infractions, if authorized by a court.

As well, it would allow victim impact statements to be heard in court in serious workplace prosecutions.

Labour Minister Harry Bains said the changes will help injured workers and their families, while also giving WorkSafeBC more tools to investigate workplace incidents.

""This bill makes modest but important improvements to several aspects of British Columbia's workers compensation system,"" Bains told the legislature.

The legislation would strengthen the way occupational diseases caused by viral pathogens are handled by fast-tracking the presumption for when a virus was contracted on the job, if established by WorkSafeBC's board of directors.

The government says this would mean people who are at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 at work are able to get benefits more quickly.

It would also expedite health care for a worker before a claim is accepted in cases when treatment would likely prevent a significant deterioration in health.

The government says in a statement that the legislation would allow WorkSafeBC to adjust a one-year time limit on mental health claims because it ""is not realistic for most workers, given the delay or gradual onset of some mental disorders.""

The amendments to the Workers Compensation Act were developed after three expert reviews, which included consultations with employer, labour and Indigenous organizations.

The government says it also considered systems that are in place elsewhere in Canada and took into account the possible effects of the changes on employer premium rates.

More than 100,000 new claims are made in B.C. every year due to workplace injuries or fatalities, the government says.

There were 140 workplace fatalities last year, with 84 of them caused by occupational disease, 40 by traumatic injury and 16 the result of a motor vehicle incident.

The province says WorkSafeBC conducted 141 investigations in 2019.

Exactly one week ago, on July 7, the province recorded 12 new cases. What followed was an uptick in recorded cases:

• 18 new cases on July 8;

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12; and

• 21 new cases on July 13.

""I know it was distressing to me to see 20, especially 25 [new cases] one day,"" Henry said. ""That's way above my comfort zone.""

She added, however, that the slight rise in cases was not unexpected, given that the province has been allowing restaurants and other indoor businesses to reopen.

""We do know where those cases are,"" she said. ""We're testing the people who need to be tested.""

It would be more concerning, she said, if the cases were spread out across the province in an unlinked way. The most recent cluster of cases is linked to the Krazy Cherry Fruit Company in Oliver, she announced yesterday (July 13).

Given B.C.'s population, 20 cases in one day is also better than some other jurisdictions, she said.

The province has identified 3,128 infections since the virus first appeared in the province in late January.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,015 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1649 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 212 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 52 people who reside outside Canada.

Of the 209 people currently fighting COVID-19 in B.C., 14 people are in hospital with five of those in intensive care units. That leaves 2,730 people who have recovered from the virus.

No new deaths from the virus were identified in the past 24 hours, leaving the death toll at 189 people.

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

So far 399 residents and 252 staff at seniors' care facilities have been infected by COVID-19 in B.C.

Health Minister Adrian Dix said that it is his understanding that the federal government and the U.S. government have agreed to extend the closure of the two countries' border for one additional month, until August 21.

""This is obviously positive and necessary news,"" he said. ""Everybody who lives in B.C. knows how inconvenient and how difficult that is for many businesses and many individuals for a variety of circumstances.""

In a fiscal update Tuesday, B.C. Finance Minister Carole James said the COVID-19 pandemic will result in ""the worst downturn experienced in our province in recent history.""

article continues below

""The projected numbers are staggering, but they're not without hope,"" James said, in summing up B.C.'s fiscal position.

She said B.C. had entered the pandemic perhaps better situated than other provinces, as it had a balanced budget, a triple AAA credit rating and one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country.

B.C. also managed to contain the pandemic and flatten its growth curve better than some other provinces, and it has been able to move earlier on a phased economic restart plan.

""Because of that strength, we were able to take immediate action to help people, to help businesses, to help communities with our $5 billion COVID action plan,"" James said.

She said the province is expecting a loss of $4.2 billion in tax revenue, including $1 billion less in personal income tax revenue, $973 million less in corporate taxes, $1.3 billion in provincial sales tax revenue, $300 million in natural resource revenues and $882 million less in Crown Corporation income.

The province is also spending $5 billion in emergency spending, and has approved $1.3 billion in tax credits and deferrals. In total, the increased spending, lost tax revenue and foregone revenue will bring the deficit to $12.5 billion.

In February, James brought down, but never passed, a balanced budget and modest surplus of $227 million and provincial GDP growth projections of 2% in 2020.

""Mere weeks after the budget 2020 was tabled, our entire world changed,"" James said.

James said the B.C. economy is now expected to contract 6.8% in 2020, according to some forecasters.

Since February, B.C. lost 235,000 jobs, and saw retail sales declined by 23.6% in April compared to February. Overall, home prices dropped 4%.

Home sales declined 45.4% in May, compared to February, and B.C. merchandise exports are down 14.7% year-to-date, compared to January to May 2019.

""While the job losses in March and April were record-breaking, figures for May and June in fact have seen some recovery of the losses that we experienced in the previous two months,"" James said.

Asked if her government planned to resort to spending cuts to address the deficit, James said ""now is not the time to be able to cut back on services and support for people and business in British Columbia.""

As for any long-range plans for dealing with debt and deficits, James said: ""I do not believe that it's going to be a quick fix.""

Asked if the $5 billion that her government has already approved could be added to later this year, James said ""I believe the $5 billion is enough now.""

However, she added no one can predict what might happen should there be a second wave of COVID-19.

As for the $22 billion in capital spending allocated in the 2020 budget over three years for big capital works projects, like new schools, hospitals, bridges and roads, that will continue to be spent.

""This is going to serve us very well because it translates into huge investments,"" James said.

According to the survey released on Tuesday, 19.3 per cent of businesses could operate at their current level of sales and spending for less than six months but would have to take additional action if it lasts for a longer duration. Nearly 35 per cent of hotels and restaurants only have the runway for six more months of lockdown measures, says the survey conducted May 29 to July 3.

The results come as many businesses are looking at government programs or credit to remain afloat.

Almost 64 per cent of survey respondents said they were approved for outside credit or government funding programs such as Canada Emergency Business Account loans or wage subsidies. Less than 24 per cent of businesses said in the survey that their rent or mortgage payments were deferred during the pandemic.

While working from home has increased during the pandemic, only about a quarter of survey respondents indicated they would likely offer teleworking as an option going forward after COVID-19 spread is contained.

The version released on Tuesday was a follow-up to a crowd-sourced questionnaire on the Statistics Canada website, a collaboration launched in April, with the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, that surveyed 12,600 businesses. The sample was not designed to reflect the overall Canadian economy.

The Canada-U.S. border has been closed to ""discretionary"" travel like vacations and shopping trips since the pandemic took hold of the continent in mid-March, a rolling 30-day agreement that's currently set to expire July 21.

article continues below

Officials on both sides of the border who are familiar with the ongoing talks, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss matters not yet public, say another extension until late August is all but inevitable, thanks to a towering wave of new COVID-19 cases that's swamping efforts to restore a modicum of normality in the U.S.

New York Rep. Brian Higgins, one of several members of Congress from northern states keen to see a plan for reopening the border, expressed dismay Tuesday at news he called disappointing but hardly surprising.

""With no leadership from President Trump to address the pandemic, cases in the United States are spiking and as a result U.S. citizens are not welcome in several countries around the globe, including many of our allies,"" Higgins, a Democrat, said in a statement.

Recent calls from Higgins and others for a plan to start easing border restrictions have been greeted with social-media scorn and derision in Canada, where recent polls make clear the idea of allowing entry to Americans any time soon is a non-starter.

The novel coronavirus has been particularly resurgent in southern states like Florida, Texas, Georgia and Louisiana, where businesses tried to reopen early, contrary to the advice of public health officials, and the wearing of face masks became a partisan issue.

""The U.S. and Canada should be developing a plan that lays out what continued, nuanced management of the border during a prolonged pandemic will look like,"" Higgins said.

""But the administration's failure to develop a national plan for widespread testing, (personal protective equipment) distribution and the rejection of social distancing and mask-wearing to slow the spread doesn't inspire confidence that such a plan is in the works.""

Wearing a mask, perhaps the simplest way to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus, has evolved into one of the most complex and flummoxing points of division in the U.S., thanks in part to conflicting signals early in the crisis about its effectiveness and the obvious reluctance of the commander-in-chief to embrace the idea.

It was only just this past weekend — nearly four months into the crisis — that Trump himself was photographed wearing one in public, during a visit with wounded service members at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.

Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, urged Americans to mask up Monday, saying facial coverings for everyone in the country would break the pandemic's back in less than two months.

""It's our major defence to prevent ourselves from getting this infection,"" Redfield told a news conference in Charlotte, N.C. ""If all of us would put on a face covering now for the next four weeks, six weeks, I think we could drive this epidemic into the ground.""

Paradoxically, new online polling from Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies suggests the idea of mandatory masking in public is more popular in the U.S. than it is in Canada.

Leger's latest online poll, conducted July 10 to 12, found 72 per cent of 1,001 American respondents supported the idea of mandatory masks indoors, compared with 67 per cent of the survey's 1,523 Canadian participants. Of those surveyed in the U.S., 41 per cent said they would consider it a violation of their personal freedoms, compared with 27 per cent of those in Canada.

""Americans are far more likely to agree that rights are at issue,"" said ACS president Jack Jedwab. ""Yet, despite the fact that Americans strongly agree that the mask requirement is a rights infringement, they nonetheless believe that mask wearing should be mandatory.""

Trump appears to be capitulating on other border issues as well: on Tuesday, facing a lawsuit from Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the administration abandoned a controversial measure that would have forced international students whose courses move entirely online to either transfer schools or leave the country.

That news likely comes as a relief to untold thousands of Canadian students studying south of the border, many of whom have been forced into virtual classrooms with colleges and universities having cancelled in-person classes.

Dr. Howard Njoo, Canada's deputy chief public health officer, was reluctant Tuesday to discuss the worsening COVID-19 situation in the U.S. in any detail.

But he said cross-border travel in a public health emergency is usually a matter of ensuring that both countries have a similar grip on the circumstances, taking into account factors like their respective health-care systems, testing and contact-tracing regimes and strategies for preventing transmission.

Given that a number of U.S. states are experiencing community transmission of COVID-19 and don't have the situation under control, it will likely be weeks or even months before the benefits of additional preventative steps become apparent.

""It will take some time,"" Njoo said. ""If I were to travel anywhere, I would stick to Canada for the time being.""

Bruce Clark, president and CEO of the biopharmaceutical company Medicago, cautions observers against holding unrealistic assumptions that his product — or any of the numerous vaccine hopefuls in development globally — can bring the pandemic to a screeching halt if proven viable.

article continues below

Clark notes more than 120 companies are trying to come up with a COVID-19 vaccine, many of which have never been in the vaccine space before.

He doesn't doubt that ""something's going to come out of this,"" but he questions how effective it may be.

""Whatever vaccine we get in this first round — unless it's a miracle — it's not going to be perfect,"" says Clark, whose company began trials for its proposed vaccine Monday in Quebec City.

""It's going to have to undergo development, it's going to take probably years to come up with an understanding of the right vaccine, the right approach. It's not the panacea.

""To assume that we can have, in 18 months, the solution to a pandemic that comes around once in a generation, is naive.""

Canada's deputy public health officer Dr. Howard Njoo expressed similar cautions Tuesday, while acknowledging the need to develop viable vaccines and therapies.

""Lots of different steps are still ahead of us before we might even anticipate that there might be a safe, effective vaccine that would be available for use in the general population,"" said Njoo.

So much is still unknown about COVID-19, notes Clark, including how it may manifest during the flu season later this year.

He suspects a more likely scenario is that a vaccine will offer only part of the solution, along with new therapeutics and ongoing public health interventions.

Medicago's first phase of clinical trials will test the safety of a plant-based product on 180 healthy men and women, aged 18 to 55.

The randomized, partially blinded study uses technology that does not involve animal products or live viruses like traditional methods.

Clark notes that vaccine developers typically use chicken eggs to propagate a virus, but Medicago uses recombinant technology involving the genetic sequence of a virus, with living plants as the host.

The resulting virus-like particles mimic the shape and dimensions of a virus, which allows the body to recognize them and spark an immune response.

Clark says the plant-based approach is significantly faster and offers more consistent results than egg-based or cell-based methods.

It's the same method Medicago has used for a proposed seasonal flu vaccine that Clark says is currently being reviewed by Health Canada. If approved, Clark says it would be the first plant-based vaccine in the world.

While it takes five to six months to propagate a virus in eggs, the plant-based technique requires just five to six weeks, he says.

""In a pandemic, something like COVID, if you're able to cut that much time off development, you have a substantial impact on public health.""

Meanwhile, Clark says viruses are prone to mutations as they adapt and grow in an egg, which could result in a vaccine that doesn't exactly match the circulating virus. In contrast, ""a plant is a plant,"" and that makes production easily scalable.

""One plant behaves like 100,000 plants,"" he says.

The trial will evaluate three different dosages alone, or with one of two adjuvants provided by GlaxoSmithKline and Dynavax. An adjuvant can boost the effectiveness of a vaccine for a better immunological response, thereby reducing the required dose, Clark adds.

He hopes to know the safety of the product, as well as effectiveness of the adjuvants and dosing by October. Based on that, researchers would kick off a second, more targeted trial phase involving about 1,000 participants.

If that's successful, Clark says a third phase would involve about 15,000 to 20,000 subjects, include older cohorts, and may be a global study, depending on circumstances of the pandemic by then.

If the vaccine proves effective, Clark points to another uncertainty.

Because the company's commercial plant is across the border in Durham, N.C., he says there's no guarantee of a Canadian supply.

""'Guarantee' is a strong word,"" says Clark. ""Strange things happen to borders in the context of a pandemic.""

Such border complications were made clear to Canadians in April when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau complained about problems with incomplete or non-existent deliveries of critical COVID-19 supplies. At the time, U.S. President Donald Trump ordered U.S. producers to prioritize the domestic market.

Clark suggests similar hurdles could impact vaccine distribution, putting immediate pressure on Medicago to complete construction of a large-scale manufacturing facility in its home base of Quebec City.

""Certainly, we need a facility in Canada,"" Clark says.

""There's no guarantee on the easy flow of materials back and forth across the border should we have a successful vaccine. We have to keep the focus on completing the Canadian facility so that we have domestic capacity. I think this is what most countries are concerned about.""

By the end of 2023, the Quebec City plant is expected to be able to produce up to one billion doses of a COVID-19 vaccine annually.

Until then, Medicago says it expects to be able to make approximately 100 million doses by the end of 2021, assuming its trials are successful.

Clark says countries must temper any nationalist agendas that might emerge with a viable vaccine and acknowledge that the fight against COVID-19 is global.

Meeting that demand would require multiple manufacturers, multiple distribution routes, and lots of co-operation, he says, possibly through the World Health Organization.

""There has to be some ability to share those around and distribute, whether that's through an entity like the WHO, or something equivalent.""

The Liberals last week revealed this year's projected deficit sits at $343 billion, driven by an estimated $231.9 billion in COVID-19 spending, so far, and a massive drop in government revenue.

article continues below

With the deficit at levels not seen since the Second World War, Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies asked 1,523 Canadians whether they felt the government ought to immediately and quickly begin to scale back pandemic support programs to Canadians and to business.

Forty-one per cent said yes to that question, 44 per cent said no and 15 per cent said they didn't know or preferred not to answer.

The survey was conducted between July 10 and 12, just after the Liberals released their projections.

It cannot be assigned a margin of error because online polls are not considered truly random.

This week, the Liberal government announced that one of the biggest benefit programs — a federal wage subsidy — will be extended until the end of this year.

It covers 75 per cent of wages, up to a weekly maximum of $847, for eligible companies and non-profits that have lost at least 30 per cent of their revenues.

""Over the last three months you have seen me come out to talk with Canadians about what we're doing to help you and your family, your employer, your local businesses deal with this pandemic,"" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Monday in announcing the extension.

""We're going to continue to do that vital work.""

As of July 6, the wage subsidy had paid out $18.01 billion to 252,370 companies. Last week's fiscal and economic update from the Liberals increased the overall budget to $82.3 billion.

The other marquee support program, the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit, is set to expire in the fall.

The $500-a-week benefit had, as of July 5, paid out almost $54.8 billion to 8.25 million people.

Of those surveyed, 78 per cent said they were worried about the size of the deficit and how it may affect things in Canada in the long term.

In releasing the deficit projections, the Liberals didn't set out a plan for how or when they might get the books back to balance.

The survey asked respondents which of two routes traditionally use to cut deficits they would support.

In the survey, 60 per cent said the government ought to focus on cutting government spending, while 21 per cent said the focus should be on raising taxes.

“What came next was unprecedented. Mere weeks after Budget 2020 was tabled, our entire world changed.”

The government has provided $6.26 billion in financial aid to businesses and individuals. Among the losses it anticipates this fiscal year because of the pandemic are close to $1 billion in personal income tax, $973 million in corporate income tax and $1.3 billion in provincial sales tax, James said.

The projected GDP decline in 2020 would be the worst on record going back to the 1980s, although it is also projected to increase by 3.1 per cent in 2021.

James said for context, B.C.’s real GDP has only declined twice in the past 40 years, falling by 2.4 per cent in 2009 and 6.4 per cent in 1982.

“As those numbers remind us, this could be the worst downturn experienced in our province recent history,” she said.

B.C.’s restart plan is showing signs of hope for the economy as consumer confidence increases, she said. The unemployment rate is slowly rebounding and fewer wildfires and floods have helped the bottom line.

However, she warned that the province’s financial forecast could change depending on many risk factors, including the possibility of a second wave of infections, the possibility of a vaccine, as well as the success of relief measures and central bank policy.

Regardless of how B.C. copes with the pandemic, James said its economy is also subject to the economic health of other jurisdictions, particularly those that buy from the province.

James said it wouldn’t help the economic recovery to pull back on spending, but the government will review every cent spent as it heads into the next budget year.

The B.C. government has tabled legislation giving itself room for three years of deficits, which James said will be re-examined each year.

James said she believes people care about provincial deficits because they understand it’s taxpayer money, but they also understand the emergency the pandemic created.

She declined to predict how long the recovery would take, given the many moving pieces at play.

“There is no question that COVID-19 has had a profound impact on the economy of British Columbia and that’s not short term,” she said.

The job losses have been widespread but some have been disproportionately affected, depending on a worker’s age, gender or which sector they work in, James said.

Young workers are among the hardest hit, with the unemployment rate rising sharply from 9.1 per cent in February to 29.1 per cent in June for those aged 15 to 24.

Women, who dominate the service industries and many of whom have also left jobs to care for family members, are another group more affected. Their unemployment rate rose from 4.8 per cent in February to 13.4 per cent in June.

The hardest hit industries include wholesale and retail, accommodation and food services, construction, culture and recreation.

The overall unemployment rate of 13 per cent remains at its highest level since 1987. While the job losses in March and April were record breaking, the figures for May and June have seen modest recovery as the economy started to reopen.

“The projected numbers are staggering but they’re not without hope. Things are getting better each and every day when we follow the provincial health officer’s advice,” James said.

The NDP government’s fiscal update was met with calls for an economic recovery plan by its political opponents, with the Opposition B.C. Liberals asking what happens when federal benefits like the Canada Emergency Response Benefit run out.

Liberal Leader Andrew Wilkinson also suggested the government should reconsider its pre-pandemic spending priorities.

“People in every corner of B.C. have had to adjust to a new normal and adapt their household budgets, so why is this government pretending it’s business as usual?” he asked in a statement.

The Green party said the province should transition to a green economy by helping traditional industries become more sustainable, spending on training and building local businesses into the supply chain.

“We can seize the once in a generation opportunity to strategically drive stimulus spending towards a future British Columbians want: an innovative, low-carbon, sustainable, just and inclusive economy for all,” interim leader Adam Olsen said.

There have been two deaths since Friday attributed to COVID-19. While there have been no new community outbreaks in long-term care or acute care facilities, there have been a number of community exposure events in the Okanagan.

Public health has issued an isolation order for the Krazy Cherry Fruit Co. in Oliver, where two cases have been identified at the farm. Interior Health has also issued alerts for possible community exposure events in Kelowna.

The authorization would have expired July 15.

Prior to the measure, restaurants and bars were in general only allowed to sell liquor for consumption at their establishments. The sale of alcohol for off-site consumption has provided businesses with an additional source of revenue during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The province is also extending an authorization that allows for increased hours of retail liquor service. Extended hours will remain in place until August 31.

The agency previously reported that year-over-year inflation declined by 0.2 per cent in April, then took a further drop of 0.4 per cent in May as lockdowns put a damper on consumer spending.

article continues below

But a look under the headline figures showed consumers were spending more on items that don't weigh as much in the consumer price index, which tracks inflation. And they were spending less on things that weigh more in the calculation.

In a numbers experiment to better reflect pandemic spending, Statistics Canada found the annualized inflation figures for April and May would have been 0.0 and -0.1 per cent.

The research paper made public Monday says a specific consumption pattern, such as that happening during the pandemic, would need ""to be sustained in order to have a subsequent impact"" on year-over-year headline numbers.

The research was aided by data from the Bank of Canada, which targets an annual inflation rate of two per cent as measured by Statistics Canada's consumer price index.

The bank has warned that the economic shock wrought by COVID-19 and structurally low interest rates is having a deep effect on the inflation rate, which is far below the target.

The basket of goods used to form the consumer price index has been shaken by a shift in consumer spending habits during the pandemic.

People are buying less gasoline, which usually receives a heavier weight in calculating inflation, as its price has plunged and the frequency of car travel has dropped. Canadians are travelling much less, while grocery-buying is up.

Statistics Canada is to report June's inflation rate next week.

The Bank of Canada said in April that it expected inflation to be close to zero in the second quarter.

Beyond the end of June, the bank was less clear, citing the high level of uncertainty around the course of the pandemic.

The federal government's economic ""snapshot"" last week pegged inflation at 0.5 per cent for this year, then rising back to two per cent in 2021.

The reading was based on the average of forecasts from 13 private sector economists.

On Wednesday, the central bank will release its updated outlook. Governor Tiff Macklem has described what's coming as a ""central planning scenario"" for the economy and inflation, as well as related risks — such as local, but not national, lockdowns.

Indigenous communities closed during pandemic but at economic cost,['Nick Wells'],,"Indigenous bands along the west coast of British Columbia say their borders will remain closed to tourists and non-residents, despite the economic impact, as they work to raise awareness about the threat COVID-19 poses to their communities.

The Nuu-chah-nulth, the Heiltsuk Nation and the Haida Nation have all closed or restricted access to their territories and reserves.

article continues below

""Of course it's negatively impacting. But our directors have said, our chiefs have said, people before economics,"" said Judith Sayers, the president of the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council, in an interview. ""I think everyone is slowly realizing the impact economically, but right now we just really feel that we want to protect the members first.""

Members of the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council, made up of 14 First Nations along the west coast of Vancouver Island, have deployed a variety of tactics to help ensure their borders are kept sealed from non-residents.

Members of the Ahousaht First Nation, who live in the remote area of Flores Island, have deputized citizens to act as peacekeeping officers, Sayers said.

The Ahousaht issued a notice on July 2 that their territory, which covers a large area of land and water north of Tofino, including provincial parks, will remain closed to tourists and non-residents as there ""is still no vaccine, no anti-serum and no cure for COVID-19.""

Others, like the Tla-o-qui-aht in Tofino, had been stopping cars in an effort to convince them to turn around.

While Tofino is now welcoming back visitors, the Tla-o-qui-aht communities of Ty-Histanis, Esowista and Opitsaht remain closed to those who haven't been invited. The closure includes part of Long Beach in Pacific Rim National Park.

The concern, Sayers says, lies in the ability to test and contain any potential COVID-19 outbreak.

""A lot of our communities are remote and testing is not easily available,"" she said. ""If you're in Port Alberni, or Nanaimo, or Victoria, or somewhere (else), you can get testing and get results in 24 hours. It's not the same with our communities.""

The closures have resulted in disputes between Indigenous groups and local businesses.

The Haida Nation in Haida Gwaii have turned away non-residents at the ferry terminal, discouraged leisure travel and called on two local fishing lodges to rethink their reopening plans.

""We're such a close-knit community, I think that once we get a case of COVID, I think that it'll spread like wildfire,"" said Duffy Edgars, the chief councillor of the Old Massett Village council in Haida Gwaii.

Edgars said many local fishing lodges are respecting the Haida Nation's state of emergency, but is frustrated by others who want to open up.

""It's disrespectful,"" he said. ""These bigger (lodges) are coming in and just doing whatever they want.""

The fishing lodges that have opened say visitors and staff will not have contact with the Haida Gwaii communities, and they have emergence evacuation plans in place if a COVID-19 case were to develop.

Leaders and representatives from the Nuu-chah-nulth, Heiltsuk and Haida all say they would like to see more co-operation from the provincial government in working with Indigenous communities.

""It's really frustrating,"" said Marilyn Slett, the chief councillor of the Heiltsuk. ""We have a limited amount of time here, we think, before that anticipated second or third wave so right now is the time for us to be sitting down and having those discussions so going forward we're all working collaboratively together.""

Part of the issue, she says, lies in B.C. politicians encouraging residents to take part in inter-provincial tourism.

""We're seeing a lot more vessel traffic on the coast, we're seeing a lot more recreational boaters, and that's a really high concern for our community,"" said Slett.

The closures — many of which began in March — have been felt at a variety of levels.

The pandemic forced the cancellation of the Heiltsuk's Spawn-on-Kelp fishery this year, an event Slett says employs 700 people and is a hugely important economic driver for the community.

""Certainly our community put forward the health and safety before the economic driver,"" she said. ""So our community has been hit hard.""

Sayers says when the pandemic first broke out and restrictions were placed on communities, First Nations were bringing in food for members so they didn't have to leave their reserves and face possible exposure at grocery stores.

The Heiltsuk, Nuu-chah-Nulth and the Tsilhqot'in issued a statement in late June, criticizing the provincial government's reopening plan and what they saw as a lack of dialogue with First Nations groups.

All three want the province to commit to four conditions, which would allow border restrictions being lifted: COVID-19 information sharing, screening, rapid testing and culturally safe contact tracing teams.

Until those are met, Slett says, she can't see Indigenous communities fully opening their borders.

But the provincial government says it is committed to working with Indigenous communities.

""Many tourist-depending communities are now safely welcoming the gradual return of out-of-town visitors,"" said Sarah Plank, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation. ""At the same time, we acknowledge some smaller and more remote communities and First Nations continue to be concerned about visitors to their communities.""

The government is also working on scheduling a meeting with the Nuu-chah-nulth, Tsilquot'in, Heiltsuk and Haida Nations and other communities, she added.

Why it matters: The program brings cost relief to businesses hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, and is intended to support employment.

article continues below

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologized on Monday for not recusing himself from discussions about the administration of Ottawa's $900 million student volunteer program.

WE Charity was initially selected to deliver the initiative under a nearly $20 million contract. Trudeau said he was aware of his family's ties to the organization, but unaware of the honorariums his mother and brother received for their involvement.

""It is not a surprise to me that they got paid by WE, but I did not know that they got paid by WE,"" Trudeau said.

""In this situation, I should have recused myself,"" he added, acknowledging that his involvement in Ottawa's student volunteer program has created controversy. Members of the Conservative Party of Canada have called on Trudeau to address his involvement before Ottawa's ethics committee.

""I get that. I made a mistake in not recusing myself immediately from the discussion.""

Trudeau said he will evaluate any requests to address the issue before parliament. He also said that, because of his involvement, the rollout of the student volunteer program has been a bit delayed – an outcome he deeply regrets.

In addition to addressing the issue, Trudeau said on Monday that the federal government will extend its wage subsidy program until the end of the year. More information on the extension is expected this week.

The prime minister also said he spoke with U.S. president Donald Trump earlier in the day about the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement – which took effect July 1, – Black Lives Matter, China, the two Canadians who remain detained in China and U.S. aluminum tariffs.

""I highlighted to the president that the pandemic has disrupted usual manufacturing processes and supply chains,"" said Trudeau. ""It would be a shame to see tariffs come in between our two countries at a time when we're celebrating the new NAFTA.""

Trudeau briefly told reporters to expect a joint announcement regarding the closure of the Canada-U.S. border.

Non-essential travel across the border is banned until late July.

But the government is being warned it may have to move the end date into 2021.

article continues below

The program is the heart of the Liberals' promise to help Canadians get back to work, even if has to be at a slower pace, as the pandemic wanes.

Speaking outside his Ottawa residence, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the extension to give ""greater certainty and support to businesses as we restart the economy.""

Trudeau didn't say how the government will reshape the eligibility rules for the program that critics have said stop some employers from getting aid they need.

He promised more details in the coming days.

While some companies are back open with restrictions easing, other parts of the economy are still reeling from the effects of COVID-19.

Some sectors will only start up in the fall or even the winter and will need help into next year, said Ross Laver, senior vice-president for strategy at the Business Council of Canada. He pointed to airlines as one example where rehiring may be slow.

""I don't think anybody expects that those industries that have been really hard-hit, that everything is going to be fine by Dec. 31,"" he said.

""We need to bear in mind that some of them are going to need help for an extended period of time.""

The wage subsidy previously was to expire the first week of June but the Liberals announced an extension to the end of August in mid-May.

The government has yet to share eligibility requirements for July.

Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said the extension would be welcomed by many small companies that have seen costs return faster than revenues.

He also pressed the need for eligibility rules to understand how to qualify.

""Not a single employer in Canada understands whether they qualify for the July wage subsidy and we're in mid-July. So they need to do an awful lot better,"" Kelly said.

""It sounds great to have an announcement to extend the subsidy, but businesses in order to use it really need to understand whether they would qualify and what the rules of the game are.""

The program covers 75 per cent of wages, up to a weekly maximum of $847, for eligible companies and non-profits. Companies must show a 30-per-cent drop in revenues, a cliff that may discourage companies from growing, lest they find themselves suddenly cut off from federal aid.

""You don't want people to think that you get over the threshold and then automatically lose"" the subsidy, said Hassan Yussuff, president of the Canadian Labour Congress.

Yussuff also said the extension would bring some stability to reopening phases, and likely bolster job gains seen over May and June.

Last week, Finance Minister Bill Morneau hinted at changes to revenue-reduction thresholds when he spoke about reducing ""disincentives to growth"" in the program.

Kelly said the government could consider a graduated approach with smaller subsidies at lower levels of revenue loss, or dropping the requirement altogether, either of which would give employers the confidence to rehire faster, Kelly said.

The Liberals originally saw the wage subsidy as the key tool in helping cushion the economic blow from COVID-19 by helping workers stay tied to their employers so businesses could get back to normal quickly once lockdowns lifted.

The pace of spending on the program has been below expectations, with $18 billion paid to 252,370 companies as of July 6.

Instead, the budget for the program dropped as more workers accessed the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) for people who lost their jobs or nearly all their hours.

The $500-a-week benefit had, as of July 5, paid out almost $54.8 billion to 8.25 million people.

The budget for that program is now at $80 billion, but it's scheduled to end in the fall. Yussuff said the government needs to soon release details on how workers without jobs will transition to the employment insurance system, which was largely supplanted by the CERB.

The government's fiscal and economic ""snapshot"" last week boosted the cost of the wage subsidy program to $82.3 billion from $45 billion, in a sign of impending changes.

Perrin Beatty, president of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, said changes to the wage subsidy ""must encourage Canadians to transition"" off the CERB, and ""create a positive incentive to return to work.""

The July 8 fiscal update noted that small employers make up the largest share of approved wage subsidy applications, with the largest numbers of employees covered in manufacturing, accommodation and food services.

The ""snapshot"" also said men may be ""slightly more likely"" to be covered than women although there aren't firm numbers to rely on.

Adrian Dix said during a news conference Monday that warnings of possible exposures at a restaurant, spin studio, bed and breakfast and resort are believed to stem from ""private parties"" at the hotels.

Eight positive tests for the disease are linked to visits to downtown Kelowna and the city's waterfront between June 25 and July 9, said an email from Interior Health, the regional health authority.

""When people come together for private parties — in this case it was primarily people in their 20s and 30s — the risks are considerably higher,"" Dix said.

The exposures follow the move to a new phase of reopening in B.C. that allows for tourism within the province. Although the accommodation industry was not ordered to close during the pandemic, many operators did so voluntarily but began welcoming guests again as part of the new phase.

Infections in B.C. inched up on Monday as health officials announced 62 new cases since Friday.

Two more people also died for a total of 189 deaths in B.C.

The new figures bring the total number of confirmed cases in the province to 3,115, while 2,718 people have fully recovered from COVID-19.

Interior Health also issued an isolation order for Krazy Cherry Fruit Co. in Oliver after two positive tests associated with the farm. Public health officials are monitoring the situation and placed restrictions on those living and working on the farm, the government said in a news release.

The cases linked to Kelowna involved people who live in three regions of the province, including the Interior, Fraser and Vancouver Coastal Health regions, said Dix. He credited contact tracers with making the connections.

He said the tourism industry has done a good job of creating safe environments for guests, but it's also up to guests to ensure they respect physical distancing guidelines and group size limitations.

""Whether it's a trip or a party at home, the same risks and the same rules apply,"" Dix said.

If you're gathering with friends and family, you should consider the increased risk that indoor locations pose and determine how many people can maintain a safe distance accordingly, he said.

""We have got to live with COVID-19 for the next year so that means the responsibility is on all of us to understand the risks and understand our responsibilities to one another.""

Interior Health issued an exposure advisory for the resort and bed and breakfast on Friday and added the restaurant and spin studio in a statement on Sunday.

Visitors to the Boyce Gyro Beach Lodge on July 1 or the Discovery Bay Resort from July 1 to July 5 were advised to self-isolate and monitor themselves closely for symptoms.

The health authority is now urging visitors to Kelowna's Cactus Club restaurant on Water Street between July 3 and July 6, or the Pace Spin Studio on July 2, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9 to self-monitor and get tested if COVID-19 symptoms appear.

The B.C. Centre for Disease Control also warns that a case or cases were confirmed on an Air Canada flight from Kelowna to Vancouver on July 6, but Dix could not say if that warning was linked.

Public health contact tracing is underway and the health authority said it's reaching out directly to anyone who has been exposed, where possible.

Testing is recommended for anyone with novel coronavirus symptoms, including fever, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, or a loss of taste or smell, said Interior Health.

""Milder symptoms may include runny nose, fatigue, body aches ... diarrhea, headache, sore throat, vomiting and red eyes,"" it said in a statement.

Anyone with even mild symptoms is urged to stay home and avoid travel.

Efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19 include physical distancing, regular hand washing, not touching the face and avoiding gatherings of more than 50 people, the health authority said.

Powell River-Sunshine Coast MLA Nicholas Simons has been adapting to new ways of carrying out democracy, mandated by regulations required to cope with the pandemic.

article continues below

Simons said he is going to be attending the legislature next week for the first time in what is being called a hybrid session. He said this means some people are in Victoria and others are functioning in their communities via videoconferencing.

“It’s very busy and there are a lot of issues that are related directly to the pandemic that I assist with when I can,” said Simons. “There continue to be issues for me relative to other sectors, including, of course, ferries, forestry and other ongoing interests.”

Simons said up until now, every day the legislature sits, he has been going onto Zoom and participating in the debate. He said if he is rostered to be doing his chamber duty in the legislature, such as next week, he simply attends in Victoria, where the number of MLAs has been substantially reduced due to physical distancing and maximum assembly numbers.

He said one significant change in legislative business has been the voting schedule. Rather than votes taking place during the day, they all get lined up and voted on at the end of the day, negating the need for everyone to be at their computer constantly from 10 am to 6:30 pm. The system, for the most part, has been working well, although there is the occasional glitch, said Simons.

There was one situation where the MLA who was voting remotely could not be heard, and so the clerk at the table phoned the member and got confirmation regarding the member’s vote.

Simons said those running and coordinating the hybrid system have done an “amazing job.” There are four screens in the legislative chamber and those in that setting can see members participating from their constituencies.

Simons said this is the first time a hybrid form of parliament has been conducted, so once again, BC is leading the way.

He said Question Period has taken on a new dimension because the chamber is not packed with close-together bodies “stuffed like sardines.” He said the opposition still has the opportunity to ask questions and the government has the chance to explain its actions on issues.

“It’s important for democracy,” said Simons.

When asked if British Columbians were being well served by the new system, Simons said: “I hope so. We’re making every effort to adjust the needs of our communities. There are challenges that everybody is facing.

“What we have to continue to do is figure out how government can best help our communities, our businesses, our industries and get to the challenges that are lying before us.”

Simons said with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the incredible focus by health minister Adrian Dix, and his dedication to the issue, has served the province well. He added that Dr. Bonnie Henry, as provincial health officer, has all of the necessary abilities to give confidence to the public.

“In this kind of situation, when you have dedicated people, incredible changes have been made to our health system,” said Simons. “We were prepared for the worst and we managed to relay good medical advice and the vast majority of people adhered to the recommendations and continue to do so.

“The message is as important today as it has always been. I’m completely confident that our government and our health officer have done their absolute best and the statistics indicate that we have been an outlier in our success.”

The new normal in the legislature has no horizon. Simons said the impact of COVID-19 will be present for a while.

“We are doing what we need to do,” he added, “and everybody recognizes that British Columbia can continue to stay strong.”",[]

The province said in a document released in late April that Stage 3 would include ""opening all workplaces responsibly"" and ""further relaxing the restrictions on public gatherings.""

The document didn't get into specifics, though it did say restrictions would remain on large gatherings such as concerts and sporting events.

Meanwhile, health officials in Quebec, the epicentre of the pandemic in Canada, are concerned about a spike in COVID-19 cases in Montreal linked to the reopening of the city's bars.

Over the weekend Montreal's public health authority urged patrons and employees who have frequented bars since Canada Day to get tested for the coronavirus.

Quebec reported 114 new COVID-19 infections Sunday, boosting its total to 56,521 cases.

The province is to introduce mandatory masks on public transit starting today, with a two-week grace period before users will be denied service as of July 27.

Montreal has also indicated that it intends to bring in mandatory masks for enclosed public spaces as of that date.

On the East Coast, Prince Edward Island is reporting another new case of COVID-19 — a woman in her 80s from Queens County tested positive and is self-isolating at home.

P.E.I. has reported four new cases of the infection since July 4 after being COVID-free during the months of May and June.

Canada's COVID-19 case total currently stands at 107,589, including 8,783 deaths and 71,467 cases considered resolved.

""I can't say no to a good time,"" said Edmonton Oilers fan Jeet Jermana. ""I'd be hard-pressed not to jump into a big party.""

On Friday, the NHL board of governors and NHL Players' Association said they had ratified the return-to-play plan, paving the way for the league to resume its pandemic-hit season later this summer.

Toronto and Edmonton were also officially unveiled as hub cities where all games will be played, beginning Aug. 1. Training camps start Monday in the 24 cities with teams still in the running for the Stanley Cup, including six in Canada.

In 2017, when the Oilers nearly advanced to the Western Conference final, Jermana was among the thousands of fans who partied in Ford Hall at Rogers Place arena and in bars along the popular Whyte Avenue district.

But with COVID-19 this year, where teams will play in empty arenas, Jermana said he'll likely watch more games at home, maybe with just a few friends.

That is, he said, until the Oilers advance and he and other fans won't be able to resist going out.

""Once it becomes the 'real playoffs' I think more and more the momentum will grab,"" he said.

Matt Black of Hotel X Toronto, located west of the city centre where multiple media outlets have reported that several teams will be based, said the prospect of any accommodation for celebratory fan gatherings, even outdoors, seems unlikely.

Nevertheless, Black said he expects citywide excitement will be palpable, even with empty arenas.

""You look back to those scenes of Jurassic Park and Maple Leaf Square and all of that ... it would be great for people to be able to get together again but you just need to make sure that you're doing it in a safe manner,"" said Black.

The players themselves aren't to have any contact with the general public.

Dr. Vinita Dubey, Toronto's associate medical health officer, said in an emailed statement that players and staff arriving from abroad will also have to serve a modified 14-day quarantine as well as undergo rigorous screening and daily testing protocols, wear masks in indoor settings, physically distance and wash hands often.

An Edmonton police spokesperson said the service wouldn't be able to comment over the weekend on what sorts of preparations they might make for crowds when the season resumes.

Geoff Grimble with the City of Edmonton said the city's civic events management team would likely discuss the issue during a scheduled meeting on Monday.

""The City of Edmonton's first priority is public safety and we'll continue to follow the advice and requirements of the Chief Medical Officer of Health to ensure fans, players, coaches and staff remain healthy,"" Grimble said.

Oilers fan Brendan McLeod admitted he may be lured to a street celebration when — not if — his team advances, but said he still wants to maintain physical distancing.

""We have to get through this together or else it's not going to change,"" said McLeod.

But Shadi Merhej, who said he enjoys both hockey and the Oilers, noted the sport doesn't have quite as strong attraction for him in the summer.

""It's daylight 'til 11 o'clock. You don't want to spend half your day watching hockey,"" Merhej explained.

""I'd rather go for a bike ride, or rollerblade or golf.""

Shaw told reporters on a Zoom conference call that he was ""a little tone deaf"" with the tweets last Friday that were ""out of frustration"" and that he took responsibility for them and didn't want them to become a distraction.

""I apologize for that, at no point was I saying I was going to break the rules or we're going to break the rules,"" Shaw said. ""We know as a team that's not an option and to get through this season, everybody is going to have to buy in and everybody is going to have to adhere to whatever protocols we're set under.""

He noted if other teams don't follow public-health guidelines, the season may be derailed in any case.

Shaw had raised concerns about the length of time players may need to stay in their current environment. He replied to a tweet from TSN reporter Scott Mitchell, who reported that multiple sources told him players could face a $750,000 fine and potential jail time if seen outside the ballpark — which also are the same maximum punishments in the Quarantine Act.

""We were told two weeks... not all summer... all summer is a bit much,"" Shaw tweeted.

In an email reply, the club said arriving in Toronto, players understood the maximum penalties for leaving the Rogers Centre footprint during camp.

""The rules have kind of changed a little bit from when we first got up here, it was the first I was hearing about that we could be possibly be in here all summer,"" Shaw said, adding he should've chosen his words differently.

He explained he'd rented a place one block from the Rogers Centre and had looked forward to taking walks by the water to get away from the game. Living in a hotel was not an ideal situation, he said.

Shaw said Blue Jays management — president Mark Shapiro and general manager Ross Atkins — spoke to players on Saturday about the situation.

""I was a little bit tone-deaf to the situation, I should have said what I said, should have worded it a little bit differently,"" Shaw said. ""I apologize for that, take full responsibility.""

The Blue Jays are training in Toronto while figuring out where to play this coming season as the shortened 60-game schedule starts in less than two weeks.

Ottawa has given the ball club the green light to hold training camp in Toronto, but hasn't made a call on games. No fans will be in the stands.

The Buffalo News reported over the weekend the club had checked in with that city about playing in that city, usually the home of the their triple-A club. Blue Jays officials have said Dunedin, Fla., the club's spring-training facility, is the most likely venue for home games if the team can't play in Toronto.

For his part, Shaw said he and his teammates are hopeful Toronto is the club's home this season.

He noted that weather and the COVID situation in Florida means that Dunedin would put the Blue Jays at a competitive disadvantage.

The Blue Jays are slated to open the season July 24 at Tampa Bay. The home opener is July 29 against the Washington Nationals.

Shaw said he doesn't foresee opting out of the 2020 season, given he was looking to this year as a bounce-back season on a one-year contract after an admittedly poor 2019.

Meanwhile, Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoyo said right-hander Chase Anderson is day-to-day with an oblique strain.

Anderson was projected to be a member of the Blue Jays' five-man starting rotation.

PETERSBURG, Fla. — Florida shattered the national record Sunday for the largest single-day increase in positive coronavirus cases in any state since the beginning of the pandemic, adding more than 15,000 cases as its daily average death toll continued to also rise.

According to state Department of Health statistics, 15,299 people tested positive, for a total of 269,811 cases, and 45 deaths were recorded.

article continues below

California had the previous record of daily positive cases — 11,694, set on Wednesday. New York had 11,571 on April 15.

The numbers come at the end of a grim, record-breaking week as Florida reported 514 fatalities — an average of 73 per day. Three weeks ago, the state was averaging 30 deaths per day. Since the pandemic began in March, 4,346 people have died in Florida of COVID-19, the state says.

Testing has doubled over the last month, going from about 25,000 tests per day to almost 50,000, but the percentage of people testing positive has risen even more dramatically. A month ago, fewer than 5% of tests came up positive on a daily average. Over the past week, the daily average exceeded 19%.

About 10.7% of Saturday’s 143,000 tests came up positive, with an average age of 38. ""I still think we need to increase our testing a little bit more,"" said University of Florida epidemiologist Dr. Cindy Prins, adding that the state and local health departments should ramp up their contact tracing.

Prins said that she's still concerned about large crowds, gyms and some restaurants as being places of mass transmission. Reports of illegal clubs and raves in South Florida is also a worry, she said.

""I really do think we could control this, and it’s the human element that is so critical. It should be an effort of our country. We should be pulling together when we’re in a crisis, and we’re definitely not doing it,"" she said. ""I know people want to live their lives. There have been a lot of other times, people have made those sacrifices in order to benefit our society. It’s almost like a war effort. That’s what we need right now.""

Terry Shaw, AdventHealth’s president and CEO, said Sunday on CBS’ Face the Nation that the peak of COVID-19 hospitalizations in Florida will be ""sometime in front of us in July.""

While on the program, he said that the health system, which has hospitals in nine states including 30 in Florida, has adequate PPE, a stockpile of ventilators and a clinical team that’s learned how to better treat the disease.

""I give you an example. Our length of stay in our ICU for COVID patients has dropped in half. The number of people coming in to our hospital with COVID that need a ventilator, we’ve also been able to cut that in half. And because of those things, our death rate has also been cut in half"" since the beginning of the pandemic,"" he said

The health system’s ICU capacities in Florida are currently running at about 85% to 90%. He said the system could turn some ""progressive care units"" into ICU units if needed.

Hospitals in several counties have stopped doing elective surgeries. HCA West Florida have ceased inpatient elective procedures at hospitals in Hillsborough, Pinellas and six other nearby counties, said an HCA spokeswoman on Sunday. Florida ceased elective surgeries statewide from March until early May in order to free up beds, and to reserve personal protective equipment for health care workers caring for COVID-19 patients.

Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach are the top three counties for hospitalizations, with 3,232 people hospitalized — 42 per cent of the 7,542 people in hospitals statewide for coronavirus.

Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez told CNN on Sunday that his county's hospitals will soon reach capacity, but he said more beds can be added, including for intensive care.

""We still have capacity, but it does cause me a lot of concern,"" he said.

Throughout May and into June, the state reopened much of its economy with some restrictions — and the number of positive cases began rising, but it wasn't until the last week that the daily death total began rising, too.

Because of the increase in cases and the positivity rate, doctors have predicted a rise in deaths, saying the mortality rate usually increases two to four weeks later as some of those infected get sicker and eventually die. Health experts are concerned that people are gathering in crowds, and have expressed concern that the Republican National Convention's nomination party for President Donald Trump will be held in Jacksonville in August.

On Saturday, the Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom reopened at Walt Disney World in Orlando, concerning health experts who urge people not to gather in groups. Guests at the park said that people were wearing masks and social distancing, and videos showed near-empty parks.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said that even with the rising rates, he still wants the schools to reopen as scheduled next month, saying children have not proven to be vectors for the disease in states and countries where campuses are open. He said while each county will have to come up with procedures, depending on their local infection rate, not opening the schools would exacerbate the achievement gap between high- and low-performing students.

""We know there are huge, huge costs for not providing the availability of in-person schooling,"" he said. ""The risk of corona, fortunately, for students is incredibly low.""

Helen Ferre, a spokeswoman for DeSantis, said Sunday that the state has tested more than 2.4 million people for COVID-19.

Ferre said the important statistic isn’t the raw number of positives, but the percentage — on Sunday, it was just over 11%, about 8 percentage points lower than the weekly average.

""The more people who get tested and are proportionately reporting negative for this virus is meaningful,"" she wrote in an email to The Associated Press.

Meanwhile, a commissioner for a county near Jacksonville is seriously ill with the virus, according to a posting by his daughter on Facebook.

St. Johns County Commissioner Paul Waldron had recently voted against a county ordinance requiring masks, but not because he opposed them. He said he wanted more answers from county administrators about which masks are most effective and whether the county had enough for employees and visitors at government buildings.

So what about 142 days?

""Every game might end 0-0,"" the Calgary Flames general manager quipped.

With summer training camps set to open Monday as the NHL lurches forward in its plan to restart a season stopped in its tracks four months ago by COVID-19, the temptation might be to spring a surprise or two — maybe a new power-play setup or a tweak to the penalty kill — when the games return Aug. 1.

Coaches for the 24 teams set to feature in the league's return have had ample time to plan, brainstorm and re-assess their systems and rosters. The 16 taking part in the best-of-five qualifying round have known for nearly seven weeks which opponent they'd be lining up against if the league got back up and running.

But don't expect to see massive changes — especially early — from the men standing behind the benches in those empty arenas in Toronto and Edmonton once the puck is dropped.

They have enough to worry about when it comes to their own players.

""Every coach is going to look at and break down the opponent and have a game plan to attack,"" continued Treliving, whose club will take on the Winnipeg Jets in the qualifying round. ""But because of the uniqueness of this time, there's more of a focus to get your team ready. I remember last year preparing for the playoffs and we're sitting there going, 'What are we going to do with the four days between our last regular-season game (and the playoffs)?'

""We thought we had two months to prepare last year and we were dealing with four days. You're dealing with four months here. So the focus for the 24 teams is how do we get up to speed? How do we get to our 'A' game when we haven't played for so long?""

Like most teams, Montreal Canadiens head coach Claude Julien and his staff met remotely via video conference on a regular basis after the NHL suspended the schedule because of the pandemic in mid-March.

And after it was announced they'd be facing the Pittsburgh Penguins in the qualifying round, those preparations ramped up significantly.

""I'm a believer that as a coach you can never get too much information — as much as you can get is great,"" Julien said. ""The important part is what you share with your players. That's where you have to be careful.""

Penguins head coach Mike Sullivan said his focus will be shaking off the rust and getting his group prepared for a situation that will see teams go from zero to 100 in short order.

""There are significant challenges from a mindset standpoint and making sure that we get out of the summer hockey mode or the social distancing skates into real competitive hockey,"" he said. ""Because that's what we're going to be faced with in a short period of time.""

But Toronto Maple Leafs winger Zach Hyman, whose club is set to face the Columbus Blue Jackets in the qualifying round for a spot in the usual 16-team playoffs, still believes there could be some subtle changes around the league.

""This is the unknown,"" he said. ""When you go in from the regular season into playoffs, you don't really tweak too much, you just kind of roll into the playoffs, rolling off your momentum from the regular season. This is a completely different beast, where what you watched a couple months ago may not be the team that you're playing against in the summer. It's almost like a brand new year with the same rosters.

""It'll be interesting to see how everything turns out around the league with the long layoff.""

Canucks defenceman Christopher Tanev said he expects Vancouver's coaches to have plenty to share about the Minnesota Wild.

""I'm sure they'll have a lot of information,"" he said with a smile. ""They'll know every little detail about the team and every player.""

The Wild, however, shouldn't expect more than the basics on the other side.

""It's unique that we've known who we're playing here for a while,"" Minnesota interim head coach Dean Evason said. ""The challenge, at least for our group, is we don't want to overload them.""

The Boston Bruins are in a slightly different position as one of the top-4 teams in the Eastern Conference. They'll take part in round-robin games against Washington, Tampa Bay and Philadelphia to determine the No. 1 seed on that side of the playoff bracket, but the Bruins won't know their first-round opponent until after the qualifiers.

""We're not going to introduce a whole lot of new concepts,"" Boston head coach Bruce Cassidy said. ""Even though you've had a lot of time to dream up a lot of different things, I don't know if it's the best time — a short turnaround with a lot of the line — to start messing too much with your game.

""We're going to try to keep it as simple as we can.""

For all the time coaches have had, that might end up being their best play.

Ferries loosens restrictions",['Roxanne Egan-Elliott'],,"B.C. Ferries is loosening some restrictions and increasing capacity as summer travel within the province grows.

Passenger numbers have risen to about 70 per cent of what they were at this time last year, said Tessa Humphries, communications manager for B.C. Ferries. In the early days of the pandemic, they were about 20 per cent of normal.

article continues below

Passenger capacity had been capped at 50 per cent, but that restriction is being phased out to increase service, Humphries said.

That level was set by Transport Canada, which gave operators a choice between limiting capacity and implementing enhanced cleaning and physical- distancing measures.

Humphries said B.C. Ferries implemented both measures at first but has now decided to phase out the capacity limit. B.C. Ferries consulted with Transport Canada on the change, she said.

Enhanced physical-distancing and cleaning protocols, including clear plastic barriers and face- coverings, remain in place. Passengers are asked whether they’re experiencing COVID-19 symptoms prior to travel, and those in vehicles are allowed to remain inside their cars.

More than 300 sailings per month have been added on major routes between the Island and the Lower Mainland since the start of June. The company is aiming to keep capacity about 20 per cent above demand, Humphries said.

“We will have fewer sailings than in summer schedules of the past, but significantly more than what was available as a result of the service cuts in April,” she said.

The company has also added an additional vessel on the route between Departure Bay and Horseshoe Bay on Fridays and Sundays, and a second vessel on the route that services the southern Gulf Islands on Thursdays through Mondays.

“We did also hear from the communities that there was a struggle for capacity there,” Humphries said, adding that it wasn’t uncommon for sailings on Gulf Islands route to be completely booked.

Passengers travelling by car are encouraged to book in advance or choose less busy times to travel.

Humphries said B.C. Ferries expects it will take a couple of years before passenger numbers return to pre-pandemic levels.

Onboard food services have resumed on some minor routes, including between Swartz Bay and the Gulf Islands, and the Passages gift shop reopened Friday on sailings between Swartz Bay and Tsawwassen. Packaged food and limited hot food resumed on three major routes between the Island and the Lower Mainland in June.

The Lands End Café in the Swartz Bay terminal also recently reopened. Markets in the Departure Bay and Tsawwassen terminals reopened in late June.

The drop in ferry traffic has cost B.C. Ferries millions of dollars in lost revenue.

Humphries said the company is evaluating the financial situation daily and reopening onboard amenities will provide another revenue stream.

“But we’re all doing all of that carefully and gradually, as well as safely reintroducing these services,” she said.

But even the best efforts have left doctors stymied about the source of more than one-third of this country's known COVID-19 infections. Not knowing where cases come from makes outbreaks that much harder to stamp out.

article continues below

Now medical researchers and supercomputers are turning genetics labs into virus detective agencies, looking first to find the novel coronavirus itself within blood samples from thousands of infected patients, and then comparing all of those isolated viruses to each other looking for places they differ.

Every close match will draw a line from patient to patient, ultimately painting a picture of how the virus spread.

""This is the big effort over the next four weeks,"" said Andrew McArthur, director of the biomedical discovery and commercialization program at McMaster University.

""What's going to come out of there pretty soon is a glimpse of what just happened, how did it move around the province, how did it move between provinces or how big was Pearson (airport) in the early days of the airport being open.""

Knowing how the virus spread will show where there were weaknesses in public health measures early on, said McArthur. Being able to keep divining genetic codes from samples will mean when there are flare-ups of cases, they can be quickly compared to each other to see if they're all related or are coming from multiple sources.

It means, for example, a long-term care centre should be able to quickly know if its 10 new cases are because one case spread widely or arose from multiple carriers coming into the facility.

""That's a very different infection-control problem,"" said McArthur.

It also means that maybe, just maybe, the second COVID-19 wave most think is coming won't be as bad, or as hard to control, as the first, because the sources can be isolated very quickly.

""A second wave is likely,"" McArthur said. ""But we've never spent this kind of money and effort before, either, so maybe we'll beat it.""

The kinds of genetic technology being used for this project did not exist when SARS hit Canada in 2003.

This genetic mapping is constantly on the look-out for mutations. Thus far, SARS-CoV-2, the official name for the virus that causes COVID-19, has not mutated as quickly as many others do. Influenza, for instance, changes so much over a year the vaccine has to be retooled every summer to keep up.

But there are enough subtle changes still happening among the 28,000 individual markers that make up a genome for SARS-CoV-2 that cases can be traced backward and linked to the ones that came before. McArthur said it takes a lot of data storage, a lot of high-capacity computer analysis, and a lot of money, to run the comparisons among them all.

The federal government put $40 million on the table in April for genetic research on COVID-19. Half is to keep tabs on the virus as it spreads, look for any changes it undergoes, and map its pathway across the country. The other half is to look at the genetic structures of the patients who get infected, trying to answer the puzzling question of why some people die and others have symptoms so mild they never even know they are sick.

Genome Canada is administering the project, with six regional genomics agencies overseeing the work locally and labs like McArthur's doing the testing and analysis. The funding is intended to create genetic maps from 150,000 patients. Canada thus far has had about 108,000 positive cases, and the expectation is that almost every one of them will be gene-mapped.

The results will be loaded into a global site comparing all known infections of COVID-19, but also be analyzed for national and regional reports.

In New York, genetic sequencing was used to figure out that COVID-19 in Manhattan wasn't coming from China and Iran as imagined, but from Europe. In Canada, it is suspected that much of the virus came into this country from travellers returning from the United States in early March. But the work is only now beginning to confirm that belief.

McArthur estimates the first data will be available for Ontario in about four weeks, but warns it will take many more months to complete all of the tests. His lab sequenced 600 samples on Wednesday alone.

Overall, McArthur expects the genetics project to last for two years.

Trump flew by helicopter to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in suburban Washington to meet wounded servicemembers and health care providers caring for COVID-19 patients. As he left the White House, he told reporters: ""When you're in a hospital, especially ... I think it’s a great thing to wear a mask.""

article continues below

Trump was wearing a mask in Walter Reed's hallway as he began his visit. He was not wearing one when he stepped off the helicopter at the facility.

The president was a latecomer to wearing a mask during the pandemic, which has raged across the U.S. since March and infected more than 3.2 million and killed at least 134,000. Most prominent Republicans, including Vice-President Mike Pence, endorsed wearing masks as the coronavirus gained ground this summer. Republican governors have been moving toward requiring or encouraging the use of masks as the pandemic has grown more serious in some states in the South and West.

Trump, however, has declined to wear a mask at news conferences, coronavirus task force updates, rallies and other public events. People close to him have told The Associated Press that the president feared a mask would make him look weak and was concerned that it shifted focus to the public health crisis rather than the economic recovery. They spoke on condition of anonymity to describe private matters.

While not wearing one himself, Trump has sent mixed signals about masks, acknowledging that they would be appropriate if worn in an indoor setting where people were close together. But he has accused reporters of wearing them to be politically correct and has retweeted messages making fun of Democratic rival Joe Biden for wearing a mask and implying that Biden looks weak.

Questions remain whether Trump will wear a mask with any regularity.

The wearing of masks became another political dividing line, with Republicans more resistant to wearing them than Democrats. Few masks were seen at recent Trump campaign events in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Phoenix and South Dakota’s Mount Rushmore.

The only time Trump has been known to wear a mask was during a private part of a tour of a Ford plant in Michigan.

A spokesman for the Biden campaign cast the president's action as too little, too late.

""Donald Trump spent months ignoring the advice of medical experts and politicizing wearing a mask, one of the most important things we can do to prevent the spread of the virus,"" spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement. ""Rather than taking responsibility and leading, he wasted four months that Americans have been making sacrifices by stoking divisions and actively discouraging people from taking a very basic step to protect each other.""

On its website, Walter Reed carries this recommendation: ""Whenever you’re out in public, like at your local grocery store or pharmacy, where it’s difficult to maintain 6 feet of social distance, you should wear a cloth face covering.""

While hundreds of people could be employed in positions relating to the games and hubs — such as security jobs, rink staff, food services and hotel housekeeping — the financial benefit of two bubble communities under tight seal would be ""modest"" at best, suggested Bank of Montreal chief economist Douglas Porter.

""When you think of how many tourists would normally be in Toronto during peak tourist season, I'm quite sure this is less than one per cent,"" he said.

""The reality is, it's not going to move the needle.""

But Porter, a lifelong hockey fan, said he anticipates a ""reasonably meaningful positive"" morale boost to Canadian sports fans who've been eagerly anticipating players returning to the ice in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The games are slated to start Aug. 1 with six Canadian teams qualifying for the 24-team resumption of play. No fans will be in the seats.

Edmonton and Toronto were confirmed as the NHL's hub cities on Friday night.

""The fact that part of our world is getting back to some kind of normal will help reinforce the sense that things, generally, are moving in that direction and could help support the recovery,"" Porter said.

The gradual comeback of major sporting events has drawn plenty of interest in recent weeks, with debates raging over the risks of putting players back into the games, even if spectators aren't allowed in the facilities.

Further questions have been raised over whether rigorous testing is enough to prevent outbreaks within the isolated community, which could potentially throw the whole plan into a costly disarray.

Many of these factors make placing a value on hockey's return especially difficult.

Michael Naraine, a professor at Brock University in St. Catharines, Ont., said the largest amount of money is on the line at large corporations, which he said is driving the return of major sporting events.

""The primary revenue driver for sports is broadcasting,"" said the assistant professor of digital sport management and marketing.

""They need television advertisers come back. The league itself needs to gain its revenue from NBC and Sportsnet here in Canada.""

Politicians have preferred to emphasize the positive aspects of a deal with the NHL.

Alberta Premier Jason Kenney eagerly promoted Edmonton as the ultimate hub city for the hockey league, posting videos on Twitter that prominently featured the Rocky Mountains and other popular destinations in the province.

Naraine said those public expressions by leaders are more an attempt to ""pander"" to their constituents than actually drive any meaningful economic impact. He said this is especially the case in Edmonton.

""Having major events come to town allows them to beat their chests and say, 'We exist. We're on the map. Come look at us,'"" he said.

""But the fact that the hub city will be in Edmonton is no different than whether the hub city would be in Toronto or Vancouver or elsewhere. It's not going to significantly drive tourism all of a sudden.""

Patrick Rishe, a sports professor at Washington University in St. Louis, said he sees value in showcasing a lesser known Canadian city on broadcast television with ""beauty shots"" of the locale. He said it may also sit well with NHL executives.

""You never know,"" he said. ""Doing and serving a good deed for the league now, this could pay dividends down the road.""

Any semblance of a regular hockey season would be welcomed by Dana Parris, owner of the Lockeroom sports bar in Barrie, Ont.

Even though her business is over 100 kilometres away from downtown Toronto, she anticipates the excitement would reverberate to her customers.

""If we could have sports come back and we hit Stage 3 (of Ontario's COVID reopening plan) around the same time, I will probably stop crying myself to sleep,"" she said.

""If those two come together it's just going to be the most beautiful thing.""

Collins made the comments in a July 8 update on summer travel and the impact of COVID-19 on the ferry service.

article continues below

Local governments on the Sunshine Coast and the Southern Sunshine Coast Ferry Advisory Committee have been pressing Ferries to add more trips to the Langdale-Horseshoe Bay route to meet the anticipated demand from residents, businesses and tourists now that travel within the province is no longer being discouraged.

Although BC Ferries is now running eight round-trips a day on Route 3, with two additional sailings on Fridays and Sundays starting July 10, there have still been frequent overloads and delays.

In a recent letter to BC Ferries, Sechelt councillors pointed out that the Sunshine Coast economy is “heavily reliant on tourism” and reduced capacity on the Langdale route could “limit our community’s recovery.”

“Our vision for Route 3 this summer is simple – provide the same level of service as last summer,” the letter said. “This would include the additional sailings we had last summer and maintaining increased time between sailings to ensure ferries run on time.”

Councillors in Gibsons are also sending BC Ferries a letter, asking the ferry company to “recognize the needs of small businesses on the Coast requiring deliveries of materials, including perishable goods, for their operations.”

In his update, Collins said traffic is beginning to grow again after dropping around 80 per cent in March and April and is expected to continue to increase throughout the summer.

“This summer, we are going to need your help, your patience and your understanding,” Collins said. “While we’re adding sailings as fast as we can, there still will be some sailing limitations this summer as we weren’t able to hire and train summer seasonal staff in March and April due to COVID-19. We are planning for summer service to exceed demand, but we won’t have the same number of sailings as last summer.”

Collins also acknowledged the inconvenience caused by schedule changes, some of which have happened on short notice. Sunshine Coast residents in particular have complained about trouble with rebooking reservations and long waits on hold with customer service.

“Over the past month or so, we’ve revised our schedules more often than normal, as we bring more sailings back into service,” he said. “I know this has impacted some of our customers, but every time we add more sailings, we need to revise the schedules one more time.”

Collins said BC Ferries is putting the bulk of its efforts into brining back service and is working with the province “to examine the impact COVID-19 is having on the ferry system.”

“We need to protect the core of the ferry system and continue to provide safe, reliable service to British Columbians.”",[]

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreaks at Tabor and at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred to those homes from the hospital. The outbreak at the Tabor long-term care home was declared over on July 7.

B.C.'s provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix said in a July 10 joint statement that the province recorded 25 new cases in the past 24 hours, for a total of 3,053 cases since the virus that has caused a global pandemic first appeared in B.C. in late January.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 990 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

There was one new COVID-19-related death recorded in the past day, for a total of 187.

Of the 187 people actively fighting off the disease, 16 are in hospital, with five of those in intensive care. The rest are self-isolating at home.

The recovery rate has dipped below 87%, as 2,679 people have recovered.

""As we continue through summer, simple steps will help us to keep COVID-19 low and slow in British Columbia,"" Henry and Dix said in their statement.

""When spending more time with friends and family, whether that is close to home or on vacation elsewhere in the province, we remind all British Columbians to avoid closed spaces, crowds and close contact with others.

North Island-Powell River MP Rachel Blaney has been working through her parliamentary commitments to ensure the reshaped government is being responsive to Canadians.

Blaney, in an interview on July 8, said she had just sat through a hybrid sitting of the House of Commons, which was “one for the record books.”

article continues below

“We’ll see what happens next but it was interesting,” said Blaney. “There were some parliamentarians in parliament and the rest of them were across the country. When we are sitting in front of our screen, we are seeing our colleagues from all over in their offices and their homes. We are participating in our democracy in a completely different way.”

Blaney said as the parliamentarian who represents the NDP on the procedural and house affairs committee, what is being done by the committee is looking at what the House of Commons can look like in the fall, and how to address the issue of being able to do the full spectrum of work that is usually done, understanding that everybody cannot be in the house simultaneously. She said a report will come out and will be made public.

Blaney said there have been a lot of discussions at the committee level about security, such as with online platforms, and what kinds of methods should be looked at in terms of voting.

“We all know that is very important,” said Blaney, about voting. “If there is any voting happening now, it’s just the members in the house, percentage wise, representing each party. It’s definitely been an experience doing the work that you’ve done for your career but doing it in a very different way.”

Running the federal government in a hybrid system has many complexities. There are 338 parliamentarians, so accommodating the sheer number of people in the House of Commons and online is an issue. Blaney said one intricacy is that as parliament does its work, everything has to be simultaneously interpreted in French and English.

She said one of the things being looked at in the report is around the reality that in the last parliament, there was also some indigenous language spoken with an interpreter present, so there is a process that has to happen to allow that in the revised House of Commons.

“Now that we are in a different format of parliament, we are trying to find a way to follow the rules we’ve set for ourselves for that kind of flexibility,” said Blaney.

She said the committee has looked at other parliaments across the planet, seeing how other governments are coping with administration of democracy during the pandemic.

“I’m not sure what the final recommendations will be but I do believe there has to be a way to allow people who can only participate virtually to have a voice,” said Blaney. “It’s really important to honour those voices and make sure they have the capacity to represent their regions.”

In more remote areas of the country, where internet service is not as robust as it is in other areas, there may also be some issues with connectivity, said Blaney. She said the committee has worked closely with the House of Commons to make sure those issues are taken into consideration.

“If we’re in a position of taking a vote, how do we make sure those folks don’t miss out because of some sort of technical challenge that has happened?” said Blaney. “The committee has been looking long and hard into those issues, wanting to make sure we really honour parliament and the history of parliament, but recognizing that sometimes we have to adapt to these new circumstances.”

She said she is ultimately looking forward to going back to Ottawa and participating in parliament and seeing all of her colleagues there, because she thinks that part of the work is very important. Blaney acknowledges that a return to the old method of governance is an unknown. COVID-19 is the reality and everyone has seen how things have fundamentally changed, she added.

The work of the all-party COVID-19 committee in parliament is done, said Blaney, so parliamentarians will continue to meet through the hybrid system.

She said the hybrid parliament will be meeting at least four times this summer and it is something the NDP fought for during negotiations.

“We wanted to make sure, during changing times, the government was held to account twice a month over the summer months because things are changing quickly and we need the ability to ask questions and to hold the government to account during these very challenging times,” said Blaney.

She said the parliamentary structure is fundamental to Canada, and if it is going to be changed or altered, she said she hopes the government is thoughtful in how it is going to change it, and that parliament is not taken for granted.

“We need to focus on how we are going to do the work,” said Blaney, “in the middle of a pandemic.”",[]

Metro Inc. was aware of Loblaw Companies Ltd.'s decision to stop its so-called pandemic pay program before it made a similar decision, chief executive Eric La Fleche told the House of Commons standing committee on industry, science and technology Friday.

article continues below

La Fleche said that a Metro competitor's move was one of several influencing factors in its decision-making process.

He joined the Loblaw president and Empire Co. Ltd. chief executive at a two-hour session about why they stopped paying a temporary wage bump to employees as of June 13.

""Let me be absolutely clear, we did not co-ordinate our decisions,"" said Michael Medline, Empire CEO, in his opening statement before the committee. Medline, whose company owns the Sobeys and Safeway brands, was the first of the trio to give his opening remarks.

""The decision was our own.""

Loblaw president Sarah Davis echoed the sentiment, but noted she sent a ""courtesy email"" to both competitors, as well as Walmart and Save-On-Foods, on June 11. The latter two did not appear at the hearing.

The email notified competitors of Loblaw's decision to end its pandemic pay program on June 13. The company had already informed its roughly 200,000 employees, she said, and recognized ""the news would be public immediately.""

La Fleche said in later questioning that he was aware of the email when Metro made its decision to end its bonus pay program on the same day.

""We made our own decision based on the information we had, which included that last piece of information, yes,"" he said.

He called it ""one factor among others"" contributing to its decision. Other factors included the broader economic reopening, other retailers starting to open their doors, lower business volumes and a gradual return to more normal conditions.

Empire had not received Davis's email when the company made its decision to terminate the extra wages, said Medline, but had heard through the grapevine that Loblaw was considering doing so.

Davis received a reply to her June 11 email, and said she would provide copies of the original and all answers to the committee.

She also sent a courtesy email to competitors when Loblaw decided to begin its extra pay program. Davis said she doesn't recall sending courtesy emails to competitors on other topics, including executive compensation.

In addition to receiving the email, La Fleche said he made several phone calls to competitors in May and June to ask whether they planned to extend their bonus pay programs or end them on previously announced dates.

""In perfect compliance with The Competition Act, I asked my counterparts their intentions regarding whether or not they would maintain the temporary bonus,"" he said, in a translation from French, during his opening remarks.

In each case, competitors, including Medline from Empire and Davis from Loblaw, told him they had not yet decided.

""Whatever the case, those calls were made in a decisional process that was much larger and ... did not inform our decisions.""

When asked why he made the phone calls, La Fleche answered he ""wanted as much information as I could have in order to make a best decision for our company, our employees at the right time.""

He said he would ""absolutely not"" characterize those conversations as trying to obtain a tacit agreement on wages.

Those who sent emails and made phone calls said they consulted with company counsel before doing so and lawyers were present during at least one phone discussion.

The appearance was a chance for the executives to admit they were wrong to end the pay increases, said Jerry Dias, president of Unifor, a private sector union.

""What we got instead was highly paid grocery executives insisting they did not collude, and then going on to say — remarkably — virtually the same thing over and over again,"" he said in a statement.

""The executives all admitted to exchanging 'courtesy emails' and 'courtesy calls' on pandemic pay, and yet insist there was no collusion. I look forward to the committee's ruling on that.""

Unifor has been critical of retailers ending temporary wage increases while the pandemic continues and has called for the pay bump to be permanent.

The matriarchs, known as Gaandlee Guu Jaalang or ""daughters of the river,"" say in a statement the Queen Charlotte Lodge and West Coast Fishing Club reopened as a local state of emergency remains in effect because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

article continues below

""Haida Gwaii is a remote community with limited health-care services and only two ventilators,"" the statement says. ""One case would devastate our communities.""

The statement says the matriarchs are upholding Haida law through the occupation of the villages, Jung and Sk'aawats.

Both the fishing lodge and club say they are fully complying with orders and guidelines issued by the B.C. government, health authorities and WorkSafeBC.

Brian Clive, vice-president of sales and corporate development for the lodge, said it has had several meetings with Haida leadership and developed plans so that workers do not go into town or anywhere near a Haida community. It also has medical staff on site and if a COVID-19 case were to develop, there's a plan in place to evacuate the affected person by air to Vancouver.

""We have gone to incredible lengths to avoid any contact with the communities and therefore have created what we call a zero-risk chance of contamination in the communities,"" he said.

The lodge expects about 80 guests at a time, down from the typical 125, he said. None will be travelling from the United States because the border is closed, he said.

President Brian Legge said the West Coast Fishing Club is remotely located about 83 kilometres from the nearest community and only accessible by boat or air. It also has an emergency evacuation plan in place.

""First and foremost we would never put the health and well-being of Haida Gwaii communities and residents at risk and equally as important our staff and clients,"" he says in a statement.

""That's why we have worked hard and gone to significant expense to eliminate all contact with the residents of Haida Gwaii and their communities through direct helicopter transportation from the mainland to our remote island and back.""

Without the plan, the club's employees would have been out of work and the business faced possibly unsustainable losses, Legge said.

The club is continuing to speak with the council of the Haida Nation, he added.

Duffy Edgars, chief councillor of Old Massett Village, said he supports the matriarchs and expected 20 to 30 people to occupy the villages. He said he didn't expect any interactions with lodge staff.

""We're just occupying our land and doing some fishing,"" he said.

Haida member Deana Young, who was on her way to support the matriarchs, said the community is following physical distancing protocols, while children have not returned to school and are not seeing their elders.

""One person coming from outside our region is one person too many,"" said Young.

The occupation of the land is an exercise of Haida rights to the land, she said.

""What we are doing is occupying our lands, asserting our rights to harvest the foods that we live on and to ensure food security for our communities,"" she said.

Cargill's beef plant near High River, south of Calgary, employs about 2,200 people. It shut down for two weeks in April because of an outbreak that affected 350 staff.

It reopened after bringing in safety measures that included temperature testing, physical distancing, cleaning and sanitizing.

Eventually nearly half of the workers contracted the virus and two employees died.

The lawsuit, which needs to be approved by a judge, was filed by Guardian Law Group and seeks damages for the harm done to family members, friends and other people who were in close contact with Cargill employees who contracted the novel coronavirus.

The plaintiffs do not include the employees themselves, who are covered by labour and worker compensation laws.

The statement of claim alleges that despite warnings and guidelines issued by the Alberta government, Cargill Ltd. failed to take ""reasonable precautions"" at the beginning of the outbreak to limit its spread.

""This is a sophisticated facility and a company well-versed in proper safety procedures. That's why it's so shocking to see them fall so far below the standard of acceptable behaviour that we expect from employers in this situation,"" said Mathew Farrell of Guardian Law Group Friday.

""Businesses bear a responsibility to the community to take reasonable measures to limit the spread of this disease, and where they fail to do so, we will hold them to account for the harms that result.""

The allegations have not been proven in court.

Daniel Sullivan, a Cargill spokesman, said the company does not have a comment to make at this time regarding the class action. He gave a general statement in an email.

""At Cargill, we take seriously our responsibility to feed the world and that keeping people safe is core to our values.""

The High River plant is back at full operation and processes about 4,500 head of cattle a day — more than one-third of Canada's beef-packing capacity.

Cargill Ltd. is a subsidiary of U.S.-based Cargill Inc., one of the largest privately owned corporations in the United States by revenue.

The league and NHL Players' Association announced Friday the return-to-play protocols — featuring Toronto and Edmonton as hub cities — and a four-year extension to the current collective bargaining agreement have been ratified.

article continues below

The NHL board of governors and the union's full membership gave the documents, which were tied together in an all-or-nothing bundle, the thumbs up in separate votes.

""It was pretty civil,"" Vancouver Canucks captain Bo Horvat said of negotiations on the deal that was tentatively agreed to Monday. ""We're happy to get things going.""

Bringing the hubs to Canada, where coronavirus infection rates are largely under control, proved to be the logical choice after a significant spike in cases across the United States in recent weeks.

""While we have all worked very hard to try to address the risks of COVID-19, we know that health and safety are and will continue to be our priorities,"" NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said in a statement. ""We know that all of our fans are excited about our return to the ice.""

Training camps for the 24 teams primed to compete in the league's restart to a 2019-20 campaign that was suspended March 12 are scheduled to begin Monday — also the deadline for players to opt out of participating with no penalty — in each franchise's home market.

The plan will then see Eastern Conference clubs report to Toronto on July 26, while those from the Western Conference head to Edmonton before the games resume Aug. 1. The conference finals and Stanley Cup will be held in Edmonton as part of a first-of-its-kind NHL Final Four that could stretch all the way to Oct. 4 and result in next season being pushed into December or early January.

Once in Canada's largest city and Alberta's capital, players are set to be kept away from the general public in so-called ""bubbles"" that include strict health measures, daily testing, and mostly confine teams to hotels and empty arenas.

The extension of the current CBA, which was slated to expire in September 2022 and now runs through at least the 2025-26 season, provides both players and owners clarity on a number of challenging financial realities caused by COVID-19.

It also give the green light for negotiations with the International Olympic Committee and the International Ice Hockey Federation on participation at the 2022 and 2026 Winter Games. The NHL skipped the 2018 Olympics after taking part in five straight between 1998 and 2014.

The salary cap's upper limit will remain at US$81.5 million in 2020-21 and stay there until hockey-related revenue returns to $4.8 billion — this season's projected total prior to the pandemic. Players have agreed to defer 10 per cent of next year's salaries, and have owners pay that back over three consecutive seasons starting in 2022-23.

""This agreement is a meaningful step forward for the players and owners, and for our game, in a difficult and uncertain time,"" NHLPA executive director Don Fehr said. ""We are pleased to be able to bring NHL hockey back.""

Escrow payments, a consistent thorn in the side of players that guarantees a 50/50 split of HRR with owners, will be capped at 20 per cent in 2020-21, and decrease throughout the deal. If teams are still owed money following the 2025-26 campaign, the CBA will be extended another season.

The agreement marks the first time in Bettman's 27-year tenure as commissioner the NHL has bridged two CBAs without a work stoppage. Both the 1994-95 and 2012-13 seasons were cut to 48 games because of lockouts, while the 2004-05 campaign was cancelled.

Alberta Premier Jason Kenney was the most outspoken politician with regards to having his province host one of the hubs, pointing to a low infection rate and Edmonton's facilities.

He also penned a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in hopes of securing a waiver for the NHL when it came to Canada's mandatory 14-day quarantine for anyone arriving in the country. The federal government approved the league's proposal of a cohort quarantine last month, granting an exception that paved the way for Toronto and Edmonton to get the nod as hubs.

Speaking outside Rogers Place, Kenney said Friday's news will create jobs and millions of dollars in economic activity.

""The Stanley Cup is coming back to Edmonton, to Alberta,"" Kenney said in a video posted to Twitter as he stood next to a statue of Wayne Gretzky. ""We are going to get an unbelievable amount of free advertising across North America and around the world that will set us up well for the future relaunch of our tourism industry when travel comes back post-COVID.""

The Cup was last awarded in Edmonton when Gretzky hoisted it over his head for a fourth and final time on May 26, 1988.

Each team will be permitted to bring a maximum of 52 people into the bubbles, including a maximum of 31 players.

Meanwhile, it was also announced the NHL draft lottery's second phase has been tabbed for Aug. 10. The eight losing teams from the qualifying round will have an equal shot at the first pick in the draft, which is tentatively scheduled for Oct. 9-10.

Much like Kenney, Ontario Premier Doug Ford and Toronto Mayor John Tory supported their city's hub potential.

""There is no better place for the NHL season to continue,"" Tory said. ""We will make sure we put on a great show for the game of hockey ... while following all proper health and safety protocols.""

Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist at Toronto General Hospital, said choosing to hold the NHL's restart in Canada reduces the overall risk, but it's far from a fool-proof endeavour.

""We'd be blind to think that there isn't COVID-19 in Canada, there's just significantly less of it here compared to parts of the U.S.,"" he said. ""Everyone has to pay close attention to COVID-19 because even with the best laid plans, there still can be small weaknesses that might be exploited by this virus.""

Vancouver was the other Canadian city originally in the running to host, along with seven American markets, before the provincial government expressed concerns about the NHL's health and safety protocols.

Ford was asked prior to Friday's announcement why the plan worked for his province when it didn't for British Columbia.

""They have very stringent rules and regulations for their players,"" Ford said of the NHL. ""When they told me (players are) getting tested every single day, I'm no medical professional, but I don't think they need testing every day.""

The 24-team format — which includes every Canadian franchise, save for Ottawa — will see the top-4 clubs from both the East and West play mini-tournaments to determine playoff seeding, while the other 16 will battle in a never-before-seen qualifying round.

Boston, Tampa Bay, Washington and Philadelphia are set to compete for the No. 1 slot in the East, while defending champions St. Louis, Colorado, Vegas and Dallas will do the same out West.

The East's best-of-five qualifying series include Pittsburgh vs. Montreal, Carolina vs. New York Rangers, New York Islanders vs. Florida and Toronto vs. Columbus. In the West, the matchups are Edmonton vs. Chicago, Nashville vs. Arizona, Vancouver vs. Minnesota and Calgary vs. Winnipeg.

In all, there will be as many as 52 games played over the first nine days before the teams get a break on Aug. 10.

The four winners of the best-of-five series in each conference will then be pitted against the top-4 seeds to fill out the usual 16-team playoff bracket.

There could, however, still be choppy waters before the 2019-20 season can actually resume.

Players won't be quarantined during training camp, but instead asked to practise physical distancing when not at the rink in hopes isolation and testing will be enough to avoid any outbreaks.

Of the 396 NHLers tested at team facilities between June 8 and Monday during voluntary workouts, 23 results came back positive. The league said it's also aware of 12 other positive tests for players not taking part in those optional sessions.

The Stanley Cup has been awarded every year since 1893, except for 1919 because of the Spanish flu outbreak and in 2005 when the lockout scratched the entire season.

There's now a firm plan in place to — hopefully — see it handed out this fall.

The Burnaby Community Action Team (BCAT) on the Overdose Crisis penned a letter to council in late May with two calls to action for the city, including providing overdose response training and supplies to warming centre staff.

article continues below

“As illicit drug overdoses continue to rise, it is imperative that facilities supporting the homeless population in our city follow best practice measures,” reads the letter. “This means ensuring warming centre staff have access to overdose response supplies and basic training in relation to overdose recognition and response.”

The letter is cosigned by Michel Pouliot, executive director of Burnaby Family Life, and Dr. Lindsay McCaffrey with the Burnaby Division of Family Practices, along with several BCAT member organizations, including the Progressive Housing Society, Mosaic Burnaby Centre for Immigrants and the Burnaby Society to End Homelessness.

“In the event of an overdose, the wait time between a call to first responders and their arrival can cause permanent brain injury or death. Such experiences can be incredibly upsetting for witnesses and for staff,” reads the letter.

“Frontline workers who are not provided with the training and tools to respond often feel traumatized and powerless.”

The letter notes staff have taken sick leave in other jurisdictions as a result of that trauma, and some Burnaby warming centre staff are already taking naloxone to work.

In a report to council this week, staff said the city would need to “evaluate the operational implications of the request and would have to determine the advisability and feasibility of the request in order to evaluate whether or not this would be an effective additional measure to prevent overdoses in this context.”

Asked why the city would need to study the measure when naloxone training has been widely available for years, city spokesperson Chris Bryan said it is “standard for the city’s risk manager to review all procedures which may affect the health and safety of our patrons and staff, and which may result in liability exposure.”

The BCAT letter also called on the city to expand its resources for the homeless community in Burnaby during the pandemic, including keeping the warming centres, the last of which closed on July 1, open until an emergency shelter has been established in the city.

An emergency shelter is currently planned for the Burnaby Lake Sports Complex, and in the meantime, BC Housing has secured more hotel rooms to house local homeless individuals.

That Burnaby Lake emergency shelter, however, is only expected to be open until December, when construction of the Burnaby Lake complex replacement is set to begin.

“As the health of this population is already compromised, a COVID-19 outbreak would have a devastating impact,” reads the letter. “We know that the proposed locations for the ERC may serve as recreational sites when restrictions are lifted but the need to support vulnerable people and save lives must absolutely supersede residents’ access to such facilities.”

Staff also suggested the city work with community partners to develop short- and long-term actions to address homelessness.",[]

Finance Minister Carol James said Friday the latest numbers paint a picture of cautious optimism with a long road ahead on B.C.'s path to recovery during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Gains in May and June bring back about 40 per cent of the total number of jobs lost since the start of the pandemic in February, when B.C.'s jobless rate was five per cent, she told a news conference.

The greatest losses have been in the service sector, but James said that's also where jobs are being added as accommodation and food services accounted for half of last month's gains.

Despite positive signs, James said thousands of people and businesses are still struggling, and net job losses stand at 235,000.

She said youth unemployment in particular stands out at 29.1 per cent, up slightly since May, while 45,000 young people did find jobs last month.

Women in B.C. are also more likely to have lost their job due to COVID-19 than men, James said.

She said the high jobless rate in June reflects increased demand for jobs and confidence that people will have the opportunity to return to work once they start looking again.

James also mentioned the loss of international visitors in the tourism sector, particularly in Metro Vancouver and Victoria, as a factor.

Businesses are restarting cautiously, she added.

""They're making sure that their employees are safe, they're making sure their customers will be safe, and people are starting to see that confidence by going back to businesses.""

James is set to provide more information next week on the post-pandemic spending B.C. has made so far, as well as updated revenue and deficit forecasts.

B.C. health officials reported 25 new cases of COVID-19 on Friday, as well as one additional death.

That brings the death toll to 187 among 3,053 people who have tested positive for the disease so far, Health Minister Adrian Dix and provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said in a joint statement.

Of 187 active cases, 16 people were in hospital, and there were ongoing outbreaks at two long-term care or assisted living facilities and one acute care facility.

While there are no active community outbreaks, Dix and Henry said exposure is still happening.

""When spending more time with friends and family, whether that is close to home or on vacation elsewhere in the province, we remind all British Columbians to avoid closed spaces, crowds and close contact with others,"" read their statement.

For the past four months, the legendary Toronto stage that's hosted the likes of the Rolling Stones and the Police has gone dark, and its famed checkerboard floors immortalized in the Tragically Hip's ""Bobcaygeon"" left empty.

Like most smaller Canadian music venues, the future is anything but certain.

""The live-venue industry right now in Canada is on the verge of bankruptcy,"" Cohen said.

""We're not opening, probably, until the end of this year — maybe next year... We have no income coming in whatsoever. It's a bad scene.""

Along with several other indie concert venue owners, Cohen has been making noise about the troubling years ahead for Canada's live music scene in hopes the federal government will take more action.

There was a glimmer of hope on Tuesday when Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault outlined a program that lets owners of for-profit venues apply for a piece of $20 million promised to support the live music sector.

The money will be divided among numerous corners of the industry, including venues, concert promoters, booking agents, managers and music festivals. The funding is part of the second phase of support in the $500-million emergency support measures introduced in May for Canada's arts and culture organizations.

Anyone who's granted approval will receive a minimum contribution of $5,000 that's supposed to last until the end of September.

Beyond the live music business, the federal government has earmarked $5 million for the recording industry that will be administered by Factor and Musicaction, which specialize in developing and supporting Canadian music talent.

Erin Benjamin, chief executive of the Canadian Live Music Association, which advocates for the industry, called the move by Canadian Heritage to support venues ""a good start"" that needs to be built upon in short order.

""It's better than nothing,"" she said.

""It'll help some companies for a very short amount of time...but we're not done here. We can't be done.""

While Cohen doesn't know if he'll qualify for a portion of the venue funding, he's skeptical about how much it'll actually help the Horseshoe.

""I'll be able to pay two weeks of rent,"" Cohen said, pointing out it's roughly $40,000 a month for the downtown location.

""It'll be something, and we'll be grateful for it... but I'm skeptical until I actually see the payments.""

He suspects the Horseshoe may also fail to meet some of the requirements outlined on the Factor website. Among them, a venue must have booked at least 50 per cent Canadian musicians at its venue last year to qualify.

""Horseshoe Tavern was open 360 days last year, I don't think we wrote down which bands were Canadian and weren't. I don't think we even know,"" Cohen said.

""The eligibility makes no sense.""

Smaller venues have been able to tap into other financial support measures, which include the Canada Emergency Response Benefit and the emergency wage subsidy.

In Toronto, city council recently passed legislation that allows property owners to claim a tax break of 50 per cent tax on spaces that operate primarily as live music venues. The intention is for those savings to trickle down to the tenants who are still not allowed to reopen.

Live venues in other Canadian cities are at different stages in a process many anticipate could stretch well into next year.

Vancouver bars were some of the first to reopen, though several clubs in the city warned that patrons may have been exposed to COVID-19 in recent weeks.

Montreal's music venues were allowed to legally reopen in late June, but concertgoers have to remain seated and dancing is forbidden.

In Halifax, Karen Spaulding reopened the Carleton Music Bar and Grill in the final days of June, but it hardly feels the same to her.

""It is at half capacity for three days a week, instead of normally five to seven, and it's acoustic shows only,"" she said.

""Just the world, the audience and the guests, all feel different.""

The Carleton operates as a restaurant, which helped Spaulding's attempt to get the business back on its feet, though she said overall revenues have dropped somewhere between 50 to 75 per cent.

But as much as she's concerned for her business, she's also worried about local Canadian musicians who relied on these venues to make a living. That's motivated her to look for solutions as she faces a long winter that brings a whole new round of questions.

Spaulding said she's been in conversations with lenders, while also tapping into other government programs that help support her staff. She's also looking into whether it would be worthwhile to launch streaming online concerts that would ""put more money in the artists' pockets"" over the coming months.

""I'm going to personally go out on a limb to keep the venue going,"" she said.

""We're huge believers in live music.""

Rep. Adam Schiff couldn't resist: ""We may all be moving to Canada soon,"" he deadpanned.

article continues below

But as a resurgent COVID-19 ravages the U.S., fuelled by cavalier openings in states like Florida and Texas and a White House determined to resurrect the economy at all costs, the red-alert status spreading across the continent's lower half has more Canadians than ever ignoring America's increasingly persistent knock.

An online poll by Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies released this week found a whopping 86 per cent of respondents in Canada opposed to letting U.S. tourists north of the border, compared with 11 per cent who supported it. An Abacus Data poll out Friday found much the same thing.

And when Rep. Brian Higgins, a New York Democrat, updated his bipartisan call for a plan to reopen the border, the ensuing Twitter barrage of sarcasm, satire and outright anger belied Canada's reputation as a bastion of civility, replete with memes of building walls, slamming doors and Bugs Bunny taking a handsaw to the 49th parallel.

Higgins took it all in stride.

""I don't blame them for wanting us out of there,"" the congressman said Friday of the Canadian reaction.

""I have an obligation to be honest, and I have an obligation to always keep trying. And if anything, what I hope will come from all of this is an appreciation for the tale of two neighbouring countries' response to COVID-19: America's has been deplorable, and the Canadian response has been fast, strong and united.""

When the outbreak first took hold in North America in March, Canada and the U.S. agreed to close their shared border to discretionary travel while allowing the movement of goods and essential workers to continue. That initial 30-day agreement has been extended three times now, and will surely be extended again before its next July 21 expiry date.

Since March, the U.S. has seen more than 3 million cases and 133,000 deaths, and the crisis is accelerating in states across the union. Florida is breaking records daily for new COVID-19 cases and deaths. In Arizona and Texas, one in four tests is coming back positive. Further north, states like Wisconsin and Michigan are seeing fresh spikes in their active caseloads. Hospitals are again rapidly nearing capacity.

In their letter last week to acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf and Canada's Public Safety Minister Bill Blair, Higgins and 27 other members of Congress, Democrat and Republican alike, urged the two countries to stop kicking the can down the road and draft a detailed plan for the gradual reopening of the border.

""The continual 30-day extensions without a plan for how restrictions will be modified prolongs uncertainty for both communities and creates unnecessary tension as we approach each new expiration,"" they wrote.

""We are asking that the United States and Canada immediately craft a comprehensive framework for phased reopening of the border based on objective metrics and accounting for the varied circumstances across border regions.""

That doesn't mean throwing open the border to Americans, Higgins said. But it could mean redefining essential travel to include foreign property owners and people with business interests or family members on the other side, provided they wear masks and practice physical distancing.

""Never in our lifetime have we had a situation where the health of you and your family is dependent on your fellow citizens to do the right thing,"" he said.

""A phased opening could expand the category of 'essential traveller,' but (include) certifying some way that you are adhering to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's protocol as it relates to stopping the spread of COVID-19.""

Ontario Premier Doug Ford, a pro-trade conservative and longtime champion of Canada-U.S. ties, has been among those urging zero tolerance at the border until the crisis in the U.S. has passed — a position spokeswoman Ivana Yelich reiterated Friday.

""The premier has been clear: the border must remain closed to non-essential travel until the U.S. has made significant progress in containing COVID-19,"" Yelich said. ""The recent spike in the number of COVID cases in the U.S. is very concerning. As such, the premier will continue to support restrictions at the U.S. border beyond the July 21 deadline.""

The worsening public health situation in the U.S. has not diminished the importance of cross-border business travel, including face-to-face meetings or technical on-site visits, to the health of Canada's economy, said Mark Agnew, director of international policy with the Canadian Chamber of Commerce.

Despite the best efforts of both countries, the current border measures have been confusing for some, causing stress and delays even for those who have work permits that allow them to cross, Agnew said.

""It would be helpful for the government to set out the circumstances under which border measures will start to normalize, to enable companies to plan.""

Despite the political challenges the U.S. outbreak now poses for the federal Liberal government in Canada, it's past time to start thinking about how to ease the border restrictions, said Laurie Trautman, director of the Border Policy Research Institute at Western Washington University in Bellingham, Wash.

""There is an immediate need to be more thoughtful and strategic about how our countries go about doing that,"" Trautman said, floating the idea of wider family exemptions and allowing homeowners to visit their foreign properties.

In northern Washington state, law enforcement is growing concerned about the challenge of protecting vacant homes owned by Canadians, she added.

""Grandparents should be able to see their grandkids,"" Trautman said. ""Exempting these two groups from the restrictions would not ‘open up the floodgates’ and seem reasonable and empathetic to me.""

Statistics Canada's labour force survey released Friday showed 953,000 jobs were added last month, including 488,000 full-time and 465,000 part-time positions. The unemployment rate fell to 12.3 per cent after hitting a record-high of 13.7 per cent in May.

article continues below

As in May, even though more people found jobs, more people were also looking for work as the labour force grew by about 786,000 after a gain of 491,000 in May, bringing it to within 443,000 of its pre-pandemic level.

Statistics Canada said the unemployment rate would have been 16.3 per cent had it included in unemployment counts those who wanted to work, but did not look for a job.

Job gains were made in every province, including by 378,000 in Ontario, marking the first increase since the COVID-19 shutdown, Statistics Canada said. It didn't include any gains in Toronto as restrictions in that city loosened after the survey week.

Despite the good news, economist Jim Stanford said there remains a historic crisis in the job market with high unemployment and hundreds of thousands who have left the labour force altogether.

Also, gains nationally were not shared equally among groups, with women, youth and low-wage workers still slower to rebound, which Stanford said could be problematic if those jobs don't ever come back.

""I worry about a coming second round of layoffs motivated not by health restrictions, but by companies deciding their businesses are going to be permanently smaller. So that would be qualitatively different and in a way worse,"" said Stanford, director of the Centre for Future Work in Vancouver.

""We aren't remotely out of the woods yet, but this was a really encouraging step forward.""

Some three million jobs were lost over March and April due to the pandemic, and 2.5 million more had their hours and earnings slashed. By last month, some 3.1 million were affected by the pandemic, including 1.4 million who weren't at work due to COVID-19.

Brendon Bernard, an economist at Indeed Canada, said recapturing jobs at the same pace in the coming months will be tougher.

""A lot of areas of the economy still aren't running at full capacity,"" Bernard said. ""So while doors may be open and customers might be coming in, business hasn't come back to normal.""

Despite the overall improvement, the oil and gas industry continues to struggle.

The PetroLMI Division of Energy Safety Canada says direct oil and gas employment fell by more than 6,700 positions in June compared with May, with about 70 per cent of the net job losses in Alberta.

Compared with a year earlier, employment in the oil and employment sector was down 17 per cent.

The overall job losses were unprecedented in speed and depth compared with previous recessions, Statistics Canada said, and the rebound to date sharper than previous downturns.

Ottawa's response has been equally unprecedented: a deficit of at least $343.2 billion this fiscal year as the Trudeau Liberals dole out some $230 billion in emergency aid.

In June, 28.3 per cent of Canadians aged 15 to 69 reported receiving some form of federal aid since mid-March, Statistics Canada said. Meanwhile, the proportion of households reporting difficulty paying the bills dropped to 20.1 per cent in June from 22.5 per cent in May.

""Without the federal government being there to support Canadian workers, Canadian businesses and the Canadian provinces and territories, we would be in a bigger mess in this country right now,"" Hassan Yussuff, president of the Canadian Labour Congress said in an interview this week.

The Bank of Canada and federal government believe the worst of the economic pain from the pandemic is behind the country, but Canada will face high unemployment and low growth until 2021.

In a statement, federal Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough touted the overall jobs numbers as a sign the government's plan was working, before adding many Canadians still ""face real challenges during this time.""

She and other ministers are now reshaping programs so fewer workers stay on the $80-billion emergency benefit, and more get tied to jobs through the $82-billion wage subsidy program.

""We understand the need for those emergency programs. We also understand as we reopen and recover, we have to move away from emergency programs and into stimulus and recovery,"" said Leah Nord, senior director of workforce strategies for the Canadian Chamber of Commerce.

She said there are other issues to resolve around health and safety in the workplace, transit, and child care to help more Canadians get back to work.

In provinces where daycares reopened for children five and under, employment levels returned to pre-pandemic levels for fathers in June, but not for mothers. Similarly, mothers with children under 18 were more likely than fathers to work less than half their usual hours in June, Statistics Canada said.

Job gains have come at a faster clip for men. Their unemployment rate hit 12.1 per cent in June compared to 12.7 per cent for women. And the underutilization rate — which counts those who are unemployed, those who want a job but didn't look for one, and those working less than half their usual hours — was 28.3 for women and 25.5 per cent for men.

Economist Armine Yalnizyan said the numbers underscore the need to provide child care as well as options for schooling in the fall so mothers can work.

The alternative, she said, could pull back any economic gains.

""It means that even if there are jobs, some women won't be able to take them because there's no way they can leave their kids,"" said Yalnizyan, a fellow on the future of workers at the Atkinson Foundation.

""So we are looking at the potential for an economic depression instead of talking about paces of recovery and pivoting to building to better.""

Three Cabinet ministers in the administration of Bolivian leader Jeanine Áñez have also tested positive for the virus, including Health Minister Eidy Roca and Presidency Minister Yerko Nuñez, who is hospitalized.

article continues below

The infections in Venezuela, Brazil and Bolivia, which is seeing a spike in cases, come after Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández tested positive in June and was briefly hospitalized.

Áñez said she will remain in isolation for 14 days when another test will be done, but she will continue to work remotely from the presidential residence.

""I feel good, I feel strong,"" she wrote on her Twitter account.

Bolivia’s Health Ministry says the Andean country has 42,984 confirmed coronavirus cases and 1,577 deaths, and is seeing a rebound in the number of new cases amid reports that hospitals are being overwhelmed in some regions. In the highland city of Cochabamba, scenes have emerged of bodies lying in the streets and coffins waiting for days in homes to be taken away.

Bolivia is scheduled to hold a presidential election Sept. 6. Áñez is running third in opinion polls. Former Economy Minister Luis Arce, who represents the party of ousted President Evo Morales, is in front, with ex-President Carlos Mesa in second.

In Venezuela, meanwhile, socialist party chief Diosdado Cabello revealed that he had tested positive for COVID-19, making him the highest-ranking leader in the distressed South American nation thus far to come down with the virus.

Cabello is considered the second-most powerful person in Venezuela after President Nicolás Maduro and made the announcement on Twitter, stating that he is isolated, getting treatment and will overcome the illness.

""We will win!"" he wrote in conclusion.

Economically struggling Venezuela is considered one of the world’s least prepared countries to confront the pandemic. Hospitals are routinely short on basic supplies like water, electricity and medicine.

The nation has registered considerably fewer COVID-19 cases than others in the region, but the number of infections has grown in recent weeks. As of Wednesday, the government had reported 8,010 confirmed cases and 75 deaths.

Cabello was last seen Tuesday, when he met with South Africa’s ambassador, Joseph Nkosi. Photographs released by the government showed him standing alongside and bumping fists with the diplomat while wearing a black mask.

The 57-year-old politician is head of the National Constituent Assembly, an all-powerful legislative body created by Maduro’s government in 2017. He had missed his weekly television program Wednesday, stating at the time that he was ""fighting against a strong allergy"" and resting.

Maduro said in a broadcast Thursday that Cabello’s diagnosis was confirmed with a molecular exam — a test that is usually conducted with a nasal swab sample. Venezuela has done far fewer of these tests than neighbouring countries, instead largely deploying rapid blood antibody tests. Some experts fear that relying so heavily on the rapid tests, which don’t detect signs of illness early in an infection, means cases are being missed.

""Venezuela is with Diosdado,"" Maduro said. ""I am sure soon enough we will continue on in this fight.""

In Brazil, President Jair Bolsonaro was diagnosed with COVID-19 on Tuesday.

He appeared Thursday on an online broadcast from the presidential residence as defiant as on previous occasions. He coughed once, but did not show other symptoms of the disease that has killed more than 69,000 people in the South American nation.

Bolsonaro repeated his view that the economic crisis brought on by the pandemic is more dangerous than the coronavirus itself. He insisted that mayors and governors need to reopen the country for business.

""We need governors and mayors, within their responsibilities, to reopen commerce. Otherwise the consequences will be harmful for Brazil,"" Bolsonaro said, wearing a gray shirt and sitting comfortably in front of two national flags.",[]

The Montreal-based company announced Thursday that it is sending notices to terminate the leases at the 124 stores to take effect in 30 days. The move would affect about half of its workforce of nearly 2,500, including all 366 employees in the United States.

It will also seek more favourable lease terms for the remaining 100 stores in Canada and may permanently shut additional locations if landlords are unwilling to negotiate suitable leases.

It had warned in mid-June that it could begin a formal restructuring depending on the outcome of its talks with landlords.

The company said at the time that it hadn't paid rent on any of its stores for April, May and June.

The store closures are part of its restructuring plan after it obtained court protection from creditors under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act and Chapter 15 in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.

""With the upcoming closure of 124 unprofitable stores across North America, we are certainly making good progress in creating a stronger business model for the future and ensuring the long-term success and sustainability of DavidsTea and our beloved brand,"" company founder and interim CEO Herschel Segal said in a news release.

Chief financial officer Frank Zitella said that with the closure of ""a significant number of money-losing stores"" it will focus exclusively on e-commerce sale which had a penetration rate of close to 43 per cent in the market before COVID-19.

""All 100 remaining DavidsTea stores have been closed since March 17 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and will remain so until further notice,"" he stated.

DavidsTea last month reported that it lost $23.2 million last year on $146.5 million in revenues. That includes a US$4.3 million loss in its fiscal fourth quarter on US$54.8 million of revenues.

The move by DavidsTea comes three years after Starbucks announced the closure of all of its Teavana brand stores. The coffee giant acquired Teavana Holdings in 2012 for US$620 million.

The cancellation of the 2020 national football championship game because of COVID-19, and U Sports not altering an age eligibility rule, accelerates the swan song of roughly 300 football players.

article continues below

U Sports has said student-athletes whose championships are cancelled in 2020-21 because of the pandemic will not lose a year of eligibility.

But football players have seven years after graduating from high school to complete their five-year eligibility. Many play junior football before entering the university ranks.

The only U Sports sport with an age limit is football.

University of Calgary quarterback Josiah Joseph of the defending Vanier Cup champion Dinos is among those caught in a rule designed to limit the age of players in Canadian university football to under 25.

Players who turn 25 before Sept. 1 age out of university football. Joseph turns 25 on July 10, 2021.

Approximately 300 players out of 2,335 will be similarly impacted in 2021, according to U Sports.

Joseph hoped U Sports would make an exception for players like him.

""All they would have to do is amend the rule and push it to maybe January first due to extreme circumstances,"" he told The Canadian Press.

""It's devastating there's that many players in my position.""

U Sports adopted a football age cap to prevent large gaps in physical maturation and experience between players in a collision sport, and also to create room on rosters for younger players, according to U Sports interim CEO Dick White.

""I really understand the disappointment of the players that this affects,"" said White, who took over for departed CEO Graham Brown last month.

""Our legal advice that we received was very firm. If we believe the age cap should be 25 for the health and safety of athletes then we should not under any circumstances alter that.

""The reasons for having that age cap have not changed even though we've had the tragedy of COVID.""

Joseph argues there is no physical or experience difference between a player who turns 25 in March and one who turns 25 in October.

""There's already 25 year olds playing in the league so what's the difference of a couple months?"" he asked. ""There is none.""

U Sport cancelling the 2020 Vanier Cup and the two bowl games — Mitchell and Uteck — that serve as semifinals doesn't stop conferences from playing football in the fall.

But Canada West, Ontario University Athletics and Atlantic University Sport have already declared there won't be football in 2020 because of the pandemic.

The Reseau du sport etudiant du Quebec is still working on running football this fall.

University of Bisons head coach Brian Dobie points out fifth-year players aren't the only ones impacted.

Any current university football player whose birthday falls before Sept. 1 will lose a year of football eligibility because of the combination of the pandemic and the current rule.

""What about that kid who had two years left and he just got a starting spot? Now Johnny has one year left. What about Billy who had three years left and now has two years left?"" Dobie asked.

""If you have one kid in your program that is negatively affected by this, as a coach you should be outraged. Every kid should count just the same and you should be outraged.""

Losing a year of football eligibility also means losing a year of athletic scholarship to pay for school, Dobie added.

""The reality is the age cap is 25 and it's not 26 and somewhere you draw the line,"" White said.

""If the football institutions wish to re-address the age cap to 26 or no age cap, that's up to our member institutions. There's a process to do that.

""The big picture here was there was a very good reason we put the age cap in. Our board of directors, supported by the legal opinion, said 'don't move it.'""

Joseph doesn't buy that rationale.

""It doesn't seem like it's reflecting the interests of a lot of coaches and players that make up U Sports football that make it successful, the guys that are going to be there for five years who are going to graduate that are going to be proud alumni,"" he said.

""That's what makes up university football in Canada.""

“The City of Burnaby is lucky to have wonderful arts and culture facilities in our community,” said Mayor Mike Hurley in a news release. “We’re taking special care to ensure Burnaby residents can stay safe and healthy when they return to these facilities.”

The three facilities and programs set to open up are:

Shadbolt Centre for the Arts - programs only

Fine arts programs restart at the Shadbolt Centre for the Arts on Monday, July 13, but the facility will remain closed for general public use. Fine arts programs include visual arts, dance, theatre, writing and music programs for children, youth and adults. Advanced registration is required. Call 604-297-4440, Monday to Friday, 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Programs include ceramics, dance, visual arts, literary arts and more.

In addition to the impact on each individual’s care, test data is critical to strategic planning and public policy.

As well as informing us, however, testing issues have also created a great deal of confusion and frustration. The terminology and specifics are new to most, and the criteria for and access to testing has fluctuated a great deal in a short period of time. After four months, here’s where we stand:

article continues below

Summary points

* Testing is now available to anyone with symptoms of COVID-19, however mild;

* Those needing COVID-19 assessment are encouraged to call their family doctor or nurse practitioner's office, call 811, or attend the hospital emergency department (ER);

* Powell River and qathet Region District have had very few confirmed cases of COVID-19 to date, but remain at risk for future outbreaks. Ongoing attention to public health measures is still critically important.

Criteria for testing

Most COVID-19 patients have cold or flu-like symptoms, though onset may be gradual over days. Those with severe symptoms should attend the ER without delay. Common symptoms include fever, fatigue, cough, shortness of breath, muscle aches, sore throat, lack of appetite, and loss of taste or smell. Headaches, confusion, runny nose, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and rashes are less typical, but may occur.

People without any symptoms (asymptomatic) are not generally tested in BC, except in special circumstances such as a public health investigation of an outbreak. In addition to using limited resources, testing asymptomatic individuals can lead to high rates of false positives (test is positive, but the person doesn’t actually have the virus). An online symptom checker is available at https://bc.thrive.health/covid19/en, or through 811.

Where to get tested

People are encouraged to call their nurse practitioner or family doctor if they feel they may have COVID-19. In addition to reviewing criteria for testing, a primary care provider knows their patient's medical history and can direct them accordingly. Some clinics offer testing on site, including drive-through testing, while others will refer to another office or to the hospital.

Assessment and testing for COVID-19 at Powell River General Hospital is located in the ambulance bay of the ER. There is a separated space for one patient at a time, and it is cleaned after each use. Efforts are being made to reduce wait times, but these do vary.

Those coming to the ER for respiratory symptoms or COVID-19 assessment are encouraged to call ahead (604.485.3211), and will be directed outside to the ambulance entrance where there is a buzzer to advise staff on arrival. Testing is available 24/7, if needed.

People being assessed and tested for COVID-19 will only be brought into the main ER department if they need further investigations or treatment. Dedicated areas are used for this purpose.

Procedure for outpatient testing

Testing for COVID-19 involves essentially a small cotton swab on a plastic stick that is inserted into one’s nose, turned a few times, then removed and placed in a tube. Nasal swabs may make one’s eyes water, but are generally described as uncomfortable rather than painful.

Locally, all COVID-19 swabs are packaged at the hospital and flown to Vancouver once or twice daily for processing. Results are typically by 8 am the day after they are received in Vancouver.

Powell River Hospital has secured a small supply of rapid tests that can identify a COVID-19 result within an hour. Owing to the very limited supply, these are generally reserved for critical situations.

Most people with COVID-19 (over 80 per cent) will be well enough to stay at home during their illness.

After being tested, patients are given instructions and an information sheet on how to self-isolate until test results are available. Staying home when sick is considered by many experts as the single most effective strategy to limit COVID-19 in a community.

Results

To confirm a negative test people may wish to speak with their primary care provider, use myehealth.ca, or call the BCCDC negative results line between 8:30 am and 4:30 pm, seven days per week, at 1.833.707.2792.

Those with positive test results will be notified rapidly by Public Health. In BC thus far, over 98 per cent of positive cases were reached in under 24 hours. The family doctor or nurse practitioner will also receive the result.

If someone tests positive for COVID-19, a public health staff member will call them daily until they are cleared (usually 10 days if minimal symptoms). They will offer direction on self-isolation and help advise how to manage symptoms, including when to seek further care.

The public health team will also take a detailed history to identify who has had close contact with a positive case, including up to 48 hours before that person's symptoms first developed.

Those people identified by public health as having a significant risk of exposure (e.g. sustained close contact, household members, no physical distancing or protective equipment) will be notified as soon as possible, and will be advised to self-isolate (and to test if they develop symptoms). Contact tracing is not generally done for very brief, distanced, or other low risk encounters.

Future plans

Blood testing for immunity (i.e. past infection) is not yet available for routine use. It is still unclear how accurate these tests are, and how long immunity from natural infection can be detected.

As we move into the fall, we expect an increase in respiratory viruses of all types. Detailed plans for additional testing sites have been developed and will be implemented based on capacity and need.

Powell River data

Local medical officer of health Dr. Geoff McKee reported last week that the lower Sunshine Coast has had a total of six cases thus far in the pandemic, and that Powell River region has had fewer than five cases to date (because of the low number and the potential privacy risk for so few cases, the exact number was not given).

Dr. McKee also noted that there were no active cases being followed on the Sunshine Coast. Unfortunately, there could be cases that simply aren’t identified yet, or new cases that may arise at any time. For this reason, regardless of the exact number of confirmed cases, we all need to follow public health recommendations if we hope to protect our community from this virus.

A recent survey completed by the Powell River Division of Family Practice identified that roughly three per cent of people surveyed in our region have been tested for COVID-19. Several barriers to testing were identified by community members, which we are working to address.

Conclusion

While our region has had relatively little COVID-19 activity thus far, global cases continue to rise rapidly. Until there is widespread immunity or a universally effective treatment, we are all vulnerable.

Local physicians will continue to prepare and behave as if there are active cases in the community. Staying home when sick, washing hands, physical distancing with most people, and wearing masks or protective equipment when needed, continue to be the cornerstones of defence for all of us.

In addition public health measures, testing (and contact tracing) is an extremely powerful tool to limit the spread of COVID-19. Anyone who thinks they may have symptoms should call their family doctor or nurse practitioner, call 811, or attend our local emergency department.

Be smart, be safe, and be kind. We are in this together.

Seniors, in particular, are a focus of the report from the Senate's social affairs committee, from those in long-term care homes to those with low incomes.

article continues below

Just this week, the Liberals rolled out one-time special payments of $300 to the more than six million people who receive old-age security, and $200 more for the 2.2 million who also receive the guaranteed income supplement.

The income supports are meant to help seniors facing increased costs as a result of the pandemic, such as more frequent prescription fees and delivery charges for groceries.

Senators on the committee wrote of evidence of ""financial insecurity and increased vulnerability"" for low-income seniors as a result of the first wave of the novel coronavirus.

A potential second wave, which could coincide with the annual flu season that starts in the fall, would make the situation even worse for these seniors ""without concrete and timely government action,"" the report says.

Senators say the Liberals should deliver a plan to help low-income seniors, among other populations vulnerable to economic shocks like new immigrants, no later than the end of August, and contain short- and long-term options.

The report also says the federal government needs to pay urgent attention to seniors in long-term care homes where outbreaks and deaths in the pandemic have been concentrated.

The document made public Thursday morning is the committee's first set of observations on the government's response to the pandemic, with a final report expected later this year.

Before then, the Liberals are planning to provide another economic update like the one delivered Wednesday, or possibly a full budget. The government shelved plans to deliver one at the end of March when the House of Commons went on extended hiatus due to the pandemic.

The long-awaited economic ""snapshot,"" as the Liberals styled it, said federal spending is closing in on $600 billion this fiscal year. That means a deficit of $343 billion, fuelled by emergency pandemic aid that the government budgets at over $230 billion.

The Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada said the spending figures demand a ""full and transparent assessment"" to see what worked, what didn't and what needs to change for an economic recovery.

Hassan Yussuff, president of the Canadian Labour Congress, said the Liberals should take back up their promise to create a national pharmacare system as the government considers its next steps.

A federal advisory council last year calculated the cost of a program at over $15 billion annually, depending on its design.

""The last thing we want to have is Canadians in frail health as we're dealing with this pandemic and I think the government really needs to think of that,"" Yussuff said in an interview Wednesday.

""Had it not been for the health care system we have right now,"" he added later, ""think of how this country would have fared in this pandemic.""

The Senate committee's report also notes the national emergency stockpile of personal protective gear like masks, gowns and gloves wasn't managed well over the years, nor sufficiently stocked when the pandemic struck.

Committee members added concerns that military members could be deployed without sufficient personal protective equipment because of ""inconsistencies from international procurement.""

The stock market crash in March and the plunge in interest rates left many investors feeling uncertain and vulnerable, while still more have been left without work.

article continues below

Tina Cheung, a wealth adviser at Vancity, says it is always important to review your financial plan on a regular basis, but a review can be especially important during times like these.

""During these times of uncertainty it is important to have peace of mind, and to have that peace of mind, to achieve it, is to get a financial check up,"" she said.

Investors who were shocked at the state of their investment portfolios at the end of the first quarter might breathe a sigh of relief when checking their statements for the second quarter as stock markets have rallied off their lows seen near the end of March.

However, Canada's main stock index is still down from where it was a year ago and well off the highs it hit in February before the pandemic struck the markets.

""The effects of the pandemic on the market will eventually pass, like the global financial crisis did, but if these few months created any stress or loss of sleep, we need to go back and talk about your risk appetite,"" Cheung says.

But she says if your risk appetite has not changed and your goal hasn't changed, then it is critical to think long term and stick to your plan.

Before heading into a meeting with your adviser, it is important to have a firm grip of your budget and what your goals are for the meeting.

Cheung says you need to be prepared to have an open discussion and be ready with information like your monthly income and expenses.

For some, reviewing their financial plan may mean difficult decisions, facing depleted emergency funds due to the loss of a job and little prospect for a return to work at a level seen before the pandemic.

A poll done for TD Bank found that 38 per cent of those surveyed identified as financially vulnerable in April 2020 compared with 15 per cent in November last year. The poll also found that 13 per cent of those asked in April felt confident in their financial future compared with 20 per cent in November 2019.

If you have taken advantage of the payment deferrals offered by many lenders, you need to have a clear plan for when those deferral periods come to an end and you need to resume making payments.

Gio Bazile, a district vice-president at TD Bank, says some borrowers may start to struggle once the deferrals come to an end if their income hasn't picked back up again.

""Part of what is going to be really critical is understanding what your future cash flow is going to look like and how do you work with your financial adviser with an impending financial hardship, how do you best balance your wants and needs,"" he said.

Bazile says everyone is going to face their own situation, but it's key to have a candid conversation with your partner or family to understand where you are financially.

""If your cash flow is low or if you are kind of over-leveraged from a debt perspective, then that's probably a time to actually spend some time with your financial adviser,"" he said.

""If you're looking at your savings account and realizing, wait a minute, I may not be able to get through this next two, three months and beyond, that's probably another really big trigger.""

That is, if they can survive long enough to see daylight again.

Those were two of the conclusions in the most recent Restaurants Canada survey of its member businesses.

article continues below

The survey, which heard from nearly 1,000 restaurant owners representing more than 11,500 restaurants, found 56 per cent of restaurant owners believed it would require a year or more to recover from the pandemic, and that at least 50 per cent of them are currently operating at a loss. “Restaurateurs are eager to help rebuild the economy and revive neighbourhoods, but they’re going to need continued assistance from government to remain operational under ongoing restrictions,” said the organization’s vice-president, David Lefebvre.

The results of the survey come as no surprise to Ian Tostenson, president of the B.C. Restaurant and Foodservices Association.

While Tostenson said the provincial situation is a bit of a “mixed bag” of results as B.C. continues to open up its economy, he made it clear there is trouble in the industry.

“Of the nearly 15,000 restaurants in B.C. maybe 60 per cent are actually up and running,” he said, noting many have decided to remain closed temporarily as there’s no business for them and others have closed for good. “Some may never come back. We expect to lose between 20 and 30 per cent of the industry … it’s just too much to expect some of these small businesses to hold on.”

That is especially true in the major markets.

“Downtown Victoria and downtown Vancouver are just disasters,” he said. Downtown restaurants rely heavily on tourism and office workers to stay afloat. “Volumes in those two big markets are tracking 20-30 per cent of where they were at this point last year.”

On the upside, Tostenson said suburban operators and restaurants in small cities and towns around B.C. have reported doing alright.

Overall, he said, they are still dealing with the fact people aren’t yet feeling safe about going out to eat despite the myriad safety precautions the industry has taken.

The survey results have spurred Restaurants Canada to call for the federal government to extend and strengthen support for food-service businesses by maintaining the federal wage subsidy, extending and expanding rent-relief programs and expanding loans for small business.

The first time, he showed up an hour before the public testing site was set to close and was told they had reached capacity. He was turned away from a second centre when rain shut it down, and voluntarily left a third after someone ahead of him said they had been waiting in line for more than three hours.

article continues below

""If you have symptoms and you are just driving around the city trying to figure out how you can get a test, for people who are positive, it is not ideal,"" said Lee, who finally got a test on June 29 after he showed up at a site before dawn and waited for more than two hours. Another five days passed before he was able to view the results online, and he didn't receive a text with the results until seven days after being tested.

Four months, 3 million confirmed infections and over 130,000 deaths into the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S., Americans confronted with a resurgence of the scourge are facing long lines at testing sites in the summer heat or are getting turned away. Others are going a week or more without receiving a diagnosis.

Some sites are running out of kits, while labs are reporting shortages of materials and workers to process the swabs.

Some frustrated Americans are left to wonder why the U.S. can't seem to get its act together, especially after it was given fair warning as the virus wreaked havoc in China and then Italy, Spain and New York.

""It’s a hot mess,"" said 47-year-old Jennifer Hudson of Tucson, Arizona. ""The fact that we’re relying on companies and we don’t have a national response to this, it’s ridiculous. … It’s keeping people who need tests from getting tests.""

It took Hudson five days to make an appointment through a CVS pharmacy near her home. She booked a drive-up test over the weekend, more than a week after her symptoms — fatigue, shortness of breath, headache and sore throat — first emerged. The clinic informed her that her results would probably be delayed.

Testing has been ramped up nationwide, reaching about 640,000 tests per day on average, up from around 518,000 two weeks ago, according to an Associated Press analysis. Newly confirmed infections per day in the U.S. are running at over 50,000, breaking records at practically every turn.

More testing tends to lead to more cases found. But in an alarming indicator, the percentage of tests coming back positive for the virus is on the rise across nearly the entire country, hitting almost 27% in Arizona, 19% in Florida and 17% in South Carolina.

While the U.S. has conducted more tests than any other nation, it ranks in the middle of the pack in testing per capita, behind Russia, Spain and Australia, according to Johns Hopkins University.

""I am stunned that as a nation, six months into this pandemic, we still can’t figure out how to deliver testing to the American people when they need it,"" said Dr. Ashish Jha, director of Harvard’s Global Health Institute. ""It is an abject failure of leadership and shows that the federal government has not prioritized testing in a way that will allow us to get through this pandemic.""

Testing alone without adequate contact tracing and quarantine measures won't control the spread of the scourge, according to health experts. But they say delays in testing can lead to more infections by leaving people in the dark as to whether they need to isolate themselves.

In other developments:

— While the number of confirmed cases in the U.S. hit 3 million Wednesday by Johns Hopkins' count, health officials have said that because of inadequate testing and the many mild infections that have gone unreported, the real number is about 10 times higher, or almost 10% of the U.S. population.

— A crowd of thousands attending President Donald Trump’s campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in late June, along with large groups of people who showed up to protest, ""likely contributed"" to a dramatic surge in new coronavirus cases in the area, Tulsa City-County Health Department Director Dr. Bruce Dart said Wednesday. Tulsa County reported 261 confirmed cases on Monday, a new record one-day high, and another 206 confirmed cases on Tuesday. A spokesman for the Trump campaign didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

— Most New York City students will return to school in the fall two or three days a week and learn online the rest of the time under a plan announced by Mayor Bill de Blasio. He said schools can’t accommodate all their students at any one time and maintain social distancing. The school system in New York is the biggest in the nation, with 1.1 million students. It has been closed since March.

In New York City, the most lethal hot spot in the nation during the spring, testing was scarce early on but is now widely available. As many as 35,000 tests are conducted daily through a combination of private health organizations and city agencies, according to the city Health Department.

""Widespread testing holds the key to reopening our city safely,"" de Blasio said.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services this week said it will open free ""surge testing"" sites in three hard-hit cities: Jacksonville, Florida; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; and Edinburg, Texas. The sites will be able to conduct as many as 5,000 tests a day in each city, with results in three to five days, officials said.

In Georgia, one of the states where cases are surging, officials are rushing to expand testing capacity as demand threatens to overwhelm six major sites around Atlanta, said DeKalb County CEO Michael Thurmond.

""If you project this out over the next three weeks, we can’t handle it,"" he said.

In New Orleans, people were turned away from a free testing site for a third consecutive day after it reached its daily allotment of tests. Health care providers are running low on trays and chemicals needed to run machines used in the tests.

Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego called the situation there ""desperate"" as residents have sat in sun-baked cars for up to 13 hours to get drive-thru testing. Robert Fenton, head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said FEMA is doubling the testing supplies it plans to ship to Arizona.

Patrick Friday, a United Methodist minister in Alabama, went to several hospitals and clinics in Birmingham this week to get checked after his school-age son tested positive. But he was told that unless he had a preexisting condition, he didn’t qualify.

Finally, he ended up at a site offering rapid-result tests and his negative result came back quickly.

""We are several months into this,"" he said. ""How can it be that we can’t go in and get a test?""

""Unfortunately, as we don't anticipate ridership to be back to pre-COVID-19 levels in the foreseeable future, we had to make difficult decisions to deal with the situation as we gain a better understanding of the impacts of the pandemic on our operations,"" Cynthia Garneau, Via's president and CEO, said in a statement Wednesday.

The layoffs take effect on July 24. Affected employees will receive a temporary written layoff notice that respects their collective agreement's terms, the Montreal-based company said. It will maintain access to different programs for the employees.

The company is working to advance its service resumption plan and has seen some recent positive developments, though many routes remain interrupted.

Winnipeg to Churchill is the sole route in service, according to Via Rail's website, which was last updated June 26.

Several routes have partially resumed, while Toronto to Niagara Falls, Toronto to Vancouver, and Montreal to Halifax remain interrupted with all trains cancelled. Some of those routes are slated to resume service Nov. 1.

Via Rail said it plans to bring back employees ""as soon as the customer demand allows it.""

The passenger rail service has faced a rough year with rail blockades impacting service earlier in 2020.

""The current year has been filled with unprecedented challenges,"" said Garneau.

The company temporarily laid off roughly the same number of employees in B.C. and Ontario during rail blockades in the winter. The company said in March that most of those employees would be brought back early that month.

Some routes in those provinces were halted when protests in solidarity with the Wet’suwet’en First Nation blocked railways across Canada.

Morneau delivered a ""snapshot"" of the federal finances Wednesday, for the first time since the pandemic brought much of Canada's economy to its knees.

article continues below

In the update, he said the government is well aware some segments of the population are hurting more than others.

""This crisis has exposed and amplified many inequalities in Canada,"" Morneau said.

The same people have in many cases also been affected more by the virus itself, in part because women, new immigrants, racialized Canadians and Indigenous people are more likely to work in the jobs where contagion is a risk, such as health care, retail and warehouse work.

The documents are careful to note that while racialized Canadians are more likely to work in economic sectors hit hard by the virus — including health care, accommodation and food services — little data has been collected to truly understand the impact on visible minorities and other marginalized communities.

So for example, there is no racial breakdown of who applied for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.

Nor has much data been collected on the ethnicities of people diagnosed with COVID-19. One recent report from Ottawa Public Health said two-thirds of cases over the previous six weeks in its territory were racialized Canadians or new immigrants, but that report was limited in scope and for just one city.

The fiscal snapshot shows women, youth, low-wage workers, racialized Canadians, Indigenous people and new immigrants all saw higher rates of job loss or reduced working hours, and are also seeing slow, and in some cases no, benefits as the economy begins to recover.

Jobs in sectors dominated by men, such as construction and manufacturing, were faster to come back than those in service industries, tourism, and accommodation, where women and immigrants tend to be employed in bigger proportion.

New Canadians in particular have seen very little job recovery thus far, the report says.

Businesses owned by women and racialized Canadians were more likely to report declines in orders and clients, and a higher need for rent relief.

Women were also hit harder by the closing of schools and daycares, with women who have kids under the age of six reporting significantly larger declines in hours worked than women with no children or older ones.

""Going forward, anything we do must be about growth, resilience, and creating opportunity for those who were most impacted by this crisis,"" said Morneau.

""This pandemic has identified clear gaps and it’s giving us a chance to reset.""

Exactly how he plans to do that is not clear. The government has said some of the $14-billion aid package offered to provinces to help them safely reopen their economies needs to include child care investments.

""We've been very clear that having access to child care is going to be critically important for us to get back to work,"" Morneau said in a news conference with reporters. ""Women have been harder hit through the course of this pandemic and our measures therefore need to consider that challenge.""

But a month after Ottawa put the $14 billion on the table, the provinces have not yet accepted Ottawa's requirements for getting access to that money.

There is also little information about how the government intends to try to level the economic playing field so the gaps that led to inequalities going into the pandemic are closed.

Morneau said for now the government is focused on the safe restart of the economy and the longer-term recovery plan is still in development.

Green MP Elizabeth May said governments have to make child care and safe school reopenings a bigger priority because without those things, parents — and most often mothers — are not going to be able to return to work.

""We know that's an economic blow we can't risk and we know that's a step back for women's rights we can't accept,"" she said.

May said the snapshot was ""exception"" for the depth of its gender-based analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on women. She said the answer to stopping the damage is three things: ""Child care, child care, child care.""

“The court has gradually resumed some regular operations, including trials, chambers applications and other hearings and conferences, many of which proceed remotely,” B.C. Supreme Court Chief Justice Christopher Hinkson said in a July 7 directive.

article continues below

“While the court has expanded the scope of its in-person operations, counsel, parties, litigants and members of the public are discouraged from attending courthouses unless their personal attendance is necessary or the court so directs,” he said.

B.C. Court of Appeal

In B.C.’s high court, the suspension of service and filing deadlines for existing appeals and chambers applications started March 18 and has been extended to July 27. As of July 14, parties may now request that appeal hearings proceed in a courtroom or by Zoom videoconference.

The court registry is accepting filings in all matters. In civil appeals, electronic filing remains mandatory for lawyers and optional for self-represented litigants.

The time periods for filing cases remains suspended.

“You can wait without concern that the limitation period to start civil or family proceedings will expire,” a July 7 directive from Chief Justice Robert Bauman said.

“Persons in the courtroom are not required to wear masks, but everyone may of course do so, except when addressing the Court at the hearing,” Bauman said. “Counsel/litigants must bring their own water supply and present their arguments from their own table (individual lecterns will be provided). Furniture will be cleaned and disinfected between hearings.”



B.C. Supreme Court

Effective July 13, in-person registry services will resume at all Supreme Court registries and the interim process for requesting a hearing of an urgent or essential matter will no longer be available, Hinkson said.

In criminal matters, bail and bail review hearings, detention review hearings, regular fix-date appearances and regular pre-trial conferences, COVID pre-trial conferences and case management conferences will continue by phone, a directive from Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes said.

Those using registries are recommended to continue using electronic, mail or fax filings where possible.

For family law matters, parties are no longer automatically relieved of the requirement to attend a judicial case conference before making an application by written submissions but that can still be done via phone.

Judicial case conferences already scheduled to occur on or after June 1 will resume by phone.

Civil and family trials scheduled to begin on or after June 8 have resumed unless otherwise directed.

“The resumption of civil and family trials may be subject to change as a result of limitations on available facilities or public health recommendations,” Hinkson said.

Jury selections remain cancelled until September. In civil cases where a jury notice has been filed and served, if all parties consent to proceeding by judge alone, they may seek such an order at a trial management conference.

Effective April 15, a ministerial order suspended limitation periods and mandatory time periods for the commencement of a civil or family proceedings from March 18, 2020 to the date on which the last extension of the declaration of the state of emergency.

“Once this suspension is lifted, more directions will be provided by the court,” Hinkson said.



B.C. Provincial Court

Chief Judge Melissa Gillespie announced July 8, provincial court would return to receiving all filings at the applicable court registry either in-person or remotely.

The provincial court had already begun re-opening June 15 courtrooms on a limited basis outside hub centres of Surrey, Vancouver Victoria, Prince George, and Kelowna where limited in-person hearings began a week earlier.

As of July 8, 2020, registries will accept all family cases filings. Small claims filings will be accepted July 13 while urgent small claims matters will only be heard by telephone.

Full details of provincial court operations are available here.

558,tricitynews,https://www.tricitynews.com/covid-19/federal-website-advertising-hundreds-of-non-existent-student-volunteer-positions-1.24166955,Federal website advertising hundreds of non-existent student-volunteer positions,[],,"OTTAWA — The federal website advertising volunteer positions for students hoping to earn money for their educations through a $900-million government aid program contains hundreds of positions that do not actually exist.

Among the student-volunteer positions advertised as available on the I Want to Help website are 1,500 spots with YMCA Canada to help create online exercise regimes for kids and seniors in their communities.

article continues below

Yet the YMCA says those positions were actually the brainchild of WE Charity, the organization originally tapped by the Liberal government to administer the Canada Student Services Grant, and that the YMCA never agreed to them.

Both the YMCA and WE blame a miscommunication as WE scrambled to get the grant program — through which students can get up to $5,000 toward their schooling if they volunteer the maximum 500 hours — up and running as quickly as possible.

WE has since withdrawn from running the program.

In an interview, YMCA Canada president Peter Dinsdale said his organization proposed hosting 391 volunteers through dozens of YMCA locations. They would focus on three areas: helping local branches with marketing and website design; data analysis; and assisting seniors with tech questions.

The YMCA arrived at the number after reaching out to branches across the country, Dinsdale said, after which the national office drew up a draft memorandum of understanding with WE to formalize the arrangement.

""We sent a draft in and they sent a draft back and that's when we saw these other positions and we asked to separate them,"" he said of the 1,500 positions for online exercise regimes. ""And they said great. And we haven't heard from them since all this has gone down.""

""These discussions (with the YMCA) took place quickly, given our short timeline for delivery, and some confusion arose around the two separate agreements,"" WE said in a statement to The Canadian Press.

""That confusion contributed to a misunderstanding on our part which led to one group of service positions being posted, rather than the other group of service positions.""

It nonetheless means those advertised positions are not actually available.

The status of thousands of other positions apparently created by WE to meet the requirements of the volunteer program remains uncertain.

Youth Minister Bardish Chagger's spokeswoman Danielle Keenan stood by the Canada Student Services Grant program on Wednesday, saying that while there will be delays in its rollout following WE's departure, the government remains committed to it.

""The Canada Student Service Grants program provides opportunities for students who want to help with their communities COVID-19 response,"" Keenan said in an email to The Canadian Press.

""Although the delivery of the program will change, our objective has not changed which is to ensure students, not-for-profits, and communities are supported throughout the pandemic.""

WE and the Liberal government announced last week that they were ending a sole-sourced contract to have the charity manage the grant program after questions were raised about a potential conflict of interest between Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the organization.

Dinsdale said the YMCA did not know the 1,500 positions had been posted, noting the agreement with WE was never signed. At the same time, the 391 positions that the YMCA does want to fill have yet to be advertised. Dinsdale said the YMCA is waiting to hear from the government on those.

""The 391 that we're actually putting forward, our Ys are ready and willing to engage in it and there are some really interesting opportunities that could exist for youth and our YMCAs and communities,"" he said. ""So we're certainly hopeful those go ahead.""

Thousands of other positions posted on the federal website involve the creation of online content or the mentoring of other students on such topics as COVID-19's impact on the environment, nutrition and cyberbullying.

Some of those are posted in huge batches, such as a call for 1,000 volunteers to be trained to hold one-to-one sessions with people on ""the impact of COVID-19 on food security in your community.""

Another seeks 1,250 volunteers to devise ""social-media assets"" such as captions, memes and videos, for local and regional awareness campaigns to help stop the spread of COVID-19.

None of those postings includes the name of a hosting organization: they're listed as ""supporting local non-profits in your community"" rather than with a specific agency.

WE did indicate that it was behind many of them as it sought to meet the government's requirement that in order to be eligible for the student grant, positions must be linked to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""The purpose of the CSSG was to engage tens of thousands of post-secondary students in service programs to assist with the impact of COVID-19,"" WE said in its statement.

""COVID-19 has been in Canada for a relatively short period of time and there are limited new service opportunities related to addressing (it). This is partly why WE was brought in (to) develop and co-ordinate service roles that fulfil the program guidelines and deliver a meaningful impact.""

Employment and Social Development Canada, which will now administer the grant program instead of WE, did not respond to repeated questions about the positions, including whether they would move ahead or not.

Conservative employment critic Dan Albas said the questions about the federal website underscore the need for answers when it comes to the student grant program, including how positions have been chosen or created and what benefit they are expected to have.

""To find out that perhaps hundreds of positions have been put forward and in good faith maybe people have applied for those positions without having a correction from the government?"" he said.

""This is public money. They need to come clean and clean up this program so that any dollar that is spent gets the maximum opportunities for young people and value for money for taxpayer dollars.""

The service industry — which includes businesses such as hair salons, schools, hospitals, gyms, hotels and restaurants — have racked up 104 orders out of 334 issued to up to July 3.

article continues below

The next most common industry to receive an order as of July 3, is the manufacturing sector, which includes meat processing plants, which have been hard hit by COVID-19, including a poultry plant in Coquitlam, as well as breweries, sawmills and pharmaceuticals.

In mid-May, an outbreak at Superior Poultry was declared over, and the plant allowed to re-open after instituting safety protocols.

Still, WorkSafeBC reports that most employers are doing their due diligence when it comes to meeting industry-specific guidelines.

However, when employers aren’t taking measures to protect workers from COVID-19 exposure, they could be issued an order for health or safety violations.

For the most part, though, employers have been taking the proper steps to re-open their businesses safely during the provincial re-start plan.

“Overall, the vast majority of employers are taking health and safety very seriously during the re-opening. Our inspections are finding that businesses want to be in compliance, and our prevention officers are providing support to help them have an effective COVID-19 Safety Plan,” stated Ivy Yuen, media relations representative in an email to The Tri-City News.

Data is not broken down regionally, so it is difficult to ascertain how many Tri-City businesses were given an order to beef up health and safety protocols.

Since, June 26, WorkSafeBC has conducted more than 12,000 worksite inspections in B.C. related to COVID-19.

The focus of these inspections has been to ensure employers have a COVID-19 Safety Plan in place, according to Yuen, who noted: “This plan needs to assess the risks to workers, and implement measures to prevent the transmission of COVID-19 in the workplace.”

Orders are usually issued as a result of an inspection or can be part of a follow-up activity.

Data posted by WorkPlace BC online shows that employers have a lot of questions about how to manage in the new pandemic reality. In recent weeks, it has has fielded 9,823 questions, 1,728 reports of potential violations and 21 workplace incidents.

There have also been 12,646 inspections, with the large service sector receiving the most at 4,615, followed by 2,988 for trade-related businesses, which includes supermarkets, retail stores and gas stations, 1,256 for the manufacturing sector, 886 for primary resource companies, such as oil and gas, 234 for transportation and warehousing, and 180 for the public sector, including government and law enforcement.

Other industries are being ordered to improve their safety protocols, according to the data.

Inspectors have issues 65 orders for the trade sector, 60 for construction, 18 for primary resources, three for public sector and two for transportation and warehousing, which includes taxis and ride hailing.",[]

Golf Canada reports that there were 17 per cent more scores registered with the national sport body this June compared to the same month last year. A total of 1,483,506 rounds were submitted to Golf Canada's handicap calculator last month compared to 1,271,782 in June 2019.

article continues below

""It was a pretty big jump from last year, comparing 2019 numbers to this year,"" said Adam Helmer, senior director of golf services for Golf Canada, on Wednesday. ""We were expecting that as golf has emerged as one of the safest activities, where people can be physically distant and we've reduced touchpoints.""

The surge in June ended a streak of three months when recreational rounds played in Canada dropped precipitously due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

As restrictions were lifted across the country in May, the number of scores registered increased.

In May, 165,026 rounds were registered between the 1st and the 15th but 265,480 scores were submitted in the final two weeks of that month. The May 1-15 numbers are a nearly 40 per cent drop from the same period in 2019 (211,809) but the May 16-30 numbers are just five per cent lower than last year (269,266).

Helmer said he expects the number of rounds submitted to Golf Canada to continue to climb through July and into August.

""We've heard anecdotally that a lot of newcomers have joined the sport, especially now that school is done we're going to see an increase in juniors too. We think the trend is going to continue,"" said Helmer. ""Golf has seen a pretty big lift and it's emerged as the sport of the summer.""

The upward trend comes even as Golf Canada had to cancel all of its amateur and professional championships due to travel restrictions put in place to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.

A shift in how scores are registered has also been seen, with most recreational players entering their scores online instead of in the course's clubhouse or pro shop, which have largely been closed this summer because of physical distancing protocols.

Golf Canada plans to launch an updated version of its scoring app later this month, helping to keep players physically distant and improve their game.

He cautioned Wednesday (July 8) some “hotspots” still remain in long-term care and some agricultural setting.

article continues below

The prime minister made the comments in a media briefing ahead of a scheduled fiscal update — or “snapshot” — from Finance Minister Bill Morneau later in the day.

Trudeau said he would leave the details of the snapshot to his finance minister, but added it was imperative for the federal government to have acted right from the outset of the COVID-19 crisis.

“The cost of doing nothing would have been far more,” he said, adding the pandemic has not been a time for “belt-tightening.”

He said the country has been able to slow down progression of the novel coronavirus significantly and parts of the economy have since been able to reopen.

Trudeau repeatedly touted the nation’s historically low interest rates, which he said would help pay off the accumulated debt.

“If the federal government hadn’t taken on significant debt in order to send money to Canadians to support businesses and households, what would Canadians have done?” he asked.

“They would have loaded up their credit cards, they would have scrambled to try and find ways to pay their bills, pay their groceries and figure out how to care for their loved ones.”

The prime minister said he’s confident about the federal government’s response to the pandemic, which has included hundreds of billions in spending, because of the reduced spread of COVID-19 over the past four months.

“This recession is very different from the last recession,” Trudeau said, adding the 2020 economic problems are related to a health crisis.

“There are going to be really important discussions and political debates about what our economy looks like in the coming years.”

He stated earlier in the briefing that his government was also at work at addressing racial injustices that have been brought to the forefront of conversation following the death of unarmed Black man George Floyd in Minneapolis in May.

Trudeau said fighting discrimination is a top priority and mentioned the need for more capital to help fund racialized entrepreneurs.

The prime minister also faced questions on his involvement in the government’s decision to award the handling of $900-million student grant program to the WE Charity, which has longstanding ties to Trudeau and his family.

“The recommendation to use WE to get opportunities out for young people was made by the public service, but as a cabinet we ratify those decisions,” Trudeau said, adding he did not recuse himself from any cabinet decisions related to the charity.

“I love long worked on youth issues both before I got into politics and since I’ve been in politics.”

Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump and Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador are meeting in Washington, D.C., Wednesday to recognize the ratification of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which replaces NAFTA.

Trudeau had earlier declined the invite from Trump but he was quick to reiterate his concerns over the potential for the Americans to reintroduce aluminum tariffs on Canada.

He once again said the U.S. does not produce enough aluminum to fulfill domestic manufacturing needs and any tariffs against Canada imposed by the Americans would hurt the U.S. economy by adding additional costs to customers.

Trump originally hit Canada with aluminum tariffs in 2018, citing national security concerns.

Most recently, she worked full time as a server at the Chateau Victoria Hotel’s Vista 18 restaurant for two years before being laid off due to the COVID-19 pandemic on March 17.

article continues below

“Growing up in Victoria where the hospitality sector is such an important part of our economy, I always thought that this would be a safe industry to work in,” she said Tuesday during a rally for hotel workers at the legislature. “As long as I worked hard and provided good service, I never worried about the insecurity of losing my job, until now.

“Since being laid off I constantly teeter on what tomorrow’s going to look like with financial burdens and obviously emotionally it’s impacted me heavily, as well.”

Only a few people have been called back to work at Chateau Victoria since the pandemic started, Spiteri said.

“And there’s no word on when the rest of us are going to be brought back to the hotel.”

Spiteri was among about 60 people demonstrating for a legal right to return to their jobs as the recovery from COVID continues. Participants were from Victoria, Vancouver and other parts of the Lower Mainland.

Spiteri said the level of insecurity she is feeling is “overwhelming.”

“I’ve been on [Employment Insurance] for a really, really long time and at this point I’m barely scraping by.”

The industry will eventually improve, she said. “Why won’t the industry promise to bring us back? Why won’t the government make that guarantee for us?”

Spiteri said she and other hotel workers at the rally have built careers in the hospitality industry.

“These aren’t just jobs, they’re a vital part of B.C.’s economy.”

Unite Here Local 40 organized the rally. The union has 6,000 members in B.C., including 500 in the capital region working at establishments such as the Chateau Victoria Hotel and Coast Victoria Hotel and Marina, said Stephanie Fung, union spokesperson. They are among more than 50,000 hotel workers in B.C.

The B.C. Hotel Association is seeking support from all levels of government to keep its businesses — and its jobs — alive, at a time when hotels are not profitable, even if many are open.

Ingrid Jarrett, hotel association chief executive, said it is critical that province extend the temporary layoff provision past the Aug. 30 end date and for the federal government to extend the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit in tandem. It proposes that those supports last until the sector regains 70 per cent of its historic revenues.

The association wants B.C. to allow municipalities to grant property tax relief for hotels.

Without this kind of help, Jarrett predicts a third of B.C.’s hotels could shut down.

“It is a very, very dire time and we have very limited confidence that the summer is actually going to allow many of the businesses to survive.”

B.C. has 83,000 hotel rooms in 1,252 hotels. Of those hotels, 25 per cent remain closed, she said. Those that are open are running at about 30 per cent capacity.

More than 80 per cent of hotels in B.C. are small and medium-sized businesses, she said.

Jarrett would like to see B.C. opened to travellers from elsewhere in Canada this summer.

The association is proposing that B.C. allow meetings and conferences, possibility by fall. They would follow health and safety protocols, and allow attendees from elsewhere in Canada and from international locations where the infection rate is low.

Frank Bourree, tourism consultant and vice-chair of the South Island Prosperity Partnership, pointed to the relationship between jobs and a healthy industry.

“The problem is that very few tourism businesses are going to be up to full capacity in order to bring everybody back, even through the fall. So is there even a job for them to come back to?

“I think it is great that they [workers] are bringing profile to the loss of tourism jobs here but there has to be an employer there to employ them. And the industry is really precarious right now.”

Employees need to be supported until their jobs come back, Bourree said.

Another key factor is that when the temporary layoff period winds up, employers have to pay severance. “For the employers, if they’ve got a huge severance hit, that might push them right over the edge into bankruptcy,” Bourree said.

Tourism represents 10 per cent of the employment base in the capital region, Bourree said.

Greater Victoria hotels are running at about 25 per cent occupancy, down from 80 per cent a year ago, he said.

“Nobody believes that we are going to see international travel into B.C. for the balance of this year.”

Even when a hotel is open, it is unlikely to be profitable, Bourree said. Most open hotels are operating on a “shoestring,” he said.

The challenge locally and within the rest of the province, is that B.C. visitors stay on the weekends and not during the week, meaning the industry is not filling enough rooms. Travellers from elsewhere in Canada and internationally typically stay long and stay during the week, Bourree said.

It’s easy for Canadians to look southward and shake their heads in bemused smugness at the daily penchant of Americans to indulge in conspiracy theories and demonizing of disfavoured segments of society.



But I’m getting a whiff of that attitude here in Canada now. It serves as a reminder how easily irrationality and fear can spark reactions leading to full-blown witch hunts and targeting of the “others.”

The past few days I’ve seen multiple news reports of people reporting cars with U.S. plates. For some, the immediate reaction was to assume the owners of those cars have no right to be where they are, and then make the irrational link that anyone who comes from the U.S. must be dripping with coronavirus that will spread to anything they touch.

article continues below

These fears were stoked by some unfortunate remarks by the premier, which were fortunately walked back by more measured remarks by Dr. Bonnie Henry.

This jump to conclusions affects me personally. Last month, my wife and I moved to Victoria from California. It is a move we have planned for five years and was irretrievably set in motion a year before anyone ever heard of the novel coronavirus.

But now that we are here — thoroughly inspected and interrogated by both CBSA and provincial health officials at the border and after completing our 14-day isolation (which confirmed our symptom-free condition during the three months of lockdown in California) — we are now faced with a very un-Canadian attitude of guilt-by-association for anyone whose car (as does ours) bears U.S. plates.

Leave aside the fact that COVID-19 spreads generally by transmission of fluids during close (usually confined, indoor) contact with someone else; leave aside the fact that wearing a mask and keeping distance are the two most effective ways to avoid transmission, wherever the suspected carrier hails from; leave aside the fact that the incidence of mask-wearing in B.C. seems far below what my wife and I expected and practise ourselves.

The mere fact someone belongs to a “suspect group” (owners of cars with U.S. plates) does not make them public-health pariahs; that is the heart of the conspiracy-driven, fear-mongering in the U.S. we Canadians rightfully disparage.

The news reports invariably actually talk with the car owners and discover that they are here legitimately.

But they fear reprisal from the unthinking, who are quick to grab their pitchfork and call for a witch-burning.

I know my wife and I are concerned about that as well, wondering if our car will be keyed by some anonymous COVID-19 vigilante; that’s why I ask my name not be reproduced with this letter.

While we all need to remain vigilant and compliant in fighting the pandemic, turning on superficial scapegoats without knowing their full story is no solution and just imports northward a different epidemic we should work equally hard to keep out.

The CFL is reportedly looking at playing in a single hub or two hub cities to limit teams' exposure to the virus. But Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases expert at Toronto General Hospital and associate professor of medicine at the University of Toronto, said positive tests remain possible and could threaten play — just like in other leagues.

article continues below

""The short answer is nothing in this era is going to be without risk,"" Bogoch said during a telephone interview. ""There are certain things we can do to minimize the risk but as with anything, there's going to be some element of risk of acquiring this infection.

""The league and players can work with medical professionals to make this as safe as possible but at the end of the day they'll have to sit down collectively and decide, 'Is this worthwhile.' As individuals they'll have to ask themselves, based on the protocols in place and individual risk perception, risk tolerance and risk threshold, 'Am I willing to play?'""

The CFL and CFL Players' Association continue to discuss amendments to their current collective bargaining agreement that would allow for a partial '20 season. The earliest action would begin is September, but commissioner Randy Ambrosie has said a cancelled campaign also remains possible.

In March, the COVID-19 pandemic forced a global shutdown of sports. In Europe, pro soccer has resumed while domestically Major League Soccer, Major League Baseball, the NHL and NBA are all attempting to either restart or open their seasons.

But it hasn't been easy as all four North American circuits have had players or team officials contract the virus. FC Dallas was forced to withdraw from the MLS is Back Tournament in Orlando after 10 players and one coach tested positive.

The NHL hopes to open training camps Monday and resume play in Edmonton and Toronto on Aug. 1. Players would stay in tightly controlled bubbles and play games without fans.

Teams can bring 52 personnel, with no more than 31 players, to their hub. Everyone in the bubble will be tested daily — including players, staff, hotel workers, food service employees and bus drivers.

Players and team officials will remain inside the bubble except in specific extenuating circumstances. That includes medical attention, the birth of a child or death in the family.

Anyone returning to the bubble will be subject to a minimum four-day quarantine with daily nasal swab tests for COVID-19.

The NHL and NHLPA have the ability to delay, postpone, move or cancel games due to a ""risk to player health and safety"" and/or chance that ""the integrity of the competition"" is in jeopardy, including ""an uncontrolled outbreak of COVID-19.""

However, perhaps the biggest challenge the CFL faces is a financial hurdle. Unlike other major sports entities, it doesn't have a billion-dollar TV deal and thus isn't flush with money.

Ambrosie has stated often the nine-team CFL collectively lost $20 million last year. That hardly puts it in an ideal position to cover food and lodging costs for its teams as well as daily testing.

Bogoch said regardless of the measures taken in a hub or bubble, positive test results are inevitable.

""Oh, 100 per cent and there already have been,"" he said. ""If they do proceed, I think the leagues and fans should be aware that anything can happen.

""The leagues could come to a halt should there be an outbreak or safety concern, individuals or teams might be pulled out. Quite frankly, as much as we want to have high expectations we should really lower them. We're in the COVID-19 era, anything can happen.""

No league has said a specific number of positive tests will result in the cancellation of games.

Bogoch said hubs and bubbles are beneficial. With the exception of baseball, the other three North American leagues are going with hub plans.

""First, they reduce the probability of introducing infection within the bubble,"" he said. ""If (infection) is introduced, it really reduces the probability that it can be transmitted.

""If there's infection it will hopefully be rapidly identified because of the high frequency of diagnostic testing and symptom checks. Now, the best-laid plans can still have holes in them but what we've seen with basketball and soccer is these plans work in that they've identified positive cases and players have been isolated. That tells me the safety mechanisms are working and that's fantastic.""

But the mounting positive tests have prompted many to question sport's return before the discovery of a suitable vaccine.

""The key is ensuring if you're going to play pro sports, you're doing it in a safe and ethical manner,"" he said. ""Safety really means player safety, safety of the auxiliary personnel but also public safety as well.

""Ethical manner means you're not drawing resources away from the community in which you're playing. Can that occur while there's still an ongoing push to ensure safety across the country and develop a vaccine and develop programs? I personally think if it's carefully planned out, they can both be done very well.""

Bogoch, a Calgary native, is a recreational hockey player in his spare time. But he also watches at least two CFL games each year: The Labour Day Classic between the Calgary Stampeders and arch-rival Edmonton Eskimos; and Grey Cup.

""That (Labour Day game) is just ingrained in my DNA,"" he said with a chuckle. ""The Labour Day Classic is so quintessential Alberta, it's wonderful.

""There's something so Canadian about (the Grey Cup), it's 40 below in a blizzard and the guys are out on the field. It's just wild.""

While Bogoch appreciates sport isn't a priority for some, he said it can definitely provide a boost for others during a pandemic.

""When we step back and think about what's been happening the last six months and especially since our lockdown in March and throughout our gradual reopening, people have taken a tremendous hit,"" he said. ""We've taken financial hits . . . we've taken emotional and psychological hits by staying at home.

""While some people might say (sport) isn't an essential service and they're correct, I think we can also say professional and amateur sports and other forms of entertainment like the arts are extremely important to the psychological and emotional well-being of our society. This may help provide some intangible benefits as well.""

Mercifully, Bogoch sees light at the end of the COVID-19 pandemic tunnel.

""I think we'll gradually see this start to wind down as vaccines are developed and rolled out globally,"" he said. ""In the best-case scenario it could be as early as late 2020 . . . but more realistically needles will start going into arms in 2021.

""I think the key word there is globally because if there's an infection in one part of the world, there's a problem in all parts of the world. This thing is pretty contagious and people are mobile so we need this vaccine deployed on a global level.""

565,tricitynews,https://www.tricitynews.com/covid-19/high-unemployment-343b-deficit-projected-in-liberals-fiscal-snapshot-1.24166665,"High unemployment, $343B deficit projected in Liberals' fiscal snapshot",[],,"OTTAWA — The Trudeau Liberals say they expect nearly two million Canadians to remain without jobs this year as the COVID-19 pandemic drags down the domestic economy and federal aid sends the deficit to a historic $343.2 billion.

The economic and fiscal ""snapshot"" from the government today lays out the Liberals' belief that there will be a slow return to a new normal, with unemployment high and economic growth low through to at least the end of 2021.

article continues below

Even though the government believes the worst of the economic harm from the pandemic is behind the country, the document says a recovery can't begin in earnest until an effective vaccine or treatment becomes widely available.

Things could, however, get worse under two alternative scenarios the Finance Department lays out.

Should prolonged shutdowns stay in place, or restrictions not fully roll back, a return to normal activity for households and businesses will be uneven and slower than hoped for, leading to a more pronounced drop in economic output than is already expected.

And should the country be hit with a second wave of the novel coronavirus during the annual flu season, the ensuing lockdowns would cause what the Finance Department describes as a ""deeper and longer-lasting negative impact on the economy.""

The Liberals have repeatedly promised to use the federal treasury as a financial shield between Canadians and irreparable harm, and the cost of that promise is now at $231.9 billion in direct spending and a deficit comparable only to those seen in the Second World War.

Whatever the costs, they're worth it, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a news conference Wednesday morning, before the snapshot was released.

""As we measure the cost of helping Canadians, we shouldn't forget that the cost of doing nothing would have been far more,"" Trudeau said, insisting that this is not the time for belt-tightening or austerity.

The document tries to make that case, saying that the $80-billion Canada Emergency Response Benefit, which had paid out $53.5 billion in benefits as of late June, has covered Canadians' estimated $44.6 billion in lost labour income through the first half of the year.

The $2,000-a-month benefit is estimated to have covered the monthly housing, food, phone and internet costs for the bottom and middle thirds of households, according to Finance Department calculations.

Historically low interest rates mean all the hundreds of billions in borrowing comes with ""manageable"" costs, Trudeau said, and the alternative would be for individuals and households to load up with debt themselves to cope with months of no or little work.

Adding to the deficit is a $37.3 billion boost to the federal wage subsidy program to bring its budget to $82.3 billion, signalling an expansion and coming changes to the benefit that covers up to 75 per cent of wages to a maximum of $847 a week for eligible companies.

The Liberals expect more workers to move onto the wage subsidy and off the Canada Emergency Response Benefit as that $80-billion program winds down.

Those who fall through the COVID-19 financial safety net are expected to be caught by the employment insurance system that has been largely dormant since the CERB replaced it in late March.

Government officials admit there will still need to be policy changes to the EI system to help some self-employed workers qualify, and capture EI-eligible workers who, due to the pandemic, haven't been able to work the necessary qualifying hours.

For this calendar year, the government expects the unemployment rate to hit 9.8 per cent, dropping to 7.8 per cent next year based on forecasts by 13 private sector economists.

Although that's a bump from the record-high unemployment rate of 13.7 per cent in May for a labour force of just over 19 million, it is still almost double the record low of 5.5 per cent pre-pandemic.

The document doesn't contain the five-year forecast traditionally part of federal budgets owing to the uncertain path the pandemic will take and the state of the economy beyond that.

""Even when the pandemic is over, lasting consequences may cast a long-term shadow over economic developments, for example via more indebted businesses and households, persistent unemployment and substantial structural changes in the economy that have been accelerated through the crisis,"" the government's update says.

""In the coming months and as needed the government will announce measures to support the recovery.""

Opposition parties had wanted Morneau to provide a road map for reshaping emergency aid measures that are set to expire in the fall and keeping spending and deficits under control.

In his own morning news conference, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said the Liberals mishandled the COVID-19 pandemic by being slow to close borders and by instituting too-rigid emergency aid programs.

Canada can't afford for the Liberals to mishandle the economy as well, he said, by keeping benefits in place that remove incentives to go back to work while the novel coronavirus remains a risk.

""Liberals put all their faith in government, Conservatives put our faith in people,"" Scheer said.

He said the Liberals should take up a Conservative proposal to offer a ""back to work bonus"" and send more money to the federal auditor general so her office can study the government's spending more closely.

Next week, the Bank of Canada is to again update its forecasts when it releases a monetary policy report along with a scheduled interest-rate announcement.

Last month, the central bank said it expected a decline between 10 and 20 per cent in the second quarter compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. That is an improvement from the 15-to-30-per-cent drop in the quarter highlighted in the bank's worst-case scenario in April.

There were no new deaths and there remain 16 people in hospital, with four of those in intensive care units.

article continues below

That makes 2,990 people who have tested positive for the virus that has caused a global pandemic since COVID-19 first appeared in B.C. in late January.

Of those, 183 people have died, 2,645 people have recovered and 162 people are still battling the disease. Most infected patients are self-isolating at home.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,013 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,576 in Fraser Health;

• 133 in Island Health;

• 203 in Interior Health; and

• 65 in Northern Health.

""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks and the outbreak at Tabor Home has now been declared over,"" B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix and provincial health officer Bonnie Henry said in a joint statement on July 7.

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreaks at Tabor and at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred to those homes from the hospital.

""While there are no active community outbreaks in B.C., new cases and community exposure events continue to occur in the community,"" Dix and Henry said.

""There has been a new community exposure event at Hotel Belmont bar and nightclub in the Vancouver Coastal Health region. Public health teams have issued an alert for anyone who may have been at the premises on June 27 and June 29.""

B.C. is estimated to have a population of about 5,190,000 people so it has so far had about one case of COVID-19 for every 1,735 residents, or 0.576 people per 1,000 residents. That compares with Washington State's estimated population of 7,615,000 people and 36,970 cases, for about one case of COVID-19 for every 206 people, or 4.85 people per 1,000 residents.

B.C.'s death rate, however, at more than 6.1%, is slightly higher than other jurisdictions.

Washington State, with 1,384 deaths, has a 3.7% death rate for COVID-19 patients.

Johns Hopkins University's Centre for Systems Science and Engineering has recorded 11,712,663 COVID-19 cases and 540,582 deaths globally, for a death rate of slightly more than 4.6%.

The record high of 10,028 new cases in Texas served as another alarming new measure of the swift resurgence of COVID-19 nationwide and the failures of the country’s response. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas aggressively began one of America’s fastest reopenings in May but has begun reversing course in recent weeks, ordering bars closed and mandating face coverings.

article continues below

New York and Florida are the only other states to record more than 10,000 new cases in a single day. New York hit that grim total back in April, when New York City hospitals were overwhelmed and hundreds of people were dying every day. Florida topped 10,000 confirmed cases last week.

The record mark in Texas partly reflects a lag in testing results from the Fourth of July weekend, when newly reported cases were far below what Texas has seen in recent weeks. But Abbott said the numbers should still be ""an alarm bell for everybody"" who is skeptical about whether the virus is a threat.

""We have rapid spread of COVID-19 in the state of Texas right now,"" Abbott told San Antonio television station KENS.

Later in the interview, Abbott was noncommittal about whether he would attend his own party's convention next week in Houston, which the Texas GOP has remained bent on holding even as the mayor, doctors and businesses pressure the party to cancel. Houston has emerged as one of the nation's hot zones in the pandemic. However, Republican activists, some of whom have called the fears overblown, have resolved to press forward with the indoor three-day convention.

Texas surged past 8,000 statewide hospitalizations for the first time over the long holiday weekend — a more than quadruple increase on the past month. On Tuesday, the number of hospitalizations soared past 9,000. Texas also set a new high for deaths in a single day with 60.

Mayors in some of the biggest cities in the state and U.S. — including Austin, San Antonio and Houston — have warned that hospitals could soon become overwhelmed with coronavirus patients. Along the Texas-Mexico border, some cities imposed curfew orders in hopes of cutting down on large parties or social gatherings as cases have skyrocketed.

""Many of us are running at capacity and have created new wards,"" said Todd Mann, the chief executive officer at McAllen Medical Center, which on Tuesday had more than 130 coronavirus patients taking up more than half of the facility's beds. ""The physical space is obviously limited, and most of the hospitals are running out of that pretty quickly.""

The record count was reported on a day that also saw the State Fair of Texas cancelled for the the first time since World War II. Fair organizers said the event, which draws more than a million visitors to Dallas each fall, was not feasible during the pandemic.

It also came as President Donald Trump leaned on governors to reopen schools this fall, arguing that some are keeping schools closed not because of the risks from the coronavirus pandemic but for political reasons. Texas education officials announced Tuesday that face coverings will be mandatory for students older than 10 years old and that school districts must offer on-campus learning to any family that wants their child in a classroom.

Deaths remain lower in Texas compared to other big states. As of Tuesday, Texas has confirmed that at least 2,715 people have died due to COVID-19. But fatalities have climbed in recent days, and in addition to an alarming acceleration in new cases in Texas, the seven-day infection rate has climbed to 13.5%.

The number of infections is likely far higher because many people haven't been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected without feeling sick.

Two separate photos of the bare-faced party leader sitting comfortably in a waiting area circulated online but his office says he was wearing a mask for his trip.

A spokesperson said the photos must have been taken after he doffed the covering to take a call but before he put it back on.

Toronto's Pearson airport currently has a policy that masks must be worn at all times to curb the spread of COVID-19, with limited exceptions that include being at a food or beverage service location.

The photos shows Scheer in the lounge with several others, and while they are seated spaced apart, none is wearing a mask.

In April, Scheer was criticized for bringing his family on a government flight back to Ottawa for a House of Commons sitting, reducing the ability for the other two MPs on board to keep a distance from the Scheers.

He and other party leaders have been wearing masks around Parliament Hill. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also wears them during photo ops.

Scheer is the waning days of his leadership. The ballots to select his replacement go in the mail in the coming days and a new leader will be elected in late August.

Up to 90 centres across the country will gradually reopen in July, starting with 14 on Wednesday. Further openings are to be guided by public health advice as well as how many Canadians each centre serves.

article continues below

The government has spent the past few weeks upgrading the centres to put up clear barriers at counters, signs to encourage physical distancing and reduce seating in waiting areas.

Personal protective equipment will also be provided to staff at centres that reopen.

Face masks will be offered to people visiting centres in provinces or municipalities that have mandated their use in indoor public spaces.

Anyone going to a centre that doesn't fall under any such provincial or municipal requirement will be encouraged to wear a masks and use hand-sanitizer.

While the newly reopened centres will handle queries for social insurance numbers, employment insurance and the Canada Pension Plan among others, the government says passport and biometrics services won't be available at first.

Days after public health authorities closed businesses and ordered workers to stay home to slow the spread of COVID-19, the Liberals closed the sprawling network of Service Canada centres.

Some of the offices, such as one tucked inside Ottawa's city hall, had already started to close before the official announcement in March as confirmed cases of COVID-19 increased and workers were needed elsewhere, or resisted going in.

The government says an online Service Canada portal opened in response to the closures has seen more than 700,000 requests. That's about half the number of in-person visits Service Canada locations would see in the same period in normal times.

In a release, the government is still urging Canadians to use online services wherever possible, including to book appointments online for in-person help.

The network of 318 Service Canada centres, along with almost 250 more outreach centres, received about 8.4 million visits during the 12-month period between April 2018 and March 2019. The figure, noted in a recently posted evaluation of federal services, included over 1.9 million people walking in to use a self-service kiosk.

Central 1 says it expects home sales to recover marginally in 2020 and 2021 after tumbling by 55 per cent between mid-March and April.

article continues below

Deputy chief economist Brian Yu says despite values plunging to levels not seen since the early 1980s, home prices have stayed firm because fewer properties were available for sale.

He predicts median prices could rebound to about $710,000 before slipping to around $540,000 late this year or early in 2021.

Yu says unemployment, business and health concerns will further weaken the market, while population growth, which has traditionally propped up the sector in B.C., will slow to a trickle next year, dampening sales.

He says a second wave of COVID-19 has the potential to shave home prices by 15 per cent as more owners already hit by the pandemic's first wave are forced to sell during a second downturn.

The report released Tuesday notes positive developments as B.C. enters the third phase of its recovery plan including restarts in the accommodation, spa, film and television industries.

Vacancy rates could also climb as high as three per cent over the next year, writes Yu, ""providing an opportune time for renters to negotiate rental rates before the market tightens up again.""

Housing starts are forecast to slump 33 per cent in 2020 and remain flat in 2021, which ""set the stage for a housing supply shortage in coming years,"" the report says.

The timing of a second wave and its impact on the economy would draw out the effect on the housing market, potentially carrying into 2022, it says.

While there have been some welcome changes with Phase 3 of our provincial Restart Plan, it is important to remember that all of the other personal and business recommendations from Phase 2 remain in place. Phase 3 is not a return to normal and we should all continue to act as though COVID-19 is still here.

This means that businesses should be following Public Health and Worksafe BC guidelines to ensure the safety of employees and customers. This includes limiting the number of people on premises at any one time, ensuring adequate spacing, and the use of masks and barriers when physical spacing is not possible. Please respect our businesses who are doing their very best to ensure the safety of everyone who enters.

In our local health-care facilities, visitors are allowed, but are restricted to essential visits only. For the hospital, each patient may have one visitor at a time for a maximum of two hours per visitor. For our long-term care facilities, residents may have one designated person who is able to visit. Virtual visits are allowed at all facilities, and tablets are available for residents and patients who do not have access otherwise.

For individuals, our recommendations remain the same:

• Maintain physical distancing with people outside of your household (or your very limited family/friend bubble), and wear a mask whenever you can’t maintain a distance of at least two metres.

• Wash your hands frequently, especially after touching high contact surfaces.

Do not touch your face unless you have just washed your hands, and make sure you wash your hands after touching your face.

• Avoid large groups if you can, especially indoors. If you do meet up with others, please meet up outside whenever possible and maintain physical distancing.

• Exercise extra caution if you are older and have high blood pressure, obesity, diabetes, heart disease, lung disease or other significant health issues.

If you do develop new cold or flu symptoms (no matter how mild), please stay home and self-isolate until you have been assessed. Do not go to work. Do not go shopping. Do not meet up with others. Do call your family doctor or the Respiratory Assessment Clinic (Monday to Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.) to arrange for further assessment and testing, if indicated. The Respiratory Assessment Clinic can be reached by phone or text at 604-740-1252 or by email at coastrespclinic@gmail.com.

We continue to test everyone with possible COVID-19 symptoms, so please do not hesitate to call if you become ill. If you have more severe symptoms and believe you may need to be admitted to hospital, please go to the Sechelt Hospital Emergency Department. If you need an ambulance, please call 911.

In a forecast released today, the organization says the Canadian unemployment rate is projected to have peaked at 11 per cent in the quarter ended June 30, surpassing the previous peak of 8.7 per cent for the third quarter of 2009.

It says jobs should return as lockdowns end, but it still expects an unemployment rate of 7.7 per cent by the end of 2021 in a single-hit scenario and 8.4 per cent if there is a second wave of infections.

The report said the average unemployment rate among the OECD countries could rise as high as 12.6 per cent in the fourth quarter of this year in a double-hit scenario.

Under the single-hit scenario, the average unemployment rate would hit 11.4 per cent in the second quarter of this year before declining to 9.4 per cent in the fourth quarter.

That's up from 5.3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2019 before the pandemic froze the global economy.

But just three weeks before Green and her family were set to fly from Edmonton to Sydney, N.S., on July 17, WestJet announced it was ending its policy of leaving the middle seats on its flights empty.

article continues below

""I was devastated,"" Green said, noting her family spends every summer in Nova Scotia with her 93-year-old grandmother who is suffering from severe dementia and another family member with an incurable form of cancer.

""We all knew it could very well be the last summer we would spend with them.""

When Green called WestJet to see if any accommodations could be made, she told the company she has a heart condition that puts her in the high-risk category for COVID-19.

Despite her pleas, Green said the airline told her it was unable to make any special accommodations, nor would it allow her to change the date of the flight to before July 1, when the rules were relaxed, without paying a fee.

And Green's not alone: as provinces begin to relax domestic travel restrictions, the cessation of physical distancing rules by two of Canada's biggest airlines — WestJet and Air Canada — is causing frustration and grief among some passengers.

Gabor Lukacs, head of the advocacy group Air Passenger Rights Canada, said he has fielded countless complaints from passengers during the COVID-19 pandemic, many of which are related to the same issues: airlines refusing to offer refunds or accommodations amid the abolition of physical distancing rules.

While he acknowledges the effort to fill seats is due to airlines attempting to recoup billions in lost revenue, Lukacs argues the companies risk deterring customers from flying at all.

""The question is: do we allow economic considerations to override public health? We don't allow supermarkets to sell spoiled meat because it's cheaper. Are we going to allow doctors to skip disinfecting their tools to save the cost?""

There's some evidence he's right: a new poll conducted by Leger and the Association of Canadian Studies found 72 per cent of respondents say they are not comfortable flying now that Air Canada and WestJet have culled their seat distancing policies.

Only 22 per cent said they would be OK with flying under the newly relaxed rules.

In response to criticisms, WestJet forwarded The Canadian Press a statement from a July 3 blog post regarding changes to its seat distancing policy.

""The blocked middle seat was introduced at the beginning of the pandemic before the myriad of safety measures were put in place and mandated on board,"" the statement reads.

""Seat distancing was never intended to be in place permanently or throughout the pandemic.""

The post notes a number of measures WestJet has taken to help stop the spread of COVID-19 on its flights, including mandatory masking, pre-boarding questionnaires for all passengers, temperature screening, thorough cleaning of aircraft between flights, and the restriction of in-flight dining services.

However, the company has also denied it's putting passengers and staff at risk by filling flights up, pointing to other safety measures as mitigating the risk of spreading COVID-19.

Air Canada provided a similar statement, acknowledging the inconvenience the change may have caused to customers.

""While we would all like a single measure that reduces risk, we are left to use a combination of approaches to mitigate risk as far as practical,"" the airline said.

Yet some passengers report first-hand experiences in which masking protocols were not followed.

Maureen Isabel Green, 31, flew from Vancouver to Fredericton three weeks ago with Air Canada to visit her family, and said she was shocked by the lax use of masks by both airport employees and the passengers on her two connecting flights.

""I just think of all the people who are getting on a flight and risking their life, or risking the life of the people they're going to visit, because some people don't want to wear a mask for a few hours,"" she said.

Green, who is a health-care worker, said there were numerous instances on her flight from Vancouver to Montreal where a group of young, male passengers took off their masks when flight attendants were not present.

While at the Montreal airport, Green said a man was able to board a flight without wearing a mask, simply by telling attendants he had a medical condition that prevented him from doing so.

Air travel has been at the centre of several headline-grabbing incidents throughout the pandemic — particularly since travel restrictions have been eased in some regions.

On July 2, health authorities in B.C. warned the passengers of four separate flights that they may have been exposed to COVID-19.

Just a day before — on the exact day the airlines ended their social distancing policies — the Nova Scotia Health Authority warned passengers of a Toronto-to-Halifax WestJet flight from the previous week that they may have been exposed to COVID-19.

And on Sunday, a Halifax man reportedly walked off of a St. John's-bound flight after learning he was the only passenger travelling within the so-called ""Atlantic bubble,"" sparking discussion about the effectiveness of airlines' COVID-prevention policies.

The YMCA Canada, the Boys and Girls Clubs of Canada and the Royal Canadian Legion are among those that say they are facing severe financial difficulties and been forced to permanently close some locations even as demand for their services has increased.

article continues below

A YMCA facility permanently closed its doors in Yarmouth, N.S., because of the pandemic while the Boys and Girls Clubs shuttered its operations in Edson, Alta. The legion has seen three halls close for good in Ontario and one in New Brunswick.

While the fear is those are just the beginning, the government is also being warned that failing to help now could cost more in the long run as organizations that provide child care, emergency food support and other social services disappear.

""The problem is the bill will come due later,"" said Boys and Girls Clubs of Canada president Owen Charters. ""Because as these organizations disappear, the social safety net becomes a tax burden where the government needs to step in and provide those services directly.""

The sector began to bang the drums with alarm at the end of March as Canadians started to realize the pandemic would last longer than a couple of weeks and donations and other sources of income such as the provision of child care started to dry up.

Dozens of charities signed a letter on March 25 asking Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his government for financial aid to prevent ""irreparable damage,"" particularly at a time when more people needed their services.

Ottawa has since included the sector in some of its COVID-19 supports such as wage-subsidy and rent-deferral programs. It also created a $350-million fund for organizations to provide emergency assistance to Canadians during the pandemic.

While welcome, those interviewed say the already-announced federal programs and funding fall far short.

""What we need is direct supports to make sure Ys can survive the crisis,"" YMCA Canada president Peter Dinsdale said. ""There is a real need for sector stabilization. It's not just YMCAs in this country. It is Boys and Girls Clubs, the United Way. So many entities out there require support.""

The government has been told as much numerous times, with letters written and phone calls made. Yet those interviewed say there has yet to be a real response. That silence has sparked concern and frustration.

""We sent off two letters,"" said Royal Canadian Legion dominion president Tom Irvine. ""There was no acknowledgment of receiving the letters or nothing. So I'm pretty discouraged at this time, but still hopeful. This is a Canadian institution and if we don't do something, we could lose it.""

Social Development Minister Ahmed Hussen's spokeswoman Jessica Eritou on Tuesday praised the work of the charitable and non-profit sector and touted the $350-million emergency fund, which organizations say does not address the core of their concerns.

""We are continuing to look at ways to work with charities and non-profits supporting Canadians during the crisis,"" she added.

""We continue discussions with organizations to help support the important work they're doing in communities across the country and we will keep looking for the most effective ways to help Canadians during this unprecedented crisis.""

Cardus, a charity that does research on the non-profit sector, released a paper on Tuesday urging the federal government to start matching donations from Canadians to different organizations using money set aside to cover the costs of a tax credit for Canadians who donate.

But Dinsdale and Charters said matching programs will still leave many organizations struggling, and that the only real solution is direct federal support to help the sector weather the pandemic and continue providing essential services.

A lack of safe places for children to be while their parents work is an obstacle to economic recovery, economists have warned, particularly for women.

""While the federal government's been focused on macro-economic approaches like the wage subsidy, like CERB and other initiatives, they have ignored this sector,"" said Dinsdale, whose organization runs child-care centres across the country.

""And they've ignored this sector at the risk of not having the most critical social services available to Canadians as the economy reopens.""

The figure is the upper range of the scenarios the budget watchdog was asked to research as part of a report released Tuesday morning as policy-makers consider how to shape emergency supports set to expire in the fall.

article continues below

Planned federal spending to date on pandemic-related aid now tops about $174 billion, in a range of programs meant to provide a financial floor for individuals and businesses.

The idea of giving a government-guaranteed basic income to Canadians has gained steam as millions have watched their jobs or earnings evaporate in the COVID-19 pandemic.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau and other senior cabinet ministers have repeatedly been asked by senators and MPs about the concept. Advocates argue that it would be an expansion of the $80-billion Canada Emergency Response Benefit for workers who saw their incomes crash.

The CERB and a $45-billion wage-subsidy program are set to expire in October.

Providing six months of a basic income starting that month could cost between $47.5 billion and $98.1 billion, depending on how much of the benefit is clawed back from people whose other incomes increase.

Budget officer Yves Giroux's report says the average benefit to Canadians aged 18 to 64 would range between $4,500 and $4,800, with the number of recipients depending on the phase-out rate.

Sen. Yuen Pau Woo, who asked for the costing, said a basic-income program could fill in the gaps in Canada's social safety nets, a patchwork largely run by provinces, that have been exposed by the pandemic.

""It's a huge undertaking to launch a basic income for the whole country on a permanent basis. The costs are extremely high and the political resistance is likely to be fierce, but we are in a period where it is likely we will have to spend large sums of money on income support going into the balance of 2020 and into 2021,"" Woo said in a telephone interview.

""The question to my mind is how we spend it, and in what form.""

A basic income means different things to different people, but it is usually viewed as a no-strings-attached benefit that governments provide to citizens instead of various targeted social benefits.

Also known as a guaranteed minimum income, it can be delivered as a universal payment, or as a means-tested benefit that declines as a recipient's other income rises.

Giroux's report says the government could repeal $15 billion in tax measures to offset the overall cost of a basic-income program, which Woo added would likely have to wrap in existing measures to avoid duplication.

The overall cost of the program might be higher than the budget office estimates. The PBO's estimates rely on some Statistics Canada income data that doesn't include people living in the northern territories or in First Nations, or some military members.

Nor can the figures simply be doubled to determine a full year's cost because that might overstate the financial impact. The economy appears to be bouncing back slowly from a bottoming-out in April, and the cost of the program would depend on how many employees are rehired or find new jobs.

The Canadian Federation of Independent Business, which represents small businesses nationwide, said Tuesday that about one-third of members responding to a survey reported being back at full staffing levels, but suggested many believe it will take six months to get back to normal profitability.

Statistics Canada is to release June's jobs report on Friday.

Projections released Tuesday by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimate Canada's unemployment rate at 11 per cent for the second quarter of the year.

The 37-member international body predicted the national unemployment rate would decline to 7.7 per cent by the end of the year, or to 8.4 per cent should a second wave of the novel coronavirus force renewed lockdowns.

NDP finance critic Peter Julian said Tuesday that the uncertain economic path ahead requires the Liberals to say how the government plans to reshape emergency aid in Wednesday's fiscal update.

He said a more universal benefit, which the NDP has pushed, would have helped more people and cost less had the Liberals used it from the start.

""It makes more sense to make sure that everybody who needs the benefit can actually get it than the government's approach,"" Julian said.

The Liberals have said the update on Wednesday will provide an economic outlook, an accounting of spending to date and projections for the remainder of the fiscal year, including the expected deficit. The PBO and others estimate that to be at least $250 billion.

Seventy-two per cent of Canadians surveyed by Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies say they're not comfortable flying since a decision by some airlines to relax their own in-flight physical distancing requirements.

article continues below

As of July 1, Air Canada and WestJet both ended policies blocking the sale of adjacent seats.

The measure was seen to align with a guidance document for the aviation industry issued by Transport Canada in April to help curb the spread of COVID-19.

Among other things, the department had suggested passengers should be widely spaced when possible, though they did not make it mandatory.

Airlines, however, are required to make passengers and air crews wear masks.

Only 22 per cent of those surveyed said they're comfortable getting aboard with no in-flight physical distancing and a requirement to wear masks.

There's more to it to keep flights safe, WestJet said in a statement last week after critics attacked its plan.

""What makes an airplane, and the entire journey, safe is the layers of enhanced cleaning, the wearing of masks and the hospital-grade HEPA filters that remove 99.999 per cent of all airborne particles,"" the airline said.

""The hygiene standards we have now are world-class and backed by industry experts.""

Critics have also previously pounced on the airlines for another move: refusing to fully refund tickets for flights cancelled due to the pandemic.

Thousands of people have beseeched Transport Minister Marc Garneau to compel airlines to issue refunds, but he has refused, arguing that mandating reimbursements from a sector that's lost more than 90 per cent of its revenue would cripple the industry.

But 72 per cent of those polled say they totally oppose his decision.

In lieu of refunds, the airlines have offered vouchers but the poll suggests that it may take a while before people will rebook previously cancelled trips: 85 per cent of those surveyed told pollsters they have no plans to travel outside the country by the end of the year.

The survey polled 1,517 people and can't be assigned a margin of error because online polls are not considered truly random.

Pollsters were in the field between July 3 and 5, a historically popular few days for Canadians and Americans to be on the move between the two countries, given the July 1 Canada Day holiday and the U.S.'s July 4 Independence Day.

But the border remains closed to non-essential traffic, and the majority of Canadians surveyed said they feel it needs to stay that way. The current mutual closure agreement is due to expire July 21.

Of Canadians polled, 86 per cent said they totally disagreed with re-opening the border at the end of July, allowing Americans back into the country.

Americans seem more eager both to head north and to welcome Canadians south; 50 per cent agreed the border should re-open and 36 per cent disagreed.

The potential for cross-border transmission of the virus has been a key factor in the decision to keep the border closed. Currently, rates of COVID-19 infection in the U.S. continue to climb, while in Canada the curve appears to be on a downward trajectory nearly everywhere.

Still, the survey suggests Canadians don't feel they are out of the woods. Thirty-nine per cent believe the worst is yet to come, while 35 per cent believe the worst of the crisis has passed.

In the U.S., 42 per cent of those surveyed felt the darkest days are ahead, 25 per cent believe the U.S. is in the middle of the worst part now while 21 per cent think that's already passed.

The spike in deaths includes one death in June but which only recently was confirmed to be a result of the COVID-19 virus, Henry said.

""To lose six people, all in long-term care, over the last three days is a source of enormous grief,"" said BC Health Minister Adrian Dix.

There have been no new outbreaks in B.C. since Friday. There were 31 new confirmed cases since Friday, bringing the total number of cases to 2,978. Of that number, 2,629 people have recovered, leaving 166 active cases in B.C.

There are currently three long-term care facilities in B.C. with active cases of COVID-19, and one acute care facility.

Responding to a spike in cases in Seattle, and the question of whether public demonstrations may have contributed to the uptick, Henry was asked whether any cases in B.C. have been traced to large anti-racism public protests that took place in Vancouver in June. She said it appears those large gatherings did not result in any spread of the virus.

""Currently, we do not have any cases that have been associated with the protests that took place,"" Henry said. ""In talking with my colleagues in the U.S., they also have not seen surges related to those activities.""

The fact the protests were held outside may be one of the factors that limited the potential spread of the virus.

Henry, health authorities and long term care operators have been working together to relax the restrictions on visitations in long term care homes. Given the recent spike in deaths, Henry was asked if that did not raise concerns about reintroducing the virus into care homes.

She conceded that, once the virus is in a care home, the potential for it to kill elderly people is high.

""The good news is that we have reduced the amount of transmission in our community so much so that we have very people in hospital,"" she said. ""We have very few people who are transmitting in our community, and that's why we feel we're at that balance where we need to allow more people to go into long-term care.""

The league and its union announced Monday the two sides have hammered out a tentative deal on the return-to-play protocol as well as a memorandum of understanding on a four-year extension of the current collective bargaining agreement.

article continues below

The NHL board of governors, the NHLPA's executive board and full membership must now ratify the documents, which are tied together, in three separate votes. If the proposals get the green light, training camps would begin July 13, with the 24 teams set to resume heading to the two Canadian hub cities on July 26. Competitive game action would then commence Aug. 1.

The league has yet to announce the two hubs for its return-to-play plan this summer, but Toronto and Edmonton are the destinations, a person with direct knowledge of the decision told The Associated Press.

The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because the league and the NHLPA have not released this information. The person said the league is in part being cautious and allowing itself flexibility in the event of potential spikes in COVID-19 infections in not yet determining which cities will host the conference finals and Stanley Cup final.

Hashed out in the shadow of unprecedented economic conditions brought on by COVID-19 — and viewed as crucial for a resumption of play — the proposed CBA would bring at least 14 consecutive years of NHL-NHLPA harmony after lockouts wiped out the 2004-05 season, and cut the 1994-95 and 2012-13 campaigns to 48 games.

While details of the CBA, which would last through the 2025-26 season, weren't made public Monday, it's believed the salary cap, escrow payments from players to owners, and Olympic participation all figure prominently. Escrow, which guarantees a 50-50 split of hockey-related revenues, was a thorny issue for players before the pandemic significantly impacted the league's bottom line when the schedule was suspended March 12.

Getting back to the Olympics has also been a priority for players. The NHL, which would still have to negotiate with the International Olympic Committee, skipped the 2018 Winter Games after participating in five straight between 1998 and 2014.

The league and players unveiled the 24-team format for a resumption of play in late May.

The plan to resuscitate the season calls for players to be segregated from the general population in tightly-controlled ""bubbles"" — games will be played without fans — in hopes of keeping the coronavirus at bay. The NHL, which will test everyone inside the bubble daily, has consistently maintained one or more positive results wouldn't necessarily derail the restart.

The NHL and the NHLPA outlined extensive health and safety measures for training camps and resumption of play Monday — referred to as Phase 3 and Phase 4, respectively, of its return-to-play plan — in two documents totalling 47 pages.

Teams will be allowed to bring 52 personnel, with no more than 31 players, to its hub. Every person in the bubble will be subject to daily testing, including players, staff, hotel workers, food service employees and bus drivers. Every team member/player inside the bubble will be expected to remain there except in specific extenuating circumstances, including medical attention, the birth of a child or a death in the family.

Anyone returning to the bubble will be subject to a minimum four-day quarantine with daily nasal swab tests for COVID-19.

While the league is encouraging physical distancing at all times, players won't be required to wear masks when exercising or on the ice. The same goes for coaches behind the bench and off-ice officials. Masks are required to be worn inside the bubble by any individual not in their hotel room.

The NHL and NHLPA have the ability to delay, postpone, move or cancel games in the event there's a ""risk to player health and safety"" and/or a chance that ""the integrity of the competition"" is in jeopardy, including ""an uncontrolled outbreak of COVID-19.""

There is not, however, any specifics as to what would constitute ""an uncontrolled outbreak.""

Individuals leaving the bubble without permission may be subject to consequences up to and including removal from Phase 4. Teams could also be hit with steep punishments, including fines and/or loss of draft choices.

Players are allowed to opt out of Phase 3 and Phase 4 without penalty, but have to notify their team this week.

Vancouver, Las Vegas, Chicago, Columbus, Dallas, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh and Minneapolis/St. Paul were the other cities originally in the running to be hubs.

The NHL is looking to restart its season with a blueprint that includes eight best-of-five qualifying round series before pivoting to the typical 16-team playoffs. It's hoped the Stanley Cup, which has been awarded all but twice since 1893, will be handed out sometime in the fall.

Las Vegas was viewed as a hub front-runner because its massive hotel complexes could be more-easily secured in a bubble scenario until a recent surge in COVID-19 cases across large swaths of the United States — the death toll there currently stands at more than 130,000 people — likely made the destination far less appealing.

But despite Monday's good news, there remain difficult waters to navigate.

The league and NHLPA will not quarantine players during training camp, but instead ask they stay home when not at the rink in hopes isolation and testing will be enough to avoid any outbreaks.

Of the 396 NHLers tested at team facilities between June 8 and July 6 during voluntary workouts as part of Phase 2 protocols, 23 results — in the neighbourhood of six per cent — came back positive. The league said it's also aware of 12 other positive tests for players not taking part in Phase 2.

The Tampa Bay Lightning closed their practice facility last month after three players and additional staff members tested positive for COVID-19. Of the 24 teams poised to resume play, 18 are located in the U.S., including current virus hot spots like Florida, Texas and Arizona.

Four clubs previously confirmed 10 positive tests in the spring, with five coming from the Ottawa Senators, three from the Colorado Avalanche, and one each from the Pittsburgh Penguins and Boston Bruins.

Now with some destinations looking to slowly reopen, and, in an effort to catch a glimpse of future travel trends, I’m continuing to reach out to travel experts and tourism bureaus across Canada and the globe for answers to five similar questions.

And while no one can predict the future, all are hopeful travel will soon resume. But, how exactly that will look is anyone’s guess.

Five questions with Lessner Gomez, director, Cuba Tourist Board, Toronto office.

How did COVID-19 impact tourism in Cuba?

Like other tourist destinations around the world, Cuba closed to international travel because of the Corona Virus. Cuba is now ready to slowly open to visitors.

In order to control and isolate any possible infection, Cuba has reopened its doors in Cayo Largo, Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo, Cayo Santa María and Cayo Cruz effective July 1.

Cuba is beginning to reopen to tourism. Who are the first international visitors Cuba will be expecting?

Cuba is looking forward to welcoming travellers from Canada and Europe. We have enjoyed a special relationship with Canada for over forty years.

We look forward to welcoming Canada back to our beautiful beaches.

How important are Canadians to tourism in Cuba?

Historically Canada has always been the biggest international inbound market for Cuba.

What does the future hold for Cuba and are there any trends we can look forward to?

As with the rest of the world, the future is hard to predict, but we are very positive.

Cuba enjoys a world class health system with particular expertise in the treatment of diseases of the lungs. In fact, throughout this pandemic we have offered medical support to countries around the world.

We believe we can offer tourists from Canada the confidence to return to our wonderful destinations and we look forward to welcoming them.

We believe that by opening gradually, tourist will feel comfortable with our planning and slowly we can begin to open other parts of our country.

What enhanced safety measures have been put in place to ensure visitors to resorts, hotels and attractions will be safe?

Over the past few months, the Cuban government has focused its efforts on the battle against the pandemic.

During this time, government officials took steps to improve all hotels and tourism infrastructure. Hygiene and sanitary protocols were put in place in order to ensure the safety of the Cuban people and its international visitors, as tourism activities are reactivated.

Hygiene and sanitary protocols will be practiced from the first phase, for example:

In order to operate, tourist facilities must obtain government certification called: Most hygienic and safest tourism (T + HS).

Workers with respiratory symptoms will not be allowed on resort premises and anyone with symptoms will be immediately directed to a health center.

International tourist circulation will only take place at the cayos (islands) where tourists enjoy their holidays.

Excursions will be offered only at the cayos for the international market.

The nautical activities and operations at international marinas of tourist centers approved for international tourism are reactivated.

As approved by the Cuban Ministry of Public Health, in the second phase, foreign tourists will undergo the PCR test free of charge upon their arrival in the country.

The ferry company announced July 3 that starting on July 10 two round trips would be added to the schedule on Fridays and Sundays – a 4:20 and 6:40 p.m. departure from Langdale and a 3:15 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. departure from Horseshoe Bay.

article continues below

BC Ferries is also adding more trips on other busy routes, including Horseshoe Bay-Nanaimo.

The addition of more sailings comes as local governments are calling for a return to a full summer schedule and travellers continue to voice frustration online.

In a lengthy post on her Facebook page July 3, Sechelt Mayor Darnleda Siegers asked residents upset with the current level of service, short-notice schedule changes, and problems rebooking reservations to “cut [BC Ferries] some slack.”

“Behind the glitches and the mistakes are humans just like you and I and they are trying as best they can,” she wrote.

But Siegers is also urging Coasters to lobby the province and the federal government for more financial support for BC Ferries.

“BC Ferries needs financial assistance from the provincial and federal government as they are using their capital funds, previously earmarked for the Langdale ferry upgrade and our second ship and other capital expenditures, to cover off their operating costs,” said Siegers.

Siegers also called the $180,000 the provincial government has already committed to keep sailings from being cut on minor routes, including Earls Cove-Saltery Bay, “a drop in the bucket.”

“There is some money earmarked for B.C. from the federal government that will be provided within the next while,” she said. “I’d like to see some of it go to BC Ferries.”

The money Siegers is referring to is part of a $14-billion “safe restart agreement” between Ottawa and the provinces.

West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast-Sea to Sky Country MP Patrick Weiler has also suggested that agreement could be the source of funding to backstop BC Ferries against the financial losses caused by the sudden drop in ridership in the early phase of the pandemic.

“I believe that one of the areas that they want to make sure that funding is going to go towards is transit, which has been very much hit hard by the pandemic similar to BC Ferries, which could also be an option for that funding,” Weiler said during a June 23 update for the Sechelt and District Chamber of Commerce.

In response to Coast Reporter’s inquiry to the premier’s office about the status of the discussions on the safe restart agreement and whether some of the money would be used to support a return to normal service levels on BC Ferries, officials with the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure replied that the government is “pleased to see the federal government agreeing to provide much-needed support for a variety of important provincial issues.”

“However, the number and size of programs that have been included in this list is substantial,” the email from the ministry continued. “So we look forward to seeing the details to make sure it can adequately support our recovery efforts.”

On the specific issue of BC Ferries the ministry said, “We know ferries are vital for maintaining the critical supply chain for food, goods and medicine, and for people who live and work on our coast, and continue to work with the federal government on solutions.”",[]

“We’re looking forward to it,” said library director Heather Evans-Cullen an hour before Monday’s official 10 a.m. opening. “If I could have a ribbon cutting or slab cake, I would.”

article continues below

At least five people had already arrived before opening hours, she said. Hours of operation are now Monday to Saturday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.

Doors may finally be open again but operations are far from normal. For the first two weeks, a maximum of 20 patrons will be allowed inside at any given time, “to make sure we can maintain distancing,” said Evans-Cullen.

The layout has been modified and Plexiglas installed to maintain physical barriers, returned books are quarantined for 72 hours and staff wear face shields.

The library has been closed to the public since March, when public health restrictions due to COVID-19 took effect. In late May it began offering curbside pickup and drop-off services on site, but patrons weren’t able to enter the building.

The curbside “takeout” book service is still being offered and access to digital media “contactless services” such as audiobooks, ebooks and databases, remains available.

About 65 per cent of the Town of Gibsons residents are patrons of the library, far higher than the provincial average, said Evans-Cullen. “I think it’s a special relationship this community has with this library.” With the opening, “they’re coming back home a little bit.”

And with the opening, two other important services will now be available to the public: computers and washroom facilities. “Our washrooms will be open. That’s been a huge limitation for people who may be homeless or not have sustainable housing,” said Evans-Cullen, adding that washroom access was something B.C. provincial health officer Bonnie Henry had asked libraries to provide, if possible.

Takeout delivery remains in place at the Sechelt Public Library. Interim library director Leianne Emery anticipates opening the doors to the public to browse shelves by the start of August, but an exact date will depend on a potential building envelope project, “which will affect the library interior,” she said in an email.

In the meantime, three major interior construction projects are underway and protective glass is being installed. Those projects should be completed by July 20, at which point the library will begin adding limited public computer access and in-person tech help to the other services it is already providing, including offering materials for “takeout,” providing online and phone tech help, exam invigilation, photocopying and faxing services and reciprocal borrowing between Sechelt and Gibsons libraries.

The Sechelt library is aiming to have outdoor “under the tent programming” up and running for small groups within the next couple of weeks. And children can pick up their reading logs at either the Gibsons or Sechelt library for the Summer Reading Club.

The Roberts Creek Community Library has been open to the public since June 19 but with modified hours.

In July, the library is open Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., Sundays from noon to 2 p.m., Tuesdays from 2 p.m. to 8 p.m. and Wednesdays from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. Safety conditions apply and instructions are available at the library’s entrance. Only one patron and child are allowed inside the building at a time.

A return to in-person services kicked off quietly at the Pender Harbour Reading Centre on July 2, according to board chair Karen Dyck. It is now open Tuesdays through Saturdays from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. and will be fully staffed with volunteers until the end of August. As with the Roberts Creek library, only one person is allowed inside at a time with some exceptions for children. Masks are required for borrowers and volunteers. And because people have been dropping off materials throughout the COVID-19 epidemic, “we have lots of books on the shelf,” said Dyck.

Over the course of the pandemic, no orders have been issued by the provincial health officer requiring libraries to close.

A May 7 letter from Vancouver Coastal Health’s (VCH) deputy chief medical health officer Mark Lysyshyn stated that VCH “believes that the risk of COVID-19 transmission in these environments can be mitigated and consistent with B.C.’s Restart Plan, that it is possible to safely operate these facilities at this time.”

Representatives from Teamsters Canada, the United Food and Commercial Workers Union Canada and Unifor point to the dozens of retail and warehouse workers who remain sickened with COVID-19 and a report Monday from CTV News in Windsor, Ont. that two workers had just tested positive in the border city.

article continues below

Some of those previously sickened have returned to work. A few workers have died from the novel coronavirus disease.

Speaking to a House of Commons committee Monday, the union leaders recommended stricter labour standards and oversight for the sector, beyond getting to the bottom of why the pay premium was abruptly rolled back by some of the largest grocery chains.

Unifor national president Jerry Dias said the fact two more workers now have COVID-19 ""is probably proof positive"" that the pandemic premium for hourly workers shouldn't have disappeared.

When the pandemic struck Canada in March, major grocery chains said they would boost front-line workers' wages on average about $2 per hour.

But late last month, one after another, the chains announced they were ending the pandemic pay bump because the pace of business had eased, giving the unions short notice about the decision.

MPs on the industry committee agreed to look into the matter and will have a chance to question retail executives at the end of the week.

""Look, the argument is nonsense and every one of us on this panel understands that and I will argue they understand that as well,"" Dias said, referring to grocery-chain executives.

""So this had nothing to do with somehow the pandemic, 'Oh we're seeing a pot at the end of the rainbow,' this was a decision made about money.""

Paul Meinema, national president of the food workers' union, said the federal government should play a more active role in boosting wages for workers in the sector.

Grocery stores were among the businesses governments deemed essential services that didn't have to close as public health restrictions forced companies to cut operations to slow the spread of COVID-19.

The pandemic pay was supposed to recognize that workers were being asked to come in to help feed a population ordered to stay home. Conservative MP Michelle Rempel Garner said she wanted to determine how to properly compensate workers who are being put in that situation.

Spending on things like gasoline and travel fell but spending on groceries has gone up — one of the few areas of the economy where things appeared positive during the lockdowns of April and May.

NDP MP Brian Masse, who represents a riding in Windsor, Ont., said the industry needs more oversight, calling the committee probe ""the first dive at this.""

The byelection is expected to fill the seat of Nick Volkow, an eight-term councillor who recently died of brain cancer. According to provincial laws, a byelection is required to fill a vacancy that opens up prior to an election year.

article continues below

To kick off the byelection, the city is supposed to appoint a chief election officer, but city staff is recommending that be put off for now, citing concerns around COVID-19. For instance, strict rules on large congregations of people could put a chill on voter turnout, while lifting those rules would create a potential hazard for voters.

According to a staff report to council, the Ministry of Municipal Affairs has deferred byelections in Victoria, Rossland and Lytton, as well as a referendum in Kamloops, to protect residents from COVID-19.

The staff report noted city clerk Kate O’Connell reached out to the ministry to ask about guidelines for votes held during the pandemic. In response, the ministry indicated it was in the process of developing those guidelines and recommended the byelection be deferred.

Staff passed that recommendation on to council ahead of Monday evening’s regular meeting, saying it is “not practicable” to hold a byelection without the guidelines.

The election guidelines are being developed by Elections BC, the Ministry of Municipal Affairs, the Local Government Management Association and the Union of B.C. Municipalities, according to the staff report, and development is still in early stages. Staff noted there is still no clear timeline for when those guidelines are expected to be completed.

Once the guideline is completed, staff will devise a safety plan for the byelection and bring a report to council.",[]

Options to do so are now on the table as members of Parliament and hundreds of behind-the-scenes staff begin to plan for what their headquarters could look like come fall, to the extent they can.

article continues below

""Is it better to meet in person or virtually come September?"" House of Commons Speaker Anthony Rota said to the procedure and house affairs committee Monday.

""COVID has been changing so drastically along the way it's very difficult to predict what will happen in a month and a half or two months from now.""

But in the meantime, a mobile app could be deployed to allow MPs to vote whether they're on Parliament Hill or off, Rota said.

The app is fully bilingual, meets accessibility standards, and is secure, including providing administrators the ability to know where MPs are when they vote and authenticate their identities.

""The proposed approach for an electronic voting system respects several key principles,"" Rota said.

Finding a way for MPs to vote while limiting the risk of COVID-19 transmission has been a sticking point for the Liberal government as it has faced pressure from the Opposition Conservatives to allow for the full resumption of Parliament.

MPs have grappled with how they can do their jobs ever since Parliament, like much of the rest of the country, shut down in mid-March to slow the spread of COVID-19.

Several compromises have been reached along the way, including a hybrid model that allows MPs to participate in person or virtually in debates or committee meetings.

Those debates and meetings have been limited in scope and the Opposition Conservatives have pressed for a full return to business that would expand the powers MPs have available to press the government and get more information.

Right now, Parliament is expected to resume sitting full-time on Sept. 21, though there is a single sitting day scheduled for this week.

Summer sitting days were among the concessions opposition parties won as they've fought for greater accountability.

The virtual voting plan is best to be rolled out come fall, Rota said, citing the time needed to get the right system in place.

In addition to an app, he's presented MPs with the option of a video-conferencing approach that would piggyback on the hybrid arrangement in place now.

Rota's report, however, raised several concerns with that, including unstable internet connections, the amount of time it would take, and the sensitive issue of MPs not being present to vote.

A video-conferencing approach would need to name each MP in turn to double-check an MP isn't on mute or having trouble with the connection.

""The absence of members would be highlighted to the public, to the media and to other members of the House, contrary to current practice,"" the report said.

Conservative MPs have come under scrutiny in recent weeks for their absence from the current special COVID-19 committee of MPs that replaced the normal House of Commons sitting.

Unlike in regular sittings, for the committee it is possible to see exactly who attended, and tallies have suggested many Tories haven't shown up regularly.

When it comes to virtual voting, the Conservatives have largely opposed the approach, citing a resistance to anything that keeps MPs off the Hill.

They argue it is possible to adjust regular procedures to allow for physical distancing, and had asked for a look at how voting could take place in person.

Pandemic-safe options could include lining up outside the Commons chamber to vote, voting in shifts or voting by proxy, Rota's analysis suggested.

Among the issues in-person voting raises is the question of time and resources needed to keep the chamber clean as well as how long the votes themselves would take.

The MPs are aiming to have their recommendations in place later this month.

The league says 23 of 396 players checked for COVID-19 at team facilities have tested positive since voluntary Phase 2 workouts began June 8 — a rate of just under six per cent. In that same time period, the NHL added it is aware of 12 additional positive test results.

article continues below

That's an increase of eight players in Phase 2, and one from outside the NHL's testing system, over the last week.

The NHL says it has administered more than 2,900 tests at team facilities.

Ten additional players were confirmed to have tested positive in the spring — five from the Ottawa Senators, three from the Colorado Avalanche and one each from the Pittsburgh Penguins and Boston Bruins. That brings the total number of NHLers with confirmed positive tests to 45 since the schedule was suspended in mid-March.

The league is no longer providing details on the players or clubs with positive tests. There was no word on the health status of the 35 players in question, including whether or not they experienced symptoms or have recovered.

""All players who have tested positive have been self-isolated and are following (government) protocols,"" the NHL said in a statement released on Twitter.

The league and NHL Players' Association on Sunday night agreed on protocols to start training camps and resume the season. That includes daily testing once games get under way for players, coaches and staff.

Resuming is contingent on each side approving an extension of the collective bargaining agreement and the return-to-play protocol.

The central bank's business outlook survey suggested about half of firms foresee a rebound in their sales within the next year as COVID-19's effects recede, but the expectations of a return to pre-pandemic levels often depend on lifting government-mandated restrictions.

article continues below

The survey report published Monday suggests many service-sector and energy companies don't expect a return to pre-pandemic employment levels.

The worry among workers about losing their jobs rose to the highest level seen in the bank's regular survey of consumer expectations, released alongside the business outlook report.

Workers' expectations of how easily they could find new work dropped to the lowest level in the survey since the 2015 oil-price shock as the country faces a different and far deeper economic crisis.

Lockdowns and stay-at-home requests from governments put the economy in a deep freeze in mid-March, with the thaw beginning in recent weeks as restrictions began to be rolled back.

Nearly half of all businesses reported an outright decline of their sales in the past 12 months because of COVID-19, low energy prices and the uncertainty both wrought.

More than half of businesses expect their total sales over the next 12 months to be lower than they were in the last year, with future sales indicators at record lows.

About half of firms expect their sales will ""mostly recover"" within the next year as COVID-19's effects recede, but the expectations of a return to pre-pandemic levels often depend on lifting government-mandated restrictions. Some companies said they could get back to normal operations within a month of public health restrictions being lifted.

""Overall, while the economy is on the mend, it's still early days and both businesses and consumers will continue to grapple with uncertainty over the foreseeable future,"" TD economist Ksenia Bushmeneva said in a note.

""This will manifest in lower spending by households and weak investment plans by businesses, both of which will weigh on the pace of economic recovery.""

Consumers' expectations for wage growth were below what they anticipated for inflation, while the outlook for growth in household income dropped to its lowest level in the survey's history.

The consumer survey said spending expectations have tumbled, which the bank says suggests consumers have become more cautious due to the economic impact and health risks related to the pandemic.

The bank said consumers expect to spend mostly on essentials and less on durable goods like cars and furniture, as well services that involve face-to-face interactions like eating out, travel or going to the movies.

A Royal Bank report Monday estimated the drop in economic output and sharp rise in spending could put the federal deficit at $265 billion this fiscal year.

The report said deficits could be close to double those the Liberals predicted just over six months ago as revenues drop — not including an expected need to spend more to help the economy recover.

""If they needed to extend some of the (aid) programs to ensure that the economy wasn't going to be ... more meaningfully impacted, they're in the fiscal position to do so,"" said RBC economist Colin Guldimann, who co-wrote the report.

""Of course, there is a position when some spending becomes too much spending and it's really hard to know where that is.""

Federal spending on fighting the pandemic and its effects, by the government's most recent figures, amounts to about $174 billion.

About one-third of service and energy companies told the Bank of Canada they have tapped a federal wage subsidy to reduce or avoid layoffs. Other firms looking to rehire or hire new staff cited an emergency federal benefit for workers as a hurdle to their plans.

The latest figures from the federal government show the $45-billion wage subsidy program has paid nearly $17.1 billion to 245,160 companies as of June 29. Meanwhile, the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, or CERB, has paid $53.53 billion in benefits to 8.16 million people as of June 28, since it was introduced in late March.

David Macdonald, senior economist at the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, argued in a research note Monday that the Liberals shouldn't make deep cuts to their aid measures.

He calculated that households will have a surplus in their budgets by $202.9 billion due to Ottawa's deficit spending, while corporations would see a surplus to the tune of $37.1 billion.

""As federal deficits can create surpluses in other areas, the opposite is also true,"" Macdonald wrote. ""Federal surpluses, through cutbacks and austerity, must force another sector into deficit by the same amount.""

We have seen countless televised messages from elected politicians, as well as heated discussions about the proper use of masks. As we enter a very different summer, Research Co. and Glacier Media tracked the views of Canadians on political and behavioural matters.

The one consistent finding throughout the pandemic has been the high level of satisfaction that Canadians express toward the federal government. In our latest survey, 70% of Canadians are happy with how Ottawa has dealt with the COVID-19 outbreak, practically unchanged since we last asked in May (69%).

article continues below

The rating for provincial governments and municipal governments improved as more Canadians were able to leave the isolation pod. Three in four Canadians (75%, up 11 points since May) are satisfied with their provincial administration, and seven in 10 (70%) feel the same way about their local government.

The big jump for provincial governments was not uniform across the country. In Atlantic Canada and British Columbia, satisfaction reaches 86% and 83%, with positive perceptions increasing by 19 points and 14 points, respectively.

Two other areas experienced double digit rises in satisfaction: Saskatchewan and Manitoba (78%, up 19 points) and Ontario (76%, up 23 points). The lowest ratings are observed in Quebec (69%, up three points) and Alberta (62%, up six points). Quebec had the highest level of satisfaction when we started asking this question in March; Alberta has consistently been at the bottom.

On the behavioural side of things, there are some remarkable changes in the way Canadians are approaching the pandemic. Time and reassurance have made many residents feel safer about take-out and delivery. In April, 40% of Canadians said they were not ordering food because they feared infection. The proportion has dropped to 23%, in what will surely be welcome news to an industry that has been greatly affected by the pandemic.

Three in 10 Canadians admit to overeating, unchanged since April. There is an increase in consumption of alcohol at home (18%, up five points) and a steadier curve on losing our tempers more often (16%, down two points).

Throughout the pandemic, the gender gap on some questions related to safe practices has been staggering. This time, it is evident on two questions. Fewer Canadians (40%, down seven points) are cleaning the groceries they buy to prevent infection. While only 36% of men are sanitizing the provisions they buy, the proportion jumps to 44% among women.

Still, the biggest behavioural change is on our faces. Back in April, only 14% of Canadians said they wore a protective mask every time they went out. This time, practically half of Canadians (48%) are not leaving home without them. Regionally, Ontarians are leading the way in wearing masks (63%), followed by Albertans at 51%. The proportion is slightly lower in Quebec and British Columbia (each at 48%).

Again, women are being more meticulous. Most female respondents (57%) say they are wearing masks outside, while only 39% of male respondents report the same behaviour. There is also a generational gap, with more than half of Canadians aged 18 to 34 (55%) always bringing their masks, compared with 46% for those aged 35 to 54 and 44% among those aged 55 and over.

Mask or no mask, Canadians appear resigned to staying close to home and avoiding big crowds. Only 11% of Canadians expect to be able to travel abroad before the end of September, while a similar proportion (12%) believe they will be able to go to a live sporting event. There is slightly more hope about attending or hosting a large social gathering at some point before Labour Day (21%).

More than a third of Canadians think the calendar will hit December before they take a trip abroad (39%), witness a live sporting event (35%) or go to a large party (also 35%). In a sign of the difficulty of issuing any kind of forecast during the pandemic, the proportion of undecided respondents is high on all three options.

Even the seemingly simple task of shaking the hand of a person who is not at our home appears distant, with 20% of Canadians expecting to do this before September, and 29% foreseeing it perhaps as a Christmas miracle. In addition, three in four Canadians (75%) say they will “definitely” or “probably” take a vaccine against COVID-19 is one ultimately becomes available, up two points since April.

Even if the future seems bleak, Canadians are more optimistic now. In March, only 22% were willing to say that the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic was “behind us.” The proportion barely moved to 24% in May, but reached 49% at the end of June. Oddly enough, Quebecers (57%) and Ontarians (49%) are more enthusiastic about the corner being turned than those in two large provinces that have fewer COVID-19 cases: Alberta (44%) and British Columbia (39%). •

Think you might have symptoms? Take a self-assessment

On this page

Symptoms of COVID-19

Symptoms of COVID-19 can vary from person to person. Symptoms may also vary in different age groups. Some of the more commonly reported symptoms include:

new or worsening cough

shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

temperature equal to or over 38°C

feeling feverish

chills

fatigue or weakness

muscle or body aches

new loss of smell or taste

headache

gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting)

feeling very unwell



Children have been more commonly reported to have abdominal symptoms, and skin changes or rashes.

In severe cases, infection can lead to death.

Symptoms may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to COVID-19.

Recent evidence indicates that the virus can be transmitted to others from someone who is infected but not showing symptoms. This includes people who:

have not yet developed symptoms (pre-symptomatic)

never develop symptoms (asymptomatic)

While experts know that these kinds of transmissions are happening among those in close contact or in close physical settings, it is not known to what extent. This means it is extremely important to follow the proven preventative measures.

If you or your child become ill

If you are showing symptoms of COVID-19, reduce your contact with others:

isolate yourself at home for 14 days to avoid spreading it to others if you live with others, stay in a separate room or keep a 2-metre distance

visit a health care professional or call your local public health authority call ahead to tell them your symptoms and follow their instructions



Children who have mild COVID-19 symptoms are able to stay at home with a caregiver throughout their recovery without needing hospitalization. If you are caring for a child who has suspected or probable COVID-19, it is important to follow the advice for caregivers. This advice will help you protect yourself, others in your home, as well as others in the community.

If you become sick while travelling back to Canada:

inform the flight attendant or a Canadian border services officer

advise a Canada border services agent on arrival in Canada if you believe you were exposed to someone who was sick with COVID-19, even if you do not have symptoms this is required under the Quarantine Act the Canada border services agent will provide instructions for you to follow



Check if you have been exposed

Have you been on a recent flight, cruise, train, or at a public gathering? Check the listed exposure locations to see if you may have been exposed to COVID-19.

Take care of your mental health

The COVID-19 pandemic is new and unexpected. This situation can be unsettling and can cause a sense of loss of control. It is normal to feel sad, stressed, confused, scared or worried in a crisis. Make sure to care for your mental and physical wellbeing and to ask for help if you feel overwhelmed.

Diagnosing coronavirus

Coronavirus infections are diagnosed by a health care provider based on symptoms and are confirmed through laboratory tests.

Treating coronavirus

Most people with mild coronavirus illness will recover on their own.

If you are concerned about your symptoms, you should self-monitor and consult your health care provider. They may recommend steps you can take to relieve symptoms.

Vaccine, therapeutics and medical devices

At this time, a vaccine and therapies to treat or prevent this disease have not yet been identified. But research and development are underway. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a global review of therapies that may be used to treat or prevent the disease.

Health Canada is fast tracking the importation and sale of medical devices for use in relation to COVID-19.

Flu vaccine

If you have received a flu vaccine, it will not protect against coronaviruses, but will help prevent the flu. Getting the flu could make you more vulnerable to other infections.

Getting the flu vaccine will not increase your risk of illness from coronavirus. For more information, please refer to this recently published Canadian research study.

About coronaviruses

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people and others cause illness in animals. Human coronaviruses are common and are typically associated with mild illnesses, similar to the common cold.

COVID-19 is a new disease that has not been previously identified in humans. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people, and more rarely, these can then spread from person to person through close contact.

There have been 2 other specific coronaviruses that have spread from animals to humans and which have caused severe illness in humans. These are the:",[]

Limit contact

Only one healthy person should provide care.

Do not share personal items with the ill person, such as toothbrushes, towels, bed linen, utensils or electronic devices.

Use a separate bathroom from the ill person, if possible. If not possible, the ill person should put the toilet lid down before flushing.

Some people may transmit COVID-19 even though they do not show any symptoms. Wearing a mask, including a non-medical mask or face covering (i.e. made with at least two layers of tightly woven fabric, constructed to completely cover the nose and mouth without gaping, and secured to the head by ties or ear loops) can help protect others around you.

Prevent contact with animals, as there have been several reports of people transmitting COVID-19 to their pets.

Protect yourself

If possible, people who are at higher risk of serious illness from COVID-19 should not care for someone with COVID-19. These people include elderly persons, those with chronic medical conditions (e.g. heart disease, diabetes) or compromised immune systems.

If you need to be within 2 metres of the ill person, wear personal protective equipment: a medical mask disposable gloves eye protection

Wear disposable gloves when touching the ill person, their environment and soiled items or surfaces.

Avoid re-using medical masks or gloves.

Clean your hands often for at least 20 seconds, especially after contact with the ill person and after removing gloves, face masks and eye protection.

Dry your hands with disposable paper towels. If not available, use a reusable towel and replace it when it becomes wet.

You can also remove dirt with a wet wipe and then use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.

Wearing masks Medical masks are recommended for COVID-19 patients in the home and for protection for those providing direct care to COVID-19 patients at home.

N95 respirators must be reserved for healthcare workers and should not be used for caregiving at home.

If medical masks are not available, non-medical masks or face coverings (i.e. constructed to completely cover the nose and mouth without gaping, and secured to the head by ties or ear loops) can be worn by the ill person, if tolerable. This will cover their mouth and nose, and may prevent respiratory droplets from contaminating others or landing on surfaces.

A non-medical mask or face covering may also be worn by those providing direct care to COVID-19 patients at home. However, wearing a non-medical mask or facial covering in the community has not been proven to protect the person wearing it.

Strict hygiene and public health measures, including frequent hand washing and maintaining a physical distance of at least 2 metres from the ill person, will reduce the chance of being exposed to the virus.

Non-medical cloth masks should be carefully removed when soiled or damp, laundered in hot water and then dried thoroughly.

Hands must be cleaned before and after putting on and removing a mask.

Keep your environment clean

Place used medical masks, gloves and other contaminated items in a lined container, secure the contents and dispose of them with other household waste.

Place possibly contaminated laundry, including non-medical cloth masks and facial coverings, into a container with a plastic liner and do not shake. Wash with regular laundry soap and hot water (60-90°C), and dry well. Clothing, linens and non-medical cloth masks and facial coverings belonging to the ill person can be washed with other laundry.

At least once daily, clean and disinfect surfaces that people touch often, such as toilets, laundry containers, bedside tables, doorknobs, phones and television remotes.

Use only approved hard-surface disinfectants that have a Drug Identification Number (DIN). A DIN is an 8-digit number given by Health Canada that confirms the disinfectant product is approved and safe for use in Canada.

When approved hard surface disinfectants are not available, for household disinfection, a diluted bleach solution can be prepared in accordance with the instructions on the label, or in a ratio of 5 millilitres (mL) of bleach per 250 mL of water OR 20 mL of bleach per litre of water. This ratio is based on bleach containing 5% sodium hypochlorite, to give a 0.1% sodium hypochlorite solution. Follow instructions for proper handling of household (chlorine) bleach.

If they can withstand the use of liquids for disinfection, high-touch electronic devices (e.g. keyboards, tablets, smartboards) may be disinfected with 70% alcohol (e.g. alcohol prep wipes) at least daily.

Monitor yourself for symptoms

If you have always used the recommended precautions, then monitor yourself for symptoms for 14 days following your last close contact with the ill person.

Quarantine (self-isolate) at home for 14 days from your last exposure and contact your local public health authority if you have no symptoms but: cared for a person who has COVID-19 without the recommended personal protective equipment live with or had close physical contact (e.g. intimate partner) without using the recommended personal protective equipment live with or have had regular close contact (within 2 metres) with a person who has COVID-19 up to 48 hours prior to symptom onset or while they were symptomatic and not isolating had direct contact with the body fluids of a person who has COVID-19 (e.g. were coughed or sneezed on) without the recommended personal protective equipment



If you start to develop symptoms, isolate yourself as quickly as possible and contact your local public health authority for further instructions.

Maintain these supplies

Medical masks if available, or non-medical mask or face covering

Eye protection (face shield or goggles) for use by caregiver

Disposable gloves (do not re-use) for use by caregiver

On Tuesday July 14, 2020, Dr. Bonnie Henry, Provincial Health Officer and Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, announced 13 new cases of COVID-19 in the province for a total of 3,128 cases in British Columbia. Of the total COVID-19 cases, 14 individuals are hospitalized, five of whom are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation. Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 1,015 cases of COVID-19 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region. There are no new community outbreaks, but there have been several exposure events particularly in the Kelowna area. These occurred when a group of people from different areas including the Okanagan, lower mainland and Alberta got together. To date, 17 of these individuals have tested positive for COVID-19. Dr. Henry says as people become more active and travel, we will see more cases. Public health teams are actively working to manage cases and clusters as they emerge and keep new cases low and slow. Of note, the first incubation period since Canada Day is now complete.



Economic and fiscal update for 2020-21

The British Columbia government is forecasting a $12.5 billion deficit due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The provincial budget for 2020, tabled just months before the global pandemic, predicted a budget surplus of $227 million for 2020-21. Carole James, Minister of Finance, says the pandemic has exposed underlying gaps in our economy and society, and reminded us of the need for strong public services and supports. Government has supported people and businesses with $6.26 billion in COVID-19 supports to date. That includes the $5 billion in supplementary spending for B.C.’s COVID-19 Action Plan supports, such as workers benefits, rent supplements, income and disability assistance supports and economic recovery funding. These are in addition to $1.26 billion in other tax and relief measures for people and businesses, including the one-time increase to the climate action tax credit and property tax reductions for businesses.

Warning about calls appearing to come from Squamish General Hospital



Vancouver Coastal Health is warning the public not to provide personal information over the phone if they receive an unexpected call that appears to come from Squamish General Hospital. Someone claiming to be a hospital employee is calling people and asking for their full names, social insurance number and date of birth. This is in no way associated with Vancouver Coastal Health, and appears to be a phishing scam, where people are tricked into providing personal information that can be used fraudulently. RCMP have been advised.



Testing

Anyone in the VCH region with cold, influenza or COVID-19-like symptoms, however mild, can now be assessed for and get a COVID-19 test. Contact your physician or nurse practitioner's office, or a local community collection centre to arrange for a test. Phone numbers and locations of collection centre can be found by visiting: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/testing or by calling 8-1-1. In Vancouver, the City Centre and REACH urgent and primary care centres can provide testing as well as the St. Vincent's drive-up location at 4875 Heather Street. The Richmond Assessment Centre is located at 6820 Gilbert Road, in the parking lot of the Richmond Tennis Club. On the North Shore, testing is available at the North Vancouver Urgent and Primary Care Centre. If you think you need testing, please call ahead before visiting your doctor, urgent and primary care center or health clinic.



VCH Medical Health Officers, our provincial partners and the Public Health Agency of Canada continue to actively monitor the COVID-19 pandemic. To protect yourself while out in public, wash your hands frequently and maintain social distance. For more information on COVID-19, please visit www.vch.ca/COVID19.

The Gagnon brothers were born and raised in Whonnock, Maple Ridge, a hilly, small town studded with trees bordered by the Fraser River.

In Whonnock, the sense of community is everything. “We see a lot of the people over the years as we’ve all grown together and it means a lot to us to try to reach out, do what we can and try to make this town as good as we can,” Clay Gagnon said.

As owners and operators of Whonnock Roofing, Clay and Abraham deeply care about the work they do, and one example is their personal involvement in hiring each of their 21 employees to carry out their business in an ethical manner. Another major achievement for the brothers was to outline and design a part of the Roofing Contractors Association of B.C. exam. This exam is to certify roofers in British Columbia to carry out their duties by upholding industry standards and provide consumers trusted services. Whonnock Roofing is proud to do business the right way.

However, raising over $50,000 over the past 12 years for the Friends in Need Food Bank and supporting various kids’ sports leagues is Whonnock Roofing’s way of saying thank you to the community and they hold it close to their heart. It was in Maple Ridge where their parents first started the company nearly 40 years ago. Since taking the company over 13 years ago, the Gagnon brothers have sustained the hard work ethic and community involvement that Whonnock Roofing has always been known for.

Their hard work both on and off the roofs is a testament to what Whonnock Roofing is all about. “That speaks to our value, it translates to the job you’re going to get,” Gagnon said.

Sue has been working the till, serving customers and just “generally trying to make customers happy,” since it first opened.

While the restaurant’s owners have changed since Sue first started, she says the philosophy of “the customer comes first” has remained constant over the years.

“It’s a community and everyone comes here to visit each other,” says Sue. “(Many of them) have been coming here since the beginning and they don’t like change very much,” she laughs. Today, the restaurant is a fixture in the community with many regulars and generations of family filling its comfortable booths and tables.

Three groups in particular come in week after week, Sue says. There are a group of retirees who used to work at nearby Dairyland; a group of truck drivers and an antique car club.

Heidi, the restaurant’s manager and wife of the owner, says the restaurant has supported the community in many ways over the years. For instance, the restaurant donated gift certificates to the Centennial Highschool Dry Grad, which students could use to purchase meals after the event. Sun Star Restaurant also supports local churches by donating restaurant gift certificates.

The academy molds the players into mature young adults and teaches them how to act and react to constructive criticism and how to interact with adults, scouts, coaches and peers. They also gain valuable knowledge about hockey etiquette, respect, athlete diets and racism in sports.

“We are different from other hockey academies,” says Chong. “We bring the best of an academy and pride ourselves in not having to uproot athletes from their academic schooling. We are more affordable because we do not have to add the academic expense to the program.”

Westwaters Hockey Academy offers U16 AAA, U14 AAA and U12 AAA programs.

Working out alone can be challenging for many reasons, whereas going to a personal trainer gives everyone – from the newly reformed couch potato to the marathon runner – a better chance to meet their goals.

“Personal trainers provide clients with the resources and tools to be successful,” says Sam Noh, personal trainer and owner of Eagle Ridge Fitness in Port Moody.

There are five things a good, certified personal trainer offers that you can’t get at the big-box fitness clubs, according to Noh.

1. Motivation. Starting a healthy lifestyle can be extremely difficult on your own, and many people give up soon after starting a new exercise regime or eating plan. A good personal trainer will stick with you and help you hold yourself accountable.

2. Resources.Personal trainers have access to all kinds of knowledge, techniques and equipment that the average person may not even consider when planning out their new healthy lifestyle.

3. Recognition. All kinds of challenges pop up when you switch your routine. Personal trainers can spot some of these and help you work through them, such as helping a client mix things up when they’re getting bored of an exercise routine, or really examining what foods might not be helping them reach their goal of losing weight or being healthier.

4. Planning. A new lifestyle is not possible without extensive planning. A personal trainer can give you tips and information on how to best plan for your goals so that you don’t sabotage yourself before you’ve even started.

5. Listening. A really good personal trainer will listen to their clients and make sure they’re there for them, helping them navigate problems or injuries, staying in touch, and making sure the client’s goals are foremost.

“It’s not about what the trainer wants,” Noh says. “What are the client’s goals? That’s what matters most.”

The wrong trainer is the one who doesn’t pay attention to his or her client’s needs and pushes his or her own agenda, Noh adds. Simply put, you get what you pay for: if a personal trainer is charging lower rates than all the others in your area, it’s probably a bad sign.

""Clean carpets not only look good,"" he explains, ""but they help keep your house healthier. For example, pollen season is April and May, but if you don't get the pollen particulate out of your carpets, you could still be suffering from allergies in November and December.""

article continues below

After many years in the automotive and restaurant industry, Mike was approached by the owner of a cleaning company who suggested he had the right attitude and personal touch to succeed in the carpet cleaning business.

""I hadn't actually thought about carpet cleaning as a career before” Mike says, “ but I've been in the business now for over 12 years and really enjoy the customer interaction and the instant gratification that a clean carpet brings my customers.""

""The benefit of being a small company,"" Mike explains, ""is that the customer knows who they are dealing with. When they refer me to their friends or family, as many of my customers do, they know that I'll be the guy who will be going over to their house. With a larger firm, that's not always the case.""

In addition to keeping your house looking bright and allergen-free, regular professional carpet and upholstery cleaning will prolong the life of any carpet.

""Most manufacturers recommend professional carpet cleaning every 12 – 18 months,"" Mike says. ""When dust and allergens land on a carpet, they start to scratch the fibres – much like dirt on a water bottle. Once that happens, even after the carpet is cleaned, there will always be more of a shadow or a traffic lane on the carpet from the damage done to the fibres.""

To people who think that renting a carpet cleaning machine from the local supermarket can do the same job, Mike has a word of advice:

""You can go to the hardware store and buy nails and wood, but would you want to build your own house?"" he laughs. ""The biggest reason for professional cleaning is my experience. There is no one miracle cleaner to remove all stains and dirt, I use different products on different spots. What I use on a tea stain is different to what I use on a red wine stain or a pet stain. And don't forget, what will take you four hours or more, I can get done in just over one.""

“Real work means real pay; and on the children’s side, all children have the right to be educated in regular classrooms with appropriate levels of support.”

This year during Community Inclusion Month (October), Community Integration Services Society is encouraging the communities of the Lower Mainland to look at how people with disabilities activate their rights decades after the final closure of Woodland Institutions in 1996 – the last known registered mental institution in the lower mainland.

“In 1990 we first opened our doors at CISS in response to the people who were leaving the institution and moving back into community where they rightfully belonged,” says Mahar. “Since 1990 we have come a long way—but we’re now moving into the next phase: thinking critically of how people with disabilities activate their rights to love, learn, vote and work in today’s age.

“Putting these rights into action is an integral part of participating in society as a full citizen and something we have to consider actively.”

With 26 years of experience in the Tri-Cities community, Community Integration Services Society is proud to provide important integration and inclusion services such as: educational, vocational, recreational and social aid throughout the Lower Mainland in the hopes of fostering contributing members of society.

“The quality of one’s life is measured against rights and opportunities and CISS firmly believes that all citizens have the same rights,” says Mahar, whose not-for-profit organization is a proud inclusive employer and has created a renowned social enterprise named Melissa Park Catering Service. “No matter who the person is, we are all equal.”

Community Integration Services Society is proud to work in the community and are thankful that Mayor Greg Moore and his council have proclaimed October as Community Living Month. The Mayor and citizens of Port Coquitlam believe that all are entitled to the same rights and opportunities.

In fact, community is a huge priority for owner and operator Gerry Sly. Not only has he surrounded and staffed his business with people who care about the community and its people, but for the past 12 years, Sly has also been feeding the homeless from the back of his Coquitlam shop.

“We have been blessed by the faithfulness of our long term customers and we are very aware of the needs of the less fortunate in our community,” Sly said. “The feeding program is a way for us to give back and say thank you to the community.”

Since 2005, Sly and the rest of the staff at Circuit Collision help feed the homeless every Thursday evening. Serving up food like barbequed hamburgers, salads, and even a full course turkey dinner on special occasions, Circuit Collision has inadvertently become a hub for community and philanthropy in Coquitlam. Because of Circuit Collision’s feeding program, now, other parts of the community can get the opportunity to also give back. Sly explained that “for many years, multiple school groups in the Tri-Cities have stepped up and prepared and supplied food for our weekly meals.”

The feeding program at Circuit Collision began after Sly’s church group realized how easy it can be to show compassion to those who need it. Sly and the men in his church group would meet weekly in the house on the auto body repair shop property. Sly said they noticed there was a group of homeless people living in the bush across the street. “We would help them fix their bikes, charge their cell phones, stuff like that,” Sly said. “Then one day, we just decided to offer them a meal.”

Circuit Collision and the people who work there exemplify that a little can go a long way. Giving back to the community, both in auto body repairs and in doing their part to give to the less fortunate in the community, are just some of the ways Circuit Collision is making Coquitlam a little brighter.

Celebrities from Halle Berry and Jennifer Lopez, to Arnold Schwarzenegger and Madonna have all been photographed enjoying fine cigars. And where would guys like Mark Twain, Fidel Castro or George Burns be without their trademark stogies?

article continues below

But if you’re new to the world of cigars, it’s hard to know where to start. Walk into any cigar shop and there are almost too many choices. Cohiba or a Montecristo? A Punch or a Mini?

“Look for the country first,” advises Sutha Nada, Director of Express News & Smokes tobacco shops, the top cigar retailer in the Lower Mainland. “The best cigars, and the cigars of the highest quality are those coming from Cuba, Honduras, and the Dominican Republic. That is where ‘real’ cigars come from. Not these flavoured things.”

Sutha explains how, as a cigar smoker himself, and Director of the top tobacco shops in British Columbia, he often travels abroad to learn more about the products so he can pass that knowledge on to his employees. He also brings in experts to teach the stores’ staff how cigars are produced.

“The best cigars are made from the top leaves of the tobacco plants,” he says. “They get more sun, and are much softer, offering a superior flavour and smoke. Every different leaf has a different taste. That is the big difference between cigarettes and cigars. Cigars are just the pure leaf, whereas cigarettes add a lot of chemicals to the tobacco, believe it or not!”

Sutha said cigar smokers should remember Bill Clinton’s famous response about marijuana.

“You don’t inhale cigars, usually,” he explains. “Rather, you ‘buff’ it in your mouth—that is, you feel the smoke and taste in your mouth. Some cigars go well with wine, and some go better with a sparkling water, or with red meat. And, of course, you also have to know how to store them properly.”

It’s a lot to know, but well worth the effort, he says.

By 2021, the target will reach 350,000 new arrivals a year.

How do you get to be one of those 350,000?

Canada Immigration Consultants can make the process easier. Not only does it help clients with the myriad of documentation requirements, but it will also advise on how to have the best chance possible to find work and become a permanent resident.

It all starts with prospective immigrants filling out a questionnaire on Canada IC’s website. The answers will be reviewed by one of Canada IC’s licensed Regulated Canadian Immigration Consultants who will determine if the applicant meets the criteria for one of several immigration pathways.

Categories include:

• skilled workers aged 18 to 47

• student visas for people 18 to 35

• holiday visas

• working holidays

“Once we see they have all the criteria, we are able to represent them with all the documents, prepare for the English or French exam, help them with evaluating their documents, and also prepare them with a résumé and cover letter that is up to Canadian standards” says COO Rachel Gary.

For student visas, Canada IC can advise applicants on the careers with the highest demand, such as nursing and engineering. Its consultants will connect applicants with the schools that best suit their interests and abilities. Once accepted, Canada IC can walk the student through the process of working while studying.

“Each time you get a visa to Canada you get points; the more points you have, the easier it is to immigrate,” Gary says. “The system is built so that if you study in Canada you will stay in Canada, work and contribute.”

Canada IC can help work applicants with their World Education Services’ international credential evaluation. This compares the applicant’s education with Canadian standards and determines the equivalency. Someone with a B.A. from South Africa, for instance, might have the equivalency of a Master’s degree or diploma. “It all depends on which school you studied at and how many years you studied,” Gary says.

Canada IC also provides clients with a list of human resources companies to help them find a job. It helps clients craft a résumé that gives them a better chance to compete.

The Maple Ridge company started out as a flooring company, Woodopolis Wood Products Ltd., seven years ago, but has since expanded to offer remodelling and renovation services.

article continues below

But Woodopolis hasn’t strayed from its flooring roots. In fact, they’ve expanded what products they offer, as well as their knowledge of what flooring is best in different circumstances, according to Woodopolis President and CEO Tracy Zhang.

Zhang is known for her flooring and design expertise, but she says it’s important for clients to keep their own preferences and lifestyle in mind.

“I always tell customers they can go online, find the picture of the flooring that they like – not necessarily what kind of flooring, just a look,” Zhang says. “Focus on a look they like.”

She suggests clients should first think about their personal style. For instance, do they prefer contemporary or modern design, or more of a country or traditional feel?

It is also important to keep the current style of their home in mind.

The next thing to consider is what kind of lifestyle they lead, Zhang says. Do they have pets, or children?

“If people have dogs, I definitely recommend laminate more than wood, because wood will get scratched by dogs,” she adds. “But laminate's really durable.”

Hardwood is a classic for a reason, as it is easy to clean and is often popular with homebuyers, if clients are considering selling. And these days, there are many types of wood, as well as a variety of stains, available to really create a signature look for a home.

But vinyl and laminate flooring are also good choices, according to Zhang.

“Vinyl flooring is getting more and more popular,” she says, adding that clients like it because it’s waterproof. “The biggest benefit of laminate is durability, and that it's cost effective.”

Vinyl flooring also offers many design and pattern choices, and it is also more cost effective than hardwood, according to Zhang.

Whether clients prefer vinyl for the design freedom, laminate for the durability, or hardwood for the classic appearance, Zhang is on hand at Woodopolis to address their needs and help them make the right choice.

“This is one of the few places where families with children of all ages can enjoy an intergenerational unifying family tradition,” says Kathleen Reinheimer, Coquitlam Parks manager. “There is nothing more attractive to people [than] having coloured lights in the darkest part of the year. There is something visceral about that and then you add water and music. The universality of it is undeniable. People are coming away with a heartwarming experience, and that is magic.”

The display is unique making it extra special. Recycled and repurposed materials are used in every way possible. The thousands of signature tulips found uniformly through the exhibit are homemade from recycled bottles set over different coloured lights.

The project has grown through the creativity of parks board staff, gardeners, carpenters and equipment operators, partnering with community members in all different ways. Community workshops are available all year to make items for the event. “There are more than 650 Light Brigade volunteers involved in fabricating lights this year and many of these volunteers are also helping to install the lights,” says Reinheimer.

This year, school groups, scouts, cubs, business partners and their staff made more than 1,000 origami cranes to add to the display. “We welcome community involvement at every stage of the project,” says Reinheimer. “And we are always looking for good recycled crafts to enhance the display so people can leave their own mark.”

Lights at Lafarge runs everyday for eight weeks, from December until the third weekend of January. Lights are on from about 4 p.m. until 11 p.m. New this year are lights on and around the Killer Whale living sculpture “Chief of the Undersea World” along Pinetree Way and interactive activities in the Park Spark Zone at the TD Plaza every night between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m.

C.A.I. Financial, Canada’s leading private lending company catering to people without the use of credit, recently moved into Port Moody.

“Some people see short-term lending as trying to capitalize on the misfortune of others,” says President Shameer Dada, who opened the Tri-Cities franchise six months ago. “The truth is that 90 per cent of the people we loan to have nowhere else to turn.”

Dada describes what C.A.I. Financial does as falling somewhere between a payday loan and a bank loan.

Offering title loans, collateral loans and reciprocal loans, all without a credit check, C.A.I. Financial can make funds available in as little as 15 minutes. As long as you have collateral, says Dada, approval is guaranteed.

“We deal with a lot of people who have seasonal income,” he says, “or people who find themselves in need of cash to cover unexpected bills or expenses.”

With proper collateral, such as a vehicle, boat, RV, motorcycle or ATV, C.A.I. Financial offers loans from $1,000 up to $25,000 with payment terms ranging from three to nine months.

C.A.I. Financial has built a niche by being the only company to offer what’s called a ‘reciprocal loan’. Similar to a title loan, a reciprocal loan is where the company lends out money tied to some form of collateral. Unlike a title loan, however, a reciprocal agreement does not require that the company take title of the asset. Instead, they allow the customer to continue to use his or her collateral for a fee. Once the loan is finished, all contracts are then voided.

“The vast majority of people that we deal with are happy to have the chance to improve their circumstances so easily,” says Dada.

""People struggling with debt are often unaware of our many roles and the options we can offer for dealing with their debt, so they delay contacting us.""

Regulated by the Federal Government through the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy (OSB), Licensed Insolvency Trustees are professionals who can help people deal with their financial difficulties.

Here are just some of the facts you should know about Licensed Insolvency Trustees (LITs):

· Consumer proposals: LITs are the only professionals authorized by law to administer a consumer proposal or bankruptcy.

· Federally regulated: LITs are both regulated and licensed by the OSB. ""We are required to adhere to a code of ethics,"" says David, ""and there's a formal complaint process through the OSB.""

· Educated and experienced: All LITs have their education and qualifications assessed by the OSB. ""My colleagues and I are required to undertake ongoing professional development,"" David explains. ""Non-trustee firms may or may not have the education and experience to help your situation. There's no guarantee.""

· Regulated fees: The federal government regulates fees charged by LIT firms. ""My competitors and I all get paid the same,"" says David. ""There's no such regulation in place for non-trustee firms.""

· Free initial consultation: Boale Wood offers a free one-hour introductory consultation. ""There's no obligation on the client's part until they have had the initial chat with me, provide the documents we need, and they've formally agreed to move forward.""

· Counselling: LITs are also Professional Debt Counsellors and able to give advice and a plan for staying out of debt once your obligations have been discharged. ""We're mandated to provide you with debt counselling whether or not you choose to proceed with a bankruptcy filing.""

And the Tri-City Eagles Field Hockey Club is eager to have its players dust off their sticks and hit the turf for another fast-paced and exciting spring schedule.

Club president Brian Lewis says the sport in North America is mischaracterized as one mainly played by females.

But it has a global following, for both men and women’s teams, and is the world’s second-most popular sport, second only to soccer.

“It’s a great sport, played by so many around the world,” he says. “There are numerous amateur and community leagues, and many of the top athletes make a living playing professionally.

“It’s also very comparable to soccer when it comes to the on-field strategy,” Lewis says, adding it can be an ideal cross-over sport for all athletes.

“For youngsters, it’s important they try out all kinds of sports,” Lewis says, adding he encourages parents and their children to come out and see the field hockey first-hand, or on video.

“Just take a look, see how it’s played. Watch it at the top levels to get a feel for the amount of skill and athleticism is required to compete.”

That opportunity to see some of the best will come this summer as Canada’s Men’s Field Hockey team will compete at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, Japan.

The Tri-City Eagles Field Hockey Club’s season begins at the end of March and runs until late June.

Typically, around 500 players are registered across the various age groups, which starts with Mite players (ages five to seven), graduates to Minis (eight to nine), Juniors (11 to 18), then adult teams, and a high performance stream that can prepare players for a place on the provincial and even national teams.

Lewis says, that last category of elite players have a host of opportunities to become eligible for college and university scholarships in Canada and the U.S., especially for females.

“We’ve had quite a number of players go on to the university level,” Lewis says.

Rest Your Head: Set on an expansive double lot in a community nestled on the hill overlooking Gibsons Marina, The Seasalt Cottage is a quiet home base from which to explore Gibsons Landing and the nearby towns of Sechelt and Roberts Creek. The owner, Michele, has lovingly renovated the two guest suites—one on the ground level and one on the “Upper Deck,” in the complex in which she resides with her adorable French bulldog, Chloe.Each suite is bright and stylishly decorated with plush furnishings and marine-inspired décor touches (think seashells and a white and blue pastel colour scheme). Both guest units boast soaker tubs, TVs/Netflix, wifi and kitchenettes which are perfect for those wanting to stay for more than a couple of nights (and who wouldn’t want that when this adorable pup is one of your hosts?).

article continues below

While the interiors are pristine and calming, the exterior space at The Seasalt Cottage is truly spectacular. Both suites have their own private patios where guests can enjoy a glass of wine while relaxing and enjoying the refreshing sea breeze. These terraces extend onto a huge garden filled where undulating pathways winding past lush bushes, vines and flowers.

Michele has created a few different seating areas nestled within the garden where guests can while away summer afternoons swaying in one of the suspended rocking chairs while taking in views of the sparkling sea and listening to the sound of water trickling from the fountains installed throughout the garden. Guests can also make use of the communal barbecue, grilling up seafood bought at the Gibsons Farmer’s Market (or caught on a fishing trip) and enjoying it in the outdoor dining area under a grapevine-covered arbour.

Wine & Dine: Just a three-minute walk down the hill from The Seasalt Cottage you’ll find an array of hip boutiques, coffee shops, restaurants and pubs at Gibsons Landing. My friend Fran and I arrived late on a Friday night and as soon as we dropped our bags in our suite we made a beeline to Tapworks pub, on Michele’s recommendation. The brewery has recently expanded from a hole-in-the-wall behind Gibsons Art Gallery to a two-level hotspot to see-and-be-seen while sipping locally crafted brews.

After ascending to the second floor, Fran and I made ourselves comfortable next to the firepit and ordered beer tasting flights, flatbread and spinach and artichoke dip from the snack menu. It wasn’t long before we had made friends with a couple of folks in their sixties who were visiting from West Vancouver and a group of twenty-somethings who were in town from Kitsilano. By the end of the night, we were playing board games with our new friends in the pub’s first-floor area. I mentioned to Fran later that night that it was Gibsons’ friendly small-town vibe that had likely inspired us to bond with complete strangers so quickly: if we had encountered the same people in a Vancouver bar we probably wouldn’t have connected in the same way.

Other notable (and super hip) dining experiences in Gibsons include Buono Osteria, a new Italian restaurant with a warm ambiance that overlooks the marina. Opened by Wally Buono’s son, the eatery serves traditional Italian fare with a modern twist, as well as excellent wines. Fran and I loved the locally foraged wild mushroom Bucatini with celery root and sherry cream. For happy hour drinks, super fresh oysters and a fun environment, head to Smitty’s Oyster House which is set right on the water. Next door Lunitas Mexican Eatery serves up beer, margaritas and excellent Mexican fare.

No trip to Gibsons is complete without a meal at the infamous Molly’s Reach restaurant which made its mark in the ’70s as one of the locations in the infamous Beachcombers series. On Day 2, Fran and I started our morning with a bacon and egg breakfast at the eatery while listening to Elvis tunes and overlooking Gibsons Marina.

Later in the day we had coffee at the locally owned and operated Beachcomber Coffee shop, an energetic little place located right on Gibsons’ Gower Point strip. I loved the unexpected, youthful vibe of the space known for its neon yellow and green branding and club-style music. On the last morning of my stay, after Fran had returned to Vancouver, I sat on the patio for a couple of hours, drinking coffee and snacking on pastries from Sandy’s Bake Shoppe down the street, people-watching, chatting with the locals and listening as they caught up on life.

Explore: The Sunshine Coast is a haven for nature-lovers so hiking, kayaking, fishing and beach-going are givens for visitors to the area. Soames Hill is a beautiful intermediate hike that we completed in about an hour and rewarded us with spectacular views of the Georgia Strait and Keats and Bowen Islands. Davis Bay is a beautiful beach to park yourself for the day with a blanket and a book. And for breathtaking sunsets Bonniebrook beach comes highly recommended by the locals I chatted with a Beachcomber Coffee.

But there is also lots to do right in Gibsons. You could spend a few hours visiting the many shops and boutiques along the strip which sell well-curated homewares and local art, as we did. And the Gibsons Public Market, opened in March 2017, is a fun place to pick up local cheeses, fresh fish, produce and flowers, and to visit the Nicholas Sonntag Marine Education Centre which temporarily holds local marine life in its tanks until they are returned to their natural habitat.

After spending a weekend getting to know Gibsons, it’s strange for me to think that it was once a town I’d drive through, without a thought, on my way to Sechelt. Now I realize it’s a gem in its own right—and I’ll definitely be back the next time I want a fun and laid back experience just a boat ride from Vancouver.

For Forest Lawn Funeral Home, it is no different.

Andrew Knapman, the manager of the Central Burnaby funeral home, understands that Forest Lawn relies on its community, and in turn, it is important for them to give back and show their gratitude.

article continues below

“We try to get involved in our community and that’s certainly true in the Burnaby area, but we also try to help out throughout the entire Lower Mainland,” Knapman said. “We do that by doing extensive philanthropic work with a place that is near and dear to our hearts: Crossroads Hospice Society.”

Crossroads Hospice Society offers outstanding support services to families throughout the Tri-Cities before and after the loss of a loved one. It is easy to see why Forest Lawn Funeral Home each year chooses to help this hospice. From raising money to sponsoring events and volunteering their efforts and funds to silent auctions and various galas, Forest Lawn gives back to its community. In fact, the Dignity Memorial funeral home’s support is scattered throughout Greater Vancouver, with philanthropic work at Burnaby Hospice and at MacLaren Housing Society of British Columbia, located in Vancouver. The organizations which Forest Lawn Funeral Home chooses to support directly reflect their values of compassion, care, and supporting those in need.

Though, Forest Lawn does not only focus on the community around them, but within them. Each year Forest Lawn holds a holiday memorial, an event for families who have been with Forest Lawn in the past year. Organizing an event where families can commiserate with those who have experienced a similar loss provides a basis of support and community within Forest Lawn’s walls.

“We often refer to the solstice,” Knapman said, “when we go into the darkest time of year and it is a parable for life and loss but this event serves as a reminder that the sun, the light, will come back into your life.”

At Origami Rhythmics, Laki’s gymnastics gym, her students learn discipline and establish a sense of focus and concentration that can only be achieved through training and athletics. But most of all, in Lena’s opinion, “sports are always important for kids because it helps them lead a healthy life, both physically and mentally.”

It is very rewarding for Laki to see her students – who are mostly female – grow right before her eyes empowered with rhythmic gymnastics. The girls develop certain kind of confidence through both experiencing being strong and athletic and at the same time feeling artistic and beautiful with their hair done up wearing extravagant costumes. Most of her students commit to the sport for several years, as Origami Rhythmic provides programs from 3-year-olds all the way to the national level.

Rhythmic gymnastics is different from artistic gymnastics – the sport you may watch during the Olympics, for example. While the latter focuses mainly on strength, balance and agility, rhythmic gymnastics primarily emphasizes grace, dance, flexibility, and eye-hand coordination, music being an integral part of any performance. The musical aspect is greatly appreciated and enjoyed by young gymnasts as it gives them a chance not only to demonstrate their athletic abilities, but to add emotions and self-express.

In addition to combining dance, ballet, and gymnastics and performing freehand with no props, young athletes use different apparatuses: hoop, rope, ball, clubs, ribbon, each routine becoming a unique piece of art. Thanks to Laki’s vast experience with figure skating, she brings a unique and innate sense of fluidity movement and flexibility training raising each of her students’ performance to a new level.

There are ten coaches that work at Origami Rhytmics. Head coach Betty Getsova who leads the Origami National team has had experience for about 30 years. She creates beautiful choreographed routines for each girl that is unique and unrepeatable.

At Origami Rhythmics, Lena stressed, there is a variety of different opportunities for girls. They include programs that are designed for every age group, including the Toddler Rhythmic Program, the Pre-Competitive Program, as well as Provincial, Regional and National Streams, to name a few.

First Memorial Burkeview Chapel is part of the Dignity Memorial network of more than 2,000 funeral homes across North America. But Keith and his colleagues work to make First Memorial Burkeview a local funeral services provider.

""We've been in this building since 1999,"" he explains. ""Everything here is on one level with no stairs or elevators, so we're very accessible. Our chapel holds 200 people, but we do have two overflow areas for large funerals. In addition, we can make the chapel into a smaller venue for more intimate services.""

The building itself has a bright, modern look without the dark colours often associated with funeral homes.

""People feel comfortable coming here,"" says Keith. ""The Tri-Cities community is a very diverse community and we like to create a life well celebrated theme for each and every family we serve. Whether that be a formal “Traditional Service” or a “Celebration of Life”. Our funeral professionals pull out all the stops to make the event meaningful to the family.

People who use the services of Keith and his colleagues at First Memorial Burkeview Chapel have typically been to the premises before and looked at the facilities.

""That's important when choosing a funeral services provider,"" says Keith. ""You should visit the facilities and meet the funeral professionals.

Blair Goodman, owner of Eclipps, started the hair salon in 1994, steadily building it up from a one-man shop to an award-winning team of 14 professional hairstylists.

Along the way, Blair and his team made time to invest in their local community.

“Community means everything to us,” Blair notes. “From day one we supported local artists. Our salon walls have always and only been adorned with local artists’ work. In addition, we’ve hosted art shows for both local artists and non-profit art groups.”

In 2014, to celebrate the hair salon’s 20th anniversary, Eclipps Hair Café hosted an event in support of Pottery Works, a studio and gallery space located in New Westminster and sponsored by the Community Living Society.

“It’s a group of special needs artists who create art, pottery, and jewelry,” Blair explains. “We loved displaying their work in the salon.”

The 2014 event featured music, an art auction, and a rendition of Vincent Van Gogh’s Starry Night, which the artists worked on together.

“We enjoy giving back to the community,” Blair says, “and we consider ourselves fortunate to have been supported by our community. We also feel honoured to have been named the number one hair salon in New Westminster for the majority of years we have been open.”

Along with featured artwork and a relaxing atmosphere, Eclipps Hair Café adds to the client experience with complimentary coffees, lattes, mochas, and cappuccinos.

“It’s been a part of our customer experience since day one,” Blair notes. “I have a love of drinking coffee, so I designed the café portion of the hair salon after a coffee shop at a time when Tim Horton’s and Starbucks were just getting off the ground.”

Open seven days a week, Eclipps Hair Café offers hair styling – including updos, downdos, and bridal styles – hair extensions, colouring, cutting, and deep conditioning treatments to look amazing while maintaining hair health.

“Our professional stylists are highly educated,” Blair explains, “and are constantly being trained on the latest styling and colouring trends, methods, and techniques.”

But who’s on speed dial if a tree comes down on your property, or your hedge needs trimming? Joe Zepedeo and Rick Pynn think it should be their company, A1 Tri-Craft.

The business is one of just a handful of Lower Mainland tree and shrub specialists that work all year round, not just in the warmer months. The team will tackle any size job from removing a hedge or large diameter tree to massive storm clear-ups, working on residential, commercial, strata, insurance and emergency projects. “We typically have two or three crews on the road at all times, which means we can react quickly to any type of situation,” says Pynn. “We can get estimates done within two days, and start a project within the week. We also have access to any type of equipment that might be necessary. From a customer-service point of view we are aware that some scenarios, especially emergency projects, can be emotional situations, so we’re sensitive to that.”

Zepedeo and Pynn are relatively new to this industry – they took over A1 Tri-Craft around a year ago – but the business has more than two decades of history in the community. Many of the experienced crewmembers have worked there for years under previous owner Andrew Baba. “Andrew was a good friend of ours who passed away suddenly last year, aged just 42,” says Zepedeo. “We decided to take on the business at that point to help his family and customers, and to keep his staff working. It was the appropriate thing for us to do so that his young children have something to fall back on down the road.”

“Andrew immigrated here from Poland and bought this business when he was just 18 or 19,” continues Pynn. “He worked incredibly hard to make it a success and had such a fantastic reputation with his many customers. We’re proud to continue his legacy – it really was his life’s work.”

Laser light therapy can help. An alternative form of treatment for musculoskeletal conditions, soft tissue injuries, degenerative conditions, and wounds, laser light therapy has been practiced for over eight years at Tri-City Laser Light Therapy by Dr. Pam Bennett and her team of fivecertified laser therapists, which includes a registered physiotherapist and Dr. Bennett, Doctor of Chiropractic.

“We’ve found laser light therapy to be a very effective and non-invasive therapy that really benefits our patients,” says Dr. Bennett, who began incorporating the treatment at her Coquitlam-based clinic in 2008.

Laser light therapy uses light energy to stimulate the body’s cells into repairing damaged tissue, drawing on the body’s natural painkiller and anti-inflammatory hormones.

In addition to laser light therapy, Dr. Bennett outlines three easy steps to achieve pain relief and take back your active lifestyle:

1) Initial consultation:Visit a qualified clinic such as Tri-City Laser Light Therapy for an initial consultation with either a chiropractor or physiotherapist who will determine the appropriate treatment after a routine exam and diagnosis.

2) Follow a treatment schedule.Your therapist will then prescribe a treatment schedule tailored to your condition. Make sure you set aside enough time to follow through with the entire treatment schedule. As a general rule of thumb, pain relief goals can often be achieved after 10 consistent treatments.

3) Follow up the treatment as directed. Once you’ve finished your treatment schedule, your therapist will provide you with any lifestyle changes and exercises for continued pain relief. This will allow you to remain active without experiencing joint and muscle pain.

Just nine months after graduating, she took a practice management course for one and a half years, which cost a month’s gross salary.

article continues below

“It was worth every cent of it because it taught me things about running an office, about delegating, about setting up protocols, and about organization which have just been foundational throughout my practice,” Dr. Pearce says.

Education has been a key part of Dr. Pearce’s work as a dentist, and she believes staying abreast of new technologies and techniques is essential.

“There are so many aspects of dental practice that are constantly changing,” she says. “In dentistry, the new technology is phenomenal.”

For instance, her clinic, On Track Dental in Port Coquitlam, recently acquired a digital scanner, meaning they no longer have to put putty in patients’ mouths to take impressions – they can take an image and email it right to the lab.

Dr. Pearce has also focused on broadening her abilities, primarily through joining hands-on dentistry study clubs where dentists learn by working together on real patients.

“Your peers are there, they watch you work, and you have a mentor. You have a chance to learn things that you never would have learned before, and that's how I started surgery,” she says.

She joined the Vancouver Oral Implant Surgical Study Club in 1986, following a course she’d taken on implants.

“The members of the Study Club found that our skills, confidence and expertise increased exponentially,” Dr. Pearce says. “It’s been a wonderful part of my life.”

In 2010, she began the process of gaining credentials for all of her implant training. She now has Diplomate status with the American Board of Oral Implantology and will be inducted as a Fellow of the American Association of Implant Dentistry in October of 2017.

Dr. Pearce take courses from the Kois Center, run by Dr. John C. Kois in Seattle. The centre focuses on a science-based approach to dentistry and uses intensive evidence-based research to develop protocols for dental treatment.

Dr. Pearce believes that it is essential for those in the dentistry field to be up to date in their knowledge and techniques.

“As a general dentist, you're dealing with a whole range of aspects of dentistry, as well as the general health and well-being of the patient,” she says. “We treat patients with teeth, not just teeth attached to patients!”

""A lot of what we do entails educating the patient about sleep apnea in general, their particular symptoms, and the medical problems they may be facing.""

Sleep apnea is a common cause of many sleep disorders and, according to Paul, is far more prevalent than most people think.

article continues below

""Around one in five people have a mild form of Obstructive Sleep Apnea, or OSA,"" says Paul. ""And one in fifteen people have a more severe form. Unfortunately, more than 75 percent of those suffering from some form of sleep apnea have not been diagnosed.""

Coastal Sleep has been helping people understand sleep apnea, its causes and symptoms for almost 15 years. Their clinics provide education and treatment in English, French, Punjabi, Mandarin, and Cantonese.

""In the past, patients were referred by their family doctor to a sleep therapist at a hospital,"" Paul explains. ""They needed to spend a night in hospital in order to be tested. The problem was that there tended to be a long waiting list, so a lot of people simply didn’t bother.""

In response to the need to test people in a timely manner, Coastal Sleep offers testing in the comfort of the person’s home. Physicians often refer patients to the clinic for testing or a patient can call for an appointment themselves.

First line treatment for sleep apnea involves the use of a CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) machine and mask that's worn every night.

""The masks are easy to wear,"" Paul says, ""and patients quickly realize the benefits of a good night's sleep. They have more energy—and are more engaged in life.""

""Dr. Kara feels that mothers give so much, especially his own, that he wanted to reach out and support other mothers in our community.""

The prize is not insignificant – up to $25,000 in dentistry services to help the lucky winner wear a smile they can be proud of.

The Career Paths for Skilled Immigrants Program at Douglas College aims to help new arrivals with two programs that, upon completion, will connect them to employment opportunities. What may be less obvious are the benefits the Tri-Cities’ economy also gains.

“There’s a labour market need for skilled employees within our province,” said Jennifer Kuenzig, Program Manager at Douglas College. “So the provincial government began funding programs that addressed that need by tapping into the labour pool that was arriving in the province, but that wasn’t getting recognized by employers,” Jennifer explained.

She mentioned an example that has become archetypal of skilled newcomers to B.C.: “we had the classic stories of the doctors driving the taxis and they were trying to prevent that by enabling those who had certain skillsets pursue those skillsets.” In addition to adding skilled workers into the labour market, Career Paths also addressed the issue of wasted potential. Industries that are rapidly changing present the problem of skills becoming outdated and ultimately wasted. “If you’re in tech and you aren’t able to use your skills while you’re a new immigrant to Canada because your experience isn’t recognized or you don’t know how to start the search, then you’re going to be rusty,” Kuenzig said.

Douglas College offers two programs, one that targets those with experience and education in the health sector and one for those who are residents of the Tri-Cities. Both programs are customizable and each client receives a personal career coach who helps newcomers gain the necessary credentials, trains them in confidence and connects them with employment opportunities. Because the program is around two years, we are only starting to see the first crop of immigrants and refugees complete the program and find employment in B.C.

Eligibility for this program requires permanent residency of Canada in B.C., an intermediate to higher level of English and is intended for those who do not have employment insurance or receive government support.

“The personalized part of it is very important for me,” says owner Michelle Di Tomaso. “We like to incorporate something a little personal about the recipient so they know the basket was made especially for them and not thought of last minute. I like to get to know my clients… building relationships. It’s the real fun part of my business.”

Di Tomaso started making gift baskets as a hobby business in the mid-1990s, but after successfully battling breast cancer, she took stock of her priorities and decided she wanted to dedicate herself full-time to her growing gift basket business. Today she boasts a long list of loyal customers.

“I found that the gift baskets were my creative outlet,” she says. “I really enjoy delivering them myself so I can see the recipients reaction. It makes the entire creative process so rewarding.”

Known as much for her outstanding quality as she is for her personal touch, Di Tomaso also knows the importance of giving back. Along with donating her creative talents to local charitable causes like the Vancouver Canucks Dice & Ice fundraiser and Pink Shirt Ladies Luncheon, she’s a proud supporter of locally produced materials.

“I know what it’s like to be the little guy in Vancouver,” she says. “It helps our economy, I make great friends with these suppliers and they are loyal. We work together to succeed together.”

As a seniors living community, it serves to help seniors and the elderly who can no longer care for themselves. As a home, the Wesbrooke looks after its residents as if they were family.

Though, what sets this privately-owned, family-run establishment apart from other retirement homes is its handpicked staff and a philosophy that respects the importance of choice. As owner Pat De Luca says it: “the Wesbrooke is just different than most retirement homes.”

Whether it is the professionally designed interior and exterior of the retirement home, or the elegant dining room serving up gourmet meals twice a day, De Luca says the seniors at the Wesbrooke can truly enjoy this next phase of life living in a home that fits to its residents’ needs.

In addition to providing caregiving and residential services to seniors and retirees, the Wesbrooke is extremely involved in its community. Running fundraisers for Alzheimer’s disease, helping out at the local food bank, working with the local hospice and organizing programs at local elementary schools are just some examples of theWesbrooke’s community engagement.

Co-owners Pat and Celeste De Luca do their best to not only make Wesbrooke a community for its residents, but to transform it into a place where they can feel comfortable, happy and social. As a family-oriented couple, Pat, Celeste and their staff are the ones who make the Wesbrooke live up to its tagline: “Our Home is Your Home.”

Senior living options include:

· Junior studios

· Studios

· 1-bedrooms

· 2-bedrooms

Woodopolis began selling and installing flooring seven years ago. Three years later, the company expanded its focus to include bathroom renovations, according to Zhang.

article continues below

“We just found there was no company locally that concentrated on bathroom renovations,” she says, adding there were no showrooms in Maple Ridge that displayed bathroom fixtures such as vanities and freestanding tubs.

The family business gathered a team of licensed and insured remodelling technicians to take on renovations in the area, with many appreciative clients posting positive reviews online after hiring Woodopolis to improve their bathrooms.

Zhang, who has an eye for design, guides clients through the process of choosing a look for the bathroom that is both relaxing and unique to their tastes.

Zhang walks them through each step, helping them choose the right elements for the space.

“From picking the colour to the materials, it's important to get it right,” she says.

Fixtures like a vanity can really establish the look of a bathroom. Woodopolis provides modern vanities with matching mirrors, quartz or marble countertops and an undermount sink, through the company’s subsidiary, Modern Bathworks. They also include matching faucets and handles.

Modern Bathworks carries the latest trends in skirted and freestanding tubs, faucets, and more, focusing on contemporary fixtures for clients’ homes.

Woodopolis also offers a variety of looks when it comes to other aspects of the bathroom, such as their selection of glass shower doors, for walk-in or bathtub showers.

While knowing how you want a washroom to look is important, clients should also know why they’re renovating.

For some, it’s because they’re tired of the look of the room and want something new, according to Zhang. But for others, it is because of the damp climate in the Lower Mainland, and its effect on building interiors.

“A lot of times, I go to customers' homes and there's already mould,” Zhang says. “That's the time you definitely do that renovation. It's not just about looks, it's a house problem. It's definitely not healthy when you have mould in the home.”

Those interested in making changes to their bathroom can drop by the showroom at Woodopolis Home Centre, or even request a quote online.

The Modern Bathworks showroom is located within Woodopolis Home Centre, at 21280 Lougheed Hwy. in Maple Ridge. For more information on Woodopolis’ bathroom renovation services, go to their website or email them.",[]

People who are using a car for business or who like to trade in their vehicles at regular intervals are ideally suited to leasing, but there are many other benefits to leasing that might make it right for you, too.

We touched base with Westwood Honda in Port Moody for a list of some of the benefits of leasing. We’ve listed the top 5 here:

article continues below

1. Because lease payments are applied to the vehicles depreciation, not the purchase price, monthly lease payments are generally lower than most car loan payments, and tax is calculated on the lease payment, not the total value of the car.

2. With a predetermined ownership period, leasing means owners can trade in vehicles more frequently – which means they can drive a new car more frequently.

3. While leasing customers sign up for a predetermined number of kilometres driven per year, most agreements allow drivers to purchase additional kilometres if needed, and most allowances are more than enough for most drivers.

4. If your needs change over the course of the lease, or you decide you’d like to try a different vehicle, it is possible to exit a lease early. Just like a vehicle loan, a lease can be paid out and a new one started. A very high percentage of our leases tend to ‘trade up’ before the end of the lease as their needs change.

5. In most cases, a leased vehicle is covered by the manufacturer’s warranty for the duration of the lease, giving you piece of mind.

If you’re debating whether to lease or buy your next vehicle, consider the benefits of leasing, particularly if you plan on using your vehicle for work or if you really like driving the latest model.

For more helpful information about the benefits of leasing a new vehicle, visit Westwood Honda online at www.westwoodhonda.com or on Facebook or Twitter, call them at 1 (877) 290-8933or visit them at 2400 Barnet Highway in Port Moody.",[]
631,tricitynews,https://www.tricitynews.com/standout/4-non-toxic-sunscreen-lines-to-try-this-summer-1.23378758,4 non-toxic sunscreen lines to try this summer,['Lise Boullard'],,"Over the last couple of years, I've experienced some health concerns that have inspired me to pay more attention to the products I use in my home, and on my face, hair and body. But one of the challenges I’ve come across with non-toxic products is that what I gain in natural ingredients, I often lose in effectiveness. (It took much trial and error to finally find a natural deodorant that works, and now I’m hooked on Sola). I’m a huge fan of SPF for its melanoma- and wrinkle-preventing properties (I wear at least SPF 15 on my face year-round), but up until now I haven’t come across a non-toxic sunscreen line that is free of harsh chemicals.

When it comes to evaluating whether a product is safe to put on my skin and hair, I use the Environmental Working Group’s Skin Deep database. I simply type in the name of the product and the database provides a rating from 1 to 10 (1 being the least toxic and 10 being the most).

article continues below

Dr. Mark Lupin of Cosmedica in Victoria says when shopping for a non-toxic sunscreen or sunblock you should look for a formula that uses mineral active ingredients such as zinc oxide and/or titanium dioxide, instead of the chemical filters oxybenzone, avobenzone, octisalate, octocrylene, homosalate and octinoxate included in most sunscreens on the market. Also, look for the words ""Broad Spectrum” on the sunscreen label as this indicates that, in addition to UVB protection represented by the SPF rating, the product also protects from UVA rays which can contribute to skin cancer and premature aging.

Here are four non-toxic suncare brands I recommend trying this summer:

1) Beautycounter, the skincare and makeup line known for its commitment to using non-toxic ingredients, has just launched a line of non-toxic suncare products for body and face formulated with non-nano zinc oxide and antioxidant-rich California Poppy. Most of the products boast EWG ratings of 1 and are available in mist, lotion and stick formulas, perfect for the whole family to use.

2) Vancouver-based natural product brand A Healthy Beginning makes a zinc oxide-based SPF 25 Whipped Mineral Sun Butter which contains raspberry seed oil to boost sun protection and hydrate the skin. All ingredients have a low EWG rating, the product packaging uses minimal plastic, and the butter can be used on the face and body (and is perfect for kids, too).

3) Josie Maran loves her argan oil and she makes a beautifully scented, chemical-free facial oil that protects with an SPF of 47, and is available at Sephora.

4) Also available at Sephora with EWG ratings between 1 and 3 is Coola's range of non-toxic SPF products which includes a White Tea Face Sport SPF 50 and an SPF 30 Sunscreen Spray Pina Colada.

Whichever sunscreen you choose, be sure to apply 30 minutes before sun exposure, reapplying every two hours, and after swimming.

“I wanted to give our neighbourhood something to do for an hour that would be a bit of a reprieve during this stay-at-home period we’re all in right now,” said Black, who placed second in the recent Youth Talent Search BC competition.

“Then I started hearing about the growing number of people who were relying on our local Food Banks because of the virus, and that’s when I thought if we live streamed the show we could turn it into a fundraiser.”

The show will begin live streaming at 4 p.m. on Instagram, accessed through Black’s profile @daniblack.music. Anyone looking to donate to the food bank can do so through a GoFundMe campaign found here.

“Every dollar we raise will go to the Food Bank, and we have also received pledges to match the dollars raised on GoFundMe, so any donations will multiply,” said Black in a press release.

Filming was shot in two PoCo businesses last year, Samz Pub and In a Wink Beautique. The City of Port Coquitlam confirms the shoot was March 5-7, 2019.

Those businesses, both temporarily closed due to COVID-19, were featured in an episode for the series based on the Virgin River book series by Robyn Carr.

Samz, a popular establishment in downtown Port Coquitlam, appears as a pub visited by Melinda and Jack/ In a Wink Beautique plays a hairdressing salon, according to tourismvancouver.com.

The Netflix series aired in December, 2019, according to IMBD.com and features 10 episodes, with another season in the works.

The show stars Alexandra Breckenridge, Martin Henderson, and Tim Matheson, among others.

Tri-City actors and locations are becoming more well-known to the film-going audience, with numerous shows being filmed in around the area.

Coquitlam child actor Glen Gordon is playing a supporting role in The Main Event, which launched recently on Netflix.

But this time is something special.

“I sat down and saw a rough cut with my family,” said Gordon. “It was awesome.”

Coquitlam child actor Glen Gordon will star in a new Netflix movie airing Friday, April 10. - Submitted

The movie, titled The Main Event, launches on Netflix Friday (April 10) and features a diverse cast of friends, including lead actor Seth Carr, who played the young super-villain Killmonger in the Black Panther. The band of friends also includes Japanese-Canadian actress Momona Tamada of Abbotsford and Indian-American child actor Aryan Simhadri.

On screen, the four friends support each other, helping Carr’s character deal with his new powers that make him “super-fast and crazy strong,” and which launch the aspiring wrestler into a competition to become the next WWE superstar.

“It’s kind of like Thor in that [the ancient mask] chooses the most worthy people and gives them superpowers,” he said. “We support him and help him learn, figure out his powers.”

But Gordon told The Tri-City News the friendship didn’t end there.

“We all became best friends in real life, even the bullies,” he said.

When asked what scenes stood out to him most, Gordon singled out some of the wrestling scenes, one where he performs a “new school” hip hop dance routine and another in which “the bullies” get strung up by their underwear on school lockers.

“They were all held up by harness. They basically stayed hung on the lockers for a few hours,” he said with a chuckle.

As for what the future holds, the young Coquitlam actor said he’s looking forward to doing more recurring TV work, some voice-overs for animations, and maybe one day, moving to the other side of the camera.

“I definitely like the behind the camera stuff too. A dream of mine is to be a director and director of photography,” he said.

Of course, like most industries, many productions have been put on hold as the COVID-19 pandemic grinds nearly all aspects of public life to a crawl.

His mother, Marnie Gordon, says he’s making the most of quarantine: Gordon has kept himself busy doing virtual dance classes with Coquitlam’s Pulse Dance Centre and has been taking part in daily online acting classes for teens and adults run by a coach on the Sunshine Coast.

“It’s a big break, but he wants to keep his skills up. It’s time to work on extra things,” said Marnie Gordon.

But that break also means time to be a kid away from all the bright lights — doing puzzles, riding his bike and “doing his photography.”

“I really like landscapes,” Gordon said. “I biked all the way to Belcarra from downtown Coquitlam the other day. I could see all the way down Indian Arm. The mountains were still snowy. It was really cool.”",[]

As for the sale of items from the shows, Cotter said the pieces are now back in the hands of the exhibitors and can be purchased directly from the artists; PoMoArts is not taking a cut of the proceeds while the venue is shuttered.

Still, as the provincial health emergency continues, there will be more virtual opportunities for PoMoArts, Cotter said.

“We’ve got lots of ideas and we are working to see what we can do to honour our artists,” she said. “Right now, we’re operating day by day while we try to flatten the curve with this virus. It’s a learning curve for us, too.""

And pulling it off will be some trick.

Zander, 27, is the youngest president of the International Brotherhood of Magicians (IBM), which comprises more than 13,000 magicians in 88 countries.

And like him, most are in lockdown, their live performances cancelled, their audiences hunkered in their own homes.

It’s times like these, Zander said, that magic is needed more than ever. His passion and profession has a history of toughing it out through world wars and economic hardships like the Great Depression.

“We are the entertainers of the world,” Zander said. “If we can’t put a smile on people’s face, then we’re doing it wrong.”

So every night, at 6 p.m.(PDT), magicians from all over the world are gathering for one hour on Facebook Live to share ideas with one another, teach and learn new tricks, and pull back the curtain on some of their secrets.

The virtual gatherings will continue nightly until Sunday — and the public is invited.

“Sharing the wonders of live entertainment is really important,” Zander said. “It adds an extra dimension.”

The IBM has also launched a directory of live virtual magic shows being put on by individual performers on its website, magician.org. Zander said he expects even more of his peers to put their acts online as restrictions on movement escalate.

And he said magicians, by their nature, love to share their craft.

“Magicians are giving folks,” Zander said. “To keep going is always important.”

While going online will help satisfy that need, it doesn’t approach the satisfaction of performing to an in-person audience where magicians are able to feed off their reactions and wonderment.

“Magic is one of those arts that does necessitate a crowd,” Zander said, adding the Facebook Live platform allows for limited audience reaction, such as ThumbsUp and comments in real time.

And who knows, logging in to find some magic in the current uncertainty may uncover a hidden talent, Zander said.

“Sometimes the reality is, the greatest talent is borne from the greatest difficulties,” he said. “If Harry Houdini was able to do a double escape from a straight jacket, we can escape this.”

And Nicholas Bradbury, a graduate of the Traditional Learning Academy in Coquitlam, was set to take on Lefou — Gaston’s sidekick.

For Hello, Dolly!, Centennial secondary graduate Tessa Trach was cast as Mrs. Irene Malloy, another lead role for her after last spring’s Singin’ in the Rain with the Royal City Musical Theatre, in New Westminster.

And Daniel Curalli, who is on faculty at Coquitlam’s Place des Arts and recently wrapped up playing Donkey in Align Entertainment’s Shrek: The Musical, was to be in the Dolly ensemble.

“Cancellation of the 2020 productions is one way we can prioritize the safety of our audiences, artists, crews, staff and volunteers while supporting our city and those working on the front lines to help flatten the curve,” the TUTS board wrote in a news release last Thursday.

Ask them what goes good with it and many will say butter.

So I thought it would be fun to show you how to make your own butter. It’s not difficult when using a stand mixer, as I did.

article continues below

You whip whipping cream until it breaks into butter and buttermilk. The butter is formed into a ball and squeezed, submerged in cold water, to remove any additional buttermilk. The butter is then drained and seasoned with salt, if desired.

Two cups of whipping cream will yield about one cup of butter. It will also leave behind about one cup of buttermilk, which is conveniently needed for my soda bread recipe.

If you don’t have a stand mixer, but do have strong arms or many family members who can help you shake, you could start making the butter in a one-litre jar. Put the whipping cream in the jar and shake, shake, shake until it eventually breaks into butter and buttermilk. Now finish the butter as described in the recipe.

If butter’s not your thing, try today’s other recipe for yogurt cheese, which can be spread on such things as bread, bagels, crostini and crackers.

Homemade Butter

Tasty homemade butter you can spread on anything requiring it, such as slices of soda bread. It also yields about one cup of buttermilk, an ingredient needed for the bread.

Preparation time: a few minutes, plus mixing time

Cooking time: None

Makes: about 1 cup butter

1 (500 mL) container whipping cream (see Note)

1/4 tsp salt (optional)

Set a colander in a bowl and set it aside for now.

Pour cream into a stand mixer fitted with the whipping attachment. Whip cream on medium speed (I used the number 5 setting on my Kitchen Aid) until medium peaks form, about four minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula. Put on your mixer’s splatter guard, if it has one.

Increase speed to medium-high (I used the number 8 setting). Whip cream until it breaks into butter and buttermilk, about six to 12 minutes. The cream will make sloshing sounds just before that happens.

Put the butter clung to the whipping attachment in the colander. Set a sieve over a 2-cup measuring cup or other vessel and pour and strain the buttermilk into it.

Add any butter in the sieve to butter in the colander. Cover and refrigerate buttermilk until ready to use for the soda bread or other use.

Press butter in the colander into a ball. Fill the bowl with ice-cold water, and then squeeze the butter to remove most of buttermilk left in it, about one minute.

Lift butter out of the water, drain on paper towel and then set in a clean bowl. Mix salt, if using, into the butter.

The butter is now ready. Form it into a brick, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until needed. You could also store the butter in a fancy bowl or jar, or mold it. The butter, refrigerated, should keep a month, but you’ll likely devour it well before that.

Note: I tested this recipe with Island Farms brand whipping cream, and also Avalon Dairy brand organic whipping cream. The latter turned to butter much quicker than the former, which is why the recipe method gives a range on how long it will take to whip the cream into butter.

Buttermilk Soda Bread

Hearty, yeast-free bread you can use for sandwiches, or serve with cheese, stews and soups.

Preparation time: 15 minutes

Cooking time: 35 to 40 minutes

Makes: one, about seven-inch round loaf

2 cups all-purpose flour, plus some for kneading and shaping

2 tsp baking powder

1/2 tsp baking soda

1/2 tsp salt

1 tsp granulated sugar

1/4 cup cold butter, cut into small cubes

1 cup buttermilk (see Note)

Preheat oven to 375 F. Place 2 cups flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and sugar in a bowl and whisk to combine. Add butter and with your fingers, two forks or a pastry cutter, work into the flour mixture until thoroughly distributed.

Mix in buttermilk until loose dough forms. Turn dough on to a lightly floured work surface. Lightly flour your hands, and then gently knead and shape the dough, which should still be a little sticky, into a 6-inch round, about 2-inch thick, disc. Set on a non-stick or parchment paper-lined baking sheet.

Cut a shallow cross on the top of the loaf. Bake in the middle of the oven for 35 to 40 minutes, until loaf springs back when gently touched in the centre.

Note: If using buttermilk leftover from the butter recipe, if you don’t have exactly one cup, simply top up with regular milk until you do.

Eric’s options: Replace 1 cup of the all-purpose flour with 1 cup whole wheat flour. To make buttermilk cheese soda bread, after adding the butter to the flour mixture, mix in one cup grated cheddar cheese. Now finish bread as described in the recipe.

Yogurt Cheese

Here’s a tangy, easy to make, soft-cream-cheese-like mixture you can spread on sandwiches, bagels, crostini or crackers. If spread on the latter two items, make appetizing bites by also topping them with items that compliment the cheese’s taste, such as tapenade, cured meats, smoked salmon or roasted peppers.

Preparation time: a few minutes, plus draining time

Cooking time: None

Makes: about 3/4 cup

1 cup thick Greek-style yogurt (see Note)

• salt, to taste

1 Tbsp chopped fresh herbs, such as chives, parsley, oregano, basil, tarragon and/or dill, or to taste (optional)

Set a fine sieve over a bowl and line with two sheets of cheesecloth. Or, line a coned-shaped, drip coffee maker with a paper filter and set in a bowl. Spoon yogurt into the sieve or filter. Cover with plastic wrap, refrigerate, and let yogurt drain 24 to 36 hours, until like spreadable cream cheese in texture

Transfer yogurt cheese to a bowl and season with salt and chopped fresh herbs, if using.

Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. It will keep about a week, depending on yogurt’s best before date.

Note: I used Liberté brand, two per cent Greek-style yogurt when testing this recipe.

647,tricitynews,https://www.tricitynews.com/entertainment/eric-akis-chicken-sandwich-japanese-style-1.24154475,"Eric Akis: Chicken sandwich, Japanese style",['Eric Akis'],,"Chicken katsu is a Japanese-style panko-coated piece of fried chicken that’s become a popular dish around the world. It’s easy to understand why — it’s crispy on the outside, juicy in the middle and served with a flavourful sauce (or two).

It’s essentially a breaded chicken cutlet that could be sliced and served with side dishes. But in recent years, it’s also become a very popular thing to stuff into a sandwich, what I did in today’s recipe.

article continues below

To make my sandwiches, large, boneless, skinless chicken thighs are pounded until fairly thin. They are coated in flour, dipped into a beaten egg mixture, then thickly coated with panko, coarse Japanese-style breadcrumbs.

In restaurants, the chicken katsu is often deep-fried once coated. But in my recipe, I opted to shallow-fry it in oil in a skillet until golden, crispy and cooked through.

Many recipes for chicken katsu sandwiches ask you to use a soft style of sliced white bread — something you can easily bite through to get to the flavourful chicken inside.

I instead chose to use a tender hamburger bun, which I find yields a more attractive-looking sandwich.

That said, you likely wouldn’t be looking at the sandwich long before devouring it. That’s because the chicken is flavoured with two addictive sauces. One is a fresh ginger-flavoured mayo that you spread on the cut sides of the buns.

The other is tonkatsu sauce, a kind of Japanese-style barbecue sauce that you drizzle on the chicken. You can buy that sauce at Japanese food stores and in the Asian-foods aisle of some grocery stores, but I made my own simple version.

You can coat the chicken and make the sauces many hours before cooking the chicken and making the sandwiches. Keep everything refrigerated until needed. You could also do the same with the cucumber and radish quick pickles I served with the sandwiches.

Chicken Katsu Sandwiches

Japanese-style chicken that’s crunchy on the outside and juicy in the middle stuffed into buns with two flavourful sauces and refreshing lettuce. The panko needed for the chicken is sold in grocery stores, often in the Asian-foods aisle.

Preparation time: 40 minutes

Cooking time: Six minutes

Makes: Four servings

For ginger mayo (see Eric’s options)

1/2 cup mayonnaise

1 tsp finely grated fresh ginger

2 tsp soy sauce

2 tsp rice or cider vinegar

1 tsp granulated sugar or honey, or to taste

1/2 tsp sesame oil

Combine ingredients in a small bowl. Cover and refrigerate until needed.

For tonkatsu sauce

3 Tbsp ketchup

1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce

1 tsp soy sauce

1/2 tsp granulated sugar or honey

Combine ingredients in a small bowl (see Eric’s options). Cover and refrigerate until needed.

For chicken katsu sandwiches

4 large boneless, skinless chicken thighs (about 325 to 350 grams)

• salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

2 large eggs

1/4 cup milk

1/3 cup all-purpose flour

1 3/4 cups panko

• vegetable oil, for frying

4 tender hamburger buns, split and warmed

1 cup shredded head or leaf lettuce, or to taste

Set a chicken thigh flat on a work surface, smooth-side-down. Cover with a double layer of plastic wrap. Using a kitchen hammer, pound chicken until it’s about 1/4-inch thick, then set on a plate (see Eric’s options). Pound the other chicken thighs this way. Season the chicken with salt and pepper.

Place eggs and milk in a bowl large enough to dunk the chicken in and beat to combine. Place flour and panko in separate wide plates. Set out a baking sheet to set the chicken on once coated.

Coat one chicken thigh in flour. Dip it in the egg mixture, evenly coating it. Coat chicken in panko, thickly pressing it on. Set coated chicken on the baking sheet. Coat the remaining chicken thighs in this fashion.

Preheat oven to 225 F. Set out a second large baking sheet. Pour 1/4 inch or so of oil into a large skillet set over medium, medium-high heat.

When oil is hot, add two of the chicken katsu to the skillet and cook about three minutes per side, until golden and cooked through. (Keep a close eye on the chicken and lower the heat if it overly darkens as it cooks.)

Drain chicken katsu on paper towel, then set on the second clean baking sheet.

Cook the other two chicken katsu as you did the first two and set them on the baking sheet. Put chicken into the oven to keep warm.

Spread the cut sides of each bun generously with the ginger mayo. Top each bottom bun with some shredded lettuce.

Remove chicken katsu from the oven and, at a slight angle, cut each one, widthwise, in half. Now set two half pieces of chicken katsu on each bottom bun. Drizzle chicken katsu with the tonkatsu sauce. Set on top buns and serve.

Eric’s options: For spicy tonkatsu sauce, add sriracha or other spicy chili sauce, to taste.

If you don’t have a kitchen hammer, try using the bottom of a heavy skillet or rolling pin to pound the chicken thighs.

Cucumber and Radish Quick Pickles

Easy and quick sweet and tangy pickles you can serve with the chicken katsu sandwiches.

Preparation time: 15 minutes, plus salting time

Cooking time: A few minutes

Makes: About 1 1/2 cups

3/4 cup water

3 Tbsp rice or cider vinegar

2 tsp granulated sugar

1 cup thinly sliced radishes (see Note)

1 cup thinly sliced mini English cucumbers

1 tsp salt

Place water, vinegar and sugar in a small pot. Bring to a simmer over medium heat for 30 seconds, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Remove from the heat and cool vinegar mixture to room temperature.

Meanwhile, place radishes and cucumber in a fine sieve. Sprinkle with the salt and toss to coat the vegetables. Set sieve over a bowl or sink and let stand at room temperature 30 minutes.

When the 30 minutes are up, rinse the vegetables with cold water, drain well, then pat dry with paper towel. Place the vegetables in a two-cup jar. Pour in the vinegar mixture. Push on the vegetables to submerge them. Cover and refrigerate pickle until ready to serve with the chicken katsu sandwiches.

Note: About two mini cucumbers and 10 radishes, depending on size, should yield the amounts needed here.

Halibut, salmon, albacore tuna, ling cod, crab, sablefish, oysters, clams and mussels are just some of the tasty choices we have and there’s much to celebrate about that.

But for many seafood lovers in this province, the party hits its peak when spot prawns are in season. This year’s fishery began in early June and according to Mike Atkins, Executive Director of Pacific Prawn Fishermen’s Association, will likely last four to six weeks.

article continues below

Although you can buy good quality frozen spot prawns year round, they really are at their best when ultra fresh. They have sweet tasting, almost buttery, succulent meat and part of their allure is that they are only available for a few weeks each year. So when you do have them you really appreciate their fine flavour and recognize what a treat they are.

Despite their name, spot prawns are the largest of the shrimp species commercially harvested off the B.C. coast. They are named after the distinctive white spots you’ll find on their tails.

You are most likely to find spot prawns for sale at stand-alone seafood stores and, occasionally, at some supermarkets, depending on availability. In some coastal locations you can also buy them direct from the fisher.

Depending on where you buy them, you’ll see fresh spot prawn tails with their heads removed, and whole live or recently live spot prawns for sale.

When buying spot prawn tails, choose bright-looking, firm tails that have few or no black spots and smell of the sea. It’s best to cook fresh spot-prawn tails the day you purchase them. But, if they are very fresh and you keep them well chilled on a bed of ice in the refrigerator, you could store them for one day or maybe two.

According to information on the Pacific Prawn Fishermen’s Association website, bcprawns.ca, when buying live spot prawns, look for lively, almost translucent specimens. The tail should be straight in line with the head, and the head should be firm to the touch.

When going out to buy live prawns, bring a cooler with ice in it to put them in for the ride home. Once home, refrigerate them until ready to cook.

Don’t leave live or recently live prawns for more than a few hours before cooking them or removing the heads. Spot prawns have an enzyme that will permeate into the tail and causes their quality to deteriorate quickly. You’ll know the prawns have started to deteriorate if the head is showing a black colour and is soft or mushy when touched, an unappealing quality the meat will also have.

If you need to store the prawns for more than a few hours, you can remove the heads by swiftly turning and pulling them away from the tails. After the heads are removed, the tails should be thoroughly rinsed and, as noted above, kept refrigerated until ready to cook.

Spot prawns can be prepared in ways similar to other large shrimp and prawns. I used them in an aromatic, colourful and tasty Cajun-style sheet pan dinner for two.

Spot Prawn Sheet Pan Dinner for Two

Here’s a nicely spiced, peel-and-eat, Cajun-style way to prepare B.C. spot prawns that sees them cooked on a sheet pan with bits of sausage, potatoes, onions and peppers. For a filling meal, serve with cornbread or corn on the cob.

Preparation time: 25 minutes

Cooking time: 23 to 27 minutes

Makes: two servings

8 to 10 B.C. nugget potatoes, halved

3 Tbsp olive oil

2 Tbsp lemon juice

1 large garlic clove, minced

1 1/2 tsp paprika

1 1/2 tsp oregano

1/2 tsp dried thyme

• freshly ground black pepper, to taste

1 tsp hot pepper sauce, such as Tabasco, or to taste

14 to 16 whole live spot prawns, or spot prawn tails (see Eric’s options)

1 cured (about 5-inch long) chorizo or other tasty sausage, sliced (see Note)

1/2 medium onion, sliced

1/2 medium red bell pepper, sliced

1/2 medium green bell pepper, sliced

• sea salt, to taste

• chopped fresh parsley, to taste

• lemon slices, for garnish

• remoulade sauce (optional, see recipe)

Boil potatoes until just tender, about eight to 10 minutes. Drain well, set on a large plate and cool to room temperature.

Preheat oven 400 F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper, unless it’s non-stick.

Combine oil, lemon juice, garlic, paprika, oregano, thyme, black pepper and hot pepper sauce in a large bowl. Add prawns, sausage, cooked potatoes, onions and bell peppers and use a spatula to toss and coat them with the oil mixture.

Set prawns, sausage and vegetables on the baking sheet, spreading them out so that they sit in a single layer. Drizzle any oil mixture left in the bowl over them and then sprinkle lightly with salt.

Roast the sheet pan dinner 15 to 17 minutes, or until the prawns are cooked and sizzling. Sprinkle with parsley, garnish with lemon slices and, if desired, serve with remoulade sauce.

Note: Ready-to-eat chorizo sausages are sold at supermarkets, butcher and charcuterie shops and European-style delis.

Eric’s options: The prawns used in today’s recipe came from Oak Bay Seafood (oakbayseafood.com). No matter where you shop, it’s best to call ahead to see if they are stocking spot prawns that day. When spot prawns are not available, simply use another type of wild prawn tail in this recipe.

Remoulade Sauce

Here’s a tangy southern-style sauce that you can dollop alongside the prawns and other items in the sheet pan dinner once plated.

Preparation time: five minutes

Cooking time: None

Makes: about 1/2 cup

1/3 cup mayonnaise

1 Tbsp finely chopped sweet mixed pickles or sweet green relish

2 tsp fresh lemon juice

1 tsp capers, finely chopped

1 tsp Dijon mustard

1 tsp chopped fresh parsley

• pinch dried tarragon and paprika

1/4 tsp hot pepper sauce, such as Tabasco, or to taste

Combine ingredients in a small bowl. Cover and refrigerate until needed for the sheet pan dinner.

While hundreds of people could be employed in positions relating to the games and hubs — such as security jobs, rink staff, food services and hotel housekeeping — the financial benefit of two bubble communities under tight seal would be ""modest"" at best, suggested Bank of Montreal chief economist Douglas Porter.

article continues below

""When you think of how many tourists would normally be in Toronto during peak tourist season, I'm quite sure this is less than one per cent,"" he said.

""The reality is, it's not going to move the needle.""

But Porter, a lifelong hockey fan, said he anticipates a ""reasonably meaningful positive"" morale boost to Canadian sports fans who've been eagerly anticipating players returning to the ice in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The games are slated to start Aug. 1 with six Canadian teams qualifying for the 24-team resumption of play. No fans will be in the seats.

Edmonton and Toronto were confirmed as the NHL's hub cities on Friday night.

""The fact that part of our world is getting back to some kind of normal will help reinforce the sense that things, generally, are moving in that direction and could help support the recovery,"" Porter said.

The gradual comeback of major sporting events has drawn plenty of interest in recent weeks, with debates raging over the risks of putting players back into the games, even if spectators aren't allowed in the facilities.

Further questions have been raised over whether rigorous testing is enough to prevent outbreaks within the isolated community, which could potentially throw the whole plan into a costly disarray.

Many of these factors make placing a value on hockey's return especially difficult.

Michael Naraine, a professor at Brock University in St. Catharines, Ont., said the largest amount of money is on the line at large corporations, which he said is driving the return of major sporting events.

""The primary revenue driver for sports is broadcasting,"" said the assistant professor of digital sport management and marketing.

""They need television advertisers come back. The league itself needs to gain its revenue from NBC and Sportsnet here in Canada.""

Politicians have preferred to emphasize the positive aspects of a deal with the NHL.

Alberta Premier Jason Kenney eagerly promoted Edmonton as the ultimate hub city for the hockey league, posting videos on Twitter that prominently featured the Rocky Mountains and other popular destinations in the province.

Naraine said those public expressions by leaders are more an attempt to ""pander"" to their constituents than actually drive any meaningful economic impact. He said this is especially the case in Edmonton.

""Having major events come to town allows them to beat their chests and say, 'We exist. We're on the map. Come look at us,'"" he said.

""But the fact that the hub city will be in Edmonton is no different than whether the hub city would be in Toronto or Vancouver or elsewhere. It's not going to significantly drive tourism all of a sudden.""

Patrick Rishe, a sports professor at Washington University in St. Louis, said he sees value in showcasing a lesser known Canadian city on broadcast television with ""beauty shots"" of the locale. He said it may also sit well with NHL executives.

""You never know,"" he said. ""Doing and serving a good deed for the league now, this could pay dividends down the road.""

Any semblance of a regular hockey season would be welcomed by Dana Parris, owner of the Lockeroom sports bar in Barrie, Ont.

Even though her business is over 100 kilometres away from downtown Toronto, she anticipates the excitement would reverberate to her customers.

""If we could have sports come back and we hit Stage 3 (of Ontario's COVID reopening plan) around the same time, I will probably stop crying myself to sleep,"" she said.

""If those two come together it's just going to be the most beautiful thing.""

For the third year in a row, the city has been recognized as a Top Employer in B.C. for 2020 by the editors of Canada's Top 100 Employers.

article continues below

This provincial designation identifies employers that lead their industries in offering exceptional places to work.

And the City of Coquitlam ticked the boxes in numerous areas to earn the recognition.

At the forefront is the city’s work culture that is shaped, in part, by its Leadership Development Program.

“This program helps people grow wherever they are,” says Nikki Caulfield, Coquitlam’s director of HR and corporate planning. “The City of Coquitlam is big enough and incorporates so many different careers that it gives us an interesting way for people to grow in the same organization.”

Coquitlam’s transition as a community, including the opening of the Evergreen line SkyTrain extension, has helped drive opportunities over the past number of years.

“We are one of the fastest-growing municipalities in B.C., and that provides a lot of opportunity in terms of employment, growth and development,” Caulfield explains.

Coquitlam’s unique workplace culture creates space for people beginning their careers, as well as more senior staff looking to take up challenges that allow them to stretch and apply their talents and experience.

“Providing those types of diverse opportunities is part of what makes a top employer,” Caulfield says. “I definitely think it’s one of the reasons we are viewed as one.”

“But at the end of the day, great people decide where they want to put their skills and experience to work. And we want to make sure Coquitlam is the place where they choose to be,” Caulfield says. “In order to do that, you need to have healthy workplace cultures in place that focus on peoples’ development, ensure they have interesting work, and allow them to be innovative.”

The City of Coquitlam’s culture encourages staff to be engaged in inventive city building by being part of a committed public service organization that provides learning development opportunities and challenging work, while at the same time making it fun and enjoyable.

“It’s one thing to know you work somewhere great, but it’s another thing to be recognized from the outside that you are part of a wonderful organization,” Caulfield says. “And city council and staff take great pride in not only being recognized as an innovative city, but as a great place to work.”

Despite close to five decades in the business, the Doctor of Audiology at Kennedy Hearing Centre in Coquitlam marvels at the instantaneous improvement his efforts can make.

article continues below

That’s why when he takes a vacation now, he’s never far from helping people in need.

For the past three years, Dr. Mistal and his wife Barbara have set up hearing clinics when they visit Mexico. On the most recent trip, they spent 11 days testing and fitting patients with devices.

“The people we see, they can’t afford the kind of treatment or equipment we can provide,” says Dr. Mistal. “And we’ve treated people from 96-years-old to, I think the youngest one we saw was eight.”

The majority attending the clinics are family and friends of employees at the local resorts where the Mistals stay.

“The resorts we go to make a point of giving back to their employees. They do things like providing English classes so a gardener can move up to become a housekeeper,” Dr. Mistal says. “So, when I saw they were providing that kind of help, I asked about giving assistance to those with hearing loss.”

Dr. Mistal collects the hearing aids - usually models that have been discontinued but are still in perfect working order. He performs the hearing tests, and his wife helps fit the patients with hearing aids.

“The effect this kind of help provides is like night and day,” Dr. Mistal says. “I had one older man come 14 hours by bus to see me. And when we were finished, he was overwhelmed by being able to now not be frustrated by having to ask people to repeat what they said to him.”

“I also had a little girl who had close to a 60 per cent hearing loss. I was a little concerned about how much we could help her. But once she got the hearing aids she was immediately telling all of her friends.”

It’s those types of immediate successes which made Dr. Mistal choose audiology.

Canada has become known as a welcoming country for immigrants who want to invest their talents here. In fact, it has made a goalto receive 350,000 new arrivals annually by 2021.

“We are 40 million people and yet we don’t have enough people living here to fulfill all the opportunities for growth,” says Rachel Gary, COO of Canada Direct. “The Canadian government is giving people the chance to have a good life here but there is the expectation that you contribute to the economy as well.”

Canada uses a points system as part of its immigration process. Factors such as work experience, education and English or French language skills are considered here. These points can begin to be accumulated in an applicant’s home country before their arrival in Canada.

Here’s how the process works at Canada Direct:

1) When you reach out to us for help, one of the team members will take you through a questionnaire to determine your qualifications.

2) Next, we will send an assessment report to one of Canada Direct’s regulated Canadian immigration consultants.

Education is an important factor when it comes to eligibility. Generally, bachelor and master’s degrees from other countries will be accepted but a post-secondary from a technical school may not be.

In some cases, Canada Direct will recommend that applicants upgrade their education. Gary says that in many Central American countries, a person can have management experience without a university degree. It’s not that they’re not educated; rather, the level of education is not as stringent a job requirement as it is in Canada.

If they want to continue working in their field, Gary suggests that they come to Canada on a student visa and study to get their university degree or college diploma. Canada Direct can also get them a work visa that allows them to earn both an income and more points for immigration.

Age is also a factor when it comes to immigration applications. So those who are 35 and older, and have only a high school diploma will likely find the process more challenging. But it’s not impossible, Gary says.

If you find yourself up against these barriers to immigration, you may want to consider moving to a Canadian province such as Manitoba, which is the most lenient when it comes to eligibility criteria and doesn’t require applicants to pass an English language test. You could also apply for a student visa, no matter what your age. This allows you to upgrade your qualifications so that you can continue working in your field.

But too much cardio is too much of a good thing, according to the owner of a local fitness studio.

“People often hit the treadmill when they want to lose a few pounds,” says Sam Noh, owner of Eagle Ridge Fitness in Port Moody.

article continues below

Unfortunately, the weight they’re losing isn’t always the right kind.

“When somebody’s trying to lose weight, they do a lot of cardio,” he says. “Yeah, that’ll help you lose weight, but what does that mean? It can be weight from fat or it can be weight from muscle.”

We all lose muscle tone as we age, he says. If you only do cardio workouts, you’ll lose even more muscle tone, and that affects your metabolism.

Any exercise is good for you, in general, but it depends on what your goals are. According to Noh, if you’re only trying to lose weight, it’s best to vary your workout, with less emphasis on cardio, not more.

“A perfect program would have strength training, a little bit of cardio, and flexibility and stability training,” he says.

It’s also important to do workouts you enjoy, otherwise you’ll lose your motivation.

Of course, different people have different needs. A marathon runner, for instance, needs to do lots of cardio. And older adults should focus on resistance training, because it’s good for the bones.

There isn’t just one right type of exercise, Noh says. Healthy living requires a balance. Some people are afraid of trying strength training, because there are so many exercise options and machines. Women in particular worry that strength training will make them bigger. But this is a misconception.

“Itcan be intimidating and overwhelming,” Noh says of strength training. “That’s why it’s important to find the right person to teach you the proper techniques.”

Remember that strength training – like resistance training, flexibility training and cardio workouts – is important if you want to lose weight and maintain good health.

But, as resilient as they are, the experience can be devastating for a small child.

BC Quake Premium Survival Supplies is a local, family-run emergency-preparedness company that offers complete survival kits to help families cope in the aftermath of an earthquake or other natural disaster. While the kits include items such as blankets, shelter, water purifying tablets, and nutritional bars that are suitable for the whole family, a few extra provisions will help make your little one's life more comforting and secure during those crucial 72 hours.

Sufficient water

Water is one of the body's essential nutrients and, while we can live as long as six weeks without food, water is needed to keep the body functioning and to stave off dehydration. The daily amount of water a child needs depends on the age, weight, and gender, but a general guideline would be five to 11 cups of water per day. Multiply that by 3 days, add enough for yourself and extra for cooking. If you run out, BC Quake Premium Survival Supplieswater-purifying tablets will help make water from streams or other sources safe for drinking.

Tasty food

Each of BC Quake Premium Survival Supplies survival kits come with nutritious food bars, but while adults will appreciate the nutritional value despite the lack of cordon bleu taste, children probably won't. Tempting kids to eat can be a chore at the best of times; tempting a scared and stressed little one to eat a nutritional bar that tastes like cardboard will be difficult. Make sure to add some dry boxed food, like mac and cheese or dehydrated complete meals to keep them nourished.

Comfort items

Small children in particular will be confused and scared during and after an earthquake. Make sure to pack a favourite toy or blanket as part of any survival kit. Having something loved and familiar will help ease the stress.

Kisses and cuddles

While these can't necessarily be packed into a survival kit, make sure there are plenty on hand during and after the earthquake. Keep reassuring the child that you will take care of them and that all will be well. Place them in a tent, or at least in a place where they are isolated from the chaos around them, and make sure they stay warm, dry, and hydrated.

“Lattes were a fairly new concept on the West Coast back then,” he says. “I’ve always had a love of drinking coffee, so we styled the café portion of the hair salon after a coffee shop. It has become a big part of what we’re known for – serving great coffee with fantastic looks.”

Barely into his mid-twenties, Blair had a dream of owning his own business.

“I had been in the hairstyling trade and I saw this opportunity to open up my own business. I had a vision to open up a casual, friendly hair salon.”

Blair found a location and started with just him and five empty salon chairs.

“I had lots of room to grow,” he laughs. “I renovated the space myself, bought some equipment, and worked six days a week for the first two years.”

Thanks to a good business acumen and a love of customer service, Eclipps Hair Café grew in size and reputation.

“I was determined that people should be able to get an amazing look while having a great experience in the process.”

After four years, Blair moved his then team of six stylists from Eclipps’ original 1,000-square-foot location to its present day location.

“As soon as TD saw what we were doing here at Evergreen and the great quality of entertainment that David Mann brings in, they were pretty excited to say yes and give us the major support,” Andrea Jabour, a representative at the cultural centre, said about the new venture.

The partnership is between one of the leading hubs for arts and entertainment in Coquitlam and TD Canada Trust, an institution that is recognized for its investment in the arts. It is a prime example of what Jabour calls “creating some really great community partnerships -” and ones that promote music and culture, at that.

“When you align yourself with somebody who thinks the same way that you do,” Jabour said, “great things happen.”

Among these, are 11 shows including Acapella groups, Canadian composers and world class bands like the Good Lovelies, to name a few. Kicking off the season on Oct. 22 will be the Double Double Duo, an act with two internationally-acclaimed soloists – in the clarinet, piano and accordion – who come together in an unbridled musical coalescence.

Though, these “great things,” as Jabour said it, transcend far past this year’s musical line-up. “It’s not only about the monetary sponsorship that is important to us here, it’s about community-like minded partners helping us disseminate information and bringing everyone together through music.”

In addition to this new venture with TD Canada Trust, the Evergreen Cultural Centre is also enabled to do what they do with the help from other corporate sponsors, including Polygon Homes, Westminster Savings Union and Greenline Dental.

“These partnerships are important to us because, again, it’s all about creating some really good community partnerships, that, when they support us, say ‘you guys are doing some things that we want to be involved with,’” Jabour said. As a great proponent in music, TD Canada Trust is turning out to be a great fit.

But one of the challenges I’ve come across with non-toxic products is that what I gain in natural ingredients, I often lose in effectiveness. (It took much trial and error to finally find a natural deodorant that works, and now I’m hooked on Sola). I’m a huge fan of SPF for its melanoma- and wrinkle-preventing properties (I wear at least SPF 15 on my face year-round), but up until now I haven’t come across a non-toxic sunscreen line that is free of harsh chemicals.

When it comes to evaluating whether a product is safe to put on my skin and hair, I use the Environmental Working Group’s Skin Deep database. I simply type in the name of the product and the database provides a rating from 1 to 10 (1 being the least toxic and 10 being the most).

article continues below

Dr. Mark Lupin of Cosmedica in Victoria says when shopping for a non-toxic sunscreen or sunblock you should look for a formula that uses mineral active ingredients such as zinc oxide and/or titanium dioxide, instead of the chemical filters oxybenzone, avobenzone, octisalate, octocrylene, homosalate and octinoxate included in most sunscreens on the market. Also, look for the words ""Broad Spectrum” on the sunscreen label as this indicates that, in addition to UVB protection represented by the SPF rating, the product also protects from UVA rays which can contribute to skin cancer and premature aging.

Here are four non-toxic suncare brands I recommend trying this summer:

1) Beautycounter, the skincare and makeup line known for its commitment to using non-toxic ingredients, has just launched a line of non-toxic suncare products for body and face formulated with non-nano zinc oxide and antioxidant-rich California Poppy. Most of the products boast EWG ratings of 1 and are available in mist, lotion and stick formulas, perfect for the whole family to use.

2) Vancouver-based natural product brand A Healthy Beginning makes a zinc oxide-based SPF 25 Whipped Mineral Sun Butter which contains raspberry seed oil to boost sun protection and hydrate the skin. All ingredients have a low EWG rating, the product packaging uses minimal plastic, and the butter can be used on the face and body (and is perfect for kids, too).

3) Josie Maran loves her argan oil and she makes a beautifully scented, chemical-free facial oil that protects with an SPF of 47, and is available at Sephora.

4) Also available at Sephora with EWG ratings between 1 and 3 is Coola's range of non-toxic SPF products which includes a White Tea Face Sport SPF 50 and an SPF 30 Sunscreen Spray Pina Colada.

Whichever sunscreen you choose, be sure to apply 30 minutes before sun exposure, reapplying every two hours, and after swimming.

You pull out your smart phone, or another device, and search for the available WiFi sources.

article continues below

Who can blame you? We all want to stay in touch, look up information, or want to be entertained while you endure whatever lineup you’re mired in.

But stop and think for a second. Do you really trust that WiFi provider you’re allowing to hook up with you?

In fact, the majority of Canadians put their personal data at risk when they connect to a public WiFi service.

Alarmingly, 54 per cent of Canadians also don’t even know the difference between secure and unsecure wireless networks.

And another 64 per cent of Canadian Internet users don’t feel threatened about the privacy of their personal information on public WiFi.

PureVPN, a provider of Virtual Private Network, wants you to guard against having your private and personal information accessed and potentially misused when you join a public WiFi service.

Sure, some say they offer robust security measures. But cybercriminals can exploit public WiFi networks in several ways.

Rogue Access Points

As the name suggests, these access points are usually created by hackers and snoopers to catch unsuspecting users. These access points are usually malicious and allow hackers to compromise connected devices with ease.

MITM (Men in the Middle)Attacks

The name says it all as the hacker intercepts a wireless connection through different tactics. Once the breach has been made, the attack allows hackers to not only monitor the network traffic but also divert the traffic to malicious sites.

Evil Twins

Have you ever noticed at a café, restaurant, or a mall that your device shows two WiFis having similar names? This is what you call the Evil Twins. Cybercriminals create malicious hotspots under the disguise of a known network. Once users are connected to such hotspots, cybercriminals cannot only see your data but also steal it.

WiFi Password Cracking Tools

These tools allow just about anyone to crack WiFi passwords with great ease.

So, how can you protect yourself?

• Never open online bank accounts or shop from the Internet when you are connected to a public network or hotspot.

• Browse only those web services that are behind HTTPS protection. These websites encrypt every data or traffic request.

• Use trusted virtual private network services, like PureVPN, that offer robust encryption, optimal data authentication practices, and security protocols. PureVPN has received high ratings and positive reviews on many renowned platforms such as CNET, Trustpilot, etc. for its reliability and wide range of features.

• Try your best not to connect to free networks. Instead, try to use your data plan, which is much more protected than free hotspots.

Her aunt taught her how to hand sew when she was 10 and soon after, her mother taught her how to make clothing.

“I started sewing my own clothes when I was in Grade 5 and basically sewed everything that I wore until I started having kids,” she says.

She enjoyed other crafts such as knitting and cross-stitch, but she had not accomplished one particular goal – learning to quilt.

After Dr. Pearce had to take some time off for a surgery, she decided to try her hand at quilting while she was recuperating.

“I had all of these quilt squares that I had cross-stitched, but I didn't know how to put them together to make a quilt,” she says.

Dr. Pearce went to a local quilting store and asked for help with the basics. Once she started quilting, she loved it.

“I've made quilts for almost every chair at the office, so when the patients come in and lay down, they're not cold,” Dr. Pearce says. “They love the quilts; it makes the dental visit a little less clinical.”

The quilts provide comfort to patients and brighten up the office, but they also showcase Dr. Pearce’s abilities, both on an artistic and a professional level.

“When patients see the quilts at the office, I think they do get an understanding that I'm skilled with my hands,” Dr. Pearce says. “Quilting and suturing are both sewing. There's a crossover and for me there's a comfort with needles and thread.”

The practice of quilting helps her process her day and relax. She hopes some of the calmness she experiences while quilting is passed on to her patients through the fabric.

“Quilting is very meditative,” she says. “Making quilts is a very peaceful and healing process.”

We asked fashion expert Nancy Gattey of Port Coquitlam’s Creekside Fashions for some advice.

article continues below

“I really think that accessories are the icing on the cake,” she says. “They can make a basic outfit transform into something very special.”

Gattey suggests that if you’re on a budget, it’s a good idea to invest in some accessories because they can enable you to get a lot more mileage out of your wardrobe and create different looks just by adding a few different items.

For instance, if you’ve worn a little black dress to work you can go from day to evening in seconds. “Just by taking off thejacket and adding a nice pop of colour, a red clutch and some heels, you’re ready to go out for the evening.”

Today Gattey is wearing dark-wash skinny jeans, a grey T-shirt with a print and a grey casual blazer, which is pretty basic - on its own. Once she adds a beautiful scarf with pale blue and off-whites, and layers it with lustrous pearls in grey shades and slip-on black sneakers, her whole outfit come to life. “It just sort of gives it a much more polishedlook,” she says.

Of course with accessories, like anything in life, you must know where to draw the line.

“You have to find the right balance,” Gattey warns. “Don’t overdo it. Just pick a few statement items that will really make your outfit come alive.”

While seasonal colours and styles come and go, Gattey says fashion accessories - from jewelry and handbags to shoes and scarves - will always be the key element to putting together a memorable outfit for any occasion.

But it can also be challenging for buyers, particularly in a hot real estate market such as Vancouver and other areas of the Lower Mainland.

“When it comes to working with the buyer, the goal is generally to get them the best property at the best price,” says Card, a Realtor with Royal LePage West R.E.S. in Port Coquitlam.

article continues below

But depending on the market, the goal can change to winning the best home for a client in a multiple offer situation, he adds.

Despite the challenges, Realtors like Card try to make the process as easy as possible, meeting with clients and discussing everything that goes into it.

“It shouldn’t be some terrifying experience, it should be something that you enjoy,” Card says. “I discuss everything that goes into the home buying process from that initial meeting, to financing, to actually looking at homes, eventually making an offer, and everything that comes afterwards.”

Buying a home is a long-term investment, and it’s important the client is well informed before making a decision, he adds.

Card suggests clients bring a list of questions and, especially in the case of first-time home buyers, keep an open mind about the process, as they often have no idea what to expect.

“I tell them they’re in good hands and being taken care of,” Card says. “I try to leave them with as few worries as you can have when you’re in the process of buying a property.”

It’s important to find a buyer’s agent who stays in touch once the sale has gone through. Home buyers may have questions or concerns that come up once they move in, and a good real estate agent will stick around to address anything that arises, according to Card.

They also touch base with clients long afterwards, so that homeowners have someone they trust on hand when they’re ready to move again, five or 10 years down the road, he adds.

The individuals involved with making the bath bombs each contribute their own talents to the social enterprise. Some enjoy getting creative with the fanciful designs which range from hearts to rainbows, donuts and the very popular poop emoji bath bombs. (Yes, they even come with the emoji’s wide eyes.)

Others thrive on packaging the boutique gifts or going to Farmers’ Markets and community events to meet with customers.

“They all work very hard and are passionate about what they do,” says Miriam Hoolahan, CVS’s Manager of Communications. “It really is a business they’ve grown and made their own.”

DisDaBomb mindfully minimizes the number of ingredients, concentrating on all-natural products such as essential oils. Its milk-and-oatmeal bath bomb is good for sensitive skin, and there are also unscented options.

A new product DisDaBomb has just launched is Potty Bombs. Not only do they release a pleasant scent when they’re thrown into the toilet, but they also have ingredients that help cleanse and refresh.

Since one of the goals of CVS is to match individuals’ interests with meaningful employment, it also recently launched adVentures Dog Walking.

“It’s a win-win-win,” says Hoolahan.

It gives individuals who love dogs the opportunity to bond with their client’s pets and benefit from physical exercise. Accompanied by a staff member, the dog gets two-on-one attention, with only one dog at a time enjoying the time outside. Dog owners know their pet is being cared for by people who are trained and have a love for animals.

The community also benefits. The individuals who have created these businesses are paid a fair wage and contribute to the local economy. These social enterprises add to the mix of services that CVS offers which include adult day programs, employment support, shared living as well as children's respite, children's specialized residential and foster care.

1. Clean Your Dentures 3 Times Daily: Use a denture brush and soapy water to clean your dentures. Never use a toothbrush or toothpaste. Dish soap or an over-the-counter denture cleaner is the best option. Make sure you clean your dentures and your mouth after every meal.

article continues below

2. Soaking: Overnight soaking in water and/or a cleaning product will not only help keep your dentures fresh, it will give your mouth a rest. Always rinse your dentures before use, especially if a denture-soaking solution was used.

“We advise our patients not to sleep with their dentures in,” says Eroshevski. “Give your gums a little bit of a rest and you’ll sleep easier at night.”

3. Regular Denture Check-ups: Because dentures are prosthetics and your gums are living tissue, your dentures will remain the same while your gums will continue to change. This is one reason to schedule a check-up every six months. Other reasons include checking for wear and tear and checking to see if a reline or rebase is necessary.

4. Reline &Rebase:As your gums continue to change, you’ll need to have your dentures rebased or relined to fit more comfortably and retain their functionality. You should Rebase or Reline your dentures every two years. A reline is when new acrylic is added to the base layer of the denture to make the fit more comfortable. A rebase is the same as a reline, except that all of the denture base is removed and replaced with new acrylic.

5. Repairs: Dentures are delicate prosthetics. The gums section of the denture is made of acrylic, and the teeth are either acrylic (plastic) or porcelain. Bart Simpson’s playful use of his grandfather’s dentures would have destroyed them long before the end of the episode. Remember, if there’s a crack or chip in your dentures, you need to take them to your local denturist to be fixed. There aren’t any do-it-yourself solutions for repairing dentures.

6. Replace: You will likely need to replace your dentures every 5 years because your gums continue to change and because the dentures will lose their edge.

“We train our patients in the use of dentures,” says Eroshevski. “You have to adjust and train your mind to use them. They are very different from your natural teeth.”

He is the only producer with two songs in the Top 10 on the latter chart (""Say So"" sits at No. 2).

For his work with Cat, he used the alias Tyson Traxe. He used the same pseudonym for his production credit on Toronto rapper-singer Benny Mayne’s ""Hokey Pokey,"" released this year. For Lil Wayne’s ""Shimmy,"" a track featuring Cat on the deluxe edition of his latest album ""Funeral,"" Dr. Luke used the name Loctor Duke.

Label representatives for Saweetie, Juice WRLD, Lil Wayne and Cat didn’t immediately reply to emails seeking comment. Neither did a representative for Dr. Luke.

Luke has sprinkled his comeback among the major labels. Cat is signed to Sony Music’s RCA Records, while Saweetie is part of the Warner Music family. Lil Wayne releases music through his Young Money imprint and Republic Records, a division of Universal Music Group.

Before Dr. Luke topped the charts this year with ""Say So,"" he last had a No. 1 with Katy Perry's ""Dark Horse"" in 2014. Months later, Kesha accused him of sexual assault during their yearslong partnership (Dr. Luke has vigorously denied the allegations.)

A New York court dismissed Kesha’s sexual abuse-related claims in 2016 because of legal issues, without ruling on whether the allegations were true. Kesha lost another round in February, when a New York judge said she made a defamatory statement about Dr. Luke on a different occasion: a 2016 text message telling Gaga the producer had also raped Perry. Both he and Perry have denied it, and the judge said there was ""no evidence whatsoever"" to support the claim.

Kesha’s lawyers have said they plan to appeal the ruling, but it didn’t resolve other aspects of his defamation and breach-of-contract suit, including the crucial question of whether Kesha’s allegation that he raped her is true. The judge said that’s for a jury to decide at trial.

Outside of rap in 2020, Dr. Luke has produced music for pop singer Kim Petras, using the pseudonym MADE IN CHINA.",[]

And while the event will be held in the museum’s parking lot rather than in a kitchen to accommodate all the anticipated guests, it will have all the traditional trappings of an east coast kitchen shindig including live maritime folk music by The Navvies and a lobster dinner. There may even be a cod to kiss.

The museum’s executive director, Jim Millar, pretty much guarantees it will be a good time. He should know: He’s a native Newfoundlander.

Millar said the kitchen party is a cultural icon in his native province because the home is the heart of the community and any gathering of friends, family or neighbours quickly gravitates to the kitchen as it’s the warmest place in the home. It also gives the host a bit of control to end the party, eventually.

“When the owner of the house wants everybody out, they just turn up the stove and it gets too hot so everybody leaves,” said Millar, who headed west in 1991 to seek better job opportunities.

Newfoundland’s harsh landscape, long winters and history of tough economic times mean its residents like to keep their celebrations simple and spontaneous. A kitchen party doesn’t require months of planning or embossed invitations.

“We’d just go over to somebody’s house, somebody would bring the screech and somebody would bring a fiddle,” said Millar. “That was our entertainment.”

Dorian Nijdam, an assistant at the museum, grew up in B.C. but discovered kitchen party culture when he attended the College of the North Atlantic in Stephenville, N.L.

“Some of the best parties I’ve been to were in Newfoundland,” said Nijdam. “They’re so friendly and raucous. There’s a sort of love for life and seizing the moment.”

Millar said the swapping of family stories at kitchen parties helps bond the community and make visitors “from away” feel more welcome.

“The world would be a better place if there were more Newfie kitchen parties,” said Millar.

• Tickets to the Newfie Kitchen Party (4 to 8 p.m. on Sunday, June 18) are $35 and include a traditional lobster dinner with potato salad and dessert. Kids can get a hot dog and potato salad for $15. Proceeds from the party help support programs at the museum. Contact info@portmoodymuseum.org or 604-939-1648.",[]

Ask them what goes good with it and many will say butter.

So I thought it would be fun to show you how to make your own butter. It’s not difficult when using a stand mixer, as I did.

article continues below

You whip whipping cream until it breaks into butter and buttermilk. The butter is formed into a ball and squeezed, submerged in cold water, to remove any additional buttermilk. The butter is then drained and seasoned with salt, if desired.

Two cups of whipping cream will yield about one cup of butter. It will also leave behind about one cup of buttermilk, which is conveniently needed for my soda bread recipe.

If you don’t have a stand mixer, but do have strong arms or many family members who can help you shake, you could start making the butter in a one-litre jar. Put the whipping cream in the jar and shake, shake, shake until it eventually breaks into butter and buttermilk. Now finish the butter as described in the recipe.

If butter’s not your thing, try today’s other recipe for yogurt cheese, which can be spread on such things as bread, bagels, crostini and crackers.

Homemade Butter

Tasty homemade butter you can spread on anything requiring it, such as slices of soda bread. It also yields about one cup of buttermilk, an ingredient needed for the bread.

Preparation time: a few minutes, plus mixing time

Cooking time: None

Makes: about 1 cup butter

1 (500 mL) container whipping cream (see Note)

1/4 tsp salt (optional)

Set a colander in a bowl and set it aside for now.

Pour cream into a stand mixer fitted with the whipping attachment. Whip cream on medium speed (I used the number 5 setting on my Kitchen Aid) until medium peaks form, about four minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula. Put on your mixer’s splatter guard, if it has one.

Increase speed to medium-high (I used the number 8 setting). Whip cream until it breaks into butter and buttermilk, about six to 12 minutes. The cream will make sloshing sounds just before that happens.

Put the butter clung to the whipping attachment in the colander. Set a sieve over a 2-cup measuring cup or other vessel and pour and strain the buttermilk into it.

Add any butter in the sieve to butter in the colander. Cover and refrigerate buttermilk until ready to use for the soda bread or other use.

Press butter in the colander into a ball. Fill the bowl with ice-cold water, and then squeeze the butter to remove most of buttermilk left in it, about one minute.

Lift butter out of the water, drain on paper towel and then set in a clean bowl. Mix salt, if using, into the butter.

The butter is now ready. Form it into a brick, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until needed. You could also store the butter in a fancy bowl or jar, or mold it. The butter, refrigerated, should keep a month, but you’ll likely devour it well before that.

Note: I tested this recipe with Island Farms brand whipping cream, and also Avalon Dairy brand organic whipping cream. The latter turned to butter much quicker than the former, which is why the recipe method gives a range on how long it will take to whip the cream into butter.

Buttermilk Soda Bread

Hearty, yeast-free bread you can use for sandwiches, or serve with cheese, stews and soups.

Preparation time: 15 minutes

Cooking time: 35 to 40 minutes

Makes: one, about seven-inch round loaf

2 cups all-purpose flour, plus some for kneading and shaping

2 tsp baking powder

1/2 tsp baking soda

1/2 tsp salt

1 tsp granulated sugar

1/4 cup cold butter, cut into small cubes

1 cup buttermilk (see Note)

Preheat oven to 375 F. Place 2 cups flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and sugar in a bowl and whisk to combine. Add butter and with your fingers, two forks or a pastry cutter, work into the flour mixture until thoroughly distributed.

Mix in buttermilk until loose dough forms. Turn dough on to a lightly floured work surface. Lightly flour your hands, and then gently knead and shape the dough, which should still be a little sticky, into a 6-inch round, about 2-inch thick, disc. Set on a non-stick or parchment paper-lined baking sheet.

Cut a shallow cross on the top of the loaf. Bake in the middle of the oven for 35 to 40 minutes, until loaf springs back when gently touched in the centre.

Note: If using buttermilk leftover from the butter recipe, if you don’t have exactly one cup, simply top up with regular milk until you do.

Eric’s options: Replace 1 cup of the all-purpose flour with 1 cup whole wheat flour. To make buttermilk cheese soda bread, after adding the butter to the flour mixture, mix in one cup grated cheddar cheese. Now finish bread as described in the recipe.

Yogurt Cheese

Here’s a tangy, easy to make, soft-cream-cheese-like mixture you can spread on sandwiches, bagels, crostini or crackers. If spread on the latter two items, make appetizing bites by also topping them with items that compliment the cheese’s taste, such as tapenade, cured meats, smoked salmon or roasted peppers.

Preparation time: a few minutes, plus draining time

Cooking time: None

Makes: about 3/4 cup

1 cup thick Greek-style yogurt (see Note)

• salt, to taste

1 Tbsp chopped fresh herbs, such as chives, parsley, oregano, basil, tarragon and/or dill, or to taste (optional)

Set a fine sieve over a bowl and line with two sheets of cheesecloth. Or, line a coned-shaped, drip coffee maker with a paper filter and set in a bowl. Spoon yogurt into the sieve or filter. Cover with plastic wrap, refrigerate, and let yogurt drain 24 to 36 hours, until like spreadable cream cheese in texture

Transfer yogurt cheese to a bowl and season with salt and chopped fresh herbs, if using.

Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. It will keep about a week, depending on yogurt’s best before date.

Note: I used Liberté brand, two per cent Greek-style yogurt when testing this recipe.

It’s easy to understand why — it’s crispy on the outside, juicy in the middle and served with a flavourful sauce (or two).

It’s essentially a breaded chicken cutlet that could be sliced and served with side dishes. But in recent years, it’s also become a very popular thing to stuff into a sandwich, what I did in today’s recipe.

article continues below

To make my sandwiches, large, boneless, skinless chicken thighs are pounded until fairly thin. They are coated in flour, dipped into a beaten egg mixture, then thickly coated with panko, coarse Japanese-style breadcrumbs.

In restaurants, the chicken katsu is often deep-fried once coated. But in my recipe, I opted to shallow-fry it in oil in a skillet until golden, crispy and cooked through.

Many recipes for chicken katsu sandwiches ask you to use a soft style of sliced white bread — something you can easily bite through to get to the flavourful chicken inside.

I instead chose to use a tender hamburger bun, which I find yields a more attractive-looking sandwich.

That said, you likely wouldn’t be looking at the sandwich long before devouring it. That’s because the chicken is flavoured with two addictive sauces. One is a fresh ginger-flavoured mayo that you spread on the cut sides of the buns.

The other is tonkatsu sauce, a kind of Japanese-style barbecue sauce that you drizzle on the chicken. You can buy that sauce at Japanese food stores and in the Asian-foods aisle of some grocery stores, but I made my own simple version.

You can coat the chicken and make the sauces many hours before cooking the chicken and making the sandwiches. Keep everything refrigerated until needed. You could also do the same with the cucumber and radish quick pickles I served with the sandwiches.

Chicken Katsu Sandwiches

Japanese-style chicken that’s crunchy on the outside and juicy in the middle stuffed into buns with two flavourful sauces and refreshing lettuce. The panko needed for the chicken is sold in grocery stores, often in the Asian-foods aisle.

Preparation time: 40 minutes

Cooking time: Six minutes

Makes: Four servings

For ginger mayo (see Eric’s options)

1/2 cup mayonnaise

1 tsp finely grated fresh ginger

2 tsp soy sauce

2 tsp rice or cider vinegar

1 tsp granulated sugar or honey, or to taste

1/2 tsp sesame oil

Combine ingredients in a small bowl. Cover and refrigerate until needed.

For tonkatsu sauce

3 Tbsp ketchup

1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce

1 tsp soy sauce

1/2 tsp granulated sugar or honey

Combine ingredients in a small bowl (see Eric’s options). Cover and refrigerate until needed.

For chicken katsu sandwiches

4 large boneless, skinless chicken thighs (about 325 to 350 grams)

• salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

2 large eggs

1/4 cup milk

1/3 cup all-purpose flour

1 3/4 cups panko

• vegetable oil, for frying

4 tender hamburger buns, split and warmed

1 cup shredded head or leaf lettuce, or to taste

Set a chicken thigh flat on a work surface, smooth-side-down. Cover with a double layer of plastic wrap. Using a kitchen hammer, pound chicken until it’s about 1/4-inch thick, then set on a plate (see Eric’s options). Pound the other chicken thighs this way. Season the chicken with salt and pepper.

Place eggs and milk in a bowl large enough to dunk the chicken in and beat to combine. Place flour and panko in separate wide plates. Set out a baking sheet to set the chicken on once coated.

Coat one chicken thigh in flour. Dip it in the egg mixture, evenly coating it. Coat chicken in panko, thickly pressing it on. Set coated chicken on the baking sheet. Coat the remaining chicken thighs in this fashion.

Preheat oven to 225 F. Set out a second large baking sheet. Pour 1/4 inch or so of oil into a large skillet set over medium, medium-high heat.

When oil is hot, add two of the chicken katsu to the skillet and cook about three minutes per side, until golden and cooked through. (Keep a close eye on the chicken and lower the heat if it overly darkens as it cooks.)

Drain chicken katsu on paper towel, then set on the second clean baking sheet.

Cook the other two chicken katsu as you did the first two and set them on the baking sheet. Put chicken into the oven to keep warm.

Spread the cut sides of each bun generously with the ginger mayo. Top each bottom bun with some shredded lettuce.

Remove chicken katsu from the oven and, at a slight angle, cut each one, widthwise, in half. Now set two half pieces of chicken katsu on each bottom bun. Drizzle chicken katsu with the tonkatsu sauce. Set on top buns and serve.

Eric’s options: For spicy tonkatsu sauce, add sriracha or other spicy chili sauce, to taste.

If you don’t have a kitchen hammer, try using the bottom of a heavy skillet or rolling pin to pound the chicken thighs.

Cucumber and Radish Quick Pickles

Easy and quick sweet and tangy pickles you can serve with the chicken katsu sandwiches.

Preparation time: 15 minutes, plus salting time

Cooking time: A few minutes

Makes: About 1 1/2 cups

3/4 cup water

3 Tbsp rice or cider vinegar

2 tsp granulated sugar

1 cup thinly sliced radishes (see Note)

1 cup thinly sliced mini English cucumbers

1 tsp salt

Place water, vinegar and sugar in a small pot. Bring to a simmer over medium heat for 30 seconds, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Remove from the heat and cool vinegar mixture to room temperature.

Meanwhile, place radishes and cucumber in a fine sieve. Sprinkle with the salt and toss to coat the vegetables. Set sieve over a bowl or sink and let stand at room temperature 30 minutes.

When the 30 minutes are up, rinse the vegetables with cold water, drain well, then pat dry with paper towel. Place the vegetables in a two-cup jar. Pour in the vinegar mixture. Push on the vegetables to submerge them. Cover and refrigerate pickle until ready to serve with the chicken katsu sandwiches.

Note: About two mini cucumbers and 10 radishes, depending on size, should yield the amounts needed here.

Halibut, salmon, albacore tuna, ling cod, crab, sablefish, oysters, clams and mussels are just some of the tasty choices we have and there’s much to celebrate about that.

But for many seafood lovers in this province, the party hits its peak when spot prawns are in season. This year’s fishery began in early June and according to Mike Atkins, Executive Director of Pacific Prawn Fishermen’s Association, will likely last four to six weeks.

article continues below

Although you can buy good quality frozen spot prawns year round, they really are at their best when ultra fresh. They have sweet tasting, almost buttery, succulent meat and part of their allure is that they are only available for a few weeks each year. So when you do have them you really appreciate their fine flavour and recognize what a treat they are.

Despite their name, spot prawns are the largest of the shrimp species commercially harvested off the B.C. coast. They are named after the distinctive white spots you’ll find on their tails.

You are most likely to find spot prawns for sale at stand-alone seafood stores and, occasionally, at some supermarkets, depending on availability. In some coastal locations you can also buy them direct from the fisher.

Depending on where you buy them, you’ll see fresh spot prawn tails with their heads removed, and whole live or recently live spot prawns for sale.

When buying spot prawn tails, choose bright-looking, firm tails that have few or no black spots and smell of the sea. It’s best to cook fresh spot-prawn tails the day you purchase them. But, if they are very fresh and you keep them well chilled on a bed of ice in the refrigerator, you could store them for one day or maybe two.

According to information on the Pacific Prawn Fishermen’s Association website, bcprawns.ca, when buying live spot prawns, look for lively, almost translucent specimens. The tail should be straight in line with the head, and the head should be firm to the touch.

When going out to buy live prawns, bring a cooler with ice in it to put them in for the ride home. Once home, refrigerate them until ready to cook.

Don’t leave live or recently live prawns for more than a few hours before cooking them or removing the heads. Spot prawns have an enzyme that will permeate into the tail and causes their quality to deteriorate quickly. You’ll know the prawns have started to deteriorate if the head is showing a black colour and is soft or mushy when touched, an unappealing quality the meat will also have.

If you need to store the prawns for more than a few hours, you can remove the heads by swiftly turning and pulling them away from the tails. After the heads are removed, the tails should be thoroughly rinsed and, as noted above, kept refrigerated until ready to cook.

Spot prawns can be prepared in ways similar to other large shrimp and prawns. I used them in an aromatic, colourful and tasty Cajun-style sheet pan dinner for two.

Spot Prawn Sheet Pan Dinner for Two

Here’s a nicely spiced, peel-and-eat, Cajun-style way to prepare B.C. spot prawns that sees them cooked on a sheet pan with bits of sausage, potatoes, onions and peppers. For a filling meal, serve with cornbread or corn on the cob.

Preparation time: 25 minutes

Cooking time: 23 to 27 minutes

Makes: two servings

8 to 10 B.C. nugget potatoes, halved

3 Tbsp olive oil

2 Tbsp lemon juice

1 large garlic clove, minced

1 1/2 tsp paprika

1 1/2 tsp oregano

1/2 tsp dried thyme

• freshly ground black pepper, to taste

1 tsp hot pepper sauce, such as Tabasco, or to taste

14 to 16 whole live spot prawns, or spot prawn tails (see Eric’s options)

1 cured (about 5-inch long) chorizo or other tasty sausage, sliced (see Note)

1/2 medium onion, sliced

1/2 medium red bell pepper, sliced

1/2 medium green bell pepper, sliced

• sea salt, to taste

• chopped fresh parsley, to taste

• lemon slices, for garnish

• remoulade sauce (optional, see recipe)

Boil potatoes until just tender, about eight to 10 minutes. Drain well, set on a large plate and cool to room temperature.

Preheat oven 400 F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper, unless it’s non-stick.

Combine oil, lemon juice, garlic, paprika, oregano, thyme, black pepper and hot pepper sauce in a large bowl. Add prawns, sausage, cooked potatoes, onions and bell peppers and use a spatula to toss and coat them with the oil mixture.

Set prawns, sausage and vegetables on the baking sheet, spreading them out so that they sit in a single layer. Drizzle any oil mixture left in the bowl over them and then sprinkle lightly with salt.

Roast the sheet pan dinner 15 to 17 minutes, or until the prawns are cooked and sizzling. Sprinkle with parsley, garnish with lemon slices and, if desired, serve with remoulade sauce.

Note: Ready-to-eat chorizo sausages are sold at supermarkets, butcher and charcuterie shops and European-style delis.

Eric’s options: The prawns used in today’s recipe came from Oak Bay Seafood (oakbayseafood.com). No matter where you shop, it’s best to call ahead to see if they are stocking spot prawns that day. When spot prawns are not available, simply use another type of wild prawn tail in this recipe.

Remoulade Sauce

Here’s a tangy southern-style sauce that you can dollop alongside the prawns and other items in the sheet pan dinner once plated.

Preparation time: five minutes

Cooking time: None

Makes: about 1/2 cup

1/3 cup mayonnaise

1 Tbsp finely chopped sweet mixed pickles or sweet green relish

2 tsp fresh lemon juice

1 tsp capers, finely chopped

1 tsp Dijon mustard

1 tsp chopped fresh parsley

• pinch dried tarragon and paprika

1/4 tsp hot pepper sauce, such as Tabasco, or to taste

Combine ingredients in a small bowl. Cover and refrigerate until needed for the sheet pan dinner.

We had a marvellous time and those photos made me reminisce about the food we enjoyed there.

One of the first things that came to mind was the New York-style cheesecake we had for lunch at the famed Carnegie Deli in Manhattan. Something we initially had not planned to order.

article continues below

That’s because this deli, first opened in 1937, is renowned for their sandwiches. The portions are generous and we thought we would have no room for cheesecake after eating one of them. For example, I ordered a “small” pastrami sandwich and it was packed with half-pound or so of rich, succulent meat.

But every time our waiter, who could have been a stand-up comic he was so funny, walked by our table he stopped and insisted we had to have the cheesecake. He must have done that a half-dozen times.

We finally broke down and when he walked by again we said we would like to try it.

The waiter stared at us and with a very serious look, paused and said: We’re sold out.

He waited a moment, admired the shocked look on our faces, and then said he was joking. We all laughed and were glad he was joking because that cheesecake was sweet and heavenly.

When thinking about that cheesecake it made me wonder, with the COVID-19 pandemic, when I’ll be able travel to New York to enjoy some again. I concluded it would be a while, but I now I had an incredible craving for that style of cheesecake. So I decided to make own and relive the experience that way.

As I sat down and ate a slice, it wasn’t, of course, the same as being in bustling Carnegie Deli. But it did make me very happy.

The recipe for that cheesecake is below. At the Carnegie deli the cheesecake was topped with glazed strawberries. In my recipe, though, I given you option to top wedges of the cake with whipped cream and sliced fresh local strawberries, which are in season now.

The cake yields 12 to 16 portions. If that’s too many for you, wedges of the cake could be frozen solid on tray, wrapped, and be kept frozen until ready to thaw and enjoy the next you want to enjoy some cheesecake.

New York-style Cheesecake

Tall, rich and divine cheesecake you can slice and serve with whipped cream and local strawberries. The cake can be baked a day or two before serving. Once cooled to room temperature, cover and refrigerate it, still in the pan, until ready to unmould and serve.

Preparation time: 25 minutes

Cooking time: 110 minutes

Makes: 12-16 servings

1 1/4 cups graham cracker crumbs

2 Tbsp granulated sugar

3 Tbsp butter, melted

5 (250 gram) bricks firm cream cheese, at room temperature (see Note 1)

1 cup granulated sugar

2 Tbsp all-purpose flour

2 tsp pure vanilla extract

4 large eggs

1 cup sour cream

• whipped cream, sliced B.C. strawberries and mint sprigs, to taste (optional)

Preheat oven to 350 F. Place graham crackers, 2 Tbsp sugar and the butter in a bowl and mix to combine. Spoon and press onto the bottom of a 9-inch spring-form cake pan. Bake for five minutes, and then set aside to cool.

Place cream cheese in the bowl of a stand mixer and beat with the paddle attachment until smooth. Gradually beat in the 1 cup of sugar. Beat in the flour and vanilla. Beat in the eggs, one at a time. Mix in sour cream until well incorporated. Pour the batter into the cake pan.

Place a shallow pan of water on the bottom rack of the oven still set to 350 F. (The steam rising from the water will help prevent the cheesecake from cracking on top during baking.) Set the cheesecake on the rack above the water and bake 10 minutes.

Lower oven temperature to 250 F and bake cake 70 minutes more, or until the centre of the cake barely jiggles when the pan is tapped. Turn the oven off and let the cake cool in the oven 30 minutes.

Transfer the cake to a baking rack and cool for five minutes. Now run a hot-water dipped paring knife around the rim of the pan to a depth of about 1/2-inch, pressing against sides of the pan as you do. (Doing this should help prevent the cake from cracking on top as it cools).

Cool the cake to room temperature, then cover and refrigerate for at least four hours.

Unmould the cake, slice, plate and serve (see Note 2). Garnish slices of the cake, if desired, with a dollop of whipped cream, sliced strawberries and a mint sprig.

Note 1: I used Kraft Philadelphia Original brick cream cheese when testing this recipe.

Note 2: To get clean slices of cheesecake, dip a thin, sharp knife in hot water and wipe it dry before cutting each portion of cake.

But instead of walking down the aisle and saying ”I do,” the couple spent what was meant to be their wedding day having an extra-special, physically-distanced “border date.”

article continues below

Since the border separating Canada and the U.S was closed to all-non essential travel in an effort to help slow the spread of COVID-19, the engaged couple has been stuck in separate countries. However, they've been making do by meeting up at a spot in the Fraser Valley, where two roads run parallel on either side of the border. They bring lawn chairs, blankets, coffee and snacks, and obey physical distancing requirements by staying firmly planted in their respective countries.

Sometimes, she’ll head out on her skateboard while he hops on a longboard, and cruise down the roads, separated only by a ditch. “There’s lots of couples and families along the way. It’s nice to see a community of people trying to make the best of a situation,” said Koop in a video posted to YouTube on May 5.

Koop has been documenting these dates on her TikTok account, which subsequently went viral. To date, their videos have amassed well over 100,000 views.

“At first, it was just so hard, for so many reasons,” she said in the follow-up video. “Obviously, just not being able to see each other, we also had to change all of our wedding plans.”

They began by planning smaller and smaller gatherings, until restrictions made it clear it wasn’t a good idea to have any kind of gathering at all. “Now we’re kind of at the point where we don’t even know when we can have our wedding, because they’ve extended the border closure for another 30 days,"" she said.

“We’re just kind of waiting to see what happens, and go from there.""

The closure, agreed upon by both countries in March, is currently set to expire on June 21.

When Koop pitched the idea for these physically-distanced meet-ups to her fiance after the border closure officially went into effect, at first “he didn’t really like it,” she explained.

“I think it’s just really hard to see someone in person but not be able to touch them or hug them, especially when you’re going through something that’s really hard, but eventually I think we got really desperate and missed each other, so a couple weeks later we decided we’d try it.”



Koop, on the other hand, was more concerned with following the rules. “I was pretty nervous. I thought, ‘Oh no, like, are we going to get in trouble? What’s the border going to say?’’ We weren’t going to try to cross or do anything stupid, but I was just kind of worried that it was something we weren’t allowed to do.”

When she finally saw Hamilton on April 1, “I cried, like, the biggest tears,” Koop recalled in the YouTube video. “It had been like a month since we’d seen each other.”

She added. “We just hung out, and it was just so nice to see each other. Once we did that, we realized it was something that we could do and probably should do more often.”

As for Koop’s nerves about what border patrol might think of these dates, the couple has had no issues. “They drove by several times and just waved,” she explained.

She recommends anyone thinking of following their example to make the effort, but to ensure they respect local laws and regulations while doing so.

While there, we dined at several Mexican restaurants and noticed that tostadas were featured on many menus.

Tostada is a Spanish word that means toasted — in this case, a tortilla that is toasted and used as a base.

article continues below

The tostadas we saw were topped in all sorts of ways, with crisp lettuce, beans, salsa, cheese and a main ingredient, including seafood, chicken and carnitas — shredded succulent pieces of pork.

The other day, I was thinking about those tostadas and thought it would fun to make a B.C.-style version.

Rather than use tortillas as the base, I used fry bread, a First Nations-style bread also called bannock. Recipes for fry bread can vary, but many see a baking powder-leavened, flour-based dough formed into rounds and fried in a skillet until golden and puffed. In other words, the perfect base for a tostada.

In my recipe, I topped the fry bread with some of the items noted above and, for the main ingredient, used strips of nicely seasoned roasted B.C. fish. The latter could be cut from snapper (also called rockfish), lingcod, salmon or halibut fillets, depending on your preference.

When the tostadas are plated and ready to enjoy, you end up with a bright, colourful, very flavourful dish that will go great with beer or margaritas.

B.C. Fish and Fry Bread Tostadas

This B.C.-style version of tostadas uses homemade fry bread as the base. Once plated, that fry bread is topped with nicely spiced pieces of B.C. fish, salsa, lettuce and sour cream. The recipes for the tostadas, fry bread and salsa could be halved if you’re only serving two.

Preparation time: 20 minutes, plus time to make salsa and fry bread

Cooking time: about 12 minutes

Makes: four servings

1 Tbsp vegetable oil

1 Tbsp lime juice

2 tsp brown sugar or honey

1/2 tsp chili powder

1/2 tsp ground cumin

• pinch ground cayenne pepper

450 grams B.C. snapper, lingcod, salmon or halibut fillets (see Note)

• salt to taste

4 fry bread (see recipe below)

• shredded lettuce, to taste

• tomato salsa, to taste (see recipe below and Eric’s options)

1 ripe avocado, cut into small cubes

• dollops of sour cream, to taste (see Eric’s options)

• lime wedges and cilantro sprigs, for garnish (optional)

Combine the oil, lime juice, brown sugar (or honey), chili powder, cumin and cayenne pepper in a bowl. Cut the fish into two-inch-long, half-inch-thick strips, set in the bowl and toss to coat.

Preheat oven to 400 F. Arrange fish in a single layer on a parchment-paper-lined baking sheet; season with salt. Roast fish eight to nine minutes, or until just cooked through.

Remove fish from the oven, then pop fry bread into the oven to warm for a few minutes.

To serve, set a piece of fry bread on each of four plates. Divide and top fry bread with lettuce, fish, salsa, avocado and sour cream. Garnish with lime wedges and cilantro sprigs, if using, and serve.

Note: If using salmon or halibut fillets, remove and discard the skin before slicing the fish.

Eric’s options: If you don’t want to make your own salsa, replace it with store-bought fresh or bottled tomato salsa. For added richness, you could also top the tostadas with crumbled goat cheese or queso fresco, to taste. If you don’t eat dairy, you could replace the sour cream with yogurt-like plain, cultured coconut milk.

Fry Bread

First Nations-style bread leavened with baking powder that you form into thin rounds and fry in a skillet until puffed and golden. Fry bread makes a great base for tostadas and could also be filled and folded as you would a soft tortilla.

Preparation time: 15 minutes, plus resting time

Cooking time: about eight minutes

Makes: four fry bread

2 cups all-purpose flour (see Note)

2 tsp baking powder

1/2 tsp salt

1 Tbsp vegetable oil, plus some for frying

3/4 cup water

Place flour, baking powder and salt in a bowl and whisk to combine. Make a well in the flour and pour the 1 Tbsp oil and water into it. Use a spatula to mix the wet ingredients into the flour mixture until dough forms that’s just starting to hold together.

Transfer dough, and any unincorporated flour in the bowl, to a work surface. Knead the dough into a smooth ball. Cover dough with plastic wrap and let rest 30 minutes.

When dough has rested, shape it into an eight-inch-long log. Cut the log, widthwise, into four roughly equally pieces. Press each piece into a thin round that’s about six inches wide. (If the dough feels overly sticky when you do this, lightly flour your fingers and the work surface under the dough.)

Heat one inch of vegetable oil in a large skillet set over medium to medium-high heat. When oil is hot, fry one round of dough 45 to 60 seconds. Carefully turn over and fry the bread 45 to 60 seconds on the other side, or until puffed, golden and cooked through. Drain on paper towel and then set on a baking sheet. Cook the remaining fry bread. Use fry bread as described in the tostadas recipe.

Note: If your flour has been sitting around for a while, give it a good stir before measuring what you need. Doing that will aerate the flour and make it more like it was when first purchased.

Fresh Tomato Salsa

Fresh and bright salsa you can spoon on top of tostadas and serve with other Mexican-style dishes.

Preparation time: 15 minutes

Cooking time: None

Makes: About two cups

2 medium ripe, red, on-the-vine tomatoes, cut into small cubes

1/4 cup finely chopped onion or shallot

1/2 cup loosely packed cilantro leaves, chopped

1 small jalapeño pepper, seeds removed, flesh finely chopped (see Eric options)

2 Tbsp lime juice

1/4 tsp ground cumin

• salt to taste

Combine ingredients in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate until needed. Any salsa left over from using it on the tostadas will keep a few days in the refrigerator.

Eric’s options: If you don’t have a jalapeño, replace it with some hot pepper sauce, to taste, such as Tabasco.

I liked the idea, so today I’m showing you how to make a good omelette, a popular egg dish that some struggle to make. They’ll overcook it so it’s tough, undercook it or fail to beat the eggs well, so the omelette ends up with unappealing streaks of egg white.

article continues below

Along with tips for making an omelette, I’ve included step-by-step photos (see top of page). Think of this quote from famed food writer Elizabeth David: “As everybody knows, there is only one infallible recipe for the perfect omelette: your own.”

The pan

A nine-inch (23-centimetre) or similar-sized non-stick skillet (fry pan) with sloped sides is a good vessel to use. There will be no worry about the omelette sticking, and the sloped sides make it easy to remove from the pan.

Beating the eggs

For each omelette, crack two or three large eggs into a bowl. With a fork, vigorously beat eggs back and forth, and up and down. There should be no strands of egg white or yolk visible.

Types of omelettes

Two popular styles of omelettes are the classic French-style one and what some call a “country-style” omelette. For the former, you quickly cook the eggs in a hot skillet, continually stirring them and shaking the pan in a continuous movement. You then carefully form the softly cooked eggs into sort of a torpedo shape right in the pan, before turning it onto a plate. Country-style omelettes are easier to make and the type most often made in Canada. That’s what I’ve provided step-by-step photos for.

Flavouring and filling an omelette

You can simply flavour the eggs with salt and pepper. I usually use white pepper because it does not discolour the eggs. Before cooking the eggs, you can enhance their flavour by mixing in such things as chopped herbs. When filling your omelette, don’t overdo it or use chunky ingredients or it will be difficult to fold.

Omelette filling ideas

Below are six ways you can fill an omelette. I have not provided ingredient amounts — simply add them to taste.

Vancouver Island-style: Chopped smoked salmon, wilted kale and crumbled Salt Spring Island goat cheese.

Canadian-style: Thinly sliced, chopped Canadian or peameal bacon, grated aged Canadian cheddar, fried onions and chopped parsley.

California-style: Thinly sliced, ripe avocado, tomato salsa and grated Monterey Jack cheese.

Cordon bleu-style: Grated Swiss cheese and thin slices of ham.

Italian-style: Cooked pieces of Italian sausage, grated asiago or provolone cheese, roasted peppers and small spoons of pesto.

What’s in your fridge: Fill the omelette with items you have in your fridge that you think will work well.

677,tricitynews,https://www.tricitynews.com/lifestyles/eric-akis-get-happy-with-halibut-1.24112479,Eric Akis: Get happy with halibut,['Eric Akis'],,"A Times Colonist reader, Kevin, sent me an email asking if I had any recipes not requiring ingredients that are consistently out of stock at grocery stores during the pandemic.

Those ingredients included the dried pasta I used in my casserole recipe last week and other staples, such as flour, canned tomato products, canned fish and rice.

article continues below

I’ve visited several grocery stores recently, and while folks are still stocking up on staple items, fresh foods seem to be in relatively good supply.

Some of them, such as fresh vegetables, could be turned into soup and other dishes you could freeze for another time. In future columns, I’ll offer recipes geared that way.

But today, I thought I would offer a recipe you could enjoy straight out of the oven, one that uses a fine-tasting seafood I saw for sale at many grocery stores and seafood shops: fresh B.C. halibut. It’s in season now and such a treat to eat — the kind of food that makes you feel lucky we live where we do.

When you’re shopping, opt for firm, almost translucent fish that glimmers with freshness.

Try to buy fresh halibut the same day you’ll cook it. If you have to, you could store it, removed from its store packaging and set in a covered container, in the coldest part of your refrigerator for one day.

Halibut welcomes all sort of flavours, from simple accents — such as baking halibut fillets or steaks with butter and/or olive oil, lemon and garlic — to more exotic tastes, which is the route I took in today’s recipe, where halibut is flavoured Moroccan-style.

Remember when preparing halibut and other types of fish that when cooked, it should feel slightly firm, not hard — a sign you have overcooked it — and not soft, a sign it’s not cooked through. When cooked, the flesh will start to slightly separate into flakes.

Note: In my Wednesday, April 8, column I’ll be offering tips on menu planning and shopping for food during the pandemic.

Moroccan-style Halibut Fillets for Two

In-season B.C. halibut baked with aromatic spices, tangy citrus juice and zest, sweet carrots, salty olives and, if desired, rich walnuts. Serve the fish with couscous, bulgur, rice, orzo or boiled potatoes and, if you have it, a steamed green vegetable.

Preparation time: 20 minutes

Cooking time: About 20 minutes

Makes: Two servings

1 medium carrot, cut into about two-inch-long, 1/2-inch-wide sticks

2 (5-to 6- oz./140-to 170 g) halibut fillets (see Note and Eric’s options)

1 Tbsp olive oil (divided)

10 to 12 black or green olives (see Eric’s options)

• walnut halves or pieces, to taste (optional)

1 Tbsp orange juice

1/2 tsp finely grated lemon zest

2 tsp lemon juice

1/4 tsp ground cumin

1/4 tsp ground coriander seed (see Eric’s options)

• pinch ground cayenne pepper or red pepper flakes

• salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

• chopped fresh parsley, cilantro or mint, or thinly sliced green onion, to taste

1 tsp honey (optional)

Place carrots in a small pot, cover with cold water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Boil two to three minutes, until carrots just become tender, then drain well. Cool carrots with ice-cold water, then drain well again.

Preheat oven to 400 F. Brush the bottom of a shallow baking dish, large enough to hold the fish with some space around it, with 1 tsp olive oil. Set the fish in the baking dish. Surround fish with the carrots, olives and walnuts, if using.

Combine remaining 2 tsp olive oil and juices in a small bowl. Drizzle mixture over fish and other items in the dish.

In a second small bowl, combine cumin, coriander, pepper, salt, cayenne (or red pepper flakes) and lemon zest. Sprinkle this mixture on the fish and other items in the dish. Season everything with salt and black pepper.

Bake fish 12 to 15 minutes, or until cooked through. Drizzle everything in the dish with the honey, if using. Sprinkle everything with parsley (or cilantro, mint or green onion) and serve.

Note: Grocery stores are currently selling fresh halibut fillets prepackaged. So you may need to buy a larger 280- to 340-gram piece and cut it into the two portions for this recipe.

Eric’s options: This recipe could easily be doubled and baked in a larger dish. If you’re only feeding one, simply halve the ingredient amounts and use a smaller baking dish or other ovenproof pan. If you don’t have ground coriander, try another type of spice, to taste, such as ground fennel seed, ginger or cardamom. If you don’t have olives, try capers, to taste. Two halibut steaks that are similar in weight will also work in this recipe. If can’t find halibut for sale, other types of fish, such as salmon, snapper or cod fillets, will also work in this recipe.

Reviewed by Fiona Watson, Port Moody Public Library

article continues below

“A mind spread out on the ground” is one way to translate the Mohawk phrase for depression into English. The mind is suspended, sprawling and disorderly, leaving the sufferer without the ability to concentrate.

Alicia Elliott’s book of autobiographical essays explores many paths to depression with astonishing courage and insight. The author chronicles her childhood and adolescence in a large, biracial family living in poverty. The tension is thick between her alcoholic, Haudenosaunee father and deeply religious, mentally ill, Caucasian mother, and Elliott struggles in and outside the family to find a sense of identity and confidence.

Although she moves back to the Six Nations Reserve at the age of 13, she is always straddling multiple identities, trying to balance the experience of both colonizer and colonized, wracked with guilt over the privilege and loss of identity that comes with her light complexion. Instability is a constant in her life and the only thing she can really truly count on is the inevitable return of her head lice. When she becomes unexpectedly pregnant with her white boyfriend, Elliott fears her child will suffer in all the same ways she has.

Heavy topics, including racism, poverty, sexual assault, intergenerational trauma, low self-esteem and loving one’s abuser, are interwoven with historical and scientific research to stunning effect in this collection. But what is perhaps most astonishing about this work is the clarity and strength of the author’s voice. The dark, self-loathing essays of the author’s young life are contrasted by the evidence of her survival and her ability to flourish as a writer.

A Mind Spread Out on the Ground is a legacy of resilience and proclamation of identity. This book is a must-read for lovers of lyrical memoirs and essay collections like I’m Afraid of Men and Heart Berries.",[]

“One silver lining of the closure is that some of our animals and their dedicated care staff are getting extra time to explore our galleries together,” explained the Aquarium in the post.

But Athena Leilani isn’t an author or muckraking journalist looking to crack the pages of The New Yorker.

article continues below

Leilani, 32, tells her stories on her skin and she’s vying to become a cover model for Inked magazine, the international bible of the tattoo lifestyle. She’s one of three finalists in the first round of an online competition to identify a model to be photographed for the magazine’s front page by New York City-based fashion and celebrity photographer Christopher Kolk. The prize also includes $25,000.

Leilani, who has done some modelling, said she got her first tattoo when she was 15 years old — without her parents’ permission — while she was on a family holiday in Hawaii. A cousin inked a tropical flower on her back as a tribute to her Hawaiian heritage.

“I thought it was going to hurt,” Leilani said, “but it didn’t.”

In fact, the thousands of tiny pricks from the tattoo gun that infused the ink into her skin flooded her brain with endorphins and, Leilani said, putting her into “the zone.”

She was addicted.

Since then Leilani has adorned her skin with dozens more tattoos — so many, she has lost count. Each can take up to nine hours to create and each tells a story of the passions that drive her, like her love for Marilyn Monroe that is captured in one tattoo, or the braid of Hawaiian blossoms

that run down one arm. She also favours motivational quotes such as “The day you settle is the day you lose respect for yourself” that she says guide her life’s path.

“I just appreciate art and who I am and the things I like,” Leilani said, adding her next tattoo will be on her thigh.

She said finding an artist she can trust is a process.

“I pick up well on vibes.”

Leilani said she likes someone who has a “light touch” with the tattoo gun and who checks in with her often through the sometimes long and arduous process that she endures without the comfort of numbing cream to deaden the sensations of the needles.

“I feel like you should earn your tattoo,” she said.

683,tricitynews,https://www.tricitynews.com/lifestyles/trying-growing-these-edible-plants-in-your-apartment-1.24099073,Trying growing these edible plants in your apartment,['Brian Minter'],,"Today, with high-density living, containerization is a popular way of gardening.

There are many new edible plants developed to perform well in containers and to provide quality produce in a shorter time frame, even under less than ideal conditions.

article continues below

Chili peppers, like ‘Chenzo’, ‘Loco’ and ‘Basket of Fire’, are easy to grow, quite attractive (like an ornamental) and their small fruits are equivalent in taste and quality to garden-grown varieties.

Container tomatoes, like ‘Tumbling Tom Red’ and ‘Yellow’, ‘Megabite’ and ‘Sweet ‘n’ Neat’, are some of the earliest and best tasting you’ll find. From basil and eggplants to squash and strawberries, breeders have perfected fast, easy-to-grow, quality varieties to help even less experienced gardeners have success. The beauty of these crops is their ability to be grown in large containers for instant results and attractiveness.

PanAmerican’s ‘Simply Salad’ series, with its three salad blends, is another example of beauty, functionality and ease of growing. ‘Alfresco’ has Mediterranean flavours; ‘City Garden’ is a traditional salad; and ‘Global Gourmet’ is a mix with an Asian flair. ‘Simply Kale’ is also an innovative new mix.

Along the theme of beauty, swiss chard has come such a long way, with some of the blends being used even in floral containers. ‘Bright Lights’, ‘Peppermint’ and ‘Celebration’ are now being grown in 6” or 8” pots as container focal points as well as container or garden pop-ins.

Speaking of pop-ins, for gardeners who have limited space or for folks in a hurry, they can minimize the time from planting to harvest by purchasing larger size pots of sugar snap peas, bush and climbing beans, cherry tomatoes, bush cucumbers, lettuce, kale, peppers, summer squash, corn, brassicas and many greens. While the vegetables they planted from seed or transplants are growing, these larger plants will allow an early harvest. Small space gardeners should trellis their climbing beans, peas and cucumbers.

Healthy foods have become a big issue over the past few years as the younger generations are very concerned about what they and their children eat. It is imperative that we grow vegetables either organically or with minimal chemical pest controls. This is equally important for protecting pollinating insects, like bees.

I give the Burpee Company full marks for their innovation, not only in providing informative labels that can be scanned with an app but also for their lead in identifying and selling seeds for vegetables with higher antioxidant values. Their ‘Boost’ antioxidant collection has some amazing varieties. ‘Gold Standard’ cucumbers have 500% more beta-carotene; ‘Sweet Heat’ peppers have 65% more vitamin C; ‘Healing Hands’ salad mix has 20% more lutein, 30% more beta-carotene, 30% more carotenoids and 70% more anthocyanins; and ‘Healthkick’ tomatoes have 50% more lycopene.

However, food gardening is not limited to vegetables and herbs but flows into perennial vegetables and small fruits. The new branded ‘Bushel & Berry’ series of raspberries and blueberries is an ideal fit for container growing. The plants themselves are attractive and there’s the added bonus of being able to pick one’s own fruit – a huge feature for small space and patio gardeners. These plants do need a little proper care, such as larger pots, good soils and nutrients, for the best results.

Perennial vegetables are really growing in popularity. Rhubarb is, perhaps, the most recognized and easy to grow, especially from well-established clumps growing in pots, as opposed to root chunks. Jerusalem artichokes are fun and also easy to grow, as is horseradish. In milder climates, the beauty of globe artichokes thriving in a garden is amazing and even if grown in colder climates as an annual and harvested for only one season, if you let it flower, it’s stunning.

With a new season upon us, let’s enjoy greater success with more innovative gardening and newer and more productive varieties.",[]

Hikers crossing another peak look like toys on a tightrope and the island’s free-roaming sheep are calmly grazing the green pasture. Steep is their normal. Not mine.

I let go, turn over onto my back and scoot down a bit. Two days earlier, I was counting clouds – soaking in the geothermal warm waters of the Blue Lagoon. Here, the sunny panorama includes a harbor (where Keiko the orca of Free Willy was relocated in 1998), the town centre, a soccer pitch (game in progress) and, to the east, the rise of black and red lava fields of Eldfell (Icelandic for “Hill of Fire”) formed in 1973 by a volcanic eruption that lasted almost six months.

We are on Heimaey, the largest of the 15 Westman Islands, for one night only (night being relative in an Icelandic summer, in June the sun barely sets below the horizon). It’s not enough time for a boat tour of the world’s largest puffin colony, or to possibly melt the soles of our shoes treading on Eldfell’s still cooling lava.

Icelandic horses greet visitors traveling by. - Supplied, David Nunuk

We take the short ferry back to the mainland at noon the next day and pick up where we left off driving the Ring Road heading from south Iceland to the East Fjords. It’s rainy when we start out, sunny an hour later and windy most of the way through. With only three days left in our trip, we’ll do about a third of the road before turning back.

We chose the route for all the mega-scenery along the way. Plumes of steam rising from emerald green meadows; lupine and lichen fields and the glaciers of Mýrdalsjökull and Vatnajökull – Europe’s largest glacier. Vatnajökull covers 8% of Iceland and is the backdrop to Jökulsárlón – a lagoon where icebergs have broken from the retreating glacier. If they don’t melt first they will eventually go out with the tide. It’s like a floating museum of ice sculpture, a glacial graveyard at the edge of the sea.

And then there are the side-of-the-road surprises: the bird-watching hut that seems to have grown out of a grassy bank overlooking Stöðvarfjörður. Horses so friendly they wait at fences for tourists to stop and pat them. Steinahellir Cave in the Katla UNESCO Geopark, The cave is concealed by a wood paneled wall but there is a small door that opens to reveal, in the dim light, a ceiling covered in delicate ferns. A sign outside tells of visitors who have picked the ferns, only to be bound by bad luck for the remainder of their days. In former times, the cave was the meeting place of the local parliament. Huldafólk are said to be in the vicinity – Iceland’s mythical “hidden people” who are known to like things left untouched. Huldafólk are also said to be extraordinarily beautiful, but this is impossible to verify, given they are also invisible to humans.

-----

On the flight home to Canada, I ask Daughter #2 what she liked best about the trip. “No spiders.” she says without missing a beat. True, we didn’t see so much as a single cobweb the whole time (Iceland’s reputation for clean and tidy holds up everywhere we go; it does have 91 different varieties of spiders, but they are small, not dangerous to humans and I think they must hang out with the Huldafólk).

“What about the Skyr?” I ask. “The waterfall you walked behind? The Blue Lagoon? Patting friendly horses? The cookies from the bakeries in Reykjavik?”

“It was all good, Mum. Really good.”

High praise from a 14-year-old, and she’s right, it was.

While hundreds of people could be employed in positions relating to the games and hubs — such as security jobs, rink staff, food services and hotel housekeeping — the financial benefit of two bubble communities under tight seal would be ""modest"" at best, suggested Bank of Montreal chief economist Douglas Porter.

article continues below

""When you think of how many tourists would normally be in Toronto during peak tourist season, I'm quite sure this is less than one per cent,"" he said.

""The reality is, it's not going to move the needle.""

But Porter, a lifelong hockey fan, said he anticipates a ""reasonably meaningful positive"" morale boost to Canadian sports fans who've been eagerly anticipating players returning to the ice in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The games are slated to start Aug. 1 with six Canadian teams qualifying for the 24-team resumption of play. No fans will be in the seats.

Edmonton and Toronto were confirmed as the NHL's hub cities on Friday night.

""The fact that part of our world is getting back to some kind of normal will help reinforce the sense that things, generally, are moving in that direction and could help support the recovery,"" Porter said.

The gradual comeback of major sporting events has drawn plenty of interest in recent weeks, with debates raging over the risks of putting players back into the games, even if spectators aren't allowed in the facilities.

Further questions have been raised over whether rigorous testing is enough to prevent outbreaks within the isolated community, which could potentially throw the whole plan into a costly disarray.

Many of these factors make placing a value on hockey's return especially difficult.

Michael Naraine, a professor at Brock University in St. Catharines, Ont., said the largest amount of money is on the line at large corporations, which he said is driving the return of major sporting events.

""The primary revenue driver for sports is broadcasting,"" said the assistant professor of digital sport management and marketing.

""They need television advertisers come back. The league itself needs to gain its revenue from NBC and Sportsnet here in Canada.""

Politicians have preferred to emphasize the positive aspects of a deal with the NHL.

Alberta Premier Jason Kenney eagerly promoted Edmonton as the ultimate hub city for the hockey league, posting videos on Twitter that prominently featured the Rocky Mountains and other popular destinations in the province.

Naraine said those public expressions by leaders are more an attempt to ""pander"" to their constituents than actually drive any meaningful economic impact. He said this is especially the case in Edmonton.

""Having major events come to town allows them to beat their chests and say, 'We exist. We're on the map. Come look at us,'"" he said.

""But the fact that the hub city will be in Edmonton is no different than whether the hub city would be in Toronto or Vancouver or elsewhere. It's not going to significantly drive tourism all of a sudden.""

Patrick Rishe, a sports professor at Washington University in St. Louis, said he sees value in showcasing a lesser known Canadian city on broadcast television with ""beauty shots"" of the locale. He said it may also sit well with NHL executives.

""You never know,"" he said. ""Doing and serving a good deed for the league now, this could pay dividends down the road.""

Any semblance of a regular hockey season would be welcomed by Dana Parris, owner of the Lockeroom sports bar in Barrie, Ont.

Even though her business is over 100 kilometres away from downtown Toronto, she anticipates the excitement would reverberate to her customers.

""If we could have sports come back and we hit Stage 3 (of Ontario's COVID reopening plan) around the same time, I will probably stop crying myself to sleep,"" she said.

""If those two come together it's just going to be the most beautiful thing.""

The 18-year veteran quarterback headlines the Canadian Football Hall of Fame's 2020 class that was unveiled Thursday. Burris, 45, got the nod in his first year of eligibility, becoming just the 21st player ever to do so but second in as many years after Calgary running back Jon Cornish in 2019.

article continues below

Joining Burris in the player category are offensive linemen Clyde Brock and Freddie Childress and quarterback Greg Vavra. John Hufnagel, the Calgary Stampeders president/GM, and Larry Uteck (posthumously), the former head coach/athletic director at Saint Mary’s University, were both named as builders.

Burris's family — wife Nicole and sons Armand and Barron — had known of his induction since February but managed to keep quiet about it until about two and a half weeks ago when the Hall of Fame informed Burris. Even then, the Burris clan was very nonchalant in asking the former quarterback to take in what he thought was a run-of-the-mill video.

Instead, Burris watched Hall of Famer Damon Allen (2012) outline his pro football journey to Canada, which drew a rather bewildered look from Burris. Then Allen detailed Burris's stellar CFL career before Mark DeNobile, the Hall of Fame's executive director, delivered the big news.

And the player, affectionately dubbed Smilin' Hank because of his outgoing personality, was lost for words as tears streamed down his face.

""Yeah, they got me good,"" Burris said with a chuckle. ""What's funny is whenever I've told the boys to keep anything quiet, they've always gone back to their mother and yet they didn't say a peep about this.

""I was lost for words just because to hear it shows you that people appreciated the things you did throughout your career. This is the way for the league and all the organizations and the fans saying, 'Thank you,' and for me I'm humbled by it . . . there's so many guys in there (Hall of Fame) who I looked up to and now to be able to join them is a dream come true.""

The six-foot-one, 190-pound Burris, a native of Spiro, Okla., played 20 pro seasons, 18 in the CFL with the Calgary Stampeders (1997-99, 2005-11), Saskatchewan Roughriders (2000, 2003-04), Hamilton Tiger-Cats (2012-13) and Ottawa Redblacks (2014-16). Burris also spent time with the NFL's Green Bay Packers (2001) and Chicago Bears (2002).

Burris appeared in five Grey Cups, winning three (1998, '08, '16) and being named the MVP twice (2008, '16). The CFL's outstanding player on two occasions (2010, 2015), Burris amassed 63,639 passing yards and 373 TD passes — both third all-time.

Burris retired shortly after leading Ottawa to a thrilling 39-33 overtime Grey Cup upset win over Calgary. He threw for 461 yards and three TDs despite suffering a knee injury during warmups.

Burris said his Hall of Fame induction is as much a testament to his family's resilience and perseverance as it is his on-field accomplishments.

""I had to take my wife all over Canada, drag my kids all over Canada and force them to make new friends just for dad to be able to play this game called football,"" said Burris, whose family still calls Ottawa home. ""And for them to understand and see just the emotions that ran through me . . . it just shows how big that moment is, just kind of when your whole life flashes before you.""

Burris and the other inductees will have to wait for their day in the sun due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2020 class will be honoured alongside the 2021 inductees next August.

When Burris is formally honoured, he'll be joined by former teammate Childress and Hufnagel, who served as Calgary's head coach (2008-2015) before moving into the front office full-time. Burris won Grey Cups with both ('98 with Childress, '08 with Hufnagel).

""Calgary is a machine right now and it all started in 2008 when Huf came in and we got that Grey Cup in his first year,"" Burris said. ""Calgary has always had double-digit wins and been in the playoffs each and every year Huf has been there, they've always been a strong contender for the Grey Cup and there's one reason why.""

Hufnagel, a 68-year-old native of Coraopolis, Pa., spent 12 seasons as a CFL quarterback with Calgary (1976-79), Saskatchewan (1980-83, 1987) and Winnipeg (1984-86) before getting into coaching. A five-time Grey Cup champion, Hufnagel also earned a Super Bowl ring as an assistant with the New England Patriots (2003).

Hufnagel amassed a 102-42-1 record as Calgary's head coach, his .712 win percentage being the highest among coaches with more than 100 games. He's been named the CFL's coach of the year twice (2008, 2014).

Childress, a 53-year-old native of Little Rock, Ark., played 13 CFL seasons with Shreveport (1994), Birmingham (1995), Calgary (1996-03) and Saskatchewan (2004-06). A former second-round pick of the NFL's New England Patriots, Childress won two Grey Cups with the Stampeders (1998, 2001) and in 1998 was named the CFL's top offensive lineman.

Brock, 79, of Los Angeles, played 12 seasons with Saskatchewan (1964-75), helping the club win its first Grey Cup in 1966. The former Dallas Cowboy-San Francisco 49er appeared in 169 regular-season CFL games and four times was named a league all-star before being inducted into Saskatchewan's Plaza of Honour in 1995.

Vavra, 59, of Red Deer, Alta., helped the Calgary Dinos win the Vanier Cup in 1983, his final season at the school. That year, he also became the first player in the program's history to capture the Hec Crighton Trophy as Canadian university football's top player and still holds the U Sports record for most passing yards in a game (627).

Vavra was drafted by the Calgary Stampeders in 1984 and also spent time with the B.C. Lions (1986-87) and Edmonton Eskimos (1988).

After playing seven CFL seasons as a defensive back with Toronto (1974-76), B.C. (1977), Montreal (1978-80) and Ottawa (1980), Uteck became an assistant coach at Saint Mary’s University in 1982. He was promoted to head coach the following year, a position he held until 1997.

Over that span, Uteck was named the Atlantic University Athletic Association coach of the year five times and twice Canadian university football's top coach.

Uteck served as athletic director from 1995 to 2002 and the Huskies captured two Vanier Cups (2001-02). The native of Thornhill, Ont., passed away Dec. 25, 2002 of Lou Gehrig's disease at the age of 50.

The Atlantic Bowl was renamed the Uteck Bowl in 2003.

Columbus announced Thursday that it has named McMillan vice-president, soccer administration and operations.

article continues below

McMillan stepped down as Toronto's senior director of administration and operations in March. So did husband Corey Wray, who was Toronto's assistant GM, team operations and strategy. Toronto did not announce the departures at the time.

The latest move reunites McMillan with Columbus president and GM Tim Bezbatchenko, who stepped down as Toronto's senior vice-president of soccer operations and GM in January 2019 to join his hometown club in Ohio.

""We are thrilled to welcome Jaime McMillan to the club,"" Bezbatchenko said in a statement. ""Jaime played a critical role in the front office, simultaneously managing and executing high-level projects during her time with Toronto FC as it became a perennial MLS Cup contender, and I know she will be a great asset to the Crew as we continue to grow our ambitions and elevate the club in this new era.""

McMillan will oversee Columbus' administration and management in non-technical areas, including soccer operations administration, facilities and budgeting.

The Crew said her role ""will also include a focus on player and staff administration, academy administration and other club support areas.""

Toronto enjoys a reputation as one of MLS' best teams at helping players settle off the field, with McMillan leading the way.

McMillan joined Toronto in 2010 as co-ordinator for business operations. She went on to become senior manager of team development (2013-15), director of team development (2015-16) and director of administrations and operations (2016-18) before taking on the role of senior director of administration and operations.

Toronto won one MLS Cup (2017), one Supporters' Shield (2017) and six Canadian Championships (2010, 2011, 2012, 2016, 2007, 2018) during McMillan's tenure.

The Super League announced its revamped schedule for the resumption of rugby league play, with Toronto playing its remaining games on the other side of the Atlantic.

article continues below

""Regrettably for the Wolfpack the challenges around travel, international border protocols and the hosting of public events in Toronto have proved too significant for the team to be able to host games at Lamport Stadium this season,"" Toronto CEO and chairman Bob Hunter said in an open letter to fans.

""This is not a decision that has been taken lightly, and we vow to return to Toronto bigger and better than ever before in 2021.""

Toronto has not played at home since Oct. 5, 2019, when it won promotion to the Super League with a 24-6 victory over Featherstone Rovers in the Million Pound Game before an announced sellout crowd of 9,974 – a Wolfpack record — at Lamport Stadium.

Rubbing salt in the wound, Toronto fans also woke up to the news Thursday that winger Liam Kay, the team's all-time leading scorer and first-ever player signing, had left to join Wakefield Trinity.

The Wolfpack, 0-6-0 in their first season in the top-tier Super League, have not played since March 11, when they blanked Huddersfield 18-0 in the fifth round of the Challenge Cup. Play was suspended five days later.

Super League features 12 teams — 10 in England, one in France and the Wolfpack.

Play resumes Aug. 2 in England with Toronto playing Hull Kingston Rovers as part of a tripleheader at Leeds Rhinos' Emerald Headingley Stadium. The rest of August sees weekend tripleheaders played over two days behind closed doors — initially at Headingley and St Helens' Totally Wicked Stadium.

""Today's fixtures announcement finally brings the 2020 season back to life,"" Super League executive chairman Robert Elstone said in a statement.

The schedule grows more crowded near the end of the season with Toronto playing its final six games over three weeks.

That's a concern given the physical nature of the sport. It's more of a worry for Toronto, which has a small squad and is facing a looming visa issue involving New Zealand star Sonny Bill Williams and six other imports.

Australia's Josh McCrone, Darcy Lussick and Blake Wallace, Australian-born Samoan international Ricky Leutele and New Zealand's Williams, Chase Stanley and Bodene Thompson have visas that allow for six months in England over a year.

That's not a problem when the Wolfpack are spending part of the season in Canada. But the global pandemic has kept the players in England and the visas are slated to expire at the end of the month.

Because the Wolfpack are Canadian-owned, they require different visas than overseas players employed by English clubs.

Super League said it will review dates and venues ""in the back end of the campaign ... in line with government advice and in discussion with our host broadcaster, Sky Sports.""

The hope is the teams can eventually host games with fans in their home market — with the exception of Toronto.

The playoffs, featuring the top four in the 12-team league, are scheduled for mid/late-November with the Grand Final scheduled for the end of November.

The championship game was originally slated for Oct. 10.

Super League said clubs will be back in training by the end of next week.

Under the original 2020 schedule, nine of Toronto's first 10 games were to be played in England with the other in France — with the late start due to the Canadian winter and the bubble over Lamport Stadium yet to come down. The Wolfpack were to play 11 of their last 19 games at home, with the season wrapping up Sept. 11.

Three other home games were to be played at neutral sites in England.

The Irish international is also one of only five players left from Toronto's inaugural 2017 squad to have taken part in the Wolfpack's rise from the third-tier League 1 to the elite Super League.

article continues below

With the Super League season set to resume Aug. 2 after a pandemic hiatus, Kay joins Wakefield initially on a loan agreement through the end of the season. He has signed a two-year deal covering the 2021 and 2022 campaigns.

Toronto has faced a salary cap crunch in recent times and is currently dealing with a visa issue that could leave New Zealand star Sonny Bill Williams and six other imports on the sidelines when the team resumes play next month in England.

Assigned the Wolfpack's heritage jersey No. 1 with the club, Kay is a pacey winger with a nose for the try-line. He scored 65 tries for Toronto, upping his career total to 159.

""While the fans will remember Liam for his incredible strike rate for games played and tries scored, everyone inside the Wolfpack bubble will also remember his commitment to the cause for the first-ever transatlantic professional sports team,"" Toronto coach Brian McDermott said in a statement.

""We all wish Liam well, and I'm sure I speak for everyone in expressing our gratitude to his efforts over the last four years.""

The move to Wakefield takes the 28-year-old Kay back to where he began his career in 2012. Kay has made more than 150 career appearances for Wakefield, Doncaster (on loan), Leigh Centurions and Toronto.

He was signed by Paul Rowley, Toronto's first coach, who had worked with him at Leigh.

Speaking in 2017, Kay said he committed to Toronto because Rowley ""sold this dream to me."" Several other former Leigh teammates also signed on.

""We kind of jumped into the unknown, when I didn't know what it was,"" said Kay, a native of Leeds. ""I have no regrets. I'm glad I did it.""

Kay made his mark in plenty of games.

He scored in the club's first-ever fixture, a 2017 pre-season friendly against Hull FC. He added two more tries in the Wolfpack's opening 2017 League 1 match against the London Skolars.

And he helped the Wolfpack earn promotion to the second-tier Championship by scoring in five of seven post-season fixtures in 2017.

Kay scored 27 tries that year, which remains a club record. Fellow winger Matty Russell tied the mark in 2019.

Kay opened the 2018 season with a three-try performance against Leigh before a left ankle injury ended his season prematurely. He was involved in a tackle in a game against Halifax when his studs caught in the mud and his ankle rolled the wrong way.

After the ankle did not respond to rehab, he had to undergo surgery that delayed his start to the 2019 campaign. He still finished with 12 tries, helping the team win promotion to the Super League.

This season, he wasted little time scoring Toronto's first-ever try in the top tier — chasing down a Hakim Miloudi kick to touch down in the corner three minutes into Toronto's opening game against Castleford.

Easy to spot with long locks that often did not stay totally in place during games, Kay was a fan favourite.

""I would just like to thank all the fans for your loyal commitment over the last four years, that's including Wolfpack fans in the U.K. and of course the ones in Canada,"" Kay said in a statement. ""It has been a privilege to represent you and I have cherished every moment of it.""

It’s the perfect way to enjoy the glittering sights winding around the 1.2 km loop of the lake, and discover how much Coquitlam’s city centre has to offer - perhaps a latte at one of many great coffee shops to dining from a veritable world of cuisine - all within walking distance.

article continues below

Started in 2011 on the southwest corner of the lake, the Lights at Lafarge grows a little each year as city parks teams add new features, such as more archways glowing with festive bulbs, or free-standing “picture frames” you can pose in front of for that perfect selfie backdrop.

“The display has become a much anticipated event for visitors each year,” says Eric Kalnins, the City of Coquitlam’s tourism manager.

On Nov. 30, the lights were switched on and will remain lit during the evenings, right up to 11 p.m., until the third week in January.

On New Year’s Eve, it will be sparkling until after midnight, making it an ideal place to ring in 2020.

Plus, Lafarge Lake’s location, right in the heart of the city at Town Centre Park (1299 Pinetree Way), makes a trip to see the holiday lights a complete evening adventure.

You can grab a bite from an on-site food truck, enjoy some entertainment on your stroll, and then partake of what the city centre has to offer just minutes away by foot.

“Have a coffee, find a great new restaurant or go to Coquitlam Centre to finish up some last-minute shopping,” Kalnins says. “There’s so much to do around one of the most picturesque, outdoor light shows anywhere.”

You can also combine your visit with the numerous events going on during December - everything from Christmas craft fairs and a traditional performance of The Nutcracker to a Coquitlam Express hockey game and New Year’s Eve beach party.

Midweek is the best time to visit if you want to avoid the crowds at the lake.

If you need to get there by car, plenty of adjacent parking is available.

Public transit, via SkyTrain, offers convenient access thanks to three stops in the city centre area, with the terminus at Lafarge Lake-Douglas, which is steps away from the light display.

Mike notes that there are a number of factors beyond the control of the auto body shop that can affect how long you need to wait.

""Obviously, the first thing is the extent of the damage,"" Mike explains. ""A minor fender bender is likely to take less time to repair than a head-on collision. Having said that, what looks like a minor fender bender could end up requiring extensive repair for unseen damage.""

At Coquitlam Express Auto Body, Mike and his team keep the customer informed every step of the way.

""After the original estimate, we'll be in touch if anything changes,"" says Mike. ""There are no surprises.""

The timing of your accident could also affect how long the repair work can take.

""We do our best to accommodate emergencies and rush work,"" says Mike, ""but sometimes a vehicle will be brought in just before a long-weekend or at peak holiday times. When the shop is closed for a statutory holiday or the repair bay is full, it may take a little longer.""

Customers can find the process for estimating repairs and completing work on Coquitlam Express Auto Body's website.

""Customer satisfaction is our number one priority,"" says Mike. ""We'll give you an estimate of the time needed and we'll let you know if that is likely to change.""

When he started serving lattes and mochas at Eclipps Hair Café in 1994, coffee shops like Tim Horton’s and Starbucks had barely gotten off the ground.

“Lattes were a fairly new concept on the West Coast back then,” he says. “I’ve always had a love of drinking coffee, so we styled the café portion of the hair salon after a coffee shop. It has become a big part of what we’re known for – serving great coffee with fantastic looks.”

Barely into his mid-twenties, Blair had a dream of owning his own business.

“I had been in the hairstyling trade and I saw this opportunity to open up my own business. I had a vision to open up a casual, friendly hair salon.”

Blair found a location and started with just him and five empty salon chairs.

“I had lots of room to grow,” he laughs. “I renovated the space myself, bought some equipment, and worked six days a week for the first two years.”

Thanks to a good business acumen and a love of customer service, Eclipps Hair Café grew in size and reputation.

“I was determined that people should be able to get an amazing look while having a great experience in the process.”

After four years, Blair moved his then team of six stylists from Eclipps’ original 1,000-square-foot location to its present day location.

698,tricitynews,https://www.tricitynews.com/standout/why-environmental-flooring-may-help-you-live-longer-1.2385136,Why environmental flooring may help you live longer,[],,"As President of Nufloors Coquitlam, an award-winning flooring store that’s been serving residents in the Tri-Cities area for nearly thirty years, Niki Jacques has witnessed a lot of change in the home renovation industry.

And she sees a new trend emerging today that may actually improve your health: eco-friendly flooring.

article continues below

“Flooring is a significant investment, regardless of how big an area you’re trying to cover,” says Jacques, whose business has maintained an A+ by the BBB for the past 30 years. “Because of that, there is a tendency to just go with the cheapest option possible. As a result, a lot of people think that eco-friendly flooring is going to be too expensive and will limit their options. That’s not the case at all. And perhaps more importantly, eco-friendly flooring can have a positive impact on your long-term health.”

Here are four reasons for considering eco-friendly flooring for your next flooring job:

1. There are plenty of options: While there might not be quite as many options as you have with traditional flooring, customers still have plenty to choose with eco-friendly flooring, says Jacques. “Cork, bamboo, leather, natural stone, reclaimed hardwood, wool carpet and concrete are all eco-friendly options that would make for a great and long-lasting beautiful touch for a home,” she adds.

2. No Additional Chemicals: When you choose an innovative sustainable floor for your house, you won’t have to use any chemical ingredients for its staining and installation since they can be ordered pre-finished. “This is extremely important for people suffering from various illnesses like asthma or allergies because wood is a hypo-allergic material itself,” says Jacques. “After all, you choose it because it’s natural!”

3. Renewable: More detailed, eco-friendly flooring is made from renewable materials which come from sustainable forests and have been manufactured with what Jacques refers to as a “moral responsibility towards the environment”.

“These types of renewable materials require lower use of energy for timber production, use and disposal,” says Jacques, “plus carbon dioxide emissions are kept at the lower levels. Imagine that a tree captures big amounts of carbon while it grows. When this tree will become a floor, all this carbon will stay away from the atmosphere and that’s because wood has the ability to attract and store carbon inside it.”

In other words, these materials are coming from forests where new trees are planted to immediately replace those that have been cut down.

4. An eco-friendly production process: “Reclaimed wood is a key factor in the production process,” says Jacques. “It’s used from trees that have already been cut down, used or lost in partial fires, and these woods are carefully processed so that metal (from nails), chemicals and other toxins are removed. It’s then remanufactured into suitable flooring.”

Offering an impressive range of flooring styles, colours, textures and finishes—not to mention installation warranties—Nufloors Coquitlam is located at 1100 Landsdowne Drive, Coquitlam.

The other 99% of the sport is far less glittering. A competitive skater will train all year round, five to six days a week, often waking up at the crack of dawn to be on the ice for as long as they possibly can.

Constantly striving to get to the next level, skaters have to push their limits and abilities, leading to bumps and bruises. Figure skating, perhaps more than any other sport, requires dedication, passion, and most importantly, a love of the sport. For 54 years and counting, coaches at the Coquitlam Skating Club have injected their passion and dedication into their skaters, which has fuelled the love of the sport that it requires.

article continues below

Any Canadian skater’s training typically begins at a young age in Canskate, Skate Canada’s “Learn to Skate” program moving through to the Star Skate system, in which they take tests and learn to compete. The next step is Skate Canada’s competitive system working their way up the national ranks.

“What makes the Coquitlam Skating Club unique is that all of the members of the senior coaching staff coach from the Canskate level, all the way to the elite levels of competition” says Yolanda Leggiadro, Club Office Manager. Every coach has at one point been an elite skater, and each of their journeys’ began at a young age. Each coach knows the level of determination and passion that it takes at every step of the way, because they have personally made it to elite levels. More importantly, they have taken their love of skating as athletes into their careers as coaches, and this makes each skater a coach that is passionate about their development. These coaches also pass their knowledge and skill over to the up and coming Junior Coaches who are usually our own Elite skaters who want an opportunity to pass on their knowledge and skill too, therefore, a never ending cycle.

Most coaches of the Coquitlam Skating Club’s senior staff have spent decades with the club, and working together, they have instructed elite talent that has gone on to have success at national and international levels.

But one of the challenges I’ve come across with non-toxic products is that what I gain in natural ingredients, I often lose in effectiveness. (It took much trial and error to finally find a natural deodorant that works, and now I’m hooked on Sola). I’m a huge fan of SPF for its melanoma- and wrinkle-preventing properties (I wear at least SPF 15 on my face year-round), but up until now I haven’t come across a non-toxic sunscreen line that is free of harsh chemicals.

When it comes to evaluating whether a product is safe to put on my skin and hair, I use the Environmental Working Group’s Skin Deep database. I simply type in the name of the product and the database provides a rating from 1 to 10 (1 being the least toxic and 10 being the most).

Dr. Mark Lupin of Cosmedica in Victoria says when shopping for a non-toxic sunscreen or sunblock you should look for a formula that uses mineral active ingredients such as zinc oxide and/or titanium dioxide, instead of the chemical filters oxybenzone, avobenzone, octisalate, octocrylene, homosalate and octinoxate included in most sunscreens on the market. Also, look for the words ""Broad Spectrum” on the sunscreen label as this indicates that, in addition to UVB protection represented by the SPF rating, the product also protects from UVA rays which can contribute to skin cancer and premature aging.

Here are four non-toxic suncare brands I recommend trying this summer:

1) Beautycounter, the skincare and makeup line known for its commitment to using non-toxic ingredients, has just launched a line of non-toxic suncare products for body and face formulated with non-nano zinc oxide and antioxidant-rich California Poppy. Most of the products boast EWG ratings of 1 and are available in mist, lotion and stick formulas, perfect for the whole family to use.

2) Vancouver-based natural product brand A Healthy Beginning makes a zinc oxide-based SPF 25 Whipped Mineral Sun Butter which contains raspberry seed oil to boost sun protection and hydrate the skin. All ingredients have a low EWG rating, the product packaging uses minimal plastic, and the butter can be used on the face and body (and is perfect for kids, too).

3) Josie Maran loves her argan oil and she makes a beautifully scented, chemical-free facial oil that protects with an SPF of 47, and is available at Sephora.

4) Also available at Sephora with EWG ratings between 1 and 3 is Coola's range of non-toxic SPF products which includes a White Tea Face Sport SPF 50 and an SPF 30 Sunscreen Spray Pina Colada.

Whichever sunscreen you choose, be sure to apply 30 minutes before sun exposure, reapplying every two hours, and after swimming.

Having a maintenance schedule for your vehicle will remind you of necessary visits and will save you time and money in the long run.

“We’re looking for small things, so you don’t have huge surprises down the road,” says Shelly Smith, owner of Port Moody Auto & Air. “After all, if you come to us and have a huge bill, you’re not going to want to come back.”

article continues below

Here are the top four areas that need regular maintenance, according to Smith:

1. Oil: “Too many people don’t think an oil change is that important and it’s killing their cars,” says Smith. “Oil is the life blood of your vehicle. It keeps the engine running smoothly. We recommend changing it every 5,000 kilometres. That’s only $40 or $50 on a regular basis. That’s so much cheaper than replacing an engine, which can start at $3,000.”

An oil change in most shops will also include tire, light, filter and brake checks, as well as fluid top-ups.

2. Brakes: If you’re bringing in your car regularly for tune-ups and oil changes, you should get advance warning if there’s anything wrong with your brakes, and when they will need changing. That will give you some time to plan and save money for when the work has to be done.

“If you don’t keep a regular maintenance schedule, things can be going wrong that you’ll never know about,” Smith says. “You have a mom with three kids coming in and suddenly her brakes are down to nothing.”

3. Tires: Inflating your tires properly and assessing them regularly for damage will allow your tires to last longer and prevent serious accidents. If you don’t know how to check the pressure or tread, ask a mechanic to do it. It only takes a few minutes.

4. Cooling system flush: This should be done every two years, says Smith. The older the coolant, the more acidic it gets, and if it’s not changed, it will start to eat away at the engine components, leading to very expensive repairs.

If you want to set up a maintenance schedule for your car, contact Port Moody Auto & Air’s services. Visit their website, call 604-461-7856 or email. You can also find Port Moody Auto & Air on Facebook.",[]

Sky Zone Trampoline Park, which opened in March, is perfect for those looking for a unique adventure close to home.

“We offer a wow experience,” says owner Morey Chaplick.

Action on the trampolines is overseen by court monitors who train for weeks at Sky Zone University, and there is always a manager on site.

Chaplick is extremely proud of his employees, saying they offer great customer service.

“We call them our orange army of Wow,” he says, adding employees get instant rewards for going above and beyond on the job.

Part of what makes his employees so special is their dedication to safety, he says. It is a big part of what makes Sky Zone unique in the region.

“Like any sport or activity, you have to have guidelines,” says Chaplick. “If there are no guidelines, people get hurt.”

He takes safety very seriously, while ensuring customers have a great time, too.

The 30,000-square-foot facility has plenty of oversight from employees who are prepared to handle any situation, from giving bouncing advice to treating minor injuries.

And with more than 10,000 people visiting the facility since it opened, they’ve only had to treat a rolled ankle so far, Chaplick says.

The Surrey trampoline park is the only Sky Zone west of Manitoba. The company has been in business for 20 years and has 200 franchises worldwide.

Sky Zone in Surrey is at 11125-124th Street, just on the other side of the Pattullo Bridge.

If students understand the basics, they don’t hate math, they love it.

This philosophy drives Mathnasium, an after-school math learning centre that helps children from kindergarten to grade 12.

“Our approach is different,” says Dr. Anoma Mudalige, owner and executive director of the Tri-Cities Mathnasium. “We want kids to understand the basic foundation of math really well, by giving them a number sense and improving their analytical, critical thinking and problem solving skills. We want to make math make sense to them.”

Located in Pinetree Village, Mathnasium combines quality, personalized instruction in a fun environment through well trained instructors.

When students first enter the program, Mathnasium does a comprehensive assessment to understand their strengths and skill gaps. After that, they will receive an individual learning plan to work through with their engaged, face-to-face instructors.

“Anyone can learn math,” Dr. Mudalige says. “Whether your child is behind, at grade level or eager to get ahead, Mathnasium can help.”

Mathnasium’s focus is on fostering an understanding of the foundational skills of math. By completing the work themselves under the supervision of instructors, children are able to grow in confidence by improving their skills.

“We love to see that lightbulb moment in their heads, when they understand,” Dr. Mudalige says.

Award-winning instructors also offer emotional support and encouragement to help kids get over the mental hurdle of being intimidated by numbers. Mathnasium makes learning fun by using math games to teach concepts and motivates students to complete their work by using a rewards program that allows them to collect rewards for finished problems.

Recently, Mathnasium has partnered with local libraries and schools to run math game events as a way to help to improve math literacy in the community.

“We line up our learning time with the school curriculum so students get direct support,” Dr. Mudalige says. “Our focus is on improving math fluency and on the way, we help them reach their goals.”

Rest Your Head: Set on an expansive double lot in a community nestled on the hill overlooking Gibsons Marina, The Seasalt Cottage is a quiet home base from which to explore Gibsons Landing and the nearby towns of Sechelt and Roberts Creek. The owner, Michele, has lovingly renovated the two guest suites—one on the ground level and one on the “Upper Deck,” in the complex in which she resides with her adorable French bulldog, Chloe.Each suite is bright and stylishly decorated with plush furnishings and marine-inspired décor touches (think seashells and a white and blue pastel colour scheme). Both guest units boast soaker tubs, TVs/Netflix, wifi and kitchenettes which are perfect for those wanting to stay for more than a couple of nights (and who wouldn’t want that when this adorable pup is one of your hosts?).

article continues below

While the interiors are pristine and calming, the exterior space at The Seasalt Cottage is truly spectacular. Both suites have their own private patios where guests can enjoy a glass of wine while relaxing and enjoying the refreshing sea breeze. These terraces extend onto a huge garden filled where undulating pathways winding past lush bushes, vines and flowers.

Michele has created a few different seating areas nestled within the garden where guests can while away summer afternoons swaying in one of the suspended rocking chairs while taking in views of the sparkling sea and listening to the sound of water trickling from the fountains installed throughout the garden. Guests can also make use of the communal barbecue, grilling up seafood bought at the Gibsons Farmer’s Market (or caught on a fishing trip) and enjoying it in the outdoor dining area under a grapevine-covered arbour.

Wine & Dine: Just a three-minute walk down the hill from The Seasalt Cottage you’ll find an array of hip boutiques, coffee shops, restaurants and pubs at Gibsons Landing. My friend Fran and I arrived late on a Friday night and as soon as we dropped our bags in our suite we made a beeline to Tapworks pub, on Michele’s recommendation. The brewery has recently expanded from a hole-in-the-wall behind Gibsons Art Gallery to a two-level hotspot to see-and-be-seen while sipping locally crafted brews.

After ascending to the second floor, Fran and I made ourselves comfortable next to the firepit and ordered beer tasting flights, flatbread and spinach and artichoke dip from the snack menu. It wasn’t long before we had made friends with a couple of folks in their sixties who were visiting from West Vancouver and a group of twenty-somethings who were in town from Kitsilano. By the end of the night, we were playing board games with our new friends in the pub’s first-floor area. I mentioned to Fran later that night that it was Gibsons’ friendly small-town vibe that had likely inspired us to bond with complete strangers so quickly: if we had encountered the same people in a Vancouver bar we probably wouldn’t have connected in the same way.

Other notable (and super hip) dining experiences in Gibsons include Buono Osteria, a new Italian restaurant with a warm ambiance that overlooks the marina. Opened by Wally Buono’s son, the eatery serves traditional Italian fare with a modern twist, as well as excellent wines. Fran and I loved the locally foraged wild mushroom Bucatini with celery root and sherry cream. For happy hour drinks, super fresh oysters and a fun environment, head to Smitty’s Oyster House which is set right on the water. Next door Lunitas Mexican Eatery serves up beer, margaritas and excellent Mexican fare.

No trip to Gibsons is complete without a meal at the infamous Molly’s Reach restaurant which made its mark in the ’70s as one of the locations in the infamous Beachcombers series. On Day 2, Fran and I started our morning with a bacon and egg breakfast at the eatery while listening to Elvis tunes and overlooking Gibsons Marina.

Later in the day we had coffee at the locally owned and operated Beachcomber Coffee shop, an energetic little place located right on Gibsons’ Gower Point strip. I loved the unexpected, youthful vibe of the space known for its neon yellow and green branding and club-style music. On the last morning of my stay, after Fran had returned to Vancouver, I sat on the patio for a couple of hours, drinking coffee and snacking on pastries from Sandy’s Bake Shoppe down the street, people-watching, chatting with the locals and listening as they caught up on life.

Explore: The Sunshine Coast is a haven for nature-lovers so hiking, kayaking, fishing and beach-going are givens for visitors to the area. Soames Hill is a beautiful intermediate hike that we completed in about an hour and rewarded us with spectacular views of the Georgia Strait and Keats and Bowen Islands. Davis Bay is a beautiful beach to park yourself for the day with a blanket and a book. And for breathtaking sunsets Bonniebrook beach comes highly recommended by the locals I chatted with a Beachcomber Coffee.

But there is also lots to do right in Gibsons. You could spend a few hours visiting the many shops and boutiques along the strip which sell well-curated homewares and local art, as we did. And the Gibsons Public Market, opened in March 2017, is a fun place to pick up local cheeses, fresh fish, produce and flowers, and to visit the Nicholas Sonntag Marine Education Centre which temporarily holds local marine life in its tanks until they are returned to their natural habitat.

After spending a weekend getting to know Gibsons, it’s strange for me to think that it was once a town I’d drive through, without a thought, on my way to Sechelt. Now I realize it’s a gem in its own right—and I’ll definitely be back the next time I want a fun and laid back experience just a boat ride from Vancouver.

The same survival kit that can be bought for earthquake preparedness will also serve as a grab-and-go bag for any number of emergencies.

In British Columbia, we don't see the magnitude of natural disasters as do other areas of the continent or world, but, according to the ""Get Prepared"" website of the federal government, British Columbia is at particular risk for other catastrophic events such as avalanches, floods, landslides, and wild fires in addition to earthquakes.

Even something as simple as an extended power outage, similar to those experienced in the province of New Brunswick in early 2017, bring home the need to be able to cook, obtain clean water, and keep warm until the power is restored or help arrives.

BC Quake Premium Survival Supplies is a local family-run disaster preparedness company and offers a variety of survival and first aid kits designed to keep us all self-sufficient in an emergency. Contents vary, but include items such as:

· First aid kit

· Food bars

· Water packs

· Whistle

· Blanket

· Emergency ponchos

· Cold packs

· Candle and matches

· Foldable camp stove and heat

· Emergency cube tent

“Over the past couple of years we’ve seen significant fires and flooding here in Canada and your survival kit might be the only thing you have time to grab in an emergency” says owner of BC Quake and Community Fire Prevention Brett Johnston.

Kits are pre-made for one to five individuals and there are special kits for groups of 15 or more for sports teams or organizations. BC Quake Premium Survival Supplies also sell individual items for topping up or replenishing existing kits.

Keeping a disaster preparedness kit in your vehicle is also a good idea, according to ""Get Prepared"". Snow, black ice, wind, and even breakdowns or minor accidents can result in motorists being stranded for a period of time.

In February 2017, the Coquihalla highway was closed for almost 24 hours and motorists were left to fend for themselves after freezing rain and temperatures created unsafe driving conditions. Many motorists complained of the cold, hunger, and relying on melted snow to keep hydrated. An emergency kit would supply blankets to keep warm and water purifying tablets to ensure a safe drinking source.

""Good dental hygiene and regular check-ups are key to avoiding any major dental work down the road,"" he says. ""Catch a small cavity before it gets too big and watch for older fillings that may need to be replaced.""

article continues below

The root canal procedure involves cleaning out infected matter from the soft tissue, or pulp, inside the tooth and replacing it with an anti-bacterial filling. Preventing bacteria from entering the tooth in the first place will delay the need for a root canal.

""By ignoring cavities and not having them filled means they will grow in size. If the cavity gets too big, the infection can spread to the nerve, necessitating a root canal procedure.""

One question Dr. Parhar hears a lot is: ""Can I avoid a root canal by taking antibiotics?""

""Unfortunately, no,"" he says. ""The reason is that other parts of your body, such as a finger or a foot, have a substantial flow of blood supply that moves the medication to where it's needed to help with removing the infection and facilitating the healing process. While teeth do have a blood supply, it's through small vessels and the teeth can't get an adequate supply of antibiotics to remove the infection.""

In other words, antibiotics may help temporarily, but medication won't completely resolve the issue.

""The tooth is in a very isolated environment,"" Dr. Parhar explains. ""Medication is useful for pain until you can get to see your dentist or come to Tri-City Endodontics, but it won't solve the problem over the long-term.""

Another question Dr. Parhar hears a lot is: ""Does a root canal hurt?""

""To be honest, sometimes,"" he answers. ""But you're having a root canal because you're in pain and because you have an infection. In most cases, the local anesthetic we use will work perfectly well. However, if the tooth is badly infected and already painful and you're stressed and upset, the anesthetic may not work as effectively and the procedure may be uncomfortable. However, afterward the tooth will feel much better and the pain will be gone.”

Dr. Parhar and Tri-City Endodontics specialize in root canal procedures and infections in the soft tissue area of teeth. Most patients are referred by their regular dentist, but Dr. Parhar is open to direct patient consultation, particularly for people looking for a second opinion on treatment options.

708,tricitynews,https://www.tricitynews.com/lifestyles/struggling-boutique-gyms-navigate-unique-covid-19-pandemic-challenges-1.24171345,Struggling boutique gyms navigate unique COVID-19 pandemic challenges,['Lori Ewing'],,"TORONTO — Amy Aldrich-Witt peered up at the threatening clouds on a recent early morning in Toronto.

""Hopefully the rain holds off,"" she said.

article continues below

The 32-year-old owner of Delta Train Liberty Village, a gym tucked among the repurposed industrial buildings the neighbourhood is known for, was about to put six members through an outdoor workout in the parking lot.

Rain would mean cancelling the class — yet another blow four months after Aldrich-Witt closed her doors because of COVID-19.

Gyms are among businesses that can reopen across much of Ontario on Friday, as part of Stage 3 of the province's restart plan. Aldrich-Witt will have to wait to head indoors however; the Greater Toronto Area and parts of southern Ontario must remain in Stage 2 for now.

Gyms in some other provinces have already been allowed to reopen after those regions loosened certain public health restrictions.

Like many small businesses, the global pandemic has brought boutique gyms to their knees. While many quickly pivoted to online workouts, and more recently to small outdoor workouts, those don't begin to pay the bills.

""So far it hasn't covered rent for this month,"" Aldrich-Witt said. ""But I would rather do (the outdoor workouts) than stay closed. I know my workout for me, it's for my mental well-being as well as physical. So, I want to make sure (members) have that.""

The outdoor workouts have been well-received by cooped-up members who've been climbing the walls for the past four months.

""Oh my god, so good,"" she said of being able to see members in person again. ""Everyone's so happy to work out.""

The rain held out on this particular morning. The six members happily huffed and puffed through burpees, kettlebell swings, and deadlifts. They each had their own equipment, and were spaced out on their own large square of gym flooring — hauled outside during a set-up process that takes Aldrich-Witt an hour.

The equipment was carefully cleaned and the floor mopped down between classes.

Jennifer Lau opened Toronto's Fit Squad with two co-owners just six months before the global pandemic shut them down. They've recently started holding outdoor classes in David Pecaut Square, but the fees barely put a dent in the bills, including the $30,000 monthly rent on their 6,000-square-foot downtown gym.

Fit Squad has held virtual classes on Zoom almost since Day 1 of the lockdown. Having a schedule and some semblance of structure kept them sane, she said, because ""we were fish out of water. We had no idea. The future was so uncertain.""

Aldrich-Witt also runs daily Zoom workouts, and said she gets as much out of them as her members.

""It does give you a purpose, right?"" she said. ""I knew I had to wake up every day, I knew I had to do these workouts.

""And it also made a difference being able to see everyone online because you feel like you're connected to other people.""

Home exercise equipment has been scarce for some. Lau got a kick out of seeing members substitute everything from weighted suitcases to jugs of laundry detergent for weights.

""Looking back at it now, had we known the hot commodity that was a dumbbell or a kettlebell, we could have sold all our equipment and been fine,"" she laughed. ""Kettle bells were going for like $400 apiece, it was insane.""

While the chance to reopen offers some hope, small Ontario gyms aren't out of the woods yet. Gyms in the province will be permitted up to 50 people, but physical distancing will require two metres of space between members.

Aldrich-Witt figures she'll be able to operate at 10 members per class, significantly lower than pre-novel coronavirus capacity.

Lau said a poll of their members showed some don't feel comfortable returning to the gym until there's a vaccine.

""The market is going to be completely different going back into this,"" she said. ""Some people have lost their jobs and people just don't feel comfortable leaving the house.""

Mike Morrison, who owns F45 Training Ancaster in Hamilton with wife Julie Jarvie, said their membership base had dropped by more than 70 per cent. Most of the drop-off has come in recent weeks, which Morrison blames mostly on the sunny weather.

The Stage 3 protocols were good news to the couple, who figure they can have 15 people per class based on their square footage. It's still well off their pre-COVID-19 numbers of 27 to 36 people, but it's a better number than they'd feared and ""a bit of weight off"" their shoulders.

""Now the challenge will be how to showcase our safety protocols being followed — no equipment sharing, no movement around the studio, full cleaning between classes, etc. — to prove that we can and will be a safe environment,"" Morrison said.

Alex Kucharski is a founder of the Ontario Independent Fitness Studio Association, which was formed during the pandemic to give small gyms a voice. Kucharski said the biggest concern was being lumped in with big-box gyms, but the Stage 3 protocols announced Monday were the same for both. Even large gyms such as GoodLife Fitness will require members to book workout times in advance to stay within capacity limits.

""The physical distancing guidelines for capacity are certainly a great step forward for all fitness studios,"" said Kucharski, who owns an F45 gym in Richmond Hill, Ont.

""We now await to see when the rest of our Ontario studios can reopen and hope to see expanded rent relief measures for August.""

Aldrich-Witt's landlord allowed her to defer the first couple months of her rent, while Lau's landlord took the rent out of their security deposit. Both landlords have since applied on their behalf for Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance (CECRA), although the program hasn't been extended beyond July.

The 30-year-old Morrison and Jarvie, 29, who've owned their gym for just a year, said these have been ""probably the hardest days of our lives, because we have invested our entire blood, sweat, tears into our first year to create this community for ourselves and our members. It's the connections with people you've made, and knowing that for so many of our members, that 45 minutes was an outlet for them to relieve the daily stresses.

""And all of a sudden, everyone's daily stresses just got that much worse, and we were no longer able to support them.""

While they're all managing to keep their heads above water, numerous Ontario gyms have closed their doors permanently.

Brothers Chris and Marty Smits recently shuttered Forme Fitness, the Toronto gym they'd owned for the past five years.

""It was a gut-wrenching decision,"" Chris said. ""My brother and I love our clients, we love the community, we love the gym, right?

""But the model that we created is no longer safe, you can't move forward using a large group model, and then a lot of these people that we created this business model for are millennials and the working class — a lot of them lost their jobs. So the disposable income for a $300 a month membership, or $200 membership is now gone. So, it's a pretty dire situation.""

Smits said they pored over the numbers countless times to try to make it work, but didn't want to go into more debt, especially when a second wave of the pandemic could hit.

""So it's like, at some point, you got to stop the bleeding and just take your loss and, and try to figure out what the next move is.""

That next move for Smits and his wife Elle Daftarian is launching an eight-week virtual challenge that's a physical and lifestyle reset. There are 40 participants, and part of the challenge is virtual workouts run by Smits. There are also weekly team challenges, information videos on sleep, nutrition, motivation, etc.

""There is a silver lining to this pandemic,"" he said. ""And I'm excited.""
