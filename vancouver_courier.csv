The notion of establishing a framework to commercialize cannabis began as a promise by the Liberal Party in the 2015 federal election campaign that led to Justin Trudeau becoming prime minister. The implementation of the policy was not as smooth as first envisioned, and the provincial governments were put in charge of setting guidelines for the sale and consumption of marijuana.

article continues below

Research Co. and Glacier Media have been tracking perceptions about legalization every six months in British Columbia. Our latest survey shows that agreement with the new rules remains high across the entire province, that some residents are starting to ponder a future when other drugs could be treated in the same fashion as cannabis, and that – in stark contrast with what we found last year – marijuana users in British Columbia are starting to acquire all of their product through licensed retailers.

As more time passes, British Columbians appear happier with the decision to end prohibition. Seven in 10 of the province’s residents (70%) agree with marijuana being legal in Canada, while 26% disagree and 3% are undecided.

These findings represent a seven-point increase since a similar survey conducted in October 2019, as legal cannabis approached its first anniversary. The groups that are more likely to voice satisfaction with the new status quo are men (75%), British Columbians aged 35 to 54 (76%) and residents of northern B.C. (80%).

In recent weeks, we have seen more talk about creating a safe supply for drugs that are currently available only through illegal means. The impact of these discussions has led to a shift in the views of British Columbians about legalizing all drugs. It must be completely acknowledged that sizable majorities of the province’s residents continue to oppose a move to place any controlled substance inside a store, but the proponents of this option have grown since late last year.

At least two-thirds of British Columbians are opposed to legalizing ecstasy (66%), powder cocaine (70%), heroin (72%), crack cocaine (73%), methamphetamine or “crystal meth” (74%) and fentanyl (75%).

Support for making some of these drugs available in a fashion that would conceivably meet the same guidelines that govern cannabis has risen over the past six months, to 25% for cocaine (up from 18%) and to 24% for heroin (up from 19%). While these are still low proportions, the fluctuation could signal the start of a trend.

Just 10% of British Columbians say they only consumed marijuana after it became legal. Identical proportions of residents tried it before October 2018 (45%) or have never consumed it in Canada (also 45%). The incidence of “legal-only” marijuana users is highest among residents aged 18 to 34 (18%) and those who live in southern B.C. (19%).

But perhaps the biggest surprise, and a source of satisfaction for policy makers, is the way in which cannabis is being sought by users. Just over half of British Columbians who have consumed marijuana since legalization (51%) say that all of their product was acquired at a licensed retailer. In October 2019, only 31% of cannabis consumers in the province were getting all of their product at a licensed retailer.

We still see 16% of British Columbians who say none of their marijuana has been bought at a licensed retailer – a proportion that climbs to 25% among those aged 55 and over. Two-thirds of cannabis consumers aged 35 to 54 (68%) are buying all of their product at a licensed retailer.

Even though the delivery of cannabis products has improved over the past six months, there are significant regional differences that are indubitably related to the presence of stores in specific areas of the province. Cannabis consumers who reside in southern B.C. and Metro Vancouver are the most likely to be getting all of their product from licensed retailers (63% and 62%). The numbers are significantly lower in Vancouver Island (29%), northern B.C. (24%) and the Fraser Valley (19%).

Finally, the issue of “drug testing” remains a priority for British Columbians, with 61% saying that companies in the province should “definitely” or “probably” be able to administer these examinations to any employee now that marijuana is legal.

After a bumpy start that featured slow store openings and hitches with delivery options, there are signs that cannabis legalization is starting to work in a better fashion. More consumers are getting all of their product through licensed retailers, and the number of “new users” has not increased dramatically. Still, the significant regional disparities suggest that more marijuana outlets will need to be authorized in order to effectively eliminate the black market.

Mario Canseco is president of Research Co.

Results are based on an online study conducted from July 10 to July 12, 2020, among 800 adult British Columbians. The data has been statistically weighted according to Canadian census figures for age, gender and region in British Columbia. The margin of error, which measures sample variability, is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.",[]

The ban could be in place next Tuesday after council reviews a staff report that also recommends a $1,000 fine be levied against anyone who sets off or sells a bear banger.

article continues below

Further penalties could include prosecution and loss of a business licence.

Residents, however, who require bangers for their intended purpose — wilderness encounters with animals, primarily bears — can continue to purchase them online or in stores outside Vancouver that carry the devices.

Earlier this month, council requested staff prepare amendments to the fire and ticket offences bylaws to ban the devices. In May, complaints began to pour in to the city’s 3-1-1 phone service of loud, explosive sounds heard throughout downtown and surrounding areas.

As of July 8, the city received 180 complaints and Vancouver police fielded reports of 327 over the same time period related to the devices. The report said some of the 507 calls could have been from the same caller about one incident.

Police say they don’t know what sparked the sudden use in bangers.

“I’m actually not too sure,” said Const. Tania Visintin, a VPD media relations officer, in an email Thursday.

Bangers, which are about the size of a roll of dimes, are usually fired from various types of launchers and can travel between 20 and 100 metres before letting out an explosive bang.

In some cases, police investigations discovered bangers were modified with ball bearings and a fuse for use as an improvised explosive device, or IED.

In one case, such a device was set off against the wall of a downtown building, shaking the walls and causing “significant distress to residents and people in the vicinity,” the staff report said.

In another case, police found a stuffed animal toy in a downtown park with an IED strapped to the underside. The report doesn’t indicate whether anyone has been injured from the devices.

The bangers can be purchased at outdoor supply stores in Vancouver and other parts of the region. A package of six typically sells for $20. Retailers are not required to maintain records of purchasers, or limit the number sold.

The sale of bear spray, however, requires the purchaser to be at least 18 years old and provide their name and address to a retailer, who records the amount purchased.

A signed “notice to purchaser agreement” is also part of the transaction, which outlines the legal uses of the spray and contains a liability warning.

The report said buyers of bear bangers tend to be people who work in forestry and mineral exploration, and people who spend time in the outdoors for recreation such as hiking, camping and mountain biking.

In preparing the report, staff consulted nine retailers and three suppliers of bangers. Others consulted included outdoor recreation clubs and associations, conservationist groups, conservation officers, industries that use the devices in the field to protect workers and the B.C. Society for the Prevention of Cruelty towards Animals (BCSPCA).

“Most of the groups consulted were supportive of a ban on the discharge and retail sale of exploding animal deterrents in Vancouver, with the exception of some retailers and a few outdoor recreation and industry groups that do not support a ban on sale,” said the report, noting gun stores were among those opposed to the ban on sales of bangers.

One supplier, the report added, thought prohibition of bangers would be an “extreme reaction” to take by council. Meanwhile, the BCSPCA told staff it was unaware of any documented cases of pets in distress, or gone missing because of noise made by bangers.

But, the report added, that may be because cases attributed to fireworks were actually due to bear bangers, with pet owners likely unable to distinguish between the two sounds.

This Halloween will be the last one for Vancouver residents who like to set off fireworks, with council deciding in November 2019 to ban the sale and use of fireworks to and by the general public after Oct. 31, 2020.

If council passes the staff recommendations Tuesday, Vancouver will join Delta, Pitt Meadows, Township of Langley, Rossland, Vernon and Dawson Creek as cities that have either regulated or banned the use of bangers.

Provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix announced July 15 that there were 21 new cases in the past 24 hours, including two cases that they call ""epi-linked,"" or presumed cases that have not been proven through testing but are being treated as official cases.

article continues below

The province has now recorded 3,149 cases since the novel coronavirus first appeared in B.C. in late January.

More than 87.4% of those infected, or 2,753 people, have recovered. Of those who haven't, 189 people have died and 207 people are actively fighting the virus. Only 14 people are hospitalized, with five of those in intensive care units. The rest are self-isolating at home. There were no new deaths recorded in the past 24 hours.

Recording at least 20 new COVID-19 cases in a 24-hour period has become common in B.C., and Henry said yesterday that she found that number ""distressing,"" even though, she added, the good news is that the province knows where the clusters of infection are, many of the infections are linked and the number is not really that large given the province's population of more than five million residents.

The numbers in the past week were:

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12;

• 21 new cases on July 13;

• 13 new cases on July 14; and now

• 21 new cases on July 15.

In June, the number of daily new cases many times was in the single digits.

""There is one active community outbreak, in addition to several community exposure events,"" Henry and Dix said. ""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks.""

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,023 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,659 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 216 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 51 people who reside outside Canada.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons is expected to take Sidoo into custody on September 23 and release him from a Pacific Northwest area facility just before Christmas.

article continues below

Sidoo, 61, appeared online via Zoom in front of United States District Judge Nathaniel Gorton of the United States District Court for District of Massachusetts, as well as his lawyers and prosecutors. He wore a plaid suit while sitting in an office space inside his $31.7 million home in Vancouver’s Point Grey neighbourhood.

Sidoo, now a convicted felon, initially pled innocent to fraud and money laundering charges; he teared up before being sentenced and read a prepared statement:

“The last several months have been the hardest in my entire life and today I accept the court’s decision without reservation. No words can express how sorry I am for my decisions and actions that led to this day. I make no excuses, your honour. I broke the law and pled guilty and I now must pay for my actions.

“To my wife and boys, all I ever wanted was your love and respect and to be a good role model. And I know I have made a terrible mistake that has deeply affected our family. To my friends and colleagues and former teammates over the years, I am deeply ashamed today. To the young men and women who looked up to me as a role model, you deserve better. To the court and all of you, I wish to apologize for my actions.

“I will serve my sentence and am committed to returning to the community and doing everything possible to make a positive impact. I hope in time people will not judge me for the worst mistake in my life but for the work in the days, weeks and years ahead in which I am committed to being a better man.”

Gorton told Sidoo he was “impressed” by the businessman’s “obvious remorse.”

But Gorton pointed out two omissions in Sidoo’s statement.

“You expect to put this behind you and go forward and make up for what you called mistakes. I would call it a crime, not a mistake, but nevertheless, it is important that you acknowledge it and realize how many constituencies you have disappointed,” said the judge.

Sidoo also did not explicitly acknowledge that his crimes resulted in two students missing an opportunity to attend the universities his sons, Dylan Sidoo and Jordan Sidoo, were admitted to.

“What you accomplished, along with getting them into college, is to deprive two other deserving students of admittance into those universities — an act that is the very antithesis of one you want to be known for,” said Gorton.

Likewise, United States Attorney Andrew Lelling submitted to Gorton: “Sidoo engaged in serious criminal conduct involving fraud and deception that stretched over multiple years.

“His crimes warrant significant punishment. By engaging in the scheme, with [scheme mastermind Rick Singer] and others, Sidoo was able to steal two college admissions slots for his sons, including one from the University of California at Berkeley, one of the top public universities in the nation.”

Sidoo, said Gorton, “committed a crime that displayed an unbelievable lack of integrity, morality and common sense.

“You have let your selfish desire, your pride and your enormous wealth overcome all of what you apparently want to stand for with your works of charity,” Gorton told Sidoo.

Sidoo’s philanthropy, derived from his earnings in the capital markets, was central to his sentencing defense. According to Sidoo he has donated several million dollars to charitable causes, such as the University of B.C. football program.

In pleading guilty to fraud, Sidoo avoided a maximum prison term of 20 years and prosecutors subsequently agreed to 90 days behind bars, plus a $250,000 fine and one-year of supervised release, which will not be enforced in Canada by the U.S. Probation Department. Prosecutors also agreed to drop the money laundering charge.

The prison Sidoo goes to is expected to have harsher conditions since his options are limited due to his foreign citizenship. His attorney Martin Weinberg said he is expected to spend 14 days in isolation in a “maximum security setting,” due to COVID-19.

Sidoo will get four days credit for time already served. If he serves the full 90 days he will be released December 17 but will have to spend 14 days in isolation at home should B.C. public health rules for international travellers and COVID-19 continue into the fall.

Gorton said Sidoo’s crime would normally warrant more time in jail but there are mitigating circumstances, such as his remorse, lack of criminal record, philanthropy and “collateral consequences,” such as not being able to enter the U.S. as a felon and being stripped last month of his Order of B.C. medal for community service. Sidoo’s attorneys also previously noted he did not directly pay the universities but that his fraud was limited to cheating on the tests.

The former B.C. Lions football player worked as a stock broker in the 1990s and an investment banker between 2000 and 2010. Since 2010 he has made millions of dollars directing a handful of public companies that have failed to generate wealth for retail investors.

Sidoo was arrested March 8, 2019, in San Jose, California, on charges by the U.S. Department of Justice of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering related to the high-profile U.S. college admissions and bribery scandal, brought to light by a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe dubbed Operation Varsity Blues.

One of dozens of parents to be charged, Sidoo initially pled innocent to paying $200,000 total to scheme mastermind William ‘Rick’ Singer, who hired corrupt exam expert Mark Riddell to take Dylan and Jordan’s SAT exams, in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Sidoo also helped falsify one of his son Jordan’s university applications in October 2013 with an essay that originally included a fake claim of Jordan being held up at gunpoint by gangsters, while he was purported to be an intern for an anti-gang organization.

Co-conspirators Singer and Riddell pled guilty last year in exchange for cooperating with the government’s investigation.

The guilty parties in the case, who used Singer’s criminal services, were generally well-off individuals. Celebrities such as actress Lori Loughlin and her clothing designer husband Mossimo Gianulli and actress Felicity Huffman also pled guilty for related crimes and brought much media attention to the investigation.

Sidoo’s sons had no involvement in their father’s crime.

Jordan is now a 2018 history graduate from University of California Berkeley. Dylan graduated in cinematic arts in 2016 from the University of Southern California (USC). The two previously attended Vancouver’s prestigious St. George’s School.

Neither university has announced whether or not their degrees will remain valid. Dylan, according to the sentencing documents, had scored a 1,460/2,400 SAT score until Riddell, using a fake ID in December 2011, bumped up the score to 1,700, which was high enough for Dylan to enter Chapman University (and later transfer to USC). Riddell then scored 2,280/2,400 for Jordan in December 2012, paving the way to Berkley.

Riddell also took a high school test for Dylan. The B.C. Ministry of Education has issued no statement on how its testing process was so vulnerable to fraud.

Both sons have since entered into penny stock promotion with their father.

But for those who refuse to leave, like the dozens of people camped out since last month in Strathcona Park, the new version of the “parks control bylaw” will test how far the board is willing to go to clear an encampment.

article continues below

So far, it appears the tent city will remain, at least as far as Shauna Wilton, acting park board general manager, indicated on the first of two nights of meetings to consider the bylaw revisions.

“This [revised bylaw] was not targeted at Strathcona specifically, but is something that we need to do broadly, knowing the impact to all of the park system from homelessness and sheltering,” Wilton told commissioners Monday.

“I think what this bylaw will do is to give our staff a tool for ongoing discussion with those in the encampment, in terms of trying to manage that space.”

More than 200 tents are pitched in the far end of Strathcona Park. The encampment borders a parking area on Raymur Avenue, where people also live in recreational vehicles, vans and cars.

The changes to the bylaw were made to put the park board in line with a B.C. Supreme Court ruling that gave homeless people the constitutional right to sleep overnight in a park.

But the park board also made a series of significant additions to the bylaw, including setting criteria that limits homeless people to sleep in 26 per cent, or 867 acres of a possible 3,320 acres of park and green space.

The board hasn’t identified specific parks that would fall under the 26 per cent, but the criteria prevents temporary shelters to be erected near schools, playgrounds, sports fields, beaches, community centres, golf courses, the seawall, environmentally sensitive areas, gardens, horticultural displays and picnic areas.

The bylaw also requires homeless people to only occupy a three-metre by three-metre space and not to leave a tent, or structure, unattended. People also must pack up in the morning and leave a park or green space.

Whether that will be enforced by park rangers, who work closely with police, was not made clear during debate, with many speakers suggesting it was an impossible task.

What was made clear by commissioners, including board chairperson Camil Dumont and many of the dozens of people who spoke at the meetings, was that addressing homelessness was not the park board’s mandate.

“We need help — we need help from the city, we need help from the province, we need help from the federal government to provide wraparound services to build into the system solutions for these problems,” Dumont said.

“We can’t do it alone, as the park board. We can be willing partners in the conversation and I understand us to be that.”

Dumont joined commissioners Stuart Mackinnon, Dave Demers and Gwen Giesbrecht in supporting the revised bylaw. All had different reasons for their support, but emphasized the need to have the bylaw upgraded to adhere to the B.C. Supreme court ruling.

“We are here not because any of us want to be, but because of a court ruling we need to be,” Mackinnon said.

“Our current bylaws have been deemed an infringement of individual rights under our Charter by the courts, and as such, need to be changed. For some, change is unacceptable. But as an elected official of government, I have no choice but to ensure our bylaws are in compliance with the courts, the laws and the constitution.”

Added Mackinnon: “We are also here because of the failure of senior governments to recognize for too long the epidemic of homelessness. Many people who wrote said this is not park board’s responsibility, and I agree — the park board should not have to deal with this social problem.”

Demers: “We’re not pretending to be solving the root causes of homelessness here. That does not belong at park board. It’s not our mandate. This bylaw is simply a tool to help us deal with the situation the best way we can.”

Giesbrecht said the revised bylaw in no way addresses “how the people in this city — way, way too many of them — are displaced and experience homelessness.”

She said she made her vote with a heavy heart, knowing the bylaw gives the park board legal authority to dismantle communities of homeless people.

But Giesbrecht said she will never grant an injunction to remove homeless people.

“On those conditions, I will vote in support of these bylaw amendments, but not if they’re used as a tool to throw people out of their communities that they’ve established,” she said.

“We call them parks, but really they are the land of Vancouver.”

Commissioners Tricia Barker and John Coupar, who voted against the staff recommendation to upgrade the bylaw, said they worried such a move would encourage more people to sleep in parks.

“I feel strongly that our mandate is to look after parks, and make sure we have clean and safe parks for everybody,” Coupar said.

“I think it’s the wrong thing for the Vancouver park board to do, and I’m hearing a lot in the community that people are concerned about it, and what it will lead to across our city.”

Barker: “I believe the bylaw doesn’t solve problems that we’re having in our parks today. Listening to all the people speak and reading all the emails, talking to people on the street, people aren’t feeling safe in our parks right now.”

Comm. John Irwin also voted against the revised bylaw after failed attempts to defer the decision to another meeting in September so more consultation could be done with homeless people and Indigenous groups.

“We have left the bylaw renewal because of COVID, and because not quite getting on it when we could have, and so I don’t see that a few months delay will matter that much,” Irwin said.

The city conducted a homeless count in March but has yet to release the findings. In March 2019, volunteers counted a record-breaking 2,223 homeless people. Coun. Jean Swanson suggested to commissioners Monday that number had increased by another 200 people.

Exactly one week ago, on July 7, the province recorded 12 new cases. What followed was an uptick in recorded cases:

• 18 new cases on July 8;

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12; and

• 21 new cases on July 13.

""I know it was distressing to me to see 20, especially 25 [new cases] one day,"" Henry said. ""That's way above my comfort zone.""

She added, however, that the slight rise in cases was not unexpected, given that the province has been allowing restaurants and other indoor businesses to reopen.

""We do know where those cases are,"" she said. ""We're testing the people who need to be tested.""

It would be more concerning, she said, if the cases were spread out across the province in an unlinked way. The most recent cluster of cases is linked to the Krazy Cherry Fruit Company in Oliver, she announced yesterday (July 13).

Given B.C.'s population, 20 cases in one day is also better than some other jurisdictions, she said.

The province has identified 3,128 infections since the virus first appeared in the province in late January.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,015 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1649 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 212 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 52 people who reside outside Canada.

Of the 209 people currently fighting COVID-19 in B.C., 14 people are in hospital with five of those in intensive care units. That leaves 2,730 people who have recovered from the virus.

No new deaths from the virus were identified in the past 24 hours, leaving the death toll at 189 people.

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

So far 399 residents and 252 staff at seniors' care facilities have been infected by COVID-19 in B.C.

Health Minister Adrian Dix said that it is his understanding that the federal government and the U.S. government have agreed to extend the closure of the two countries' border for one additional month, until August 21.

""This is obviously positive and necessary news,"" he said. ""Everybody who lives in B.C. knows how inconvenient and how difficult that is for many businesses and many individuals for a variety of circumstances.""

Harry Bains said injured workers have complained for too long that the system lacks fairness and support in times of injury and recovery.

article continues below

Changes Bains proposes include raising the maximum annual salary on which compensation benefits are based; authorizing WorkSafeBC to provide preventative medical treatment before claim acceptance; giving powers to the court to issue WorkSafeBC search and seizure warrants appropriate for investigating workplace safety infractions; and giving people a voice in serious workplace prosecutions and trials by using victim impact statements.

Victoria is also fast-tracking legislation to handle situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic so workers can access benefits more easily.

During the pandemic, the regulator is allowing businesses to defer paying their premiums for six months without penalty or interest. It is also waiving premiums on wages paid to workers of employers receiving the Canadian Emergency Wage Subsidy.

The amendments to the Workers Compensation Act comes after three expert reviews were completed in 2018 and 2019.

The ministry said of the more than 44,000 injured workers currently receiving permanent disability benefits because of a work-related injury, about 35% are in the Lower Mainland, while the rest are spread throughout all regions of B.C.

There are more than 100,000 workplace injury or fatality claims annually.

In 2019, there were 140 workplace fatalities in B.C. Of that number, 84 were due to occupational disease, 40 to traumatic injury and 16 the result of a motor vehicle incident.

In a fiscal update Tuesday, B.C. Finance Minister Carole James said the COVID-19 pandemic will result in ""the worst downturn experienced in our province in recent history.""

article continues below

""The projected numbers are staggering, but they're not without hope,"" James said, in summing up B.C.'s fiscal position.

She said B.C. had entered the pandemic perhaps better situated than other provinces, as it had a balanced budget, a triple AAA credit rating and one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country.

B.C. also managed to contain the pandemic and flatten its growth curve better than some other provinces, and it has been able to move earlier on a phased economic restart plan.

""Because of that strength, we were able to take immediate action to help people, to help businesses, to help communities with our $5 billion COVID action plan,"" James said.

She said the province is expecting a loss of $4.2 billion in tax revenue, including $1 billion less in personal income tax revenue, $973 million less in corporate taxes, $1.3 billion in provincial sales tax revenue, $300 million in natural resource revenues and $882 million less in Crown Corporation income.

The province is also spending $5 billion in emergency spending, and has approved $1.3 billion in tax credits and deferrals. In total, the increased spending, lost tax revenue and foregone revenue will bring the deficit to $12.5 billion.

In February, James brought down, but never passed, a balanced budget and modest surplus of $227 million and provincial GDP growth projections of 2% in 2020.

""Mere weeks after the budget 2020 was tabled, our entire world changed,"" James said.

James said the B.C. economy is now expected to contract 6.8% in 2020, according to some forecasters.

Since February, B.C. lost 235,000 jobs, and saw retail sales declined by 23.6% in April compared to February. Overall, home prices dropped 4%.

Home sales declined 45.4% in May, compared to February, and B.C. merchandise exports are down 14.7% year-to-date, compared to January to May 2019.

""While the job losses in March and April were record-breaking, figures for May and June in fact have seen some recovery of the losses that we experienced in the previous two months,"" James said.

Asked if her government planned to resort to spending cuts to address the deficit, James said ""now is not the time to be able to cut back on services and support for people and business in British Columbia.""

As for any long-range plans for dealing with debt and deficits, James said: ""I do not believe that it's going to be a quick fix.""

Asked if the $5 billion that her government has already approved could be added to later this year, James said ""I believe the $5 billion is enough now.""

However, she added no one can predict what might happen should there be a second wave of COVID-19.

As for the $22 billion in capital spending allocated in the 2020 budget over three years for big capital works projects, like new schools, hospitals, bridges and roads, that will continue to be spent.

""This is going to serve us very well because it translates into huge investments,"" James said.

19,vancourier,https://www.vancourier.com/gun-violence-imported-from-u-s-is-a-key-concern-for-canadians-1.24169958,Gun violence imported from U.S. is a key concern for Canadians,['Mario Canseco'],,"National governments have a tendency to overreact immediately after they are forced to face an unexpected challenge. No example is better than the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks in the United States, which gave us the “Patriot Act” after just 45 days of deliberation to expand government surveillance of Americans to previously unimagined levels.

In mid-April, the actions of Gabriel Wortman led to the deaths of 22 people in Nova Scotia after multiple shootings and fires. Most Canadians, at the time still under lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, were horrified at Wortman’s actions, which included impersonating a police officer.

article continues below

It took the federal government only 13 days after Wortman’s criminal activity was evident for the entire country to announce a nationwide ban on 1,500 types of military-grade “assault-style” weapons in Canada. Any Canadian who possesses these firearms will have two years to get rid of them. The prohibition led to many new discussions about the role that firearms play in Canada’s urban and rural areas.

We know now that the perpetrator of the 22 murders in Nova Scotia had obtained his weapons illegally from Canadian and American sources. This was not a surprise for Canadian authorities, who have consistently reported that more than 70% of the weapons used in gun-related crimes in our country come from the United States.

On the issue of firearms, Canada is decidedly different from the United States. In Canada, it is not legal for a person to own or carry a firearm for the purpose of self defence against human beings. When Research Co. and Glacier Media asked Canadians about this key precept of Canadian law, more than three in four (77%) agreed with it, while 18% disagreed and 5% were undecided.

Atlantic Canada (31%), Saskatchewan and Manitoba (29%) and Alberta (24%) boast the highest number of residents who openly question Canada’s long-standing regulations for firearms. While higher than what is observed in Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia, these are not proportions of voters that would sway an election, certainly not in the way American statewide and congressional races can be tilted if your candidate can adequately hold a shotgun and recite the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution in a manner that panders to the base.

Fewer than one in five Canadians welcome the notion of citizens carrying firearms for something other than hunting or scaring wildlife away. Any survey measuring opinions on banning “assault-style” weapons would be met with near unanimity. The opposition reacted to the announced ban as it always has under its outgoing leader, by claiming the regulations would affect law-abiding Canadians. Lost in this unfortunate combination of inadequate polling and incapable opposition are the solutions that matter to Canadians.

In our survey, more than three in five Canadians (63%) told us that gun violence in Canada is a “very serious” or “moderately serious” problem – a proportion that climbs to 69% among women and 68% among those aged 55 and over.

Sizable majorities of Ontarians and British Columbians, who have experienced gang wars in urban areas, are more likely to look at gun violence as particularly problematic (76% and 67%, respectively). The COVID-19 pandemic did little to curb gun violence in Toronto, where 61 people were shot in the first four months of the year.

We asked Canadians about the effectiveness of four possible measures, and their responses outline a public that is ready for bold action. More than three in five Canadians (62%) think enacting a complete ban on handguns would be “very effective” or “moderately effective” in reducing gun violence in Canada. Most crimes, after all, are not being committed with the military-grade “assault-style” weapons that the federal government was quick to ban.

A higher proportion of Canadians deem two other measures as effective: imposing mandatory jail terms for crimes committed with firearms (74%) and introducing new outreach programs to steer youth away from gangs (also 74%).

Canadians place dealing with firearms smuggled from the United States as the most important issue that needs to be addressed. Many of the country’s residents also want to make sure gangs are not attractive to our country’s youth and believe mandatory minimum jail sentences would act as a deterrent.

Banning military-grade “assault-style” weapons is low-hanging fruit in a challenge that definitely has Canadians preoccupied and wishing for a type of government intervention that goes beyond a photo-op celebrated by poorly executed survey charity work.

True sociologists know that we learn nothing from posing the wrong questions to Canadians, and capable politicians should go beyond voicing displeasure with plans and proposals just because that is what they are expected to do. Meanwhile, Canadians are still worried about gun violence and expecting their elected officials to do better. •

20,vancourier,https://www.vancourier.com/news/moving-strathcona-park-tent-city-doesn-t-solve-problem-of-homelessness-1.24169951,Moving Strathcona Park tent city ‘doesn’t solve problem’ of homelessness,['Mike Howell'],,"A new version of a bylaw that aims to limit the number of Vancouver parks and public green space where homeless people can legally sleep overnight is not designed to dismantle the city’s newest and biggest homeless encampment at Strathcona Park.

That was made clear by Shauna Wilton, the acting-general manager of the park board, at a meeting Monday in which several disappointed Strathcona residents outlined their concerns over the state of the growing tent city.

article continues below

“This [revised bylaw] was not targeted at Strathcona specifically, but is something that we need to do broadly, knowing the impact to all of the park system from homelessness and sheltering,” Wilton told park board commissioners.

“I think what this bylaw will do is to give our staff a tool for ongoing discussion with those in the encampment, in terms of trying to manage that space.”

She noted the long-running Oppenheimer Park encampment was cleared after an emergency order from the provincial government related to COVID-19. The subsequent CRAB Park tent city was shut down after the Port Authority was granted a court injunction that was enforced by police.

“The reality we’ve seen now is there is a homeless population in Vancouver that requires a place to be,” Wilton said.

“Now that we’ve had encampments in Oppenheimer, on the Port lands [at CRAB Park], and certainly now in Strathcona, moving them again doesn’t necessarily solve the problem.”

The present version of the parks control bylaw does not permit people to remain in parks overnight, or to erect temporary structures. That bylaw, however, has not been enforced because of a B.C. Supreme Court ruling that gives homeless people the constitutional right to sleep in a park overnight.

The changes to the bylaw seek to strike a balance between honouring those rights and the needs of people who regularly use the city’s parks, including the Strathcona residents who spoke Monday to park board commissioners.

Commissioners are expected to vote on the revised bylaw Tuesday night, after running out of time Monday night to hear from all 88 people who registered to speak.

Many who spoke Monday identified as Strathcona residents and a majority said they supported updating the bylaw, but were disappointed nothing will immediately be done to address the encampment in their neighbourhood park.

Collectively, residents told commissioners the encampment, which has grown to more than 200 tents, has been the scene of assaults, drug use and fires.

It’s also served as a centre for bicycle “chop shops” and stolen property, making the park unsafe for residents and young families who depend on the green space for outings, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.

At the same time, residents such as Katie Lewis said she understood the plight of homeless people and that addressing homelessness is not the mandate of the resource-stretched park board.

“I just don’t feel that this should all fall onto your laps,” said Lewis, vice-president of the Strathcona Residents’ Association, who urged commissioners to seek help from senior governments.

The mother of young twins said she’s heard from many neighbours representing a wide spectrum of views on the encampment, which started in the park last month after people were forced to leave CRAB Park’s tent city on the waterfront.

“The one thing I am really hearing loud and clear is that Strathcona Park is not set up for a large, long-term encampment,” she said, noting it represents 80 per cent of Strathcona’s green space and has shut out residents.

Ted Bairstow lives across the street from Strathcona Park and said he was more concerned about the tent city Monday than when he put his name on the list a few days ago to speak to the revised bylaw.

“Last night, someone broke into my car, took the door opener to my garage, opened the garage and stole two bicycles from it,” Bairstow said.

“I have no idea whether there’s a direct link to the encampment in the park, but it’s hard to believe that there isn’t.”

The proposed changes don’t identify which parks or green space would be open to overnight camping, but park board staff estimated it would amount to 26 per cent, or 867 acres of a possible 3,320 acres.

That 26 per cent is based on a long list of criteria that would prevent temporary shelters to be erected near schools, playgrounds, sports fields, beaches, community centres, golf courses, the seawall, environmentally sensitive areas, gardens, horticultural displays and picnic areas.

Enforcing the bylaw will be challenging, with commissioners hearing Monday that 85 per cent of park rangers’ workload already involves monitoring and managing homeless shelters in parks.

In October 2019, rangers did an audit of all parks to assess and identify temporary homeless shelter activity in parks. In addition to 107 counted at the time in Oppenheimer Park, they counted a total of 405 occurrences within 116 parks.

Housing advocate Fiona York urged commissioners to pause further discussion of the proposed changes to the bylaw until the pandemic is declared over. She said homeless people were not consulted about the changes, which call for people to have to pack up their gear after each night they sleep in a public space.

“During COVID, the recommendation [from Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry] is to shelter in place, and that’s what is being provided right now by not having a bylaw in place that allows for daily displacement,” York said.

“We know about the health effects of daily displacement. It’s talked about by many public health officials in terms of COVID, but also there’s the mental, emotional, psychological trauma and impacts of being displaced on a daily basis.”

City councillors Jean Swanson and Pete Fry also spoke to commissioners, with Swanson echoing York’s concerns about daily displacement, saying “it’s cruel to make people pack up and move every day.”

Fry, a longtime Strathcona resident, said he supported changes to the bylaw but believed commissioners were unfairly forced to bear the burden of failures of other orders of government, despite Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s proclamation two years ago that housing is a human right in Canada.

“We still haven’t seen any real meaningful delivery on that promise,” Fry said.

“And despite the investments from the provincial government — at a level of commitment that we haven’t seen in years — we’re still barely making a dent on delivering mental health and addictions supports, or the housing needed to deal with the crisis that’s unfolding here on our streets in Vancouver, but also across our province.”

Fry, though, said the tent city at Strathcona Park has become dangerous for residents, particularly those who have visited the encampment in an attempt to retrieve their stolen property.

“Which is obviously a risky proposition for all parties involved,” he said.

“There have been trip-line booby traps, bear bangers shot at park users, threats with weapons, swarmings, verbal accosting and physical assaults directly as a result of the encampment.”

Commissioners meet again Tuesday night at 6 p.m. to hear from the remainder of registered speakers. If commissioners approve the revised bylaw, it will go before them again at a future meeting for enactment.

That brings the total confirmed cases to 3,115. Of that number, 51 are non-residents who live outside of Canada but are currently in B.C. Although public health officials aren't saying where these non-residents are from, it is likely that some are temporary foreign farm workers, as there have been outbreaks at a number of farms in B.C.

There have been two deaths since Friday attributed to COVID-19. While there have been no new community outbreaks in long-term care or acute care facilities, there have been a number of community exposure events in the Okanagan.

Public health has issued an isolation order for the Krazy Cherry Fruit Co. in Oliver, where two cases have been identified at the farm. Interior Health has also issued alerts for possible community exposure events in Kelowna.

Prior to the measure, restaurants and bars were in general only allowed to sell liquor for consumption at their establishments. The sale of alcohol for off-site consumption has provided businesses with an additional source of revenue during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Five questions with Peter Mayers, Canadian director for Barbados Tourism Marketing Inc.

How has Barbados been coping amid COVID?

As a Caribbean destination, Barbados’ economy is reliant on the tourism industry and the pandemic has greatly impacted the country.

However, the small but mighty island is persevering. We have demonstrated resiliency and ingenuity, taking the downtime as an opportunity to refurbish hotel properties, train hospitality staff, rethink health and safety measures and provide respite for nature.

Many of Barbados’ top hotels have used this time to deep clean properties and rethink health and safety protocols, including Bougainvillea Beach Resort, The Crane Resort, Dover Beach Hotel and Ocean Hotels Barbados.

The public spaces within most hotels have been reimagined to encourage social distancing and the guest experience is being reworked to offer as many contactless capabilities as possible.

Barbadian rum distilleries, such as the West Indies Rum Distillery, have been taking this downtime to help in any way they can amid the pandemic by producing both surgical alcohol and hand sanitizer.

These materials have been donated to public health officials and local communities to help ensure that health and safety is uppermost in our thoughts, which is a testament to the warmth of Bajan people.

Barbados has been making the most of the downtime posed by COVID, well-positioning the island to confidently welcome visitors once again with travellers’ peace of mind at heart.

What can visitors anticipate upon reopening?

When Canadians begin to visit Barbados once again, they can expect to feel at ease and confident that their best interest is at heart.

All entities will be observing social distancing and sanitization practices to ensure that guest experiences are seamless from the moment they land in destination, to the moment they are revisiting the airport to return home.

While new levels of sanitization will be in place, guests can still expect the same Bajan warm welcome throughout their trip!

As of June 15, 2020, all businesses have reopened and parks and beaches no longer have restricted hours.

As of July 1, 2020, curfew restrictions were lifted and physical distancing reduced to one metre, offering a sense of normalization across the island.

Barbados offers endless opportunities for outdoor adventure. Photo Visit Barbados

What are some of the things that you personally love about Barbados?

Bajan cuisine and sailing quickly come to mind, especially when combined, but it is wonderful spirit of our people that make Barbados such a unique and special destination.

Our hospitality is unmatched, which showcases the safety of the island. Visitors can go for walks along the beach, head to a local party or hop on a public bus and be greeted with a warm smile and energizing conversation.

We love to share stories of our home and are eager to give the same memorable experience to our Canadian visitors.

Coco Hill is a popular hike in Barbados. Photo Visit Barbados

Why will Barbados be an attractive destination to Canadians in a post-COVID?

Canadians love exploring and being enveloped in nature, and Barbados is a destination that is abundant in pristine wildlife and natural playgrounds.

What makes Barbados such a great post-COVID travel destination is that visitors can take refuge in nature and spend their days hiking open trails, sailing the open seas or soaking up the sun on one of the many sprawling coastlines.

My recommendation is visiting Coco Hill for some green therapy in the beautiful and hilly rainforest, followed by seaside brunch consisting of healthy and delicious food.

Barbados is also a naturally remote destination, further from its Caribbean island counterparts, providing both the tranquil and pristine Caribbean Sea on the West Coast and the sleepy East Coast villages along the Atlantic shore.

The East Coast lends itself nicely to social distancing and allows for a sense of privacy that many Canadians have been vying for during quarantine, plus you get to be in Barbados!

Horseback riding is a popular outdoor activity on Barbados. Oistins Street

When can Canadians expect to find regular flights to Barbados once again?

With the Grantley Adams International Airport aiming to reopen at the end of the month, individual air carriers have shared plans to resume regular flights in tandem with the airport reopening.

Air Canada has resumed flights from Toronto to Bridgetown with two weekly flights and the international airport officially opened July 12.

I recommend visiting visitbarbados.org for updates and more inspiring stories of our Bajan culture.

Maybe you heard the news last Thursday that the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police called for the decriminalization of people found with illicit drugs for personal use.

Kind of a big deal.

That is, of course, if you live in a Canadian city other than Vancouver.

As I was reminded by a retired high-ranking Vancouver police officer a few hours after news broke of the chiefs’ support for decriminalization, the addiction-is-not-a-crime-and-should-be-treated-as-a-health-care-issue position is not revolutionary in these parts.

In fact, Kash Heed joked that he should sue the chiefs for plagiarism.

That joke was based on a serious presentation he made Nov. 7, 2001 to the Senate Special Committee on Illegal Drugs. At the time, Heed was an inspector with the Vancouver Police Department in charge of the drug and vice sections.

The focus of his presentation concerned marijuana, but he made clear what the VPD’s approach was on people caught with all types of drugs for personal use, including heroin and cocaine.

“The Vancouver Police Department’s policies focus drug enforcement resources on people who are making a profit from the sale of drugs,” Heed said almost two decades ago.

“Generally, simple possession charges are not pursued, regardless of the type of drug unless there are extenuating circumstances. We recognize that many of the people who use, or are addicted to drugs must be dealt with outside of the law enforcement system.”

In practical terms, he continued, Vancouver has “de facto decriminalization or de facto legalization” based on the wide margin of discretion afforded to the police. For marijuana specifically, Heed said he wasn’t alone in going on record in support of removal of criminal penalties for possession of the now-legal drug for personal use.

Nineteen years later, one of Heed’s former colleagues, Adam Palmer, spoke to reporters last Thursday as president of the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police (CACP). Palmer is, of course, Vancouver’s police chief.

See if you notice any similarities in what Palmer said in 2020 to what Heed said in 2001.

“Being addicted to a controlled substance is not a crime and should not be treated as such,” he said from the VPD’s Cambie Street precinct.

“We are calling for the decriminalization of illicit drugs for personal possession of illegal substances. The CACP endorses alternatives to criminal sanctions for simple possession of illicit drugs for personal consumption. In other words, we recommend that Canada’s enforcement-based approach for possession be replaced with a health care approach that diverts people towards social and healthcare services and away from the criminal justice system.”

He continued: “Instead of police agencies recommending or laying criminal charges, we are suggesting that partnerships be formed and strengthened between healthcare, government, police and social service providers to ensure drug users have timely access to appropriate health, social and treatment services.”

As president of the chiefs’ organization, Palmer was reiterating what he’s already said numerous times in his tenure as Vancouver chief — that drug addiction is not a crime, more treatment is needed and such treatment should include a safe supply of prescription alternatives to deadly street drugs.

That’s all on the record, and has been for some time.

So has the VPD’s support of injection sites, with Vancouver being the first city in North America to allow a legal site — Insite on East Hastings — which opened in September 2003.

But, as reporters heard Thursday, Canadian police forces continue to arrest people for simple possession of drugs.

Waterloo Police Service Chief Bryan Larkin, who joined the news conference via telephone, said Ontario typically has the highest charge rate across Canada for simple possession. But those charges are beginning to drop off, he said, although he didn’t provide statistics.

“What we’ve seen in the last two years is a decline in simple possession charges,” Larkin said.

“We started to see a trend, not only in Waterloo, but across Ontario where officers are looking at more diversion — individuals who are chronic drug users now actually being diverted and, or, put towards acute care intervention.”

At the same time, seeking an alternative to a charge heavily depends on what type of treatment facilities and programs are available in the cities in which police work. As we’ve seen in Vancouver, there aren’t enough.

Canada, however, has made some significant gains in harm reduction since Heed’s presentation in 2001 to the Senate committee, with 49 injection sites now operating in the country. Another 14 applications are under review from Health Canada.

Safe supply is also available in B.C., including prescription heroin for a select group of less than 200 people. The last time I spoke to Judy Darcy, B.C.’s Minister of Mental Health and Addictions, she told me 3,500 more people in B.C. receive medication-assisted treatment than when the NDP took office in July 2017.

Three forms of methadone, hydromorphone, morphine and Suboxone were among the medications she mentioned.

Regardless of those gains, decriminalization — whether defacto, or not — doesn’t legally exist in this country and now we have another organization calling for it to be written or edited in law.

Palmer and his fellow chiefs want a national task force created to research drug policy reform, and they want government to amend the section of the federal Controlled Drugs and Substances Act related to simple possession.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who often talks about evidence-based approaches to policy, has repeatedly said his government doesn’t support decriminalization. That position does not appear to have shifted with pressure from police chiefs.

Health Minister Patty Hajdu and Attorney-General David Lametti did not respond directly to the chiefs’ request for decriminalization in their joint response emailed to Glacier Media following the chiefs’ news conference.

But the ministers said they “welcome their endorsement of a holistic approach including harm reduction and diversion, and thank them for their recommendations.”

“Working with other orders of government, substance use experts, service providers, first responders, law enforcement and people with lived and living experience, our Government remains committed to advancing evidence-based responses to help reverse the trend of opioid overdose deaths and other substance-related harms in Canada,” their statement said.

As many British Columbians know, the call for decriminalization has not just been made by harm reduction advocates — and now police chiefs — but by the very people the Trudeau government and Canadians now rely on for expertise in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic: public health doctors.

In B.C., Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and Vancouver Coastal Health Chief Medical Officer Dr. Patricia Daly, have gone on record in their support of decriminalization — Henry in a report last year, and Daly along with other public health doctors in a report in 2001.

Both doctors have pointed to the mounting death toll of people dying in B.C. of a drug overdose, with an all-time high of 170 deaths in the province in May — a statistic that brought Henry to tears.

More than 5,000 people died in B.C. of a drug overdose between the start of 2016 and end of 2019. In the first five months of this year, 554 people lost their lives in B.C. to drug use, most of them using alone inside a private residence.

As of Friday, 187 people in B.C. had died of COVID-19.

For Heed, who went on to become police chief in West Vancouver and then attorney general of B.C., he said he’s disappointed that 19 years after he spoke to senators about the need to decriminalize drugs that politicians continue to be politicians.

“They’re the ones that are going to be able to change the policy,” he said.

“The chiefs can say whatever they want. They have an amount of discretion that their officers can use, they have an amount of discretion that their organization can use in setting policy. But the overall policy has to come from our elected officials. And when we get this same rhetoric from our politicians, you can see even after almost 20 years, there’s been no real movement on this issue.”

Note: After I posted this piece, I came across some comments on Facebook from former Downtown Eastside cop, Dave Dickson. So here’s a take from another veteran of the streets on decriminalization:

“OK, I’m a little confused. The chiefs of police have now [announced] it’s time to decriminalize drugs. I remember 15 years ago as a police officer reading a memo from the federal Crown saying there will be no more charges for possession of marijuana, cocaine or heroin because it wasn’t in the public interest. I have spoken personally to most of the drug dealers out there in the Hastings corridor [and asked] if they are bothered by the police, and they just laughed. So can anyone explain to me why they think this is worth even discussing, as I think it’s pretty much already decriminalized, and it hasn’t made a difference whatsoever to the streets.”

Why it matters: The program brings cost relief to businesses hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, and is intended to support employment.

article continues below

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologized on Monday for not recusing himself from discussions about the administration of Ottawa's $900 million student volunteer program.

WE Charity was initially selected to deliver the initiative under a nearly $20 million contract. Trudeau said he was aware of his family's ties to the organization, but unaware of the honorariums his mother and brother received for their involvement.

""It is not a surprise to me that they got paid by WE, but I did not know that they got paid by WE,"" Trudeau said.

""In this situation, I should have recused myself,"" he added, acknowledging that his involvement in Ottawa's student volunteer program has created controversy. Members of the Conservative Party of Canada have called on Trudeau to address his involvement before Ottawa's ethics committee.

""I get that. I made a mistake in not recusing myself immediately from the discussion.""

Trudeau said he will evaluate any requests to address the issue before parliament. He also said that, because of his involvement, the rollout of the student volunteer program has been a bit delayed – an outcome he deeply regrets.

In addition to addressing the issue, Trudeau said on Monday that the federal government will extend its wage subsidy program until the end of the year. More information on the extension is expected this week.

The prime minister also said he spoke with U.S. president Donald Trump earlier in the day about the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement – which took effect July 1, – Black Lives Matter, China, the two Canadians who remain detained in China and U.S. aluminum tariffs.

""I highlighted to the president that the pandemic has disrupted usual manufacturing processes and supply chains,"" said Trudeau. ""It would be a shame to see tariffs come in between our two countries at a time when we're celebrating the new NAFTA.""

Trudeau briefly told reporters to expect a joint announcement regarding the closure of the Canada-U.S. border.

Non-essential travel across the border is banned until late July.

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreaks at Tabor and at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred to those homes from the hospital. The outbreak at the Tabor long-term care home was declared over on July 7.

B.C.'s provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix said in a July 10 joint statement that the province recorded 25 new cases in the past 24 hours, for a total of 3,053 cases since the virus that has caused a global pandemic first appeared in B.C. in late January.

Stephen Without pleaded guilty to assaults involving directly massaging patients’ breasts or touching or rubbing their vaginal areas.

article continues below

The court said the activity had no therapeutic or valid reason during treatment in 2015 and 2016 at Witvoet’s Thrive Physiotherapy business.

He was charged with 16 offenses in total.

“The victims went to see Mr. Witvoet for pain relief. They trusted him. He abused that trust,” Vernon Provincial Court Judge Jeremy Guild said.

The first complaint came in July 2015 when a woman told police Witvoet had massaged both of her breasts under her sports bra with his hand. She did not want to proceed with charges unless someone else came forward.

Three months later, another woman complained of similar behaviour. Police contacted the first woman and Witvoet was charged.

Two more complaints led to charges in June 2019.

After that, RCMP appealed to the public for assistance and a further 12 charges resulted.

The victims ranged in age from 18 to 57.

They had sought Witvoet’s services for issues such as flat feet, shoulder injuries, lockjaw and other injuries.

The October 2019 guilty plea came after a joint submission from Crown and defence.

“The guilty pleas were also important for him as an acceptance of his responsibility, and an acknowledgment that he did wrong and that the victims were right,” Guild said in the July 8 sentencing ruling. The guilty pleas help make sure justice is done from the victims’ perspectives.”

Witvoet is now separated from his wife, with whom he has two children.

“He now takes full responsibility for his offending, is remorseful and recognizes that he abused his position of trust. The publicity has left him feeling like a pariah,” Guild said. “He may have to find a new career. He has been working in construction to make ends meet and support his family.”

Guild said he initially had concerns about the sentence “because there seemed to be very little punitive aspect to it.”

But, he said, the guilty plea spared the victims having to testify. Despite their names being barred from publication, their need to be in court would leak out and people would know the details of what had happened to them, Guild said.

“Being spared the necessity of testifying helped protect their privacy and save them from embarrassment. That was one of the main goals in the Crown arriving at the joint submission,” Guild said.

The 18-month sentence is broken into six months’ house arrest and a year with a 10 p.m.-6 a.m. curfew.

He also received two years’ probation also include a ban on treating female patients while on probation.

“Given the notoriety of his offending, his neighbours and the community will know of his restrictions,” Guild said.

The College of Physiotherapists of British Columbia in June 2019 prohibited Witvoet from treating female patients pending the completion of its regulatory investigation. With sentencing complete, the college will conclude its regulatory process with results to be published on its website.

Crazy talk, you might say.

article continues below

Well, a decision to hold off for one, maybe two years on hiring a new person to replace Fire Chief Darrell Reid, who leaves next week to take a management job in Alberta, almost happened Wednesday.

Why is a reporter writing about what almost happened?

Fair question.

Answer: Because that reporter can’t recall a time in his almost two decades of covering city hall when four councillors didn’t want to immediately replace what is arguably one of the most important positions in the city.

But yes, you might say in defence of the councillors’ push, we’re in strange and fiscally challenging times, with the city at one point losing up to $5 million per week in revenues and is now looking at an estimated $124 million total loss this year.

That loss, which could climb in the months ahead, is related to pandemic-influenced cuts, temporarily halting parking enforcement, a reduction in development fees and the shutdown of community centres, theatres and programs.

With that financial picture in mind, NPA Coun. Lisa Dominato proposed Wednesday a hiring freeze at the city for the remainder of this year and into next, and possibly beyond; her amendment to a motion read “until such time as the city’s revenues have returned to 2019 pre-COVID levels.”

Her NPA colleagues — Sarah Kirby-Yung, Melissa De Genova and Colleen Hardwick — all supported the move, even after city manager Sadhu Johnston outlined the consequences for the organization.

“We’re trying to really limit our hiring at this point, however there are some critical positions that we do need to hire,” he said.

“So it’s my sense that this amendment [from Dominato], if moved forward, would cripple us at this point.”

Those critical positions include finding someone to replace Reid and someone to replace Malcolm Bromley, who recently retired as general manager of the park board.

A “chief diversity officer” to lead the new equity and diversity office is also being sought, as are positions related to Indigenous issues, engineering and anti-racism.

Johnston’s concern was shared by Mayor Kennedy Stewart and other councillors, who all piled on in their criticism of the NPA’s push to place a moratorium on new hires and — of equal importance — not to fill vacancies left open from retirements, promotions, illness and those who quit.

Stewart: “To have a whole bunch of senior manager vacancies in the middle of a pandemic, and having an order not to fill them, would be a huge mistake. That means no hiring new firefighters, no hiring new police. Those are all the debates we have through the budget [sessions in December]. So I‘m kind of disappointed that there’s so much support for this.”

COPE Coun. Jean Swanson said council has spent months setting priorities related to affordable housing, the economy, social issues, equity and climate change. To advance those priorities, people need to be hired, she said.

“I just think it would be gross to say we can’t hire the people that are needed to do this work,” she said.

Green Party Coun. Pete Fry questioned Dominato wanting to freeze hiring until city revenues return to 2019 pre-COVID levels.

“That could be years from now, that could be months from now,” he said.

“It’s far too risky. We need to stay nimble, we need to be able to pivot, we need to be able to respond to the needs of our city in a timely and appropriate manner.”

From under the pile of criticism, Dominato emerged to propose an amendment to her original amendment, pointing directly to Johnston’s concerns about hiring people for “critical positions.”

“I heard that,” she said, “and I think that’s reasonable.”

Dominato, however, never identified the “critical positions,” although it could be assumed she was referring to the vacant jobs of fire chief and park board general manager. In the end, that amendment was defeated, too.

The debate featured all the trappings of the budget back-and-forth that normally goes down in December. But the positioning here by the NPA came as council got an update from the city’s finance crew on what the rest of the year and 2021 may look like for city finances.

As the estimated $124 million loss in revenue makes mind-bogglingly clear, it’s not promising.

The debate occurred on the same day the federal government announced it expected a $343 billion deficit this year, which Hardwick mentioned in her argument for supporting her colleague’s move for a hiring freeze at the city.

“The federal deficit is going to have a massive effect, and all of this is going to land on the city and our residents, which I’m always reminded are the people who elect us and pay our salaries,” she said.

“No one wants a hiring freeze, no one wants to cut back, but at some point — when the rubber hits the road — we’re going to be forced into positions to be doing these things.”

For now, the search begins for a new fire chief.

Since B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix announced on June 30 that his government would start accepting these plans, 61 of the 681 homes in the province have submitted them, he said July 9. He did not elaborate on how many of the plans would be approved.

article continues below

Homes that have approved plans could start allowing visitors into the facilities as early as next week.

The breakdown of seniors' homes with plans submitted to the government, by health region, is:

• 3 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 18 in Fraser Health;

• 18 in Island Health;

• 4 in Interior Health; and

• 18 in Northern Health.

Initial provincial restrictions on visits include that they will happen with each resident having a single designated visitor, that each visitor and resident would go to a designated place within the care home and that both vistor and resident would wear protective equipment.

""Keeping people safe in those communal-living environments is incredibly important,"" provincial health officer Bonnie Henry said July 9.

""Visiting is an important part of what we need to do to keep the mental health as well as the physical health of our seniors in care, however it needs to be done in a measured fashion so that we're not introducing this virus into a care home again.""

Dix on June 30 announced $165 million in new funding for up to three new full-time staff per home to oversee the visits and train visitors on how to wear protective equipment. He also announced that the government would provide a total of $26.5 million to care home operators to subsidize them for extra costs endured during the pandemic, including such items as hand sanitizer and masks.

The plan to allow visitors in B.C. care homes is contingent on the province continuing to record a relatively low number of new COVID-19 cases.

Henry said July 9 that the province had identified 20 new infections in the past 24 hours, for a total of 3,028 cases since infections were first recorded in the province in late January.

The province tweaked its system of reporting where in the province cases have been recorded to separate cases of people whose residence is outside Canada.

The new breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 982 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1596 in Fraser Health;

• 133 in Island Health;

• 201 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 51 people who reside outside Canada.

There were no new deaths in the past day, meaning that B.C.'s death toll from the virus that has caused a global pandemic remains at 186. Of the 175 people actively fighting off the disease, 17 are in hospital, with four of those in intensive care. The rest are self-isolating at home.

More than 88% of those infected in the province, or 2,667, have recovered.

Bacon pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to murder Corey Lal in the so-called Surrey Six case.

article continues below

He also pleaded guilty to one count of counselling to commit murder in a separate case involving the shooting of a man who survived an attack on Dec. 31, 2008.

Sentencing has been tentatively scheduled for July 23 when victim impact statements will be heard by the court.

Court heard a joint sentencing submission that includes 18 years for conspiracy to murder and 10 years for counselling to commit murder to be served concurrently.

Outside court, defence lawyer Kevin Westell said if the sentencing submission is accepted, Bacon is looking at an additional five to six years in prison after time served is taken into account.

""This has been a long, deliberative process of coming to the right agreement with the Crown,"" he said. ""We've come to a resolution that's principled and that's appropriate from all sides.""

Bacon was also charged with one count of first-degree murder in the Surrey Six case, but only pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge as part of a plea deal. Court heard the murder charge will be stayed at the sentencing hearing.

Police have said four of the victims were targeted but Chris Mohan, who lived on the floor where the killings occurred, and Ed Schellenberg, a maintenance worker, were in the wrong place at the wrong time.

Eileen Mohan said outside court that she would like to see Bacon serve at least 12 years for his part in the Surrey Six case.

""It breaks my heart,"" she said when asked about the possibility Bacon could be free in five or six years.

""This crime came to my doorstep. We didn't go to it, and this crime dictated my son's life that he's buried and dead now, and it's dictating our lives for the last 13 years. That has to be considered.""

Mohan said she will deliver a victim impact statement in person at the sentencing hearing.

""I will have my day in court with him,"" she said.

""Six people's lives meant something to this country and to the laws of Canada.""

It's yet to be determined whether Bacon will appear at the sentencing in person or via video link due to restrictions aimed at stopping the spread of COVID-19.

In court documents, the Crown alleges that at the time of the murders Bacon was a leader of the Red Scorpions gang.

The officer in charge of the investigation previously told the court it was one of the largest and most complex investigations that police have undertaken in the province. By November 2016, about 1,300 officers had been involved in the investigation.

In 2014, two men were convicted of six counts of first-degree murder in the Surrey Six case.

That is to say, boards need to have information from management on the risks posed to an organization so they can make prudent and informed decisions, said Carol Hansell, a principal with McLaughlin Hansell Advisory Inc. and senior partner with Hansell LLP, which provides corporate legal, government relations and communications advice.

article continues below

As with COVID-19, if management is to manage climate change risk, it needs direction and resources from the board level, she said.

“If the board accepts the fact that climate change is a real and imminent risk, they need to say to management, ‘we need some information on how climate change is a real and imminent risk to this business,’” Hansell said.

Her comments in a July 9 webinar coming after her release of her ‘Putting Climate Risk on the Boardroom Table’ opinion released in June.

Hansell said there is now broad consensus among scientists, politicians and policy makers that climate change is real.

“Climate change has been so broadly acknowledged that boards of directors need to onboard that consensus and assess how climate change is affecting their business,” Hansell said. “A reasonably prudent person would be taking climate change risk into account as part of their risk register.”

What it comes down to, she said, is a simple test where duty of care requires each director to exercise care, diligence and skill.

“But to what standard?” she asked in the opinion. “That question is answered by the next phrase in the test – a director must exercise the care, diligence and skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise.”

And, she said, Canadian courts have taken judicial notice of that climate change consensus on “and the existential risks it poses or business.”

“They essentially said, ‘You don’t need to bother proving this to us,’” Hansell said.

Moreover, Hansell said, if a board of directors is not seen as reasonable in its decision making, a court would not defer to it.

And, Hansell said, directors need to be clear their first duty is to the organization rather than its stakeholders.

“We have yet to have case law on whether stakeholders like creditors or communities or environmental groups can say they are stakeholders that directors must take into account,” Hansell said.

Hansell said tools exist to assist boards in deliberations.

Hansell was clear that boards do not need a director brought specifically as an expert on climate change issues.

She said that became the case in 1999 when companies were worried about the Y2K issue, where havoc was expected in computer systems which only dealt with years in two digits rather than four – ie ‘99’ instead of ‘1999’ which would have dated things to the start of the last century – 1900 instead of 2000 - as the millennium changed.

“That created a board position with a single-subject matter person boards would defer to,” Hansell said.

“It was otherwise an empty chair at board meetings,” she said.

“Many, many boards in Canada are already doing a spectacular job.”

Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada director of corporate oversight and governance Gigi Dawe said the issue is one of many new areas directors have to wrangle with, including digitization, cybercrime and geopolitical considerations.

She said directors know banks, investors, regulators and other stakeholders are demanding boards consider climate change as part of their operational oversight.

“Boards are being given an unambiguous message that they need to step up to the plate,” Dawe said.

York University Osgoode Hall law school Prof Cynthia Williams said Hansell’s opinion builds on work done by Australian Noel Huntley who said climate related risks “represent foreseeable risks of harm to Australian businesses.”

Williams said many Canadian law firms have no issues with memos to boards saying climate change is real and an issue needing to be addressed.

The webinar was put on by Canada Climate Law Initiative, which examines the legal basis for corporations’ directors, officers and pension fiduciaries to consider, manage, and report on climate-related financial risks and opportunities. It also looks at advancing effective climate governance practice knowledge and exploring the scope and limits of fiduciary obligation limits around climate change.

The professional bodies for doctors and nurses are supporting her investigation and they should not fear losing their jobs, despite the fact that British Columbia's whistle-blower legislation does not apply to health authorities, she said.

Turpel-Lafond said compelling physicians to give evidence can be difficult so she is hoping for voluntary compliance and disclosure from those who won't be ""shamed"" as Indigenous people themselves have been through racism.

""I can say, though, if I do find that there have been violations of the Criminal Code or the standards of health professional bodies as I look into these investigations, I will report that to the appropriate authorities,"" Turpel-Lafond said.

She said an investigation, not an inquiry as some Indigenous groups have suggested, is the quickest route to addressing ongoing racism that has not been dealt with because of a broken complaint system.

Racism exists across the health-care system with Indigenous people seeking care often asked irrelevant questions about whether they are intoxicated or addicted to substances, Turpel-Lafond said.

Her investigative team includes former provincial health officer Dr. Perry Kendall as well as Indigenous professionals with clinical experience and those who will analyze data about the number of Indigenous people using the health-care system.

Turpel-Lafond expects to provide an initial report in a few months to Health Minister Adrian Dix, who appointed her to conduct an investigation on June 18.

However, Turpel-Lafond said CEOs of health authorities should immediately address allegations of racism and she'll ask those who didn't to explain themselves.

She is urging Indigenous people to complete a confidential survey of their experiences and says anyone with experience or knowledge of racism could provide information through email or a 1-800 number.

Daniel Fontaine, CEO of Metis Nation British Columbia, one of the groups assisting with the investigation, said he learned last month about a ""Price is Right"" game played in an emergency room by staff guessing the blood-alcohol level of Indigenous patients.

He said the allegations were outlined in a report by the Provincial Health Services Authority and a second report included ""story after story of racism"" reported by health-care workers around the province.

Both reports were brought to him by his staff, who work in the Health Ministry, and were stamped March 2019, Fontaine said, adding he contacted the deputy health minister the night before Dix made the allegations public.

""I said we were going to have to speak out because these reports had been produced 15 months ago,"" he said.

Fontaine said the organization planned a news conference the following morning but backed off when Dix announced Turpel-Lafond's appointment.

Fontaine said he's hoping she will recommend all health-care workers be provided with standardized cultural training that has been endorsed by Indigenous groups.

""Are people being held accountable for participating in racist activities? Those are the kinds of things we're hoping this investigation will look into as well.""

This year’s presidential campaign in the United States will be very different from the ones of elections past, with the COVID-19 pandemic affecting public gatherings, events and conventions.

article continues below

Research Co. has been tracking this democratic process, and some themes are starting to emerge. The last presidential contest that saw an incumbent seek a new term took place in 2012, when Democrat Barack Obama ultimately defeated Republican Mitt Romney. I had the privilege of following that election from start to finish, and there are many differences between what we saw eight years ago and the mood of Americans in 2020.

In July 2012, there was no clear frontrunner in the race for the White House. Obama and Romney were supported by 47% of decided voters across the United States, with Independents barely breaking in favour of the incumbent president. Obama could count on the votes of most women and young voters, while Romney connected well with men and older voters.

This year, the situation is dissimilar. Trump, the Republican incumbent, sits 10 points behind prospective Democratic Party nominee Joe Biden at the national level. Across the country, in a survey that was completed before the Independence Day celebrations, 53% of decided voters said they would cast a ballot for Biden, while 43% would support Trump.

Independents, who backed Trump over Hillary Clinton in 2016, are no longer happy with the president. In this crucial group, Biden is ahead of Trump by 15 points (54% to 39%). Unless the numbers tighten among American voters who do not align themselves with the Democrats or the Republicans, Trump’s chances will fade.

In our tracking, Trump’s approval rating dropped to 40% this month, down six points since we checked in early June, well into the COVID-19 pandemic but before the protests about racial equality dominated media coverage. An approval rating hovering around 50% is usually an indicator of a lost election for an incumbent president. Trump is significantly below this threshold right now.

Trump’s approval rating is particularly bad with African Americans (21%) and Latino and Hispanic Americans (32%). These two groups are usually supportive of Democrats, so the results are not earth-shattering. Still, his numbers also fell to 46% among White Americans.

When we asked Americans to select six words out of a list of 18 to describe Trump, almost three in five selected “arrogant” (57%). Of the six words chosen, the only one that is remotely positive is “strong” (36%). More than a third of Americans perceive their current head of state as “dishonest” (40%), “uncaring” (39%), “foolish” (also 39%) and “out of touch” (34%).

This does not mean that Americans are enthralled by Biden. When we pose the same question about the prospective Democratic Party nominee, about three in 10 Americans describe him as “intelligent” (32%), “compassionate” (also 32%), “down to earth” (30%), “honest” (28%), “weak” (28%) and “out of touch” (28%).

We could look at Biden’s results as superior to Trump’s, since only one of the six words is overly negative (“weak.”) These numbers are very different from what Barack Obama and Mitt Romney posted in July 2012.

At that time, 50% of Americans regarded Obama as “intelligent” and 46% felt the same way about Romney. In an exceedingly polarized nation, the numbers on this indicator are significantly lower for both Biden (32%) and Trump (31%).

Right now, Biden is clearly favoured at the national level, but we still need to look into the way specific American states will behave. The Democrats hope to win the three jurisdictions that took Trump to the White House (Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin) and perhaps make inroads in Florida and Ohio.

No election is decided four months in advance. In any case, three indicators point to Biden enjoying unique advantages in 2020: Trump’s weak approval rating, reminiscent of what Jimmy Carter and George H. W. Bush posted in 1976 and 1992, his difficulties in reconnecting with Independents, and a lower proportion of voters willing to cast a ballot for a third-party candidate.

In 2016, almost 6% of all cast ballots in the American presidential election went to third-party candidates, most notably Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party and Jill Stein of the Green Party. This year, Americans are not looking at third parties as much as they were four years ago, with only 3% selecting Libertarian Jo Jorgensen or “some other candidate.” However, we collected our data before a man called Kanye Omari West flirted with becoming the Ross Perot of the 21st Century.

Given that B.C. has an estimated population of about 5,190,000 people, that translates into one case for every 1,735 residents, or 0.579 people per 1,000 residents. That compares with Washington State's estimated population of 7,615,000 people and 37,491 cases, for about one case of COVID-19 for every 203 people, or 4.92 people per 1,000 residents.

Three people in B.C. have died in the past day from the virus that spawned a global pandemic, making the death toll in the province now 186. Of the 162 people actively fighting off the disease, 17 are in hospital, with three of those in intensive care. The rest are self-isolating at home.

More than 88% of those infected in the province, or 2,660, have recovered.

""While there are no active community outbreaks in B.C., new cases and community exposure events continue to occur in the community,"" Health Minister Adrian Dix and provincial health officer Bonnie Henry said in a joint statement.

The two acknowledged that there has been a second case of exposure to the virus in a strip club – at the No. 5 Orange bar on Main Street. That is the second instance of exposure at a strip club, following one at Brandi's Exotic Show Lounge on Hornby Street in late June.

Public health teams have issued an alert for anyone who may have been at the No. 5 Orange on July 1.

""If you have been at a location with a community exposure event, monitor yourself for symptoms, limit your contact with others and contact 811 to arrange for testing if any symptoms develop,"" Dix and Henry said. ""Contact tracing to contain the spread of COVID-19 requires all of our involvement to be successful.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,018 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,589 in Fraser Health;

• 133 in Island Health;

• 203 in Interior Health; and

• 65 in Northern Health.

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreaks at Tabor and at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred to those homes from the hospital. The outbreak at the Tabor long-term care home was declared over on July 7.

""Fewer faces, bigger spaces is the safest approach, because we know crowded, closed spaces where people may be in close contact with each other are higher-risk environments for all of us and need to be avoided at this time,"" said Henry and Dix.

The Mounties say in a release that four people were taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, including a Calgary man who was driving the westbound semi.

Police say there were heavy brake marks at the scene, and they believe the semi crossed into the oncoming lane after the driver failed to safely make a turn on the highway.

The truck flipped onto its side and skidded down the highway before striking the five other vehicles travelling eastbound.

Police say the driver has been charged with crossing a double line under the B.C. Motor Vehicle Act.

The Mounties say speed may have been a factor in the crash but there's no evidence to suggest impaired driving was involved.

The survey of 1,401 member businesses from groups including the BC Chamber of Commerce, Greater Vancouver Board of Trade and Business Council of B.C. indicates owners want a bold, long-term recovery plan.

Only 16 per cent of businesses were confident in B.C.'s restart plan and 47 per cent were not.

Two-thirds of those surveyed were relying on some form of government support and owners were braced for a ""second wave"" of shutdowns or other problems if programs expire too quickly.

Some 28 per cent believed they'll return to normal once programs end, 32 per cent expected to cut workers' hours, 27 per cent anticipated layoffs, and one business in every 10 forecast either temporary or permanent closure.

Owners say payroll and wage supports must remain key components of B.C.'s recovery plan, along with fee and tax cuts.

The survey also identified expectations that the province must create better investment conditions.

Bridgitte Anderson, president and CEO of the Greater Vancouver Board of Trade, says business viability hinges on those measures.

Val Litwin with the BC Chamber of Commerce urges policy-makers to ""stay sensitive"" to the vulnerability of the business sector.

""A bold economic recovery plan that helps small businesses compete is non-negotiable for a prosperous B.C., and when small businesses thrive so do communities and people,"" Litwin said in a statement.

""Governments must keep focused on delivering their recovery plans swiftly.""

The joint study by researchers at the B.C. Centre for Disease Control, University of B.C., LifeLabs and public health scientists is posted on the health research website medRxiv and a news conference on the findings is scheduled for Thursday morning.

article continues below

The authors say the findings indicate successful suppression of community transmission in B.C., with an estimated overall infection rate of less than one per cent.

The study looked at anonymous blood samples collected for reasons unrelated to COVID-19 by LifeLabs in March and May, before and after public health measures were introduced.

The first samples in March found two of 869 specimens were positive, for a prevalence of 0.28 per cent, while the May sample found a prevalence of 0.55 per cent.

Health Minister Adrian Dix described the estimated infection rate as ""very low"" and says it shows the effectiveness of British Columbia's public health measures and co-operation of the public.

""It reinforces the fact that we're on the right track,"" Dix says.

""Of course, this is as the study suggests a dual-edged question, a low level of transmission but also very few people with antibodies to deal with potential future spikes of COVID-19.""

If the study's prevalence rate is applied to the whole provincial population, it could mean about 28,000 people have had the novel coronavirus, while 3,149 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed to date, however Dix noted the results are specific to the Vancouver area.

Health officials have repeatedly said that more people have been infected with the virus than have tested positive and Dix calls the estimated prevalence rate in B.C. ""encouraging.""

""Overall the level of infection in B.C. was low and that's due to the actions of people in B.C. That said, there are more people who were infected with COVID-19 than tested positive and that's something we've said clearly, especially in the period of March and April when we were focusing our testing program particularly on specific groups including health-care workers,"" Dix says.

The study is the first of its kind in Canada, he says.

The study is also important because it involved people who did not self-select for COVID-19 testing, so they likely didn't believe they had the virus, Dix says.

The study was authorized by provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and approved by the clinical research ethics board of the university. It has not yet been peer reviewed.

British Columbia recorded 21 new cases Wednesday and no new deaths. There are 207 active cases while 2,753 people who tested positive have recovered, the government said in a news release.

The resources include videos and webinars on topics such as adapting to online learning, stress management and navigating financial supports.

Mark says the province is also providing another $400,000 to support the development of more resources covering a wide range of courses and subjects in B.C.'s growing open textbook collection.

The minister says students may also now apply to StudentAid BC to be automatically considered for a free access grant announced in this year's provincial budget.

She says the grant means more than 40,000 eligible low- and middle-income students could receive up to $4,000 per year to help with costs associated with degree, diploma and certificate programs.

Dylan Perceval-Maxwell was removed on July 8 from the race to succeed Elizabeth May as the party's leader.

The party says ""several"" recent statements by Perceval-Maxwell are inappropriate and the party's leadership contest authority decided it would not stay silent and allow him to continue his campaign.

Perceval-Maxwell appealed the decision and lost.

The Montreal environmental activist says in a Facebook post shared Wednesday that he is apologetic for saying in a June 23 debate that police should be forced to pay $20 to every person of colour they stop, as compensation for the trauma and an incentive for police to think twice before stopping someone.

Montreal lawyer Meryam Haddad, who is also running for the leadership, told Perceval-Maxwell during the debate that the comment was ""super racist.""

Perceval-Maxwell said in his Facebook statement that putting the dollar figure out there was a mistake but also shared the Oxford dictionary definition of racism to defend himself.

""According to this definition, my idea was not 'racist' as was claimed during that debate,"" he said. The idea is not prejudiced or antagonistic against members of minority groups, he said.

He said he agrees that he should not have included a specific dollar figure on compensation, and said he has apologized many times for the comment. He also said that attacking people who are not ""actively"" engaged in oppression is how genocides happen.

Perceval-Maxwell added that his ""dear Jewish mother"" survived the Holocaust by hiding in a garbage can in Hungary and that he firmly believes ""standing up for the rights of all regardless of race and class is the thing we have to do.""

In its written statement, the Green party said it expects ""those who are called out for making discriminatory statements will reflect, learn and commit to doing better.""

""The party respects every individual’s right of free speech but we will not provide a platform to normalize racism and discrimination,"" the statement says. ""We are committed to creating a forum where contestants can debate the solutions that Canada needs to survive and thrive in the 21st century.""

Haddad told The Canadian Press she knows the party got many complaints about the comments and that she is happy to see the party take quick and decisive action.

""It shows that our organization will just not tolerate someone who makes racist comments,"" she said.

Haddad also said Perceval-Maxwell's attempts to apologize are not thorough enough.

""When people that live racism tell him that it's a racist comment, like he should apologize and he never apologized properly,"" she said. ""He apologized for me to feel that way.""

Perceval-Maxwell acknowledged many people do not think his apologies are full and sincere. He said he is relieved to not be in the race any more because he can now get more sleep and exercise.

There remain nine people in the contest to find a permanent successor for Elizabeth May. The race will be decided by online and mail-in ballots this fall. The winner is to be announced the first weekend of October.

The Canada-U.S. border has been closed to so-called ""discretionary"" travel like vacations and shopping trips since the COVID-19 pandemic took hold of the continent in mid-March, an agreement that had been set to expire July 21.

The extension comes with COVID-19 resurgent across the U.S. — cases are on the rise in all 50 states, and southern states like Florida, Arizona and California are facing a fresh crisis with overcrowded hospital wards, refrigerated truck trailers serving as makeshift morgues and another shortage of personal protective medical gear.

The escalating emergency has also exposed a deep divide between Canadians dead-set against reopening the border and U.S. lawmakers in northern border states who continue to press both countries for a blueprint for doing exactly that.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has called the extent of the pandemic in the U.S. a ""constantly evolving"" situation, but won't say whether officials have considered extending the border restrictions beyond the standard 30-day window.

""Based on the success of the existing restrictions and close collaboration with Mexico and Canada, (the Department of Homeland Security) will continue to limit non-essential travel at our land ports of entry with Canada and Mexico until Aug. 20,"" Wolf tweeted.

The 8,000-kilogram, armour-plated truck — equipped with a rotating roof hatch, eight gun ports and a powered battering ram — looked like it was ready for the worst of war zones.

article continues below

However, when the purchase was scuttled by city council last month, Mayor Mike Savage made it clear the brawny vehicle had become a symbol of oppression, particularly for Halifax's Black community. The mayor said the money would be used instead for anti-Black racism programs.

""There has been in this province a history of systemic racism, and we have to do better,"" Savage said at the time.

The decision was seen as a step forward by those who have long complained that Canada's police forces are becoming paramilitary organizations that act more like occupying armies than community-based partners.

""This announcement sends a positive message,"" said Akwasi Owusu-Bempah, a sociology professor at the University of Toronto. ""I have no doubt that what we call defunding of police ... will take hold in Canada.""

Owusu-Bempah, whose work examines race, crime and policing, cited the July 6 decision by Edmonton city council to cut $11 million over two years from the Edmonton Police Service budget. That money will be spent on housing, social services and a safety task force.

The professor, who also works with the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, said there is a growing movement to ""de-task"" the police, which means reducing the scope of their responsibilities and reallocating the savings.

He said mental-health organizations should be given the resources to deal with people facing mental-health crises rather than poorly trained front-line officers.

In the same vein, police should not be expanding their duties to include what the military is trained to do, because it transforms peace officers into soldiers who see members of the public as enemy combatants, he said.

""Poor, Black and Indigenous people then become the enemies in the war on drugs. It further entrenches the problems of racial injustice,"" Owusu-Bempah said. ""(Police) feel like they're in battle, as opposed to serving a community.""

The Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police did not respond to a request for an interview.

Meanwhile, there are others who say the about-face in Halifax was just a distraction from a much larger problem.

Kevin Walby, an associate professor of criminal justice at the University of Winnipeg, said there's more to militarization than the purchase of armoured vehicles, automatic weapons and tactical gear.

""In terms of defunding, they're actually the smallest piece of the puzzle,"" he said. ""So I wouldn't say the decision (in Halifax) means that Halifax police are off the hook when it comes to militarization, because it could still be happening in other ways.""

As an example, Walby points to the increasing use of heavily armed emergency response team members in routine, everyday policing.

Using information gleaned through access to information laws, Walby has found that police forces across Canada are increasingly using SWAT members to serve low-risk warrants.

""It is happening all the time, but we don't see it,"" he said. ""And they even assign SWAT team members to do mental-health checks.""

As well, Walby said he has been tracking a more insidious form of militarization known as ""community policing.""

It involves teams of officers fanning out in neighbourhoods to ask residents questions about their safety concerns and problems with their neighbours. The information is later used to compile detailed community profiles.

Though it may sound like a tame, feel-good strategy, Walby said community policing is anything but.

""Community policing has morphed into this kind of intelligence-gathering activity,"" he said. ""The militaries in Afghanistan and Iraq used community policing models to ... collect intelligence and feed it back into military operations. Canadian police are now using the very same tactic.""

In the United States, where the militarization of police has been more overt, an academic paper in the journal Research and Politics found that the increasing use of military equipment has led to more violent police behaviour.

The article, published in June 2017, cites a U.S. Department of Defence program that has made excess military weapons and vehicles available to local law enforcement agencies since the late 1990s.

The study revealed a statistically significant relationship between military transfers to police in four states and fatalities from officer-involved shootings.

""As militarization seeps into their cultures, (law enforcement agencies) rely more on violence to solve problems,"" the paper says. ""The mechanism mirrors psychology's classic 'Law of the Instrument,' whereby access to a certain tool increases the probability that the tool is used for problems when other tools may be more appropriate.""

Owusu-Bempah said police in the United States routinely use armoured vehicles for low-level drug raids.

""In the United States, we saw police with armoured vehicles pulling down the front walls of houses with a battering ram to execute warrants,"" he said. ""When you have the militarized type of policing, it creates an environment in which the warrior cop is allowed to exist.""

In January 2015, U.S. President Barack Obama cited concerns over the militarization of police when he signed an executive order that prohibits law enforcement agencies from acquiring certain military equipment, including tracked armoured vehicles, bayonets, grenade launchers and large-calibre weapons.

Obama's order came a few months after the shooting by police of Michael Brown, an unarmed Black youth in Ferguson, Mo., whose death sparked protests across the country — not unlike the protests that followed the death of George Floyd, the Black man in Minneapolis who died May 25 as a police officer was kneeling on his neck.

The disturbing video showing Floyd's violent arrest gave rise to a global movement that, among other things, is calling for the defunding and demilitarization of police departments — and an end to police brutality and systemic racism.

Plenty of cities across Canada already have armoured vehicles like the one Halifax rejected, including Ottawa, Fredericton, Saskatoon, Winnipeg and Sault Ste. Marie, Ont.

The Department of National Defence confirmed in 2014 it had donated five armoured vehicles to police agencies since 2007: a Grizzly armoured personnel carrier to Edmonton police in 2007; two Cougar armoured vehicles to the B.C. RCMP in 2010; and one Cougar each to the police in New Glasgow, N.S., and Windsor, Ont., in 2013.

The Cougar sent to New Glasgow was given away in 2017 because it was never put to good use, the police chief said at the time.

Still, the police departments that have these vehicles argue they are necessary because they offer protection to officers and the public during mass public shootings, hostage takings and other high-risk scenarios.

Ottawa lawyer Michael Spratt doesn't buy that rationale.

""Our police forces look more like military organizations — with automatic rifles and riot shields and tanks,"" said Spratt who specializes in criminal law and policing. ""There's no need for any police force to have a tank.""

The Ottawa Police Service, for example, has an imposing armoured vehicle known as a Lenco Bearcat, which Spratt says has rarely seen service since it was purchased in 2010.

""When we're talking about defunding the police ... this is really low-hanging fruit,"" said Spratt. ""Even if there is some marginal benefit in some rare circumstances, the cost of having these vehicles — and inherent harm of having a militarized police force — vastly outweighs any potential benefit.""

Mohammed Shahed, a member of the governing party who regularly appeared on TV talk shows, was arrested Wednesday by the Rapid Action Battalion near the Indian border after a nine-day manhunt.

Shahed is chairman of the Regent Group and owner of two Regent hospitals in the capital, Dhaka.

Abdul Baten, a commissioner of the Detective Branch in Dhaka, said Shahed admitted after his arrest that his hospitals did not have proper equipment to conduct coronavirus tests.

A court in Dhaka on Thursday allowed investigators to keep Shahed in custody for 10 days for questioning.

Officials said the hospitals had issued more than 10,000 coronavirus test results and about 60% were fake even though patients were charged for them. The hospitals allegedly arranged for the remaining tests to be conducted by another hospital.

The two hospitals had not renewed their medical licenses for years, but the Ministry of Health nevertheless signed a deal with Shahed to dedicate the hospitals to coronavirus testing and treatment as the number of cases rose in Bangladesh.

Bangladesh on Thursday was nearing 200,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, including 2,496 deaths. Public health experts say the actual number is much higher because only about 70 testing facilities are available in the country of 160 million people.

Shahed belongs to the governing Awami League party headed by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and is a member of its foreign affairs subcommittee. He has more than 50 illegal cases pending against him across the country on various charges including forgery and cheating.

Another doctor and her husband were also arrested recently on similar charges of falsifying test results.

Local media reports say the scams could hurt Bangladesh’s earnings from overseas workers. Last week, Italy suspended all flights from Bangladesh to Rome after some Bangladeshis reportedly presented fake negative test reports for the coronavirus.

Bangladesh earns about $19 billion a year from about 10 million overseas workers. Authorities said about 15,000 Bangladeshi workers with jobs in Italy remain stranded in Bangladesh and it is unclear whether they will be able to travel to the European country.

Bangladesh has reopened businesses including its main export-earning garment sector after a monthslong closure.",[]

The Anti-Defamation league and some Jewish leaders had condemned what they called anti-Semitic theories expressed by Cannon and demanded the apology.

article continues below

""First and foremost I extend my deepest and most sincere apologies to my Jewish sisters and brothers for the hurtful and divisive words that came out of my mouth during my interview with Richard Griffin,"" Cannon said on his Twitter account.

""They reinforced the worst stereotypes of a proud and magnificent people and I feel ashamed of the uninformed and naïve place that these words came from. The video of this interview has since been removed.""

ViacomCBS cut ties with the TV host and producer Tuesday in response to his comments on a podcast where he discussed racial bias.

Rabbi Abraham Cooper, the Simon Wiesenthal Center’s associate dean, told The Associated Press that Cannon reached out to him Wednesday and during a 30-minute telephone conversation he apologized to the Jewish community and Cooper asked him to post it on social media.

""He started out the right way, he said the right things. Half an hour is a long time, and we'll probably meet tomorrow in the LA area,"" Cooper said.

""He understood that the words and references that he thought were based on fact, turned out to be hateful propaganda and stereotypical rhetoric.""

The TV host and producer wrote earlier a lengthy Facebook post defending himself and criticizing his firing for what the company deemed ""bigotry"" and ""anti-Semitism,"" prominent members of the U.S. Jewish community said the post fell well short and demanded an apology.

""It’s not enough to say, ‘I’m not a racist, I’m not a bigot,’"" Cooper had told the AP earlier. ""The statements he made are hurtful, and they’re false.""

Cooper said Cannon should read and heed the words of Martin Luther King Jr., who ""dedicated his life for civil rights for all and a colour-blind America."" Cooper also had advised him to seek out the guidance of basketball Hall of Famer-turned-writer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who has condemned several sports and entertainment celebrities for anti-Semitic posts.

In the hour-plus episode of ""Cannon's Class"" released last month that prompted his firing, Cannon and Richard ""Professor Griff"" Griffin, formerly of the rap group Public Enemy, contended that Black people are the true Hebrews and Jews have usurped that identity.

Cannon then argued that lighter-skinned people — ""Jewish people, white people, Europeans"" — ""are a little less"" and have a ""deficiency"" that historically caused them to act out of fear and commit acts of violence to survive.

""They had to be savages,"" he said.

""When I first heard about the comments Mr. Cannon made, it was very, very disappointing,"" said Oren Segal, director of the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism. ""We’re in a time where hatred of all kinds is very much apparent. It’s in the news every day.""

""Anti-Semitism in particular over the past several years has been something that we've seen in increase , as well as racism and other issues,"" Segal added. ""So when you hear an individual who has a public profile, who has influence over people, make statements that are highly offensive to the Jewish community, the first reaction is disappointment.""

Anti-Semitic violent attacks rose worldwide by 18% in 2019 compared with the previous year, according to a report published in April by Tel Aviv University’s Kantor Center for the Study of Contemporary Jewry.

Segal said some members of the Black Hebrew Israelite movement see themselves as the true ""chosen people,"" and believe that Blacks, Hispanics and Native Americans are the true descendants of the 12 Tribes of Israel. He noted that not all spew hateful rhetoric, although many adhere to an extreme set of anti-Semitic beliefs.

Bruce D. Haynes, a professor of sociology at the University of California, Davis, who has been studying Black Jews for more than two decades, agreed that the remarks echo the ideas of extreme Black Hebrew Israelites and of Minister Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam leader who last year referenced ""Satanic Jews"" in a speech denying allegations of anti-Semitism. But Haynes took a more nuanced view.

""The danger is that those groups get confused with other self-identified Israelites like (Rabbi) Capers Funnye, who has a congregation in Chicago, and who is very much involved with the Ashkenazim Jewish community. So I want to make clear that the term 'Israelites' is a tricky term,"" he said.

""Is it anti-Semitic to say Black people are the real Israelites or the real Jews? I’m not sure I’d call it anti-Semitism,"" Haynes said. ""It’s not a good reading of history, but I wouldn’t call it anti-Semitism. On the other hand, some of those groups that call Jews impostors certainly cross the line.""

Until his firing, Cannon produced ""Wild ’n Out,"" a comedy improv series for VH1, the ViacomCBS-owned cable channel.

In an earlier Facebook post, he had said that he welcomes being held accountable and takes responsibility for his words, while also accusing the company of trying to silence an ""outspoken black man"" and demanding full ownership of the ""Wild ’n Out"" brand.

""I do not condone hate speech nor the spread of hateful rhetoric. ... The Black and Jewish communities have both faced enormous hatred, oppression persecution and prejudice for thousands of years and in many ways have and will continue to work together to overcome these obstacles,"" he wrote.

Cooper had said that Cannon should reject Farrakhan’s hate speech and ""reduce the long statement to two sentences"" — a simple apology, which he did after their conversation.

""I just had the blessed opportunity to converse with Rabbi Abraham Cooper director of global social action @SimonWiesenthal. My first words to my brother was, I apologize for the hurt I caused the Jewish Community"" Cannon tweeted.

""On my podcast I used words & referenced literature I assumed to be factual to uplift my community instead turned out to be hateful propaganda and stereotypical rhetoric that pained another community For this I am deeply sorry but now together we can write a new chapter of healing.""

""My hope is that this series can be a place to explore meaningful topics together and sort through so many of the questions we’re all trying to answer in our own lives,"" Obama said in a statement.

The new podcast is the first title in the ongoing collaboration between Spotify and Higher Ground, a production company founded by Barack and Michelle Obama. Last year, the former president and first lady partnered with Spotify to produce exclusive podcasts for the platform.

Michelle Obama’s new podcast expects to hold candid and personal conversations with a focus on topics concerning relationships and health. She expects to have several guests on the series including talk-show host Conan O’Brien and Valerie Jarrett, business woman and former senior advisor to Barack Obama.

""Perhaps most of all, I hope this podcast will help listeners open up new conversations — and hard conversations —- with the people who matter most to them,"" she said. ""That’s how we can build more understanding and empathy for one another.""

Obama released her Netflix documentary ""Becoming"" in May. The project was an extension of her 2018 bestselling memoir of the same name and a kind of authorized filmic portrait of Obama.

The Census Bureau reported Thursday that retail sales are 1.1% higher than their levels from a year ago, after a brutal plunge in March and April was offset by a decent rebound in May and June. But any gains might be short-lived as infections began to rise toward the end of June.

""While today’s report gives the illusion of a fearless consumer spending lavishly, the reality is more sobering: consumers are increasingly fearful amid new spikes in COVID-19 cases and a looming fiscal cliff,"" said Lydia Boussour, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.

The report shows how shoppers and businesses are adjusting to life in a pandemic, changing their habits in hopes of halting an illness that can quickly flare-up and wreak financial havoc.

Bars in Texas shuttered again at the end of last month as infections surged in that state. Pennsylvania this week ordered that restaurants can only seat 25% of their potential customers. Gap, Kohl’s and other stores are withdrawing clothes worn in their changing rooms from sales floors for several days as a precautionary move. Adding to all this pressure are signs that the recovery in consumer spending began to stall at the end of last month, according to analysis of credit cards by the bank JPMorgan Chase.

""I suspect the modest pullback we have seen in our card spending data since late June is driven by concern about the resurgence of COVID-19,"" said Jesse Edgerton, an economist with the bank.

June's retail numbers showed the complicated nature of an uncertain recovery.

Non-store sales—which includes online shopping—slumped 2.4% over the past month but are 23.5% higher from a year ago. Spending at restaurants and bars jumped 20% last month, but it's still down 26.3% from last year. Sales at clothiers more than doubled between May and June, yet they've collapsed 23.2% from a year ago.

Shoppers have responded by shifting their spending, and not only to online retailers. Sales at building materials stores were up 17.3% annually. Stores in the sporting goods, musical instrument, books and hobbies categories have enjoyed yearly growth of 20.6%. Purchases at grocers have increased 11.7% over the past year.",[]

The bank's report says 1.5 million women lost their jobs in the first two months of the pandemic.

The report found that women tend to work in industries hardest hit by the crisis, their employment level has been slower to rebound as the economy reopens and they are more likely to fall out of the workforce in the long-term.

The study says one-third of women who lost jobs between February and June did not seek work, putting them at higher risk of long term job-separation and future wage penalties.

Employment among women with toddlers or school-aged children fell seven per cent between February and May, compared with a four-per cent decrease for fathers of children the same age.

Single mothers with a toddler or school-aged child saw their employment drop 12 per cent between February and June, compared with a seven per cent decrease for single fathers.

The study says women accounted for about 45 per cent of the decline in hours worked over the downturn, but will only make up 35 per cent of the recovery.

The Toronto-based miner says gold production in the three months ended June 30 fell by about eight per cent to 1.149 million ounces from 1.25 million in the previous quarter, mainly due to COVID-19 related disruptions at its Veladero mine in Argentina.

article continues below

It warns that second quarter gold all-in sustaining costs per ounce are expected to be seven to nine per cent higher than in the first quarter, while copper costs are to rise by four to six per cent.

Barrick says the average market price for gold in the second quarter was US$1,711 per ounce, up from its realized price of US$1,589 per ounce in the first quarter.

Copper production, meanwhile, rose to 120 million pounds from 115 million in the first quarter, and the average market price was US$2.43 per pound, up from a realized price of US$2.23 in the first quarter.

CEO Mark Bristow says Barrick is positioned well to achieve its guidance for the year.

In May, 2020 gold guidance was adjusted lower by about 200,000 ounces to between 4.6 and five million ounces to account for the suspension of its Porgera gold mine amid a dispute with the federal government in Papua New Guinea.

Barrick is to report its second quarter financial results on Aug. 10.

The Toronto-based company says it has reassigned about 220 of the complex's 475 workers elsewhere within its Canadian organization since the suspension began in April.

However, Kirkland Lake Gold says it now believes that the best course of action is to provide severance packages for the remaining employees who can't be reassigned.

The mining and milling complex near Matheson, Ont., was designated as non-core to Kirkland Lake Gold's business in mid-February.

That was followed by a suspension of operations as of April 2 under protocols that Kirkland Lake Gold put into effect to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Holt, Taylor and Holloway mines and Holt mill accounted for nearly 12 per cent of the 975,000 ounces produced last year by Kirkland Lake Gold, according to its website.

But closing those sales has been problematic, Rivera says, since the Alberta government ended a rebate program that had covered as much as 35 per cent of the initial cost of a typical system.

article continues below

""I've been in the solar business long enough to watch it slowly, slowly increase, then once the grant program was there, it increased quite sharply for the residential market,"" says the president and co-founder of Calgary's GreenLight Power, which was founded in 2008.

""But, once the grants disappeared (last fall), we saw that sharp increase drop drastically. We had 21 customers signed up — the day they cancelled the grant, all but one cancelled their contract with us.""

The financial argument for investing in a home solar power array in Canada depends, experts say, on how much sun your house receives, how much it costs for electricity from the public grid, the capital cost of installation and, of course, which way the political wind blows.

In Alberta's case, the United Conservative Party cancelled a program put in place by the New Democrats. Similarly, after a 2018 provincial election, Ontario's Progressive Conservatives put an end to the main solar rebates program, implemented by a previous Liberal-led government.

Shifting policy and power prices make it difficult to estimate how long it will take for energy savings to pay off the capital cost of a home system, said Nicholas Gall, director, distributed energy resource for CanREA, the Canadian Renewable Energy Association.

Abundant — and cheap — hydroelectric power in Quebec, for instance, makes it more difficult to justify home solar power on a cost-saving basis there, he said.

Still, the declining cost of solar panels makes them a much better deal today than they were a decade ago.

""Costs for solar panels have fallen by about 55 per cent between 2008 and 2018,"" he said, citing the most recently available numbers.

""Those costs will represent anywhere from 20 to 45 per cent of the total installed cost. There are fixed costs that haven't come down as much, for labour and permitting and design, but the hardware is continuing to decrease in price.""

Installations are long-lived, he said, noting some installed in the 1980s are still producing plenty of electricity and panels installed today are expected to last at least 30 years.

The systems work best if your roof faces south but east or west can work, too, he said. (Roofs that are shaded by neighbours or trees make poor solar power collectors.)

Most provinces have programs where excess power from residential systems is purchased for distribution on the grid, he added, but the compensation varies widely from one jurisdiction to another.

Asked which Canadian province is the best in which to buy a solar power system now, Gall was quick to identify Prince Edward Island, which has a ""generous"" rebate of $1 per watt.

""That's around 40 per cent of the total installed cost for a typical system, up to a maximum of $10,000,"" he said.

Nova Scotia has a slightly less generous rebate program that pays 60 cents per watt, up to 25 per cent of system costs, to a maximum of $6,000, he added.

There are a hodgepodge of other programs across the country. The Northwest Territories, for instance, will pay up to 50 per cent of the cost of a solar system but only for buildings that are off the grid.

Some municipal governments also offer solar rebates — Medicine Hat is an example in southern Alberta. In Calgary, residents can lease their solar power system.

Prospective homebuyers in Edmonton and Calgary, meanwhile, have the option to buy solar power as an included component of their new house — Jayman Built Homes has been putting six-panel, two-kilowatt solar systems on all of its homes since early 2019.

The Calgary-based company built 811 homes last year and expects to add more than 700 this year, said Jayman president and chief operating officer Dave Desormeaux.

The withdrawal of the provincial rebate program last year meant an additional cost to Jayman of about $1,500 per home, he said, but after much thought, the company kept its solar program going.

""We're not making the margins we used to but we don't want to change the brand unless we absolutely had to. And so far that strategy is working,"" said Desormeaux.

He estimates the panels result in annual utility bill savings of about $200 to $250 per home.

GreenLight's Rivera says a full-sized home system should generate eight to 12 kilowatts at a non-subsidized capital cost of between $2 and $3 per watt, or $16,000 to $36,000.

He said he's fielding plenty of calls these days asking about adding battery storage to improve system reliability, independence from the grid on cloudy days and power quality.

But, although battery costs are falling, storage adds thousands of dollars to the cost of the system.

""As soon as you add batteries, you're doubling if not tripling the cost of solar because the battery technology is so expensive,"" he said.

""It's a tonne of interest — but not a tonne of sales.""

“I wanted to do something creative that day (March 23) to fill the void that the (Gateway) show would have. So, I decided to do it to honour the fact that I was supposed to start rehearsal that day,” explained Jason Sakaki, a Steveston resident and McMath secondary grad.

Gateway Theatre’s production, From Alaska, was cancelled earlier this month due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Sakaki added, “(I didn’t) think it would pick up so much traction with many people being super invested in the show,” which was staged in every room in his house to give the impression of set changes.

Jason Sakaki took to Instagram for a one-man live stream of Les Miserables. Photo: Video screenshot

Sakaki’s choice of Les Miserables was no coincidence.

Les Miserables is a story about people going through a difficult time, similar to what Richmond and the world is going through today, he explained.

“We’re in this time of ‘what’s happening next’ and no one really knows. Even though the musical takes place in the 1800s, it’s completely relevant to what we’re experiencing right now,” Sakaki added.

Like many residents, the pandemic is affecting Sakaki as a performing artist financially, but the fear of the community turning away from theatre frightens him even more.

“It’s a little bit unsettling for actors because we don’t know when it’s going to end. Since we will not be able to get back to work until it’s fully over. That’s the scary thing right now I think,” said Sakaki.

“What we’re a little scared about is when we come back, are people going to come back to theatres and so … we want to keep them interested in what we’re doing.”

Sakaki will be hosting another one-man production of Beauty and the Beast on April 3 at 7 p.m. on Instagram @jasonsakaki.

The Inside Chor Leoni Livestream will be hosted by artistic director Erick Lichte, from his home, and will include high-quality concert videos from the past seven years of filming at the choir’s shows.

The choir will also be creating new video content from its albums, pairing its music with artwork from local artists in an effort to reach out and help all artists as much as it can at a time that’s challenging the entire arts and cultural sector.

The livestream will also include a weekly guest – a locally or internationally recognized music luminary, with an interview and video.

Viewers will also be able to interact within the live comments section.

Lichte underscored the importance of choral music, especially at this time of global uncertainty.

“I believe that choral music has a unique healing quality,” he said in a press release. “It can offer serenity, beauty and can connect with people in ways I don’t even understand. We want to pair this music power with the fun wrapping of a show in a way that is very Chor Leoni.

“Choral music is, for me, the ultimate way in which people can come together. This show won’t replace the community we share as a choir and with our audience, but hopefully it will move us from our current reality to the day we can again bring our voices together and they can be heard.”

For the April 1 livestream, the guest is conductor Ethan Sperry, talking about Translations, his new recording of the works of Latvian composer Eriks Esenvalds on the Naxos label.

The show will also premiere the first video for the album’s recording of Esenvalds’ In Paradisum, paired in video with paintings by renowned Vancouver artist Tiko Kerr.

These film artists — these Vancouverites — are at once distinct from each other and very much the same. They’re hardworking. They’re creative. They’ll film for days in mud and snow and sleet because that’s what needs to be done in order to get the story off the page and onto the screen. They’re dreamers. They contribute more than words can properly express to the cultural and economic landscape of this city and this province. They hold up a mirror to Vancouver and reflect back our beauty and our ugliness. They entertain us. They hold us accountable. They are essential.

They’re also largely self-employed. They were mainstays in the gig economy before the gig economy was even a thing. And for the moment at least, their industry — this industry that is a dream factory and an economic powerhouse — is all but shut down.

I don’t know when the CW and Netflix and all the other networks that shoot up here will call everyone back to set, or when it will be safe for indie film crews to gather on weekends to shoot their passion projects.

What I do know is that the entertainment industry will return, because human beings need art, and Vancouver’s artists are still artists — are still dreaming up new ways to tell their stories — while they self-isolate and practise social distancing. And when they do, I’ll be back in these pages to tell you the stories behind the screen stories.

In the meantime, I encourage you to enjoy the work that’s already out there. Peruse Storyhive’s online archive of locally produced short films (such as A Typical Fairytale) and web series (such as Coded). Binge Hospital Show or Inconceivable on YouTube. Watch The Order or Ghost Wars or Van Helsing or Freaks or Intelligence on Netflix. Rent Down River or Black Fly or The Body Remembers When the World Broke Open on iTunes.

If you make it through all of that, tweet at me @sabrinarmf and I’ll recommend something else.

I also encourage you to subscribe to the YVR Screen Scene Podcast on Apple Podcasts or wherever you listen to podcasts. For the last year, I’ve been doing my own version of Inside the Actors Studio: sitting down with our city’s finest actors, writers, directors, showrunners, stunt artists and other talented film workers for long-form interviews about why and how they do what they do. I’ve released more than 70 episodes, and I’ll continue this work in the days, weeks and months ahead.

Thank you for reading “The Showbiz.” Thank you for valuing Vancouver’s screen storytellers. See you on the other side of COVID-19.

Vancouver comedians weigh in,['Drew Clarke'],,"Full disclosure: The author of this article is involved in the comedy scene, employed by one of the venues and is friends with some of the people interviewed for this story.

It’s been said that “tragedy plus time equals comedy.” But what if tragedy is unfolding in real time? Can we afford to laugh? Do we need laughter more than ever? The Courier checked in with four local comedians to chat about comedy in times of crisis, joking about sensitive topics and how to make money in a gig-less economy.

‘The saltiness is so good’

Sophie Buddle recently returned from Halifax, where she writes for the CBC sketch and news satire show This Hour Has 22 Minutes.

“We’ve been covering the corona story and I wasn’t worried about it for the first couple of months, but it’s just taken this turn. It feels so sudden,” she said, from her home in Vancouver. “We just wrapped two weeks ago, so I’m in kind of a good position, because most of my income for the year comes from writing for the show,” she said.

Usually when Buddle is in Vancouver, she tries to perform as much stand-up as possible, but due to current social-distancing restrictions, every comedy show in Vancouver has been shut down. “My Facebook notifications are just about everything getting cancelled,” she said. “Things I didn’t even know I was invited to got cancelled.”

Even with the serious nature of the pandemic, Buddle is still finding humour in these dark times.

“All these companies are going bankrupt and millennials are tweeting at them, being like, ‘Well, if this company didn’t want to go bankrupt, it shouldn’t have been eating avocado toast every day,’” she said. “The saltiness is so good.”

Buddle is never one to back away from sensitive topics in her own stand-up.

“My comedy is very dirty and pretty political, so that’s kind of my bread and butter,” she said. “I find it great to talk about sensitive topics because comedy is all about building that tension up and then letting it go — it’s a very easy way to create tension in a room.”

For now, Buddle is holed-up with her boyfriend, recording episodes of her podcast, Obsessed, “We did a bonus episode of him and I, early on in the quarantine,” she said. “We’ll do another one in a few weeks and see if we still love each other so much.”

‘Joking about it takes a bit of the power away from it’

Graham Clark. File photo Dan Toulgoet

Graham Clark is a three-time Canadian Comedy Award winner, he hosts the weekly stand-up showcase The Laugh Gallery and regularly appears on CBC’s The Debaters. Despite the current climate of collective anxiety, Clark is trying to stay calm.

“If I’ve learned anything from any kind of disaster movie, it’s that panicking does not help,” he said. “It’s always the panicky idiot that gets eaten by the zombie.”

Like many gig-economy workers, he has plenty of reasons to panic, including no holiday or sick pay, no employment insurance and a sudden drop in income. “In one way or another, all my income is tied to comedy,” he said. “Yeah, it’s affecting me, but I would guess it’s affecting other people even more.”

Fortunately for Clark, he already has one foot in the digital realm, with his podcast Stop Podcasting Yourself.

“In a nice twist of fate, my podcast partner, Dave Shumka, was going to go away for a holiday, so we had banked some episodes already,” said Clark, who will try to keep recording the podcast. “As long as we can find a safe way to do it, we will continue to do it.”

Clark doesn’t avoid sensitive topics in his comedy, especially when it’s something that affects all levels of society.

“This is a thing that everyone is thinking about, so you can’t not mention it, because then you’ll look like you don’t know what’s going on,” he said. “You’ll be like Jared Leto.”

The Hollywood star recently emerged from a 12-day silent retreat in the desert — completely cut off from all forms of communication — only to emerge into our new pandemic reality.

“To me, that’s the most humour-rich story that’s come down the pipe in the last few days,” chuckled Clark. “I think we seek out humour because that’s the only way our brains can get comfortable with how insane things are. Joking about it takes a bit of the power away from it.”

‘You need to be able to laugh at the ridiculousness of certain things’

Rae Lynn Carson. Photo supplied

Rae Lynn Carson is a stand-up comedian and a professional improviser. She regularly performs at Vancouver TheatreSports and in the monthly sketch and improv show Nasty Women.

“At this moment, the gig economy provides 100 per cent of my income,” said Carson. “I have a decent paycheque on its way, but I don’t have any shows booked for the rest of the month, so I’m just going to be living on that.”

She added, “I’m also diabetic, so I have to buy diabetic supplies on top of bills and rent — it’s going to be tight.”

Even with challenging times ahead, Carson is trying to see things in a positive light.

“I’m grateful that I can still make people laugh, even if I’m not making money doing it,” she said. “But I do miss making a room full of people laugh — it’s like ecstasy for me.”

Carson believes that laughter is a great way for all of us to relieve stress and tension.

“I think you need to be able to laugh at the ridiculousness of certain things, like the whole T.P. situation,” she said. “Yeah, maybe last Tuesday, you and Susanne went to the friggin’ store and bought five packs of 24-roll toilet paper and now you’re thinking, ‘Oh God, what the hell was I doing?’ You know what — we all make mistakes and it’s easier to acknowledge those things by laughing about it and just letting it go.”

‘Art is important — and it’s an important thing to support’

Aaron Read. Photo Photo Ross Dauk

Aaron Read regularly performs stand-up at various shows around Vancouver, teaches improv at Blind Tiger Comedy and is also a member of the long-running weekly improv show The Sunday Service.

“I just got a cheque for some commercial work, right before this all happened, which is a godsend,” said Read. “I’m sure a lot of artists, especially in this city, don’t have savings. If I didn’t have this cheque, I wouldn’t have savings.”

Read is all-too-aware of the ground shifting beneath his feet.

“We’re in a weird time, because everyone is trying to pivot online,” he said. “Everyone’s scrambling to figure out how to still make a living from making art.”

His improv troupe, The Sunday Service, uploaded a pre-recorded show to YouTube last Sunday, and set up an Eventbrite page where viewers could donate if they wanted to.

“That allowed us to help out the Fox [Cabaret, which normally hosts the event] with the revenue that they’re losing, as well as paying the staff that would’ve been there and the [audio and lighting] tech person. We also paid ourselves a little bit,” said Read. “It was right at the beginning of social distancing, so I think people really appreciated it.”

Read emphasized that although people are on lock-down, they shouldn’t spend too much time on the internet.

“Don’t be online all the time. Even though it’s really cool and has lots of information, it’s still really toxic,” he said. “All those assholes in the real world, who weren’t online, are now online. So you’re going to get the equivalent of a Donnelly pub flooding the internet right now.”

Despite the negativity of our current zeitgeist, Read is trying to see through the smog.

“People who are hoarding stuff and reselling it, like, capitalizing off of a pandemic, at first I thought those people were disgusting,” he said. “But then I was reading some stuff that was saying, ‘Don’t get mad at those people, because they’re just evidence of how broken our system is.’”

Ultimately, Read believes comedy can help us rise above our present mess.

“I think it’s a good time to exercise comedy that’s about catharsis,” he said. “And for comedy that’s absurd, that’s silly, as a break — not to make you forget, but to take you to another world for a second.”

Referencing the millions of people at home on their couches, Read added: “All anybody is doing right now is self-soothing by watching stuff and listening to stuff. Art is important — and it’s an important thing to support.”

He's released a public service announcement on YouTube, which is a humourous take on a Canadian classic from the now-defunct Concerned Children's Advertisers.

article continues below

The puppets in the original delivered a message about not putting things in your mouth — specifically medicine, ""bad food or some poison"" — because it would make you sick.

In an email, Brown writes: ""I decided to dust it off and give it a new message.""

In his version, the puppets are telling you to wash your hands, don't ""turn your stupid face,"" and ""stay in your f***ing house"" because you might get sick, or make others sick — with COVID-19, of course.

The director says he's ""been frustrated by people not taking the COVID-19 outbreak seriously and wanted to make something to help spread the word.”

“I was trying to think of something I could do quickly and without having to go out and film something. I remembered 'Don’t you put it your mouth,' figured it sounded close enough to 'Don’t you ever leave the house' and just went from there.""

Brown and his friend Jess Rivers wrote the lyrics and did the voice work for it, collaborating from their homes over FaceTime and recording their individual parts on their phones. Shawn Penner created the music track for it.

Virtual open mic nights, online readings and drag performances via social media are becoming the new normal as Vancouver waits out the COVID-19 pandemic.

article continues below

One local filmmaker decided to take it a step further with the Vancouver Quarantine Performance Project (VQPP), an online festival and competition aimed at bringing the city’s actors, writers and creators together (virtually) to create and share art.

“The film community and arts community in Vancouver have been a huge part of my life, and it kills me to see it suffer these days,” Joel McCarthy, who is also festival director at Run N Gun: Vancouver's 48 hour film festival and a directing teacher, said in an email.

Launched this week, VQPP includes four categories – original monologue (must be completely original and never performed before), quarantine short film (shot in your own home, isolated outside or animated), original song (must be a world premier and performed on a video) and stand-up comedy routine (created for the contest and submitted as a video file).

The project will culminate on April 18 and 19 with a live variety show on YouTube where awards will be given and the audience can vote for their favourites.

McCarthy said the idea for the project started percolating when the NBA suspended its season on March 11.

“The writing on the wall was clear, so I started obsessing over what could be done,” he said. “We had some local film festivals coming up that I was really excited about and they are all cancelled now. I wanted to create something that couldn't be cancelled.”

The project was announced March 16 and, McCarthy said, Vancouver’s arts community has jumped at the chance to keep creating while self-isolating.

“I know of a ton of people who are planning and creating now… [we] already have a number of submissions. We don't know how big this thing is going to get, but we are generating multiple plans based on how many submissions we get.”

McCarthy said it was a “mixed bag of events” that inspired the project.

“I was feeling very down seeing pretty much all of my friends lose their jobs over the matter of a few days,” he said, adding that at the same time he was watching viral videos of quarantined Italians singing from their balconies.

McCarthy also has some experience with broadcasting live events online – the last film competition he organized sold out quickly so the decision was made to take it online – and he already has the needed equipment and infrastructure in place.

“This is ultimately a way of me dealing with my depression, anxiety and despair as we go through these uncertain times.”

McCarthy said updates will be posted on the VQPP Facebook page and an official schedule will be released once all the submissions are in and organizers know how much content they have.

Entries can be submitted online at filmfreeway.com/vqpp.

Submissions are due April 3.

For the 2020-21 season, the cap was estimated to be $84 million to $88.2 million, depending on a few factors.

That has changed.

article continues below

The suspension caused by COVID-19 and the uncertain future of the 2019-20 season leaves next season’s salary cap in serious jeopardy.

That’s because the cap is tied to league revenues. There’s meant to be a 50/50 split in revenues between the owners and the players. If there’s a drop in revenue for the owners — from a loss of gate revenue for unplayed or unattended games, unplayed playoff games, or a crashing Canadian dollar — then the NHL’s Collective Bargaining Agreement leads to less money for the players the following season in the form of a reduced salary cap.

A significant increase in the salary cap would have been a major relief for a team close to the cap like the Vancouver Canucks. The Canucks were set to have a tough time navigating the cap next season, thanks to the combination of a few highly-paid veterans, performance bonuses for young stars rolling over from this current season, Roberto Luongo’s cap recapture penalty, and several restricted and unrestricted free agents they need to re-sign.

If the salary cap went up, it’s possible the Canucks wouldn’t have to choose between UFAs Jacob Markstrom, Tyler Toffoli and Chris Tanev, but could re-sign all three. A flat cap — one that stayed at $81.5 million — would force the Canucks to choose two and possibly lose another player like Troy Stecher or Josh Leivo.

If the cap goes down? Then the Canucks are in some serious trouble, with difficult decisions to make that will undoubtedly make the team worse for next season. And they’re not the only ones: plenty of other teams would feel the cap crunch from this unprecedented situation.

Potential solutions could include an artificially inflated cap, but one option that has come up in NHL circles is compliance buyouts, with Brian Burke discussing it recently on Oilers Now, a radio program with Global News.

“I’ve heard discussion of compliance buyouts to help teams get to this new cap, to solve some of their problems,” said Burke. “In the last CBA, each team got two cap-compliance buyouts which were exempt from the cap.”

A compliance buyout would differ from a regular buyout in that it wouldn’t cost money against the salary cap. For instance, the Canucks will still have a little over $1 million against next season’s cap from buying out Ryan Spooner, but the Canucks bought out Keith Ballard and David Booth in 2013 and 2014 at no cost to their cap as compliance buyouts after the 2012-13 lockout.

If teams do get a compliance buyout, it seems obvious who the Canucks would use it on. Loui Eriksson has a $6 million cap hit for two more seasons following this one and has found himself in an increasingly-diminished role, playing primarily as a shutdown, defensive forward, with little-to-no contributions offensively.

The Canucks do have other options, however. Brandon Sutter has lost several steps and has a $4.375 million cap hit next season. They could be proactive and buy out Tyler Myers’ $6 million contract for the next four seasons before his play starts to decline. Cutting their losses on Micheal Ferland’s $3.5 million cap hit for the next three seasons might be smart. They might even be tempted to buy out Sben Baertschi’s $3.37 million contract with him buried in the AHL.

Do any of those supersede Eriksson? Probably not. Where it gets interesting is if teams get two buyouts, as they did in 2013 and 2014. Buying out Eriksson would be a given, then, but who would be the second buyout? Sutter has just one year left on his contract, Ferland’s cap hit isn’t overly onerous, and Tyler Myers is still a good, useful player.

One compliance buyout would make it far easier for the Canucks to re-sign Markstrom and Tanev. Two might mean re-signing Toffoli as well.

Stick-taps and Glove-drops

A tap of the stick to Eddie Lackas he announced his retirement from professional hockey on Monday. The former Canuck said the “best time in my career” was in Vancouver and thanked the fans sincerely.

A big stick-tap to Bauer. The hockey equipment manufacturer has modified its production line to produce protective visors for healthcare workers, with Quebec already ordering 300,000 visors for their doctors, nurses, and first responders.

Big Numbers

89 In four seasons with the Canucks, Loui Eriksson has a total of 38 goals and 89 points. He had 30 goals and 63 points in just one season with the Boston Bruins prior to signing with the Canucks.

4 So far, four NHL players have tested positive for COVID-19: two from the Ottawa Senators and two from the Colorado Avalanche. The Senators’ radio colour commentator, Gord Wilson, has also tested positive, as has St. Louis Blues’ play-by-play announcer John Kelly.

With the season suspended because of the COVID-19 pandemic and a lot of fans confined to their homes for much of the day for the same reason, they’re jonesing for a little Canucks action to help get them through.

Because of that, fans were eager to watch a couple classic Canucks games on Saturday, with Sportsnet Pacific airing two games in lieu of Hockey Night in Canada. At 4pm, they showed 2004’s Game 7 between the Canucks and Calgary Flames, and at 7pm, it was 2011’s Game 7 between the Canucks and Chicago Blackhawks.

article continues below

The 2004 game, despite the way it ended for Canucks fans, was a treat. It was great to see the likes of Markus Naslund, Mattias Ohlund, and Sami Salo back in action. Seeing the Sedins on a line with Trevor Linden was a treat, though it was a little bizarre to see them on the ice at times with a number 14 that wasn’t Alex Burrows. Instead, it was Geoff Sanderson, who wore 14 after coming to the Canucks at the trade deadline for the second time in his career.

On the other hand, the 2011 game, despite being objectively one of the greatest moments in Canucks history, was strangely disappointing.

Both games include one of the greatest play-by-play calls in Canucks history. The game against the Flames featured Chris Cuthbert’s play-by-play masterclass on Matt Cooke’s game-tying goal in the dying seconds of regulation that had Ed Jovanovski jumping up and down like a madman in the penalty box.

Meanwhile, the game against the Blackhawks featured not one, but two classic calls of Alex Burrows’ overtime game-winner. One was from John Shorthouse’s play-by-play for radio, the well-known “They’ve slayed the dragon!” call, but the television call is just as great. Jim Hughson unexpectedly paraphrased a line from The Exorcist, declaring, “It’s a wonderful day for an exorcism!”

Canucks fans got neither call.

Instead of the Canadian feed from the CBC broadcast, Sportsnet used the American feed from Versus, now known as the NBC Sports Network.

Instead of Hughson, fans got the play-by-play of John Forslund, with Daryl Reaugh and Brian Engblom providing commentary. There was nothing particularly wrong with their commentary — well, apart from Forslund botching the call of Alex Burrows’ opening goal, saying it was scored by Mason Raymond — but it’s hard to compare with that of Hughson, particularly since his call is the one that Canucks fans remember.

Forslund also called Burrows’ goal an exorcism, but it didn’t quite have the impact, perhaps because he didn’t let the moment breathe. He rolled right through from the goal call to saying, “They exorcise their demons and eliminate the Stanley Cup Champions.”

To be fair, Forslund is a fine play-by-play commentator, legitimately one of the best in the business. It’s just exceedingly odd that Sportsnet Pacific, which is aimed primarily at Canucks fans, would use the American feed. The replay of the 2004 game used the CBC feed, so it isn’t a rights issue.

According to Andrew Garas, the Director of Communications at Sportsnet, the reason for the US feed was because of the complexities of the archiving systems from which they’re trying to find games.

“We're working to get a wide range of games from our various archiving systems,” said Garas. “At the time we were going to air this particular game, only the US feed was available, with some parts condensed.”

Evidently, no one anticipated needing to fill weeks of airtime with full replays of old games.

“You would think that they would all be labeled, you can just go in and say, I want this game from this year at this time,” said Garas, “but I don't think anyone's ever been in a situation like this where you're going back so far and getting games from years past. They're all somewhere in some capacity. It's just a matter of...being able to extract them from the archiving systems.”

Beyond the source of the broadcast, the replay of the 2011 game was plagued by problems. The first five minutes or so were nearly unwatchable due to a jittery frame rate that had the players looking like bad stop-motion animation. This was, again, an issue with the Versus feed that Sportsnet was able to extract from their archives.

Eventually, the broadcast smoothed out, but then Canucks fans just had a clearer view of the baffling editing decisions made to fit the game’s broadcast into a tighter timeframe. Garas was unable to specify whether these cuts were part of the Versus feed in the archive or if they were choices made by Sportsnet. Whoever made the edit removed two key moments from the game.

One was Alex Burrows’ penalty shot near the beginning of the third period. Burrows had a monumental performance in Game 7. He opened the scoring in the game off a great feed by Ryan Kesler, then had multiple chances to pad the team’s lead, finishing the game with seven shots on goal.

None of his chances were better than his penalty shot just seconds into the third. Burrows had been money on the breakaway and in the shootout all season, with his patented backhand deke that he once claimed was unstoppable if he did it correctly.

Asked Burrows if he thought goalies were wise to that shootout move 2 wks ago. He told me, ""If I do it right, it doesn't matter."" #Canucks — Daniel Wagner (@passittobulis) February 8, 2012

So, when Burrows was taken down from behind by Duncan Keith on the breakaway, it seemed certain that he would go to his, well, go-to move.

Instead, perhaps concerned that Corey Crawford would see it coming, Burrows stayed on the forehand and tried to go past Crawford’s blocker. He was shut down.

“It was probably the worst attempt of my career on a penalty shot,” said Burrows to The Athletic a few months ago. “I know where to shoot, but it was a total fail shot. It was an easy save for Crawford.”

That failed penalty shot is a key part of the narrative of that game and the role Burrows played. Removing it from the replay of the game just doesn’t make any sense.

Saturday’s broadcast also cut out another major moment from the game. Early in overtime, Burrows took a holding penalty, leaving him sitting in the box at a crucial time. In many ways, you could compare it to the 2004 Game 7 against the Flames, with another heart-and-soul player sitting in the box early in overtime, Jovanovski.

In many ways, that entire game was about Burrows. He scored both Canucks goals, had a game-high seven shots, got stopped on a penalty shot, and took a potentially-devastating penalty in overtime. The narrative of that game rises and falls with Burrows.

While killing Burrows’ penalty, Roberto Luongo made a fantastic save on Patrick Sharp on a backdoor play. Hearts stopped across BC in that moment, as Sharp looked to have the game on his stick, but Luongo made the stop.

“From the box, I was just so relieved that Lu made that push and got his blocker on it,” said Burrows to The Athletic.

“I saved his ass,” said Luongo.

That was one of the biggest moments of the game. Sportsnet cut it all out of the replay.

Fans didn’t get to see Burrows take the penalty. They didn’t see the Canucks’ penalty killers go to work to keep the Blackhawks from scoring the game-winning and series-ending goal. They didn’t get to see one of the most important saves of Luongo’s career.

Instead, the broadcast jumped ahead in overtime, skipping over the Blackhawks power play entirely.

In a way, the editing of the latter parts of the game echoed the jittery frame rate of the opening minutes: it was herky-jerky and hard to watch, leaving the feeling that fans were missing something.

Fortunately, Garas indicated that Sportsnet has big plans for the coming weeks that should erase the sour taste that Saturday's broadcast left in the mouths of Canucks fans.

“Right now what we're trying to do is we're trying to get the entirety of the 2011 series versus Chicago, to be able to air that in its entirety,” he said.

Hopefully Sportsnet will be able to grab the CBC broadcasts from the archives when they air the series in the near future.

For now, fans have other Canucks games from the past to look forward to. Sportsnet shared the Canucks game that are on their upcoming schedule:

Virtually.

Thursday, the BCHL launched a simulation — created in the EA Sports video game NHL2020 — of the rest of the league’s playoff series that were cancelled March 13, just as the second round of the post-season was set to begin.

A player representative from each of the eight teams remaining in the playoff tourney is handling the game controls in a head-to-head match-up against their second-round opponent, with a two-minute highlight reel — complete with commentary by the teams’ broadcasters — posted to the league website.

“We were looking for a way to keep fans engaged during this unfortunate downtime,” BCHL commissioner Chris Hebb said in a press release. “We’ve tried to make it a fun and unique BCHL experience for everyone to enjoy.”

The initiative sprang from a project by the former director of communications for the Express, Jacob Lazare. Bored and restless after the team dispatched the Langley Rivermen from the playoffs’ first round in four straight games and were awaiting the start of the second round, he put together a simulation of a series between Coquitlam and the Surrey Eagles, who took seven games to defeat the Chilliwack Chiefs.

Lazare said he was able to use the video game’s various customization features to recreate the rosters of the two rivals, ranking each player’s attributes and tendencies, like their skating ability, speed, puck-handling skills and physicality, on a scale from zero to 99.

“You can go through and create a player that mimics the actual players realistically,” Lazare told The Tri-City News, adding he can set a dazzling skater like Massimo Rizzo to weave around defenders and a skilled stickman like defender Drew Cooper to repel onrushing forwards one-on-one.

While his own knowledge of the Express gleaned from running the team’s video camera during games helped him build Coquitlam’s digital doppelgänger, Lazare reached out to contacts at the Eagles to inform his recreations of Surrey’s players.

The effort was an amusing distraction that got some attention on social media.

But when the actual series, and the rest of the season, was scrubbed because of the pandemic, the league reached out to spin his effort into a virtual march to the Fred Page Cup championship.

Lazare said it takes him a couple of hours to handicap all the players for each team, and additional time to create facsimiles of the uniforms and match headshots with the game’s graphics.

“It’s just to make it so fans can recognize their teams’ players,” he said of the laborious attention to detail.

Lazare lamented, however, that limitations in the game don’t allow him to recreate the cozy confines of BCHL arenas, so the virtual players are battling in front of likely the biggest crowds they’ve ever experienced, even if they’re comprised entirely of pixels.

Lazare said having actual players contest the rest of the playoffs, albeit with the help of the game’s artificial intelligence, adds an extra wrinkle of unpredictability, which is part of the fun.

“Somebody is able to win it for their team,” he said. “There can be upsets involved.”

The first series, contested between Express goalie Joe Howe and Hassan Akl of the Surrey Eagles, is already decided, with the three remaining series to be posted in the coming days. The third round of the playoff simulation commences next week.",[]

Tuesday, Batchelor put out the call to fans and his followers for random videos to which he would apply his vocal talents.

“I'm bored,” he said, adding he’ll do three such play-by-play calls a day.

HIs first three calls were a golfer at the driving range, a cat losing its mind in a cardboard box and a couple of pillow fighters blinded by hoods pulled over their faces.

“Keep ’em coming,” Batchelor said afterward.

Batchelor has been the Canucks’ play-by-play man since 2017 after several years calling Vancouver Giants games.

The Dr. Charles Best secondary school grad said he honed his commentary chops calling goals and assists while playing road hockey in the driveway of his parents’ home on Harbour Drive, playing table hockey in the basement and video games.

“I was huge into hockey,” Batchelor told The Tri-City News.

To fulfill his dream of announcing the sport, Batchelor studied broadcasting at BCIT and volunteered doing public address announcements for the Burnaby Express of the BC Hockey League (BCHL), then followed the team when it returned to Coquitlam.

In 2012, Batchelor became the broadcaster for the BCHL’s Surrey Eagles, then graduated to the Giants and the Western Hockey League the next year.

His Twitter project follows the lead of another social media effort by Port Moody’s Al Murdoch, the Canucks’ public address announcer. He has been taking requests to call goals and assists for the team’s fans and minor hockey players, posting one a day for his followers.

Murdoch said he launched the initiative because he missed doing the announcements at Rogers Arena, especially as the Canucks were in the thick of the playoff race before the season was abruptly suspended March 12.

He said he also wanted to help lift spirits at a time when everyone is anxious about the pandemic and its mounting economic and societal consequences.

His idea has since been picked up by other announcers, including Mike Ross of the Toronto Maple Leafs and the New Jersey Devils' goal and assist caller, Kevin Clark.

Ryan entered the NHL/NHLPA Players' Assistance program on Nov. 20 to get help for alcohol addiction. After going public with his story in an effort to help others with addiction issues, an emotional Ryan returned to the ice Feb. 27 and scored three times in a 5-2 win over visiting Vancouver.

Lindblom was diagnosed in December with Ewing's sarcoma, a cancerous tumour that grows in the bones or in the tissue around bones. He completed radiation treatments on July 2.

The rising star had 11 goals and 18 points in 30 games this season. While he has recently skated at the Flyers' complex in Voorhees, New Jersey, he has been ruled out of playing when the NHL season resumes.

Johns missed all of last season and the first 47 games of this one with painful headaches due to post-concussion syndrome. He scored four games into his return on Feb. 3 against the Rangers, with his parents in attendance at Madison Square Garden.

The 18-year veteran quarterback headlines the Canadian Football Hall of Fame's 2020 class that was unveiled Thursday. Burris, 45, got the nod in his first year of eligibility, becoming just the 21st player ever to do so but second in as many years after Calgary running back Jon Cornish in 2019.

article continues below

Joining Burris in the player category are offensive linemen Clyde Brock and Freddie Childress and quarterback Greg Vavra. John Hufnagel, the Calgary Stampeders president/GM, and Larry Uteck (posthumously), the former head coach/athletic director at Saint Mary’s University, were both named as builders.

Burris's family — wife Nicole and sons Armand and Barron — had known of his induction since February but managed to keep quiet about it until about two and a half weeks ago when the Hall of Fame informed Burris. Even then, the Burris clan was very nonchalant in asking the former quarterback to take in what he thought was a run-of-the-mill video.

Instead, Burris watched Hall of Famer Damon Allen (2012) outline his pro football journey to Canada, which drew a rather bewildered look from Burris. Then Allen detailed Burris's stellar CFL career before Mark DeNobile, the Hall of Fame's executive director, delivered the big news.

And the player, affectionately dubbed Smilin' Hank because of his outgoing personality, was lost for words as tears streamed down his face.

""Yeah, they got me good,"" Burris said with a chuckle. ""What's funny is whenever I've told the boys to keep anything quiet, they've always gone back to their mother and yet they didn't say a peep about this.

""I was lost for words just because to hear it shows you that people appreciated the things you did throughout your career. This is the way for the league and all the organizations and the fans saying, 'Thank you,' and for me I'm humbled by it . . . there's so many guys in there (Hall of Fame) who I looked up to and now to be able to join them is a dream come true.""

The six-foot-one, 190-pound Burris, a native of Spiro, Okla., played 20 pro seasons, 18 in the CFL with the Calgary Stampeders (1997-99, 2005-11), Saskatchewan Roughriders (2000, 2003-04), Hamilton Tiger-Cats (2012-13) and Ottawa Redblacks (2014-16). Burris also spent time with the NFL's Green Bay Packers (2001) and Chicago Bears (2002).

Burris appeared in five Grey Cups, winning three (1998, '08, '16) and being named the MVP twice (2008, '16). The CFL's outstanding player on two occasions (2010, 2015), Burris amassed 63,639 passing yards and 373 TD passes — both third all-time.

Burris retired shortly after leading Ottawa to a thrilling 39-33 overtime Grey Cup upset win over Calgary. He threw for 461 yards and three TDs despite suffering a knee injury during warmups.

Burris said his Hall of Fame induction is as much a testament to his family's resilience and perseverance as it is his on-field accomplishments.

""I had to take my wife all over Canada, drag my kids all over Canada and force them to make new friends just for dad to be able to play this game called football,"" said Burris, whose family still calls Ottawa home. ""And for them to understand and see just the emotions that ran through me . . . it just shows how big that moment is, just kind of when your whole life flashes before you.""

Burris and the other inductees will have to wait for their day in the sun due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2020 class will be honoured alongside the 2021 inductees next August.

When Burris is formally honoured, he'll be joined by former teammate Childress and Hufnagel, who served as Calgary's head coach (2008-2015) before moving into the front office full-time. Burris won Grey Cups with both ('98 with Childress, '08 with Hufnagel).

""Calgary is a machine right now and it all started in 2008 when Huf came in and we got that Grey Cup in his first year,"" Burris said. ""Calgary has always had double-digit wins and been in the playoffs each and every year Huf has been there, they've always been a strong contender for the Grey Cup and there's one reason why.""

Hufnagel, a 68-year-old native of Coraopolis, Pa., spent 12 seasons as a CFL quarterback with Calgary (1976-79), Saskatchewan (1980-83, 1987) and Winnipeg (1984-86) before getting into coaching. A five-time Grey Cup champion, Hufnagel also earned a Super Bowl ring as an assistant with the New England Patriots (2003).

Hufnagel amassed a 102-42-1 record as Calgary's head coach, his .712 win percentage being the highest among coaches with more than 100 games. He's been named the CFL's coach of the year twice (2008, 2014).

Childress, a 53-year-old native of Little Rock, Ark., played 13 CFL seasons with Shreveport (1994), Birmingham (1995), Calgary (1996-03) and Saskatchewan (2004-06). A former second-round pick of the NFL's New England Patriots, Childress won two Grey Cups with the Stampeders (1998, 2001) and in 1998 was named the CFL's top offensive lineman.

Brock, 79, of Los Angeles, played 12 seasons with Saskatchewan (1964-75), helping the club win its first Grey Cup in 1966. The former Dallas Cowboy-San Francisco 49er appeared in 169 regular-season CFL games and four times was named a league all-star before being inducted into Saskatchewan's Plaza of Honour in 1995.

Vavra, 59, of Red Deer, Alta., helped the Calgary Dinos win the Vanier Cup in 1983, his final season at the school. That year, he also became the first player in the program's history to capture the Hec Crighton Trophy as Canadian university football's top player and still holds the U Sports record for most passing yards in a game (627).

Vavra was drafted by the Calgary Stampeders in 1984 and also spent time with the B.C. Lions (1986-87) and Edmonton Eskimos (1988).

After playing seven CFL seasons as a defensive back with Toronto (1974-76), B.C. (1977), Montreal (1978-80) and Ottawa (1980), Uteck became an assistant coach at Saint Mary’s University in 1982. He was promoted to head coach the following year, a position he held until 1997.

Over that span, Uteck was named the Atlantic University Athletic Association coach of the year five times and twice Canadian university football's top coach.

Uteck served as athletic director from 1995 to 2002 and the Huskies captured two Vanier Cups (2001-02). The native of Thornhill, Ont., passed away Dec. 25, 2002 of Lou Gehrig's disease at the age of 50.

The Atlantic Bowl was renamed the Uteck Bowl in 2003.

Columbus announced Thursday that it has named McMillan vice-president, soccer administration and operations.

McMillan stepped down as Toronto's senior director of administration and operations in March. So did husband Corey Wray, who was Toronto's assistant GM, team operations and strategy. Toronto did not announce the departures at the time.

The latest move reunites McMillan with Columbus president and GM Tim Bezbatchenko, who stepped down as Toronto's senior vice-president of soccer operations and GM in January 2019 to join his hometown club in Ohio.

""We are thrilled to welcome Jaime McMillan to the club,"" Bezbatchenko said in a statement. ""Jaime played a critical role in the front office, simultaneously managing and executing high-level projects during her time with Toronto FC as it became a perennial MLS Cup contender, and I know she will be a great asset to the Crew as we continue to grow our ambitions and elevate the club in this new era.""

McMillan will oversee Columbus' administration and management in non-technical areas, including soccer operations administration, facilities and budgeting.

The Crew said her role ""will also include a focus on player and staff administration, academy administration and other club support areas.""

Toronto enjoys a reputation as one of MLS' best teams at helping players settle off the field, with McMillan leading the way.

McMillan joined Toronto in 2010 as co-ordinator for business operations. She went on to become senior manager of team development (2013-15), director of team development (2015-16) and director of administrations and operations (2016-18) before taking on the role of senior director of administration and operations.

Toronto won one MLS Cup (2017), one Supporters' Shield (2017) and six Canadian Championships (2010, 2011, 2012, 2016, 2007, 2018) during McMillan's tenure.

""Absolutely one (of) the best in the business,"" tweeted Toronto striker Jozy Altidore.

""Columbus Crew SC has been making some great moves. Jaime will make the entire organization better. Congrats Jaime!!!""

The Super League announced its revamped schedule for the resumption of rugby league play, with Toronto playing its remaining games on the other side of the Atlantic.

article continues below

""Regrettably for the Wolfpack the challenges around travel, international border protocols and the hosting of public events in Toronto have proved too significant for the team to be able to host games at Lamport Stadium this season,"" Toronto CEO and chairman Bob Hunter said in an open letter to fans.

""This is not a decision that has been taken lightly, and we vow to return to Toronto bigger and better than ever before in 2021.""

Toronto has not played at home since Oct. 5, 2019, when it won promotion to the Super League with a 24-6 victory over Featherstone Rovers in the Million Pound Game before an announced sellout crowd of 9,974 – a Wolfpack record — at Lamport Stadium.

Rubbing salt in the wound, Toronto fans also woke up to the news Thursday that winger Liam Kay, the team's all-time leading scorer and first-ever player signing, had left to join Wakefield Trinity.

The Wolfpack, 0-6-0 in their first season in the top-tier Super League, have not played since March 11, when they blanked Huddersfield 18-0 in the fifth round of the Challenge Cup. Play was suspended five days later.

Super League features 12 teams — 10 in England, one in France and the Wolfpack.

Play resumes Aug. 2 in England with Toronto playing Hull Kingston Rovers as part of a tripleheader at Leeds Rhinos' Emerald Headingley Stadium. The rest of August sees weekend tripleheaders played over two days behind closed doors — initially at Headingley and St Helens' Totally Wicked Stadium.

""Today's fixtures announcement finally brings the 2020 season back to life,"" Super League executive chairman Robert Elstone said in a statement.

The schedule grows more crowded near the end of the season with Toronto playing its final six games over three weeks.

That's a concern given the physical nature of the sport. It's more of a worry for Toronto, which has a small squad and is facing a looming visa issue involving New Zealand star Sonny Bill Williams and six other imports.

Australia's Josh McCrone, Darcy Lussick and Blake Wallace, Australian-born Samoan international Ricky Leutele and New Zealand's Williams, Chase Stanley and Bodene Thompson have visas that allow for six months in England over a year.

That's not a problem when the Wolfpack are spending part of the season in Canada. But the global pandemic has kept the players in England and the visas are slated to expire at the end of the month.

Because the Wolfpack are Canadian-owned, they require different visas than overseas players employed by English clubs.

Super League said it will review dates and venues ""in the back end of the campaign ... in line with government advice and in discussion with our host broadcaster, Sky Sports.""

The hope is the teams can eventually host games with fans in their home market — with the exception of Toronto.

The playoffs, featuring the top four in the 12-team league, are scheduled for mid/late-November with the Grand Final scheduled for the end of November.

The championship game was originally slated for Oct. 10.

Super League said clubs will be back in training by the end of next week.

Under the original 2020 schedule, nine of Toronto's first 10 games were to be played in England with the other in France — with the late start due to the Canadian winter and the bubble over Lamport Stadium yet to come down. The Wolfpack were to play 11 of their last 19 games at home, with the season wrapping up Sept. 11.

Three other home games were to be played at neutral sites in England.

The newspaper explained the decision in a note by Bill Sternberg, editorial page editor, attached to the column online. Navarro's column originally moved online late Tuesday and was published in Wednesday's newspaper.

article continues below

Navarro wrote that Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, ""has been wrong about everything I interacted with him on.""

The newspaper on Wednesday evening also ran a fact-check story by Washington reporter Ledyard King examining five of Navarro's claims.

USA Today did not immediately return messages seeking comment on how Navarro's column escaped such scrutiny before being published. The incident is reminiscent of The New York Times saying last month that an opinion column by U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton hadn't been properly vetted, which led to the resignation of the paper's opinion editor.

Navarro also did not immediately return a message.

USA Today said it had sought Navarro's opinion to accompany an editorial that the newspaper ran calling Fauci ""a national treasure.""

That editorial said the fact that Navarro was writing the opposing viewpoint ""shows how hard it is to find an actual medical professional willing to undercut Fauci.""

It wasn't clear whether the newspaper sought those opinions.

Fauci has essentially been shelved by the White House as a prominent spokesperson on the coronavirus pandemic because he's publicly been more pessimistic than the president. But Trump distanced himself from Navarro's column, saying Wednesday that the column was Navarro's views and ""he shouldn't be doing that.""

Navarro claimed in the column that Fauci opposed travel restrictions from China that were imposed by Trump that ""might well have saved hundreds of thousands of American lives."" USA Today said there isn't enough data to conclude the restrictions made a significant difference, and that despite some initial skepticism, Fauci backed the president.

The fact-checker also gave more context to Navarro claims about masks, the drug hydroxychloroquine and Fauci's early statements of concern about the virus.",[]

He’s returned to the charts in 2020, working on songs for rising and established rap stars, including Lil Wayne, Juice WRLD, Saweetie and Doja Cat.

The songmaster, who has been entangled in a bitter lawsuit with former collaborator Kesha since 2014, has produced and co-written Saweetie’s new single ""Tap In,"" the follow-up to her double-platinum smash ""My Type."" Dr. Luke also co-wrote and co-produced Juice WRLD’s ""Wishing Well,"" taken from the rapper’s first posthumous album ""Legends Never Die,"" released last week.

article continues below

The recent successes mean all three major U.S. record label companies have worked with Dr. Luke this year, even if he hasn't always put his widely recognizable professional name to the new collaborations.

Dr. Luke marked a major comeback this year with the success of the Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hit ""Say So"" by rapper-singer Doja Cat, who is signed to Dr. Luke's Kemosabe Records. Dr. Luke, born Lukasz Sebastian Gottwald, produced several songs on Cat’s sophomore album ""Hot Pink,"" including single ""Like That,"" which is No. 5 on Billboard’s Hot R&B songs chart. He is the only producer with two songs in the Top 10 on the latter chart (""Say So"" sits at No. 2).

For his work with Cat, he used the alias Tyson Traxe. He used the same pseudonym for his production credit on Toronto rapper-singer Benny Mayne’s ""Hokey Pokey,"" released this year. For Lil Wayne’s ""Shimmy,"" a track featuring Cat on the deluxe edition of his latest album ""Funeral,"" Dr. Luke used the name Loctor Duke.

Label representatives for Saweetie, Juice WRLD, Lil Wayne and Cat didn’t immediately reply to emails seeking comment. Neither did a representative for Dr. Luke.

Luke has sprinkled his comeback among the major labels. Cat is signed to Sony Music’s RCA Records, while Saweetie is part of the Warner Music family. Lil Wayne releases music through his Young Money imprint and Republic Records, a division of Universal Music Group.

Before Dr. Luke topped the charts this year with ""Say So,"" he last had a No. 1 with Katy Perry's ""Dark Horse"" in 2014. Months later, Kesha accused him of sexual assault during their yearslong partnership (Dr. Luke has vigorously denied the allegations.)

A New York court dismissed Kesha’s sexual abuse-related claims in 2016 because of legal issues, without ruling on whether the allegations were true. Kesha lost another round in February, when a New York judge said she made a defamatory statement about Dr. Luke on a different occasion: a 2016 text message telling Gaga the producer had also raped Perry. Both he and Perry have denied it, and the judge said there was ""no evidence whatsoever"" to support the claim.

Kesha’s lawyers have said they plan to appeal the ruling, but it didn’t resolve other aspects of his defamation and breach-of-contract suit, including the crucial question of whether Kesha’s allegation that he raped her is true. The judge said that’s for a jury to decide at trial.

Outside of rap in 2020, Dr. Luke has produced music for pop singer Kim Petras, using the pseudonym MADE IN CHINA.",[]

Some critics online questioned whether the masked vigilante should be the primary focus after DC announced the sequel ""Rorschach"" on Wednesday. Others have slammed the decision to bring on Batman writer Tom King to write the 12-issue series, which will debut in October.

article continues below

King's approach to the Dark Knight's comic book story line he's written has been divisive. With ""Rorschach,"" he said the new series will take a compelling look at politics similar to that of HBO’s ""Watchmen"" and the original comic in 1986. The comic will also be worked on by artist Jorge Fornés, colorist Dave Stewart and letterer Clayton Cowles.

The HBO series earned acclaim for delivering a story about race relations in America. But some are concerned about whether the story about the anti-hero Rorschach, who wears a trenchcoat, fedora and white mask with morphing inkblots, will be as relevant today.

King believes it will be.

""This is a very political work."" he said in a statement. ""It’s an angry work. We’re so angry all the time now. We have to do something with that anger. It’s called ‘Rorschach’ not because of the character Rorschach, but because what you see in these characters tells you more about yourself than about them.""

The sequel is set 35 years after the ""Watchmen"" comic series when Dr. Manhattan turned Rorschach into dust.

A plot summary released on DC's website asks: ""So what does it mean when Rorschach reappears as part of a pair of assassins trying to kill the first candidate to oppose President Robert Redford in decades? Follow one determined detective as he walks backward in time, uncovering the identities and motives of the would-be killers, taking him deep into a dark conspiracy of alien invasions, disgraced do-gooders, mystical visions, and yes, comic books.""",[]

Every night at 7 p.m., residents across the city — but particularly in the West End — gather on their balconies to bang pots and pans or shout out their windows in appreciation of health care workers and all that they are doing during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Seven-year-old Kian and his sister Kiera, 6, took to YouTube with a three-and-a-half minute video, titled “COVID-19: What To Do When Staying At Home, For Kids And Family” that shows the adorable siblings partaking in activities like baking (and eating) cookies, having sumo wrestling and pillow fights, making care packages for others, and “climbing a mountain”—or, if mountains aren’t available, a small hill—all with a comedic twist.



“We came up with the idea together,” explained Kian and Kiera’s mom, Lydia Lee, in an email.

“It all started with a conversation about what's happening to the world, to our country and city and why we are social distancing right now. We also had some open discussion about how people might feel and what we can help our family and friends. Since we had to cancel all of our plans and playdates for spring break, they made a bucket list of all the things they would like to do at home and one of them was 'making a movie.’”

While Kiera’s hope for the video was that it might help “other kids not to be scared,” Kian said he hoped their video could give other kids ideas about how they could avoid being bored at home, Lee added.

Lee said her children are enjoying the extra family time at home, but are missing friends, playgrounds and their favourite restaurants, just “like everybody else.”



She added, “We also try our best to keep them busy, and do meaningful things for our community so they have a different perspective of not just focus on their needs but others.”



But the bright side of the self-isolation? “It actually pushes them to be more creative,” Lee explained.

Yes, some of our self-isolating nerves are fraying while our society has practically, and in some cases truly, ground to a halt. It’s surreal, isn’t it?

article continues below

As you’ve no doubt come to realize as quickly as have I, most everything we do has been impacted by the coronavirus, even this wee column: welcome to the last edition of my “Vancouver Shakedown” for the foreseeable future.

The pandemic has turned our world upside down, and that includes media. Freelancers are the first to go. It wasn’t my choice, but I will respect it. I’ve been around the block a few times. Nothing quite like COVID-19, but I get it.

I will say this: for the past several years, it’s been my great honour to share your stories along with my own opinions and adventures in this space. When you are required to deliver a column each and every week, it allows you, sometimes forces you, to explore areas of your own city that you’ve never been.

What’s it like inside the Tent City? What is he building in there, behind that garage door? Who is that lady collecting bottles in the back alley every night, anyway?

Following up on those curiosities, many times by hopping off my bike and asking a question, led me to dozens of incredible people with wonderful stories, like master Haida artist Clarence Mills, who I stumbled across while he carved a magnificent 20-foot totem pole in an anonymous East Vancouver car port. Or Gia Tran, “the angel of East Hastings,” who has faithfully donated to charity most of the money she has collected from 20 years of dumpster diving. Or Mary-Ann Liu, a sculptor who has shaped Canadian culture — everything from the Unknown Soldier in Ottawa to the dragon lamp fixtures in Chinatown — from an utterly unremarkable shed in Railtown.

And yes, I’ve pissed off plenty of people, too, not the least of which was my friend, Vancouver Is Awesome editor Bob Kronbauer, most especially when we butted heads over recreational chinook salmon fishing (I’m against it) to the normalizing of the Downtown Eastside (I’m for it). Thanks for putting up with me, Bob. And speaking of angering others, I suppose the one good thing to come out of our current ban on any sort of public gathering means that the 4/20 “protestival” will be finally snubbed out — for one year of relief, anyway.

In the meantime, much like you, I’ll be waiting out the pandemic at home with my family. Being the parents of two children, ages four and six, my wife and I are still grappling with the shocking fact there won’t be any school to return to at the end of spring break or perhaps even this school year.

My six-year-old son is aware of COVID-19 and its dangers, but my four-year-old daughter remains pretty aloof to the whole thing. The other night at dinner, we discussed our current situation softly and thoroughly. When we were done, our daughter said, “I have just one question.” We braced ourselves. “Which one of us has… a new pink umbrella?” (She does).

Despite my wife and me being generally freaked out by the rising tide of the virus, it could be honestly stated that we have already found silver linings in our unexpected quarantine: our family is bonding like never before. Games are played, books are read, laughs are shared, lessons are learned and there are plenty of hugs and kisses. And, yes, screen time for sanity, too.

Sure, the odd game of Go Fish can get a little tense, but for the most part, we’re hanging in, and we hope you are too. The most irritating hurdle so far? We’ve actually run out of f***ing toilet paper. Spare a square?

During my hopefully temporary sabbatical from this space, you can still find me over at the CBC, or on my West Coast wilderness adventure podcasts, or on various other pages in print.

I will see you on the other side of this. Stay safe, keep your distance, thanks for your stories, and thanks for reading.

As travel editor at the Vancouver Courier newspaper, vice-chair of the B.C. branch of the Travel Media Association of Canada, and a member of the Society of American Travel Writers, travel is a big part of my life, which meant I already had the contacts in place to get started.

Now with some destinations looking to slowly reopen, and, in an effort to catch a glimpse of future travel trends, I’m continuing to reach out to travel experts and tourism bureaus across Canada and the globe for answers to five similar questions.

And while no one can predict the future, all are hopeful travel will soon resume. But, how exactly that will look is anyone’s guess.

Five questions with Lessner Gomez, director, Cuba Tourist Board, Toronto office.

How did COVID-19 impact tourism in Cuba?

Like other tourist destinations around the world, Cuba closed to international travel because of the Corona Virus. Cuba is now ready to slowly open to visitors.

In order to control and isolate any possible infection, Cuba has reopened its doors in Cayo Largo, Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo, Cayo Santa María and Cayo Cruz effective July 1.

Cuba is beginning to reopen to tourism. Who are the first international visitors Cuba will be expecting?

Cuba is looking forward to welcoming travellers from Canada and Europe. We have enjoyed a special relationship with Canada for over forty years.

We look forward to welcoming Canada back to our beautiful beaches.

How important are Canadians to tourism in Cuba?

Historically Canada has always been the biggest international inbound market for Cuba.

What does the future hold for Cuba and are there any trends we can look forward to?

As with the rest of the world, the future is hard to predict, but we are very positive.

Cuba enjoys a world class health system with particular expertise in the treatment of diseases of the lungs. In fact, throughout this pandemic we have offered medical support to countries around the world.

We believe we can offer tourists from Canada the confidence to return to our wonderful destinations and we look forward to welcoming them.

We believe that by opening gradually, tourist will feel comfortable with our planning and slowly we can begin to open other parts of our country.

What enhanced safety measures have been put in place to ensure visitors to resorts, hotels and attractions will be safe?

Over the past few months, the Cuban government has focused its efforts on the battle against the pandemic.

During this time, government officials took steps to improve all hotels and tourism infrastructure. Hygiene and sanitary protocols were put in place in order to ensure the safety of the Cuban people and its international visitors, as tourism activities are reactivated.

Hygiene and sanitary protocols will be practiced from the first phase, for example:

In order to operate, tourist facilities must obtain government certification called: Most hygienic and safest tourism (T + HS).

Workers with respiratory symptoms will not be allowed on resort premises and anyone with symptoms will be immediately directed to a health center.

International tourist circulation will only take place at the cayos (islands) where tourists enjoy their holidays.

Excursions will be offered only at the cayos for the international market.

The nautical activities and operations at international marinas of tourist centers approved for international tourism are reactivated.

As approved by the Cuban Ministry of Public Health, in the second phase, foreign tourists will undergo the PCR test free of charge upon their arrival in the country.

Bonus question

Where do Americans fit into the scheme of things in Cuba right now?

There are no changes on the Cuba-US relations and related travel restrictions.

Five questions with Tourism Australia

Visitors to ustralia can take in a Jarramali Rock Art Tour. Photo Jarramali Rock Art Tours

How do you measure tourism numbers and how does Canada fit into that?

If we look at the most recent statistics from the government’s International and National Visitor Survey, which are for the year to December 2019 — just prior to the crises — it shows that our industry was in a very strong position and a major economic driver — highlighting the important role that tourism will play in Australia’s economic recovery when the coronavirus crisis passes.

The most recent figures for the 2019 year-end show that the Australian tourism industry contributes $126 billion ($80 billion domestic overnight visitor spend & $45.5 billion in international overnight visitor spend) to the Australian economy each year to one that has virtually been put on hold since restrictions were introduced due to COVID-19.

In terms of international travel, Australia welcomed 9.5 million visitors in 2019, including 190k visitors from Canada who spent $892 million on trips to Australia.

What does the future hold for your destination and are there any travel trends we can look forward to?

After spending more time at home and indoors, we’ll no doubt see a lot of the pent-up desire for travel with people wanting to get out and about more and reconnect by exploring nature through travel.

Domestically, we're already seeing a new appreciation for our natural beauty and wide-open spaces with which we expect to see a surge in Australians embracing road trips, and planning their own epic routes to discover their backyards, as some state borders have begun to reopen.

When the time is right for international travel to return to Australia, visitors will be able to indulge in the great food and wine, spectacular nature and wildlife experiences, and uniquely Australian arts and culture moments that Australia is well known for.

Australia is home to so many incredible and diverse landscapes, offering plenty of open-air experiences — from the Outback to the Great Barrier Reef as well as the many Great Walks of Australia and more — visitors are literally spoilt for choice.

Finally, wellness travel (i.e. spa holidays, yoga retreats) was growing in popularity as we closed out 2019 and the last six months have amplified the desire for this type of holiday.

When do you think your destination will be welcoming visitors once again?

International travel has effectively been at a standstill since Australia announced the closure of its borders on 20 March 2020, and it is not certain when international borders will re-open.

At this stage we are just starting to see borders reopen between some, but not all, states and territories in Australia.

From Tourism Australia’s perspective attracting international travellers will form a critical part of the tourism restart and recovery in Australia, but will likely be further down the track.

We just don’t know when international restrictions will start to be lifted, nor how the

process of restoring international travel will play out. But we will be ready to go back and go back at scale when the time is right.

Is Australia considering any ""travel bubbles"" with any other countries?

While we all want to see the return of international visitors, that’s still some way off and given domestic travel restrictions are being lifted before international ones, recovery will undoubtedly be domestic led.

However, Tourism Australia remains active in 15 international markets including Canada. For the moment we are also active in domestic marketing as we look to support our industry through these challenging times.

The process of rebuilding tourism is likely to be gradual, beginning first with visits to local cafes and restaurants, day trips, intrastate road trips and weekend breaks.

Then, as the state borders gradually re-open, interstate travel, when people have the opportunity to explore further afield. And eventually international travel, potentially starting with our near neighbours, New Zealand.

What are you doing now to keep travellers interested in Australia?

Tourism Australia has been committed to bringing Australia's unique and iconic experiences into the living rooms of grounded travellers around the world through Live from Aus, a jam-packed program of live entertainment delivered by Aussie experts in everything from koalas and kangaroos, to mountain biking, music, food and wine and much more.

The wide range of programming virtually transports viewers across the country, into every state and even underwater.

What started as a weekend of live events has continued with several recent videos, all available on-demand on Australia's YouTube channel.

We can't wait to welcome our mates from around the world Down Under when it is once again safe to travel, and in the meantime, we encourage travellers to take this time to daydream of their next trip and make it the most memorable holiday they've ever had.

We're constantly adding to the growing library of content and resources on Australia.com, including virtual tours of Australia's top sites and wildlife experiences, Australian entertainment to tune in from home and tips for planning your next Aussie trip from your living room.

We hope it inspires people to keep the wanderlust alive and to come visit us soon, because there's still nothing like Australia.

Of course, ongoing travel restrictions due to COVID-19 mean the Yukon is currently closed to visitors. (British Columbia residents will be admitted into the territory beginning July 1.)

But, Tourism Yukon can’t wait that long and wants everyone in the world to experience the charm of this Canadian gem right now.

And now you can — without leaving home — with two new ways to escape to the Yukon from anywhere on the planet.

Each of these initiatives offer opportunities to learn more about the territory, have fun and gain inspiration for when visitors are welcome once more.

YUKON BOOK CLUB

The Yukon has been the setting of countless classic novels throughout literary history.

Tourism Yukon has selected some of the best classic and contemporary fiction set in the Yukon and is making these books available for download from TravelYukon.com.

Readers will gain a deeper understanding of the locations described in the books, thanks to interactive story maps, which offer photos, expert historical information and more.

The first two titles in the Yukon Book Club include:

Published in 1903, this world-famous short novel about a sled dog’s adventures during the Klondike Gold Rush has never been out of print, and is considered one of the most famous stories of all time.



Strange Things Done

By Elle Wild

Winner of the prestigious Arthur Ellis Award for Best First Novel, this 2017 thriller tells the tale of Jo Silver, an investigative journalist who becomes a prime suspect in the death of a Dawson City politician.



SWEATIN’ TO THE YUKON

Something about the Yukon has always inspired people to be active. From the engaging energy of the people who call it home, to the breathtaking beauty of its wide-open spaces, the Yukon gets locals and visitors alike moving — and loving it.

81,vancourier,https://www.vancourier.com/standout/laugh-freely-leak-free-tips-for-strengthening-your-pelvic-floor-1.23935014,Laugh freely: Leak-free tips for strengthening your pelvic floor,[],,"If you’ve ever laughed and leaked, you’re like most women. This common problem is why panty liners and leak-proof undies are huge industries. But instead of stocking up on pads, the “Vagina Coach” Kim Vopni wants women who want to be carefree and leak-free, to visit a pelvic floor physiotherapist at least once a year.

That’s the first of Vopni’s three leak-free lifestyle tips. Pelvic floor physios are regular physiotherapists with additional training and licensing to perform internal assessments to check for tone, strength, endurance, organ position, and the pelvic floor’s ability to contract and relax.

article continues below

Pelvic floor muscles, like any muscle, like to move through their full range of motion. Our modern-day lifestyle involves a lot of sitting, typically in slouched postures. This can contribute to short tight pelvic floor muscles that become hindered in their ability to respond to increases in pressure like laughing and coughing or jumping. “Learning to relax the pelvic floor is just as, if not more important than learning to contract the pelvic floor muscles”.

Enter pelvic floor specialists, who can assess the pelvic floor and assign appropriate corrective exercises. Vopni’s site can help you find a pelvic floor specialist near you.

Vopni’s second lifestyle tip is that Kegel exercises are critical to pelvic floor health. Most women do Kegels incorrectly, and then give up thinking they don’t work. Vopni is on a mission to promote a Kegel lifestyle with her 3 C approach. Kegels work when done Correctly, Consistently and Coordinated with movement. Being told to do Kegels at every red light is not serving women nor does it translate into activities of daily living like lifting and carrying and pushing. By learning HOW to do Kegels, and then how to add Kegels to exercises like squats and bicep curls women can transform their core! “Kegels are a core exercise” Vopni says. The key is to then do them consistently. By adopting a Kegel lifestyle, women can ditch the pads, avoid drugs and surgery and live a leak free life!

Then there’s the third tip, which Vopni explains, as “you have to optimize your pooping.” This means eating non inflammatory foods, balancing soluble and insoluble fibre and hydrating well so you can poop daily without straining. “Constipation,” she warns, “is a pelvic floor killer.""

Pelvic floor health is so much more than living a leak-free life – it’s an important step in sexual health and a pain-free life too, as there is a significant correlation between low back pain and pelvic floor dysfunction. Vopni’s sense of humour underlies her “Vagina Coach” moniker, and she’s a hardcore advocate for pelvic floor health. She runs a monthly 28 day Kegel challenge that teaches her 3C approach and helps women reduce or eliminate their symptoms, some in as little as 14 days. Registration is open until Sept 6.

Whether it’s you as a player or the local charities benefiting from bingo funds, Planet Bingo provides great entertainment with a strong connection to the community.

article continues below

“We are the largest bingo hall in the Lower Mainland with more than 400 seats for our bingo players,” says Abby Dy, marketing manager for Planet Bingo, which is operating for the Community Gaming Management Association (CGMA), in partnership with British Columbia Corporation.

Originally called Starship Bingo, the hall has been hosting games at the historic Mount Pleasant War Memorial Community Co-operative building on Main Street for decades.

But it was in 1988 that technology changed the way the game was run with the introduction of electronic bingo.

Players can still play the paper version at Planet Bingo, but the electronic alternative allows them to increase their scope and chances at winning.

“The most seasoned paper card players can normally only play up to about 20 cards at one time,” Dy says. “But those playing electronic bingo can play as many as 60 cards at a time.”

And while this is beneficial for players it’s also good for business, as a portion of proceeds is returned to the community.

“We are a profit for non-profit organizations, directing whatever we make above our payouts and expenses to a group of charitable organizations,” Dy says. “Currently, we have 18 member charities.” Among them are the Mount Pleasant Community Centre Association, Vancouver Pacific Lions Club, Boys and Girls Clubs of South Coast BC and Turning Point Recovery Society.

On average, 60% or more of sales go right back into bingo prizing with the remainder being divided between the bingo hall’s overhead and the recipient charities.

But Planet Bingo plays another role.

“It’s not just a place where people come to try and win money,” Dy says. “For many of our regulars, this is a community. It’s a destination where they come and see their friends, sit down and have some fun.”

As for the age range for players, you might be surprised who’s dabbing the numbers.

“A lot of people just assume that bingo is for old people,” Dy says. “While that might be true for some church bingos, the majority of our players are actually between the ages of 35-55.

“But whoever comes here is sure to have a good time.”

83,vancourier,https://www.vancourier.com/news/amanda-tapping-on-coping-with-miscarriage-1.883172,Amanda Tapping on coping with miscarriage,[],,"Miscarriages are rarely discussed openly in any venue — in the media, within families, or over coffee with close friends — despite the fact that a staggering number of pregnancies (one in six, according to a 2010 study by the American National Institute of Child Health and Human Development) end in loss.

article continues below

For many women, a miscarriage is a traumatic and isolating experience, one that is worsened by feelings of shame and guilt. These women feel that their miscarriages were their fault (even though miscarriages are very rarely caused by anything the mother has done). Despite the statistics, they often feel that no one could possibly understand their pain. They might even feel an intense societal pressure to be a mother, and that if they're unable to naturally birth a child, they're somehow less of a woman

Combined, such feelings can be absolutely crippling.

Amanda Tapping knows the burden of these feelings all too well. Tapping — the Vancouver-based actor-director who starred on Stargate SG-1 and Sanctuary — had two miscarriages before the birth of her daughter Olivia, and six miscarriages after.

Like so many other women in our midst, Tapping has wrestled with feelings of shame and isolation — and has done so largely without sharing her story with others.

""I just feel like it's one of those taboo subjects that women don't feel comfortable talking about, and there were times where I felt downright embarrassed. Truth be told, I still do,"" says Tapping in an interview with Westender in the courtyard of a North Vancouver café. ""You just don't know how to articulate it because you're struggling so much, and you feel guilty, like 'I must have done something wrong, and that's why I've lost this baby.'""

Tapping first told Westender about her miscarriages in an off-the-record conversation about motherhood back in January; it's a part of her life that she's never shared in a formal interview. But with Mother's Day approaching, we asked Tapping to consider speaking out about her journey through miscarriages and grief — and for the first time, she's doing just that.

""As hard as it is to talk about it, as scary as it is to talk about it, we have to talk about it, because how else are we going to support each other if we don't have those conversations? As soon as you give a voice to it, then it ceases to have as much power over you. I don't know if would I have the courage to do this if you hadn't asked, but I do realize how important the dialogue is.""

Tapping always knew that she wanted to be a parent, not that she and her husband of nearly 20 years, Alan Kovacs, explicitly expressed this desire to each other at the beginning of their marriage. ""I think this generation coming up maybe has that conversation more than my generation,"" she says. ""My generation, it was just expected that you would.""

The question then was not how or why but when. Once Tapping's career took off with her role on Stargate SG-1, her plans for motherhood were pushed to the backburner— until she realized she simply couldn't wait any longer. ""There was this sort of 'A-ha!' moment of, 'wait a second, this show could go on for a really long time, I don't want to finish the show and had that opportunity pass me by.'"" Spurred on by this moment of clarity, somewhere around the seventh season of Stargate SG-1, Tapping and Kovacs started trying to conceive.

Tapping had never entertained the possibility that she could suffer a miscarriage, so when she lost her first pregnancy two months in, she was completely bowled over. ""I just always assumed I would have three children so it was a bit of a shock, but I thought, 'okay, it happens, a lot of women have miscarriages.'"" The second miscarriage further rattled Tapping's confidence, and presented a startling question. ""I started to think, 'oh my God, what if I cant do this?'""

Compounding the panic was the fact that there was no apparent reason for these recurrent miscarriages. A multitude of tests showed everything was normal. ""I had absolutely no problem getting pregnant, unlike some women,"" says Tapping. ""There's a difference between the fertility struggle and the miscarriage struggle, but the pain is similar because at the end you are still childless.""

Besides the physical impact of pregnancy loss, Tapping also contended with grief and shame. ""Every time it's like your heart's ripped out of your body and then you beat yourself up and you try to stuff your heart back in and move forward,"" she says.

And move forward she did, into a third pregnancy — the one that resulted in her now eight-year-old daughter, Olivia. ""It felt different,"" says Tapping. ""It was a great pregnancy.""

Tapping relished every moment of new motherhood. She went back to work feeling not quite physically her best, but no matter: she'd always enjoyed portraying Sam Carter, and now there was there was the added bonus of a special little person waiting for milk and cuddles between takes. ""I would run around and fire my weapon pretending to save the planet, and then I would go to my trailer and strip off my vest and place my baby against my breast and I would be Zen,"" says Tapping. ""It's exhausting when you're working 14-hour days, but I loved it and I felt a sense of accomplishment. I was a mama.""

It wasn't long before Tapping felt compelled to add to her family. Despite her best efforts — and then the support of the team at the Recurrent Pregnancy Loss Clinic at BC Womens Hospital — Tapping suffered miscarriage after miscarriage. ""The first one after Olivia was frustrating because I was like, 'come on, I know how to do this, and I did it well,'"" she says.

She was pregnant on and off again throughout the remainder of Stargate SG-1, as well as on Stargate: Atlantis and during the early days of Sanctuary. Tapping rarely let those around her in on her private struggles. ""The producers on Stargate, I think I told them about one or two of the miscarriages, but I didn't feel like it was a place where I could talk about it,"" she says. Her work ethic was strong; she didnt want to let the team down.

Finally, after an eighth loss that culminated in a devastating scene in the clinic's examination room, the doctors advised Tapping to stop trying altogether. The traumas of pregnancy and miscarriage were taking too heavy a toll both physically and emotionally.

Through all of this, Tapping kept the grief of her lost pregnancies close to her bones (""You sort of go through the waves of guilt and then at one point, I felt like I had eight little baby spirits circling around me and I couldn't let them in""). She had her work; she had her spirited daughter and her husband; she barreled forward without giving herself the time and space to mourn her losses. ""It piles up; every miscarriage becomes harder because it's carrying the weight of the one before,"" she says. ""[If I could go back in time], I would have reached out to more of my women friends. I have a tendency to not want to bother people, so I go down the rabbit hole a little bit.""

Though Tapping tried to shove her feelings aside, they were always present just beneath the surface. When Sanctuary went off the air in early 2012, for the first time, those feelings had the time and space to burst through. ""I thought I had no ripples on my lake, the waves gently lapping on the shore, but then Sanctuary ended, and the full force of everything hit me,"" says Tapping. ""It was a tsunami of grief.""

Her journey to motherhood, and the healing of the last year, has given Tapping pause to consider the toxic emotions that women battle on an ongoing basis. According to Tapping, the guilt and shame that swirl around miscarriages and infertility are indicative of societal pressures on women that beginand don't cease with childbirth.

There is pressure everywhere, says Tapping: pressure to get married; pressure to be a mother within a certain age range; pressure to give birth naturally; pressure to have one child, and then another, and ideally children of both genders; pressure to breastfeed; pressure to stay at home and then pressure to go back to work. And every move is judged.

The judgment needs to stop, says Tapping. ""Who are we to judge anyone elses choice, ever? Unless they're doing something that's physically harming someone or the planet, then who the hell are we?"" she says. Once the judgment is pushed aside, says Tapping, the life-changing dialogue can begin.

For Tapping, this interview marks the beginning of a converstaion that she hopes will inspire women to give voice to their struggles and find the strength in each other that they simply won't find in isolation. ""The intention is to feel comfortable about something that has been traditionally shrouded in shame,"" she says. ""If it's not talked about, then it stays in the shadows. The more that we lift each other up and support each other, the better off we will be.""

The city-owned heritage building was damaged in a flood in 2013, but it’s being renovated and is expected to be ready for occupancy by the fall of 2018.

Other community programs had operated out of the building since the mid-1980s, prior to the flood.

article continues below

In late January, city council selected the Association of Neighbourhood Houses of B.C. (ANHBC) as the new operator of Marpole Place.

South Vancouver Neighbourhood House, one of the ANHBC’s oldest neighbourhood houses, will oversee the setup of the new centre.

Deb Bryant, ANHBC’s CEO, said the organization is currently working on the program mix, but Marpole Place will operate like a “classic neighbourhood house,” which includes some work with seniors, such as a drop-in program or formal adult daycare program, work with youth and work with young families.

Details are being ironed out.

“We’ve got a pretty strong connection with the Marpole Oakridge Community Centre. What we’d like to do is have Marpole Place be a gathering point for young people that live south of 70th — maybe to transport them up to the community centre for programs that are already operating or to do some kind of outpost programs for young people,” she said.

Other initiatives will likely involve food and food security.

“The core of our work is what we call community development or community building, so sort of a drop-in area for neighbours. We quite often do work to bring people together to look at local issues in the neighbourhood,” added Bryant.

For example, if residents see the need for a particular program such as a conversation group for English-as-a-second-language learners, a volunteer group could start one up.

“A lot of what we’ll be waiting to see is who comes forward out of the neighbourhood and what are their ideas and primary concerns, and we’ll try help accommodate that,” Bryant said.

It’s the first time the ANHBC has opened a new neighbourhood house in a decade. It currently runs six in Vancouver — Marpole Place will be its seventh. (It also has a neighbourhood house in Crescent Beach, and it operates an outdoor camp in Port Moody at Camp Sasamat.)

Bryant said studies by the City of Vancouver and Vancouver Coastal Health have revealed there’s a lack of social infrastructure in Marpole, especially at its south end.

Marpole’s population is also expected to grow by 50 per cent by 2041 and it’s considered a higher needs community because there are larger numbers of renters, single-parent families, children in low-income families and immigrants.

“There’s a real concentration of people who maybe don’t have a lot of space inside their homes, have less affluence [and therefore less] access to paid services,” she said. “There’s a little bit of a desert of social services there, especially since the flood because that building was a real cornerstone for that neighbourhood for quite a while.”

85,vancourier,https://www.vancourier.com/news/mining-the-truth-1.387540,Mining the truth,['Rob Howatson'],,"The tiny bungalow on East Kent Avenue is the most unassuming house on the block. Set well back from the road and partially obscured by trees, the simple, four-room abode seems lost among its newer, million-dollar neighbours that overlook the north arm of the Fraser River flowing past the foot of Elliott Street. A stroll down the dead-end lane behind the house, reveals even less, because a wall of wild blackberry bushes protects the back yard from prying eyes. The only notable feature in the alley is a discarded, aluminum balcony railing positioned to discourage vehicles from parking in a small clearing. The scrap metal glimmers in the sun like a grinning set of braces, as if the property savours a secret, which it most certainly does.

Few people know that country music singer Loretta Lynnshe of Coal Miners Daughter famewas discovered by record executives in that rustic backyard in 1959 when she attended a jam session held in a chicken coop that had been converted to a private party space. Lynn rarely mentions the story to journalists and the barn was demolished in the early 70s, but the truth endures. On Sept. 16, local history buffs will gather at nearby Riverfront Park to unveil a Vancouver Heritage Foundation Places That Matter plaque commemorating the Queen of Countrys inauspicious, hen-house meeting with representatives from Zero Records, the tiny Vancouver label that launched the superstars career.

article continues below

Vancouver music aficionado Mike Harling will be at the plaque party. He was the first writer to track down the former location of the Chicken Coop in 2002 after his friend, sports historian Fred Hume, told him that Kentucky-born Lynn had a connection to the city through local football pioneer and sawmill owner Norm Burley. Loretta lived in Washington State in the 1950s and she played any gig she could get, on both sides of the border, before she moved to Nashville and made it big, says the soft-spoken Harling. The First Lady of Country likes to say that Burley discovered her when he saw Loretta sing Whispering Sea on Buck Owens TV show out of Tacoma, but in fact it was two music producers from Thunder Bay, Ontario who spotted her at the Coop and signed her to Zero Records.

Don Grashey was the president of the tiny label when it began, and his longtime business partner Chuck Williams was the vice-president. They were stunned when Lynn published her first autobiography, Coal Miners Daughter in 1976 and it contained only a passing mention of Grashey and no word about The Coop. Harling interviewed the two veteran record men a few years before they passed away in 2005 and Grashey, a Canadian Country Music Association Hall of Famer, was still bitter. I would like her [Lynn] to tell the truth, instead of the bullshit that was in the movie and in her book. Norm Burley did nothing. He was just a shareholder who had some money. Thats all he was, yknow. I did all the god darned work. I signed her and I produced her and I published her songs and I promoted her god darned record [Im A Honky Tonk Girl] to number 14 on the Billboard and I got nothing out of it, but a bunch of bullshit.

Chuck Williams, who was the first of the duo to see Lynn in Vancouver, also felt that their contributions were crucial to her career. Loretta was in the Pacific Northwest singing for quite awhile before we signed her. No one had made any overtures to record her, so I believe if we hadnt discovered her, if we werent the professionals that we were and knew how to do things, I honestly dont think she would have made it.

As for The Chicken Coop, the only image of it known to exist is from a 1961 aerial photograph that hangs in the reception area of North Arm Transport, a tug and barge operation across the railway tracks from the property where the party barn once stood.

The black and white photo was hand tinted and shows an unpaved Elliott Street snaking down the South Van slope to the muddy river, the narrow road passing between the massive Fraserview subdivision that was built for Second World War veterans and the golf course of the same name that was built as a Depression-era work relief project.

Marine Drive appears as two lanes of lightly driven blacktop that cuts across the vista mid-frame. Beneath it, a loosely spaced cluster of neatly kept homes overlook the rough, industrial shoreline. Today, most of those houses have been replaced by a tight wall of detached residences and condominiums. Only the tiny 1949 bungalow, standing squat and isolated in the photos central foreground, remains. And clearly visible behind it is a long, low slung building with a patched roof and a line of small, square windows.

Gino and Leo Stradiotti, two of North Arms principals who grew up in the neighbourhood, both identify the structure as The Chicken Coop. They heard the noise from the parties, and saw ambulances and police cars attend whenever the revelers got out of hand. Neither cousin had any idea that Lynn had performed there, but they knew the property owners Ernest Clare Mac McGregor and his wife Irene. The childless couple were from the Prairies. Mac worked a short walk upriver at the giant Canadian White Pine sawmill, which has since been demolished and is being replaced by the River District condominium development. Irene was a stylish dresser who sewed her own outfits and could be seen catching the streetcar each morning enroute to her office job at an oil and coal company.

Mrs. McGregors brother was the longtime Province sports writer Clancy Lorangera cigar chomping, hard drinking, baseball statistic guru for whom the entrance street to Nat Bailey Stadium is named. Loranger passed away in 2010, but not before he gave an interview in which he recalled attending dances at The Coop. He said that his sister and brother-in-law were a pretty sharp couple, referring to their resourcefulness on limited incomes. The sports scribe had photos that showed the Fraser River squatter shacks that Mac built for his wife and mother-in-law while they struggled to save enough money to buy land. The shacks were attractive cottages on stilts with ample decks and container gardens. In one photo, Clancy and his wife Joy are horsing around on the patio beside a table draped in linen and set with fine dinner china. Mac often swam in the Fraser and if they wanted salmon for lunch, they just tied a line to the railing.

After a few years of living tax free on the river, the McGregors bought the property at 2541 East Kent and built a real house. The Chicken Coop may already have been there, the remnants of a sub-divided farm acreage. Mac either did not want to raise poultry in the hen house or city bylaws forbade it, or both, so he tried breeding Airedale terriers. When that business failed, he decided to use the barn for his main passion: music. He used every spare penny from his mill job to buy state of the art audio equipment. He dubbed songs from the radio on his reel-to-reel tape recorder. The McGregors cleaned out the coop and installed wooden tables and chairs, a small bar and a closet with a bucket that served as a washroom.

Reports vary on the cleanliness of the venue. Ernie Straiton of the 50s band Hobo Hank and the Sons of the Delta called it a rat hole. Chuck Mackenzie who grew up on Harrison Drive, up the hill from The Coop, recalls that it was freshly whitewashed inside and out. Guitarist Gord Lundy says it had a distinctive fowl odour. Whatever the spaces ambiance, it routinely shook as a weekend dance hall for the McGregors family and friends. The old floorboards bounced during waltzes, polkas and the odd Schottische (a slower, step-hop move that originated in Bohemia and made its way to B.C. via Scandinavia and the prairies). Parties were BYOB, but if a guest ran dry, Mac always had a bootleg bottle.

During IWA labour action, The Coop served as strike headquarters for local mill workers. Macs union brethren could drop in to the barn to get a free sandwich, play cards or get a haircut before heading out on the river in the union boat to patrol for scabs.

Live music was rare at The Coop, but in the late 50s, a Vancouver drummer-promoter named Johnny Zapp Zaplotynsky organized half a dozen jam sessions at the backyard venue.

The get togethers were primarily intended for local country musicians to socialize on Sunday afternoons when they had no gigs. The events were promoted on the radio, so Loretta Lynn may have heard about them that way, or Zapp may have invited her personally for he had met her during his regular visits to Blaines clubs. Either way, she showed up to sing at a couple of the jams.

Grashey and Williams knew about the hoe downs through one of their young discoveries, Sandi Shore Loranger, the McGregors niece. The stage was set for a momentous meeting of country music minds, or, as Mike Harling likes to say, Ground Zero of Lynns career. But more than 50 years later, there is no mention of the iconic singers Fraserview debut on her website. And no mention in her recent book, Honky Tonk Girl: My Life in Lyrics.

Sandi, who was only 15 years old at the time, has a hazy memory of the American singer performing to a packed barn. I was more into pop music than country, more interested in the beautiful dresses that Aunt Irene sewed for my singing career, but I do remember Loretta was well received by the pickers who were there that day.

I interviewed the Grand Ole Oprys grand dame in March, two months before Associated Press ran a story revealing that Lynn was married at age 15, and not 13 as she claimed in Coal Miners Daughter. She reminisced for half an hour about Zero Records in her gentle Kentucky twang and twice broke into song. Loretta recalled The Coop, but not who was present when she appeared there. She remembers Grashey and Williams, but not where she first met them, which seems odd given that they were likely the first music producers to approach her.

I told her that I could not find any evidence to show that Norm Burley had tracked her down after seeing her on TV, nor that he had started the label specifically to record her as she claimed in her first book. I suggested that Grashey and Williams delivered her to him. Lynn said, No, I think that Mr. Burley saw me sing Whispering Sea on the Buck Owens show and then when I went toIm sure this is kind of the way it wentand I went to the Chicken Coop and Don and them were there. Thats where [Don] probably come over and want to know if I want to record.

This is the most detail Lynn has ever provided about Don Grashey to a journalist. She was hazy about many facts, which is understandable given that the events took place more than 50 years ago, but the Queen of Countrys memory was crystal clear when she suddenly asked rhetorically, Don didnt own any of that Zero Records, did he?

He did own some shares, but Norm Burley was the money man, Grashey was merely the music man.

When the Coop was demolished in the early 70s to make room for a row of Vancouver Specials, the McGregors bungalow was inexplicably spared from the wreckers ball. Mac and Irene have since passed, as have most of the storys main players, but the homes current owners are aware of the propertys unique history. A few years back they discovered an electrical wire buried in the backyard, a line that may have carried Macs music from his living room DJ set-up to The Coop.

Today in the home there are no signs of the elaborate custom cabinetry that was said to have held Macs music collection and sound system. No one knows what became of his hobby. Harling hopes that someone has additional details about this story and will contact him through his website honkytonkgirl.ca.

The commemorative plaque being installed across the street from the bungalow is the beginning of a renewed interest in this lost chapter of Vancouvers music history. Local folk band Viper Central recently composed a song about the saga entitled Thump and Howl. And Lynn continues to tour, but no word yet on whether the upcoming Broadway musical adaptation of her life starring Zooey Deschanel will contain a massive song and dance number set in a chicken coop.

The Vancouver Police Department and the B.C. RCMP issued news releases Wednesday that said Andrew James Seangio has been charged with seven counts of an indecent act, three counts of exposing himself to persons under the age of 16 and one count of voyeurism.

article continues below

Seangio is alleged to have committed the acts in February 2019 while off duty in the west side neighbourhoods home to private schools York House and Little Flower Academy, said Const. Tania Visintin, a VPD media relations officer.

“We had a number of calls starting from November of 2018 of a man driving around in a black vehicle and it took investigators some time to narrow it down,” said Visintin, noting police arrested Seangio Wednesday.

“So it definitely is comforting to the area and to the neighbourhood that someone like this has been taken into custody.”

The officer also faces an internal code of conduct investigation by the Richmond RCMP. Detachment commander Supt. Will Ng said in a news release “the allegations are concerning and are not in keeping with our expectations.”

Seangio has been suspended with pay, with his duty status “subject to continuous review and assessment,” the RCMP news release said. His next appearance in Vancouver Provincial Court is scheduled for April 29.

The Washington Post reported Jan. 21 that a man in his 30s is in stable condition at Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett, Wash. The man, who is not seriously ill, is said to have arrived last week from the central Chinese city of Wuhan, which is the epicentre of the outbreak.

article continues below

The virus so far has infected close to 300 individuals, mostly in China, and it is said to be contagious as it spreads from person to person.

The Vancouver Airport Authority told Business in Vancouver in an email that the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is directing the response to the crisis because it is the government agency responsible for decisions about health-related screening of passengers at Canada’s airports.

PHAC’s plans for Vancouver International Airport (YVR) include enhanced “messaging on arrivals screens and an additional health screening question to be added to electronic border kiosks,” the Vancouver Airport Authority said in its email. “They have indicated these measures will be implemented in the coming week.”

No one from PHAC immediately responded to a request from BIV to elaborate on planned measures and on whether there could be temperature screening.

Other airports are stepping up precautions.

At Changi Airport in Singapore, all inbound travellers arriving on flights from China will undergo temperature screening starting on Jan. 22 (today in that Southeast Asian island nation), according to that country’s Ministry of Health.

That precaution is necessary, it said, because the number of infected people is on the rise, the risk of the disease spreading is rising and the volume of passengers is expected to spike given upcoming Lunar New Year visiting.

Canada’s chief public health officer Theresa Tam said yesterday that no coronavirus cases have yet been discovered in Canada, although several people have been investigated.

Flights between China and YVR have been surging in recent years. While the airport has significantly more non-stop off-continent flights than does the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA), SEA has been catching up and is increasingly the largest competitor with YVR for new airlines and routes.

Nikolaos Dais, a retired teacher from the all-girls Catholic high school Little Flower Academy, and Ken Clement, who resigned last June for personal reasons as a Vancouver school trustee, were charged with communicating for the purpose of obtaining sexual services for consideration from a person under the age of 18.

article continues below

The offences are alleged to have occurred in June 2018 at or near Vancouver. So far, the Crown has approved charges against Dais, Clement and five other men: Mario Celo Amistad, Jim Malmros, Jun Jie He, Donald Schroeder and Mehran Arefi.

One of the men charged is a firefighter from a department in Metro Vancouver, another is connected to “an outlaw motorcycle gang.” Police declined to say where the firefighter works, or the name of the biker gang.

Diane Little, principal of Little Flower Academy, said she was “absolutely shocked and heartsick and sad” when news broke Wednesday. Little said Dais was a long-time employee, but she wouldn’t disclose how long he taught at the school or when he retired.

On Thursday, Little continued to talk with staff, students and parents about the charge but wanted to keep the nature of the conversations private. Little Flower, which is located in the 4000-block Alexandra Street, has 480 students in grades 8 to 12.

“These are conversations we’re having with our own school community, who is hurting right now, and I’m not prepared to talk about the private conversations we’re having with staff, parents and students,” she said. “We are providing support for any kids that need it, though.”

Little said she had not been contacted by police when she spoke to the Courier Thursday.

“All I can tell you is the school has never been contacted by the VPD, and so all of our information is 100 per cent coming from the media,” she said. “The VPD has not informed us of the investigation, or any charges.”

An online site called Rate My Teachers has several entries for Dais, who is listed as a multiple subjects teacher at Little Flower. The Courier was unable to verify whether comments from students and parents — including those posted today and yesterday after news broke — were credible since the authors were anonymous.

Patti Bacchus, who served with Clement for six years as Vision Vancouver school trustees, said she was devastated and heartbroken about the news that her former colleague was charged in connection with obtaining sexual services from a young person.

“Having been a school trustee, the safety and well-being of children and youth is the most important thing,” said Bacchus, who was clearly upset as she spoke to the Courier by telephone. “So to hear this news about someone who I trusted and I care about is really devastating.”

She described Clement as a good friend and was worried about him, noting she hadn’t heard from him — despite messages left with him over the Christmas holidays — since he resigned last June, citing health issues.

Bacchus said Clement, who is of Ktunaxa First Nation ancestry, told her he was returning to his community last June, possibly near Cranbrook, to participate in a healing program and a sweat lodge. Clement is a residential school survivor.

“There’s absolutely no excuse for what he’s being accused of and I would never, ever want to diminish the harm that that would be causing to young people, if he was actually engaging with them,” she said.

Various online biographies related to Clement’s work as a trustee note that he was a leader in organizations serving Aboriginal people in Metro Vancouver, including offering “executive guidance” to health organizations. He was involved with Aboriginal HIV/AIDS movement since 1998.

Bacchus said Clement, who is gay, wasn’t married.

“He worked so hard to build a life from a very difficult start,” she said.

Board chair Janet Fraser and superintendent Suzanne Hoffman both declined interview requests Wednesday and again on Thursday.

First elected in 1999, Allan Wong is the longest-serving board trustee and was the lone Vision candidate to win a seat in last year’s election.

He worked alongside Clement on the board for seven years, first as a COPE trustee and as a Vision member since 2013.

Wong hasn’t been in contact with Clement since July 2018.

“I had no idea that was coming out,” Wong said. “When it was said that a trustee was involved, I was thinking it was elsewhere in the province.”

Michael Haack, a spokesperson for Vision Vancouver, said in an email that “Vision Vancouver’s priority has always been ensuring that everyone in our communities is safe from abuse and harm.”

He continued: “In that respect, these charges are very troubling. Ken will be proceeding through the criminal justice system and we will monitor this situation very closely as the case unfolds. We appreciate the hard work and dedication of the VPD. We encourage anyone with any information or concerns to reach out to the police.”

The arrest of Clement, Dais and the other men came after Vancouver police ran a two-month operation that targeted people willing to purchase sexual services from young people. Vancouver detectives posted “decoy advertisements” on web escort listings and social media platforms for sexual services.

After prospective clients made contact via text message, they were told the girls were between 15 and 17 years old. Police then operated nine “arrest days” to capture the men who showed up to a hotel, as arranged, to pay for sex.

“I want to make it clear that these projects were not about sexual activity between two consenting adults,” said Vancouver Deputy Chief Laurence Rankin at Wednesday’s news conference at the VPD’s Cambie Street precinct. “Police will continue to focus their attention on those willing to prey on and exploit young boys and girls.”

Media relations officer Sgt. Jason Robillard said Thursday that investigators are still working through the 40 other cases.

“We anticipate that all 40 arrests will be considered for criminal charges at some point and so far seven have already been approved,” he said in an email. “Our investigators are working diligently on these matters and will continue to work closely with our partners at the B.C. prosecutions office.”

The Courier contacted several fire departments in Metro Vancouver to determine which department the firefighter charged in the sting belonged to. Vancouver, Burnaby, Richmond, West Vancouver and the District of North Vancouver all said none of their firefighters were among the charged.

Of the seven men charged, Amistad, Malmros, He and Dais have court dates Jan. 30. Arefi’s next court appearance is Jan. 28 and Schroeder’s is Jan. 31. Clement has a trial date scheduled for Oct. 29 of this year.

The party issued a news release Friday afternoon saying that it had not found a replacement for Ian Campbell, who was Vision’s mayoral candidate until he withdrew Monday from the race.

article continues below

“After considering all the options, and listening carefully to party members and progressive voters, Vision Vancouver has decided we will not field a mayoral candidate,” said Ange Valentini, the party’s executive director and campaign director. “This was a difficult decision because we believe our chances would have been very good, but we believe this decision is the right decision for our city.”

Added Valentini:“Vancouver residents are fortunate to have two other excellent candidates for mayor in Shauna Sylvester and Kennedy Stewart and running another mayoral candidate at this late date creates too much risk that the NPA or one of the other right-wing parties would win and take Vancouver backward.”

Longtime Vision councillor, Andrea Reimer, announced earlier this week that she was reconsidering her decision to retire and possibly replace Campbell as the candidate.

Campbell, a hereditary chief with the Squamish Nation, withdrew from the race after reflecting on the “political landscape and my complicated personal journey.”

Reimer posted a statement Friday to her Facebook page, saying in part that she didn’t want to weaken the so-called progressive vote.

“After very carefully weighing this decision, there is no question that it weighs towards running if taken simply on the merits of what’s best for the progressive policies I’ve championed for the better part of two decades,” she wrote. “At the same time, there are two candidates running who echo substantial parts of some of the policies I’ve championed, and while lacking a party backing makes it harder for them, another candidate won’t help.”

She didn’t name the two candidates, although the values and policies of independents Stewart and Sylvester are in line with many of those promoted by Vision Vancouver, as Valentini alluded to in the party’s news release.

When news broke Monday of Campbell’s departure, Stewart and Sylvester were coy about what the sudden loss of a candidate on the centre-left of the political spectrum would do for their chances to become Vancouver’s next mayor.

Stewart: “It does change the race significantly, but it really doesn’t change what I’ve been doing.”

Sylvester: “I don’t know what it does for my campaign.”

In its history, Vision has only run two people for mayor—the late Jim Green in 2005 (he lost to the NPA’s Sam Sullivan) and Gregor Robertson, who was elected in 2008 and re-elected in 2011 and 2014. Robertson announced in January that he was retiring after this term.

Vision, meanwhile, will run five candidates for the 11-member council. Longtime councillor, Heather Deal, is the party’s only council incumbent. Tim Stevenson and Kerry Jang are also retiring, and Geoff Meggs resigned last year to become Premier John Horgan’s chief of staff.

Stevenson and Jang announced this week they were supporting Stewart for mayor. Stevenson is a former NDP cabinet minister and Jang has been a staunch NDP supporter.

As of Friday, Stewart was still the NDP MP for Burnaby-South, a riding that federal NDP leader Jagmeet Singh hopes to win in either a byelection or the next general election.

Vision will run three candidates for school board and two for park board. In 2008, the party boasted almost 20,000 members. This year, it has about 2,000, according to a party official.

On Monday night, dozens gathered at the picnic tables near the Italian Garden at Hastings Park, skateboard in one hand, Old Milwaukee or Pabst Blue Ribbon in the other, to throw Wong a birthday party.

And not just any old birthday bash — her 75th.

“Joyce is pretty amazing,” said Julia Dennis who, like many people at the festive gathering, wore a black T-shirt with a graphic of Joyce’s smiling face across the front.

A logo of Joyce’s name and the words “75 years strong” is also spray-painted across the south bowl of the skatepark, and two weeks ago more than 3,000 people attending the Van Doren Invitational skate competition sang an early “Happy Birthday” to a tearful Wong. “When everyone sang ‘Happy Birthday’ there was a moment where a few of us got choked up,” Dennis said.

So what brings an elderly Chinese woman with three kids and a handful of grandchildren deep into the fold and loving embrace of East Vancouver’s rough-and-tumble skateboarding scene? In a word: cans.

Tosh Osaka, 42, has been coming to Hastings Skatepark since it opened in the early 2000s and says Joyce and her husband Henry have been fixtures for just as long, collecting empty cans and bottles in their cart, as part of their daily route, which includes New Brighton Park and the back alleys of Hastings-Sunrise where they live. Because skateboarders tend to be a thirsty bunch, Joyce makes sure to attend all of the skateboard competitions, even travelling by bus to North Vancouver’s Seylynn Skatepark for its annual Canada Day Bowl Series Jam. And if there’s a new skateboarding event coming up, the community is sure to inform Joyce about it.

“She’s like the grandmother of Hastings,” said Osaka, who like the others often saves his empties at home for Joyce and Henry to collect. Lore has it, the retired couple has been able to put their kids through university and finance a yearly trip back to China through their recycling efforts.

“She’s the sweetest woman in the world,” added Amy Byers, 33. “She’ll come by your house to pick up cans, she’ll plant vegetables in your garden. She’ll bring you food.”

According to Amy’s husband, Jonny, it was the younger skaters who first took a shine to Joyce. Unlike the usual can and bottle collectors who would come by the skatepark, Joyce was nice to them. “What first attracted the connection was how she would be considerate and friendly and engage with us,” Jonny, 39, said. It was also comforting to know that she and Henry lived nearby and could be trusted, he added. And it’s not uncommon for Joyce to find lost items at the park and return them to people’s homes.

“A lot of people here are from somewhere else, so she’s become kind of like family,” he said. “She’s been part of the culture here for 14 years or so.”

In fact, Joyce and Henry have become such a presence at the skatepark, they are now part of the community’s social circle.

Mike Telford, 37, recalls going to house parties and being initially surprised to see Joyce and Henry among the revellers.

“It’s like her social scene. It’s kind of cool that she actually enjoys us, because we’re a lot younger,” he said. “It would always surprise me seeing her at competitions… And then seeing her at house parties was the next step. I’d be half-cut and be like, ‘That looks like Joyce over there.’ She's part of our little society.”

Chris, a 40-year-old skater who wouldn’t give his last name and goes by the nickname “Bumbles,” had a similar experience while partying.

“A few years ago, we threw a sausage-themed party and had people dress up as German beer maids. We invited Joyce and Henry, and we have these photos of them sitting on our bed drinking tea with all of us just raging around them. And they were there for hours.”

When Henry and Joyce arrived at Hastings for the birthday celebrations, Joyce was greeted with hugs, bouquets of flowers and bags of empties people had brought from home.

“I don’t think I’d get this many people to show up to my birthday party,” quipped Krista Shaw, 33, also wearing a Joyce T-shirt.

For the party, Joyce insisted on bringing massive trays of chow mein and fried rice, which she cooked earlier in the day, and handed everyone a red envelope containing a five dollar bill. She’s also brought several cases of beer for her crew.

According to Jonny, Joyce wouldn’t have it any other way. “One of the things she said about tonight is don’t bring anything. ‘Just come so I can take pictures and show my grandchildren how many friends I have.’”

So what does Henry make of their celebrity status among the skateboarding community?

“A lot of Chinese people who come from China ask me, ‘Why are they so good to you?’ I say, I don’t know. We just go along with it,” he said. “Myself and my wife like to associate with people. We don’t want to be alone at home. I see them as family.”

As for getting a T-shirt with his wife’s face on it, Henry hasn’t received one yet. “They don’t have anymore,” he said. “I was told they’re ‘limited edition.’”

Henry confided that he even bought himself a skateboard from Canadian Tire but his requests for lessons have been turned down. “They say after you turn 80 your bones don’t recover so well if you break them,” said the 84-year-old.

Monday not only marked Joyce’s 75th birthday, it was also the anniversary of the day she arrived in Canada. She remembered the immigration officer had wished her happy birthday, but at the time she didn’t understand English. That was 47 years ago — long before Hastings Skatepark and most of the skaters there were even born.

Now she’s celebrating another milestone, surrounded by her unlikely adopted family members, who have taken her in as much as she’s taken them in.

“I have a big family now,” Joyce said with a grin that never left her face as she hugged well-wishers, posed for photos and urged people to eat. “I’m so happy. Everyone’s so nice to me. I’m so happy.”

92,vancourier,https://www.vancourier.com/real-estate/b-c-strata-insurance-market-unhealthy-study-1.24153951,B.C. strata insurance market ‘unhealthy:’ study,['Jeremy Hainsworth'],,"Strata corporation insurance rates have jumped about 40% across B.C. since last year, with deductibles sometimes leaping to triple-digit increases, the B.C. Financial Services Authority (BCFSA) said June 16.

“The current state of the strata insurance market is unhealthy,” said authority vice-president and deputy superintendent for regulation Frank Chong.

article continues below

Minister of Finance Carole James said rising condo and apartment building costs are serious issues for thousands of British Columbians.

“This is especially true with many people facing additional financial pressure related to the COVID-19 pandemic,” she said. “We knew this was a complex issue, and now we have a clearer picture of the different local, national and global factors affecting cost and availability within the insurance market.”

Among key report findings, based on a survey of 6,000 strata and townhouse properties, are:

• an average increase of 40% year-over-year to strata insurance premiums province-wide;

• a 50% increase in Metro Vancouver;

• 54% of strata properties experienced a premium increase of less than 30% compared to premiums the previous year;

• 31% of strata properties saw increases in the 30-50 % range;

• 9% faced year-over-year increases of 50 -100%; and

• 6% saw increases in excess of 100% compared to the previous year.

“Price pressures will continue,” the authority said in the report to James. “Buildings considered to be higher risk are expected to face the most significant increases as well as the possibility of not being able to obtain full, or in rare cases any, insurance coverage.""

The data is in an interim report done at the direction of the provincial government. Further findings will be released in the fall after continued stakeholder consultations, Chong said.

The authority regulates the province’s insurance industry, among other things.

CEO Blair Morrison said the market is failing to meet goals of sustainability, affordability and availability.

“Despite large increases already being felt, the situation has not yet stabilized, meaning many stratas, particularly those in buildings considered to be higher risk by insurers, can expect to face further pricing pressures as well as the risk of not being able to obtain full strata property insurance coverage,” Morrison said.

The industry generates about $300 million in premiums, covering more than $100 billion of insured property value. Coverage is mandatory under B.C.’s Strata Property Act, the authority told James.

Insurance under the act, which must provide full replacement value of the common strata property and assets, does not cover individual unit insurance, which owners need to ensure under individual policies.

The authority said earthquake coverage is not required under the act, but it is often included in strata property coverage.

“Strata corporations that choose not to purchase earthquake coverage are still covered for fire damage following an earthquake,” the authority told James. “An estimated 1.5 million residents live in strata properties in BC and properties can range from under $1 million to over $200 million in insured value.”

The investigation found evidence showing the industry has been incurring losses over the past three years from mostly minor claims, particularly from water damage, due to poor building maintenance.

“The data suggests that strata insurance has also been used to fill in the gaps left by other forms of protection such as home warranties for new buildings and maintenance programs for older buildings,” the authority said.

Further complicating things is the exposure to risk insurers have to earthquake damages in B.C. which has prompted many to reduce the amount of insurance they offer, the study found.

“With this reduction in capacity comes upward price pressures,” the authority said.

“It’s clear there is no quick fix for this problem,” James said. “It’s important to recognize that the dynamics driving these increases are playing out in the private insurance industry – government does not set insurance rates or regulate pricing.”

She said the government is reviewing the report and will be bringing in legislation this summer as a first step to help tackle this problem, while the authority continues its engagement with the sector.

While legislation details won’t be released before being introduced in the Legislature, Liberal Party Opposition Leader Andrew Wilkinson has called on James to take action.

“Skyrocketing strata insurance costs represent one more unexpected hit to the wallets of British Columbians, with a growing number truly at risk of losing their homes. Action by your government is needed now,” Wilkinson said in a June 16 letter to James.

Wilkinson suggested the following actions be taken:

• implementation of a temporary tax holiday on the 4.4% Insurance Premium Tax applicable on strata property to leave money in the pockets of strata owners;

• Extension on a temporary basis the Property Tax Deferment Program to enable strata owners facing extraordinary additional expenses to defer a portion of their property taxes;

• changes to Strata Property Act and regulations that ensure annual contributions are made to a strata corporation’s consolidated revenue fund at levels acceptable considering a building’s age, claims history and other unique circumstances;

• require strata corporations to have a depreciation report detailing necessary maintenance every year;

• require a strata corporation to inform owners and tenants of any material change in insurance coverage, including an increase in any deductible, as soon as feasible;

• develop a mandatory education and training program for strata council members, with particular emphasis on risk mitigation;

• review the B.C. Building Code and implement new requirements focused on the prevention and severity of water damage events, and;

• require the B.C. Financial Services Authority to make public the data and information it is gathering from insurance companies to better understand the current climate of rapidly rising strata insurance.

Condominium Home Owners' Association of B.C. CEO Tony Gioventu in March warned that uninsured condo owners could find themselves bankrupt and homeless if they didn’t maintain suites and personal insurance as strata insurance costs skyrocket.

Birds Nest Properties handles condo and townhouse rentals in Vancouver, Burnaby and Richmond. Director Alvin Cheung said the situation is putting pressures on both strata corporations and individual owners.

Cheung said some buildings have seen deductibles rise from $250,000 to $750,000, situations that have led to special levies for unit owners.

“What if all the owners can’t pay the special levy? What happens then?” he asked.

That could lead to cases of buildings not triggering their insurance leaving owners to pay for repairs or upkeep just not being done.

“It would be a neglected building,” he said.

And that could cause future insurance coverage problems, he agreed.

As well, Cheung said, landlords have seen their landlord insurance premiums leap, in some cases from $500 to $4,000 a year.

They were also 63% lower than the 10-year sales average for the month - a direct result, said the board, of social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

article continues below

“Predictably, the number of home sales and listings declined in April given the physical distancing measures in place,” Colette Gerber, REBGV’s president-elect said. “People are, however, adapting.”

According to Gerber, this adaptation is coming in the form of “using different technology to showcase homes virtually, assess neighbourhood amenities with their clients and handle paperwork electronically.”

Across the region, 1,109 homes changed hands last month. This is a 39.4% drop year-over-year and a 56.1% decline compared with March 2020.

The number of new listings for all residential property types was 2,313 in April, which is a 59.7% drop compared with April 2019 and a 47.9% decline compared with March 2020, when 4.436 homes were listed.

The benchmark price for all homes across the region is $1,036,000, which is 2.5% higher than it was one year prior.

“Home prices have held relatively steady in our region since the COVID-19 situation worsened in March,” Gerber said.

A total of 388 detached homes sold in April, which is 33.8% lower than the 586 homes of this type sold in April 2019. The benchmark price for detached homes is $1,462,100 - up 2.3% year-over-year.

In April 2020, 503 apartments were sold, which is 43.2% lower than the 885 homes sold in the same month last year. The benchmark price for apartments is $685,500, up 2.7% from April 2019.

For attached homes, sales reached 218 - a 39.1% decline year-over-year. The benchmark price was $796,800 - up 2.8% compared with the same month last year.

REBGV data includes sales and prices for Vancouver, West Vancouver, North Vancouver, Burnaby, New Westminster, Coquitlam, Port Coquitlam, Richmond, Port Moody, the Sunshine Coast, Whistler, Squamish, Pitt Meadows, Maple Ridge and South Delta. It does not include Langley or Surrey.

However, the vast majority of those transactions were in the first half of the month, and many of those deals reflect pre-pandemic buying activity, due to the reporting lag.

article continues below

“The first two weeks of the month were the busiest days of the year for our region, with heightened demand and multiple offers becoming more common,” said Ashley Smith, REBGV president. “Like other aspects of our lives, this changed as concerns over the COVID-19 situation in our province grew.”

REBGV said April 2 that residential sales on the region’s MLS averaged 138 per day during the first ten business days of March, and 93 during the final ten business days of the month.

“Many of the sales recorded in March were in process before the provincial government declared a state of emergency. We’ll need more time to pass to fully understand the impact that the pandemic is having on the housing market,” Smith added.

Story continues below

Kevin Skipworth, a realtor with Dexter Realty, said, “This month’s numbers for Greater Vancouver are a tale of what could have been, not so much what will be… There is a time lag between when the contract is written and when it is reported. A degree of [March’s] activity came from transactions that were initiated prior to the increased attention to COVID-19.”

Cameron McNeill, partner and executive director at real estate marketing firm MLA, predicted that the market would see a hiatus until the pandemic is over, but then would rebound later. “While it is too soon to determine the real effects COVID-19 will have on the Greater Vancouver real estate market, we certainly expect significantly slower sales volumes in historically active spring months ahead. The speed and timing of recovery is uncertain, but long-term housing demand for the region will likely be heightened by Canada’s COVID-19 response, and supply constraints.”

Sellers still listing

Despite the pandemic, sellers continued to list their homes in March. There were 4,436 homes listed for sale in Metro Vancouver in March, which is 10.4 per cent lower than March 2019 but a 10.8 per cent increase compared with February 2020 this year, reported the board.

“I was surprised at the number of new listings,” said Skipworth. “It dropped off in the last week of the month but people are still coming to market. Perhaps some people who had been planning on selling decided to do so before the situation gets any worse. We’re also seeing some listing cancellations and re-lists of those properties, so that accounts for some of the new listings.”

With overall sales increasing more than new listings, the sales-to-active listings ratio for March 2020 increased to 26.3 per cent. By property type, the ratio is 21.1 per cent for detached homes, 33 per cent for townhomes, and 28.9 per cent for apartments. These figures indicate a seller’s market, which is defined as more than 20 per cent for a sustained period.

Prices and property types

Home prices in the region also increased again last month. The composite benchmark price for all property types combined in Metro Vancouver is currently $1,033,700. This is a 2.1 per cent increase over March 2019, and a 1.3 per cent rise over February 2020.

Story continues below

Sales of detached homes in March 2020 reached 852, a leap of 61.1 per cent over the 529 detached sales recorded in March 2019. The benchmark price for single-family properties is $1,450,700, which is 0.7 per cent higher than March 2019, and a 1.2 per cent increase compared with February 2020.

March saw 493 attached homes trade hands, which is a 51.7 per cent jump compared with the 325 sales in March 2019. The attached-home benchmark price is now pegged at $791,800, a 2.5 per cent rise from March 2019, and a 0.9 per cent uptick compared with February.

Condo transactions hit 1,179 in March 2020, a 35.1 per cent increase over the 873 sales in March 2019. The benchmark price of an apartment property now stands at $687,000, which is 2.9 per cent higher than in March 2019, and a 1.4 per cent month-over-month rise.

One question mark is whether the no-eviction rule applies retroactively to tenants in recently purchased homes, where the new owner intends to occupy the property, or whether existing eviction notices served before the announcement have been grandfathered in.

article continues below

Now, a leading real estate lawyer in Vancouver has offered clarification on this issue, following advice he received directly from the B.C. government.

Richard Bell of Bell Alliance told Glacier Media Real Estate on Monday, “Up until today [March 30], if an eviction notice has already been given to the tenants to vacate because the buyers are to take possession, that eviction still stands. However, any new home purchase contract, from today onwards, you will not be able to evict the tenant, under any section of the legislation.”

He added, “That was a big concern for us, as we [at Bell Alliance] are working on lots of purchase contracts where the notice of eviction for tenants had already been given. Those purchases can now go ahead.”

However, the eviction ban may significantly affect sales of currently tenanted homes, now that any new buyers wouldn’t be permitted to evict sitting tenants from March 30 onwards, until the ban is lifted.",[]
97,vancourier,https://www.vancourier.com/real-estate/buyers-can-t-get-out-of-home-purchase-contracts-because-of-covid-19-1.24109720,Buyers can’t get out of home purchase contracts because of COVID-19,['Joannah Connolly'],,"If you’re in the process of buying a home but have lost income due to COVID-19, don’t assume that you’ll be able to get out of your signed purchase contract, a leading real estate lawyer has warned.

Home buyers who have paid their deposit and signed a purchase contract, who may now want to get out of the purchase since the pandemic hit, do not have a standard “Force majeure” or “Act of God” clause that will let them walk away, said Richard Bell of Bell Alliance in Vancouver. Such a clause would need to have been specifically written into the purchase contract to be applicable, which is unlikely, he said.

article continues below

What’s more, if the buyer walks away from a purchase contract, even if they have lost their job and can no longer afford the home, they could be liable for much more than simply losing their deposit.

“If a buyer loses their job – well, that could happen any time,” Bell told Glacier Media Real Estate March 30. “If they can’t complete the deal, they become liable for at least the deposit. But there could be a further, knock-on liability, if the seller then resells for less than the original amount. The buyer who caused the original deal to collapse could also be liable for the difference.”

Bell added, “Then the question becomes, if the collapse of the original deal causes a series of deals in a chain to collapse, how remote is the original buyer’s liability? How many links in that chain is the buyer liable for? That’s when you get into a legal battle.”

A purchase contract can, however, be rendered void under the doctrine of “frustration” whereby the deal can’t go ahead and collapses under extraordinary circumstances, through no fault of either party. However, this requires the explicit agreement of both parties to the contract, explained Bell.

For example, a buyer may not want to go ahead with a home purchase due to lost income, and the vendor may equally not want to sell anymore because they can no longer afford to upsize, also due to lost income. Under such circumstances, the buyer and seller can come to an agreement whereby the contract is cancelled and the buyer’s deposit returned.

Cold feet a symptom of COVID-19

Vancouver realtor Kevin Skipworth of Dexter Realty is seeing a lot of nervousness among buyers who have signed purchase contracts. He told Glacier Media Real Estate March 31 that he had one buyer with cold feet because of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated concerns about the economy, but after discussion with their conveyancing lawyers, the deal finally went ahead.

“There’s really nothing in the contract that allows for a buyer to walk away from a transaction because of the virus pandemic, but that doesn’t stop anybody from trying. For us as realtors, it’s not our place to try to negotiate out of a contract, that’s where legal advice is the first place to go.

He agrees with Bell that there can be much pricier ramifications than merely a lost deposit. “Everybody seems to think you can walk away and just lose your deposit and that will be fine, but that’s not the case. Sellers can go after you for damages, and more.”

Bell said he is seeing some collapsed home purchases at his law firm, but this is not currently his key concern in terms of real estate conveyancing. He pointed to rules of social distancing and quarantining making it virtually impossible to comply with legal requirements that home buyers and mortgage consumers be present in person to sign contracts, along with their government ID.

“It’s a major roadblock to closing home purchases right now,” said Bell. “Different lenders require different things. But some are literally requiring that we go round to quarantined clients’ homes and have them show their ID to us through the window. It’s ridiculous. Hopefully it will change before long, so we can do it by video. We’re trying to get this up the chain of command.”

‘Force majeure’ in construction

One sector that may have some luck in claiming “force majeure” when failing to complete a contract due to COVID-19 is the construction industry, where sites have had to close due to the outbreak – depending on such a clause being in the contract.

Whether or not a judge under Canadian common law would grant “force majeure” varies greatly from case to case, said Sahil Shoor, a Waterloo, Ontario-based civil litigator for Gowling WLG, in a legal bulletin to the construction sector on March 20.

That is because while some contracts include “force majeure” clauses that clearly states diseases, plagues, epidemics or quarantine restrictions as applicable conditions (beyond the typical “acts of God” events such as natural disasters, fires, floods and wars), other make no such distinctions. Some other contracts yet, Shoor said, may not have a “force majeure” clause at all, further complicating the issue in court.

“In order to successfully rely on a force majeure clause, the relying party [contractor] has the burden of establishing Force Majeure Event and proving that the Force Majeure Event has effectively prevented the party from fulfilling its obligations under the construction contract,” Shoor said in the bulletin, adding the court will assess the merits of the case based on whether the COVIC-19 outbreak qualifies as a force majeure, whether the risk of not being able to complete the contract was “foreseeable and able to be mitigated,” as well was whether it was really impossible to complete the contract.

In cases where there is no clear description of an epidemic or disease as force majeure, a judge will often hinge decisions on the availability of an “alternative method of performance” – even if the alternative is significantly more expensive for the contractor applying for relief.

“As an example, are the party’s employees ill due to the virus and unable to work, or simply afraid to work and choosing not to attend?” Shoor said, adding that cases without a force majeure clause will follow similar lines of legal logic under the doctrine of frustration.

Poloz said the program will “help to restore a key source of short-term funding for businesses.”

“The intent of our decision today is two-fold: to immediately support the financial system so it keeps on providing credit, and, over the longer term, to lay the foundation for the economy’s return to normalcy,” Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz said in an opening statement to media.

Although existing variable-rate mortgage holders will enjoy additional discounts from the BoC's new rate, whether or not the cuts will be passed on to new mortgage consumers remains to be seen. Thus far, despite two previous recent rate reductions of 50 basis points each, mortgage rates for new customers have been rising, not falling.

“This is a very uncertain time for banks and lenders, just as it is for consumers,” said Alex Conconi, CEO of Lendesk. “While the normal consequence of a Bank of Canada prime rate cut is to pass that on to borrowers, at the end of the day, banks control their own prime rate and it cannot be taken for granted amid COVID-19. Moreover, until recently, it wasn’t unusual to see variable rates that were prime minus something: now that has all but evaporated, and we’re seeing prime plus a spread. The consequence is that the banks are able to shore up some margin, which may be necessary if they are to take losses in other parts of their business. Meanwhile, consumers aren’t necessarily paying any less than they would have been paying a few months ago.”

Tenant advocates are openly wondering if it even makes sense to pay rent.

In a response to the COVID-19 crisis, the March 25 announcement by the provincial government will end virtually all rental evictions – including those currently in process – freeze rental increases, and pay $500 direct to landlords to help tenants battling job and income losses over the next three months.

""This is not the time to seek rent increases and there is just zero per cent chance of that happening,"" said Premier John Horgan. “Landlords will be prevented from legally raising rents starting April 1. Increases slated to take effect on April 1 will no longer be applied.”

Despite the good intentions, many say the unprecedented program is wide open to abuse. This is apparently recognized by the provincial government whose models concede that 100 per cent of B.C.’s 500,000 renters could theoretically qualify for assistance.

The new rental supplement is in addition to federal and provincial programs announced to offer financial aid to those who lose income due to the health crisis.

Mark Goodman, a multi-family real estate specialist with Goodman Commercial Inc. Vancouver, estimates B.C.'s rental aid package could add up to more than $1 billion over the next three months, but argued it is landlords who could end up paying the most. The $500 paid directly to the landlord will not compensate for losses from the rental increase freeze, Goodman said.

This is particularly evident in Metro Vancouver, he said, where the average rent is now $2,351, according to Rentals.ca.

While the $500 payment direct to landlords is welcome, David Hutniak, CEO of LandlordBC, said that, with no potential for evictions, landlords have little protection if a tenant refuses to pay the balance owing.

“This is wide open to potential abuse,” Hutniak said. He added he hoped common decency would keep abuses in check.

“Two-thirds of landlords in Metro Vancouver are mom-and-pop situations,” Hutniak said, which includes people renting out a basement suite or a condominium to help cover the highest mortgages cost in the country. These owners are also struggling during the current crisis, Hutniak said.

According to a December 2019 survey by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp., there are 67,000 rental condos in Metro Vancouver.

Hutniak also noted a naivety in the potential of landlords qualifying for a mortgage payment deferral. Premier Horgan encouraged banks to provide this, but Hutniak doubts most landlords would qualify or could afford such a deferral.“We have heard advocates speak about landlords getting mortgage deferrals so they can 'pass those savings onto renters.' But a mortgage deferral by a bank does not constitute any savings to the landlord. It has to be paid back with compound interest on the deferred amount. In other words, interest upon interest,""Hutniak explained. Any deferred amount is added to the mortgage principal, whereas a landlord doesn’t have any security for deferred rent from a tenant, he noted, or from the loss of legal rent increases.

Angela Calla, mortgage broker with Dominion Lending Centres, said landlords are unlikely to get approved for a deferral from some mortgage lenders, even if their tenants can’t pay rent due to lost income. “Deferrals are not being approved on rentals at this time,” she said on March 25. “If/when they are, it will come with additional costs for the landlord, once determined.” However, she updated this information March 26 with the news that Scotiabank is now allowing deferrals regardless of occupancy, and other banks may follow suit.

""It is the government’s expectation that all renters, including those renters impacted by the COVID-19 crisis, who have the capacity to pay rent do the responsible thing and pay their rent,” Hutniak added.

But the Vancouver Tenants Union noted that Premier Horgan conceded he could not guarantee that any rental aid will actually be paid by April 1, when the next rent is due.

“Every person should think towards the future, see where they are going to be in a few months and decide if it makes sense to pay rent,” said Mazdak Gharibnavaz, a steering committee member of the Vancouver Tenants Union, in a March 25 interview on CiTR 101.9 FM’s station at the University of British Columbia.",[]

But with phone lines jammed, and websites unable to process applications that are assessed on a case-by-case basis, many homeowners looking for a deferral or seeking answers have had little success.

Confusion reigns over what makes a homeowner eligible for an emergency deferral, how the program works, whether interest is payable and whether deferring payments will affect credit scores. Unfortunately, with the situation changing on a daily basis, and lenders forced to make up rules as they go, it has been impossible for most people to get any information.

To clear up some of these issues, Glacier Media Real Estate spoke with five mortgage experts who offered their insights and advice on some frequently asked questions.

Would deferring my mortgage payments damage my credit score?

As long as the proper arrangements are made in advance, your credit score should not be affected. Atrina Kouroshnia, mortgage broker with Dominion Lending Centres, says, “I don't think deferring payments will have the same impact as [it did] before, as it's a global [pandemic] and, especially if your job is affected, you are making a proactive choice.”

Peter Kinch, best-selling author and award-winning mortgage broker, agrees, “I do not see a situation wherein this will have any impact on your credit score.”

The number-one most important thing? Never assume that you’ll be able to get the deferral and simply not pay your mortgage when it’s due, as this will damage your credit score. “The worst thing would be to just skip your payments,” warns Kouroshnia.

Angela Calla, also with Dominion Lending Centres, cautions, “If you miss the payment without an agreement or your lender does not approve you, it can impact your credit score and could significantly increase your cost of borrowing at renewal. Each borrower should confirm with the lender before they agree to the deferral.”

How can I get through to my lender?

For those trying to make such arrangements but having trouble getting through, Calla says it’s important to give the banks time. “Unless you have a payment due in the next five days [that you can’t pay], they ask that you delay calling at this time [due to overwhelming call volumes]. Email is preferred, or some lenders have portals they have created to assist with this. Look at your lender’s website for updates.”

Alisa Aragon, also with Dominion Lending Centres, recommends speaking first to your mortgage broker, if you have one. “Lenders are experiencing an overwhelming amount of calls and it is very hard to get through. If people have questions, it is best that they talk to their mortgage expert, as we are getting information from most lenders and we might be able to answer their questions faster.”

Should I apply, and would I be approved, for a deferral?

Once you’ve managed to get through to your lender, you’ll likely only be approved for a payment deferral if you’ve lost income due to the COVID-19 pandemic, say the brokers.

If you’re still working and can afford your mortgage, don’t attempt to get a deferral. Not only will you likely be wasting your time and that of the overstretched lenders, the program should only be used as an emergency last resort. That’s because deferring payments will cost you more money in the long term (see “How would a mortgage payment deferral work?” below).

Only those truly unable to pay their mortgage right now, due to lost income from the pandemic, should apply. “The deferral program is really for homeowners that are experiencing financial hardship due to the COVID-19 virus,” says Aragon. “If you are still employed and earning an income, then lenders will not be assisting those borrowers at this time. This program is for people that really need it.”

For those who feel they meet the requirements, it’s worth applying, and each application will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. “It also depends on the lender,” adds Aragon. “Each lender has its own requirements on what has to be provided.”

Landlords may not get approved for a deferral with some banks, even if their tenants can’t pay rent due to lost income, according to Calla. “Deferrals are not being approved on rentals at this time [March 25],” she says. “If/when they are, it will come with additional costs for the landlord, once determined.” However, Calla has an update of this information as of March 26, with the news that Scotiabank is now allowing deferrals regardless of occupancy, and other banks may follow suit.

One relief for landlords is that tenants unable to pay rent due to lost income can now apply for the new $500-a-month rent supplement, to be paid directly to their landlord via BC Housing, which was announced March 25. However, the accompanying temporary ban on evictions may mean leave landlords without options if tenants don't pay their rent at all.

If I were approved, how would a mortgage payment deferral work?

Make no mistake, a mortgage payment deferral is an emergency, temporary measure that will cost you more in the long term, caution the brokers. What’s more, the longer you defer payments, the more it will cost you, as interest will be payable at your contract rate during the deferral period, and will add up.

Kinch explains, “Your principal and interest payments do not have to be made for a period of [up to] six months. However, the banks will accrue your monthly interest payments and add that amount onto your current mortgage balance. As such, after the six-month deferral period, you will have a larger mortgage balance and your monthly payment will be adjusted accordingly to compensate. So you end up with a cash-flow break today, but you’ll have to make up for it in six months. To be clear – this is a ‘deferral’ not a ‘loan holiday’.”

Kinch’s colleague Jonathan Barlow adds, “Every lender will be different in how they manage it. Ones with deep pockets may allow for the deferral to continue until renewal, when they simply renew with the higher balance. Others may structure a repayment plan. Again, this is untrodden ground for the lenders, so they will all approach it differently.”

Calla says, “You are responsible to pay the deferral [interest] taken on the remaining payments on the term with most lenders. This is why it’s approved only for those who can’t make a payment due to not having the financial means. Everyone’s amounts per month and total interest cost will be different based on mortgage amount, rate and term remaining.”

What if my mortgage is with a monoline lender?

The Big Six Canadian banks, plus some credit unions such as Vancity, have been vocal about offering their mortgage payment deferral programs to those in need. But many Canadian homeowners have their mortgages with alternative specialist mortgage lenders, also known as monoline lenders. So are they offering the same payment deferral program?

Barlow says, “Monolines are supporting the deferral program as well, but because they are single service providers (mortgages only), their monetary base is much smaller. So they will be much more strategic about who they offer it to. They’ll certainly ask more questions, but you’ll likely get a much better plan and collaboration from them.”

“It is the inevitable next step,” said Jon Stovell, president and CEO of Reliance Properties and past chair of the Urban Development Institute.

Quebec announced the extended shutdown of the majority of construction sites as it ramped up efforts to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus. Quebec's construction unions had called for a work stoppage, saying many sites lack proper hygiene control and require working close to others.

B.C. is second only to Quebec in the number of residents infected by COVID-19.

On March 22, six days after B.C. banned large gatherings, its COVID-19 Joint Information Centre released guidelines that allow for construction to continue, provided no more than 50 workers are working in any one space at a time.

Dr. Bonnie Henry, provincial health officer, has issued a set of guidelines regarding hygiene on construction sites.

Stovell’s company has two big building projects underway, an office tower and a condominium project, and he said his contractors are “going beyond” the provincial measures to assure worker and public safety.

But he believes that all B.C. construction work, aside from infrastructure projects deemed essential, will soon be ordered to close.

A request for comment from the provincial health officer was not received by the Western Investor deadline.

Ron Rapp, CEO of the Homebuilders Association of Vancouver, sent a memo to members this week.

“I told them we have the privilege to continue to work and to make darn sure they all meet the criteria of the provincial health guidelines,” he said.

But Rapp warned that much of the private sector construction in Metro Vancouver – estimated to be worth $10 billion to the B.C. economy and employing up to 130,000 people – could be forced to close regardless of legislation.

A lack of key building supplies due to a broken trade chain, especially from Asia, and the number of people who can’t or won’t report to work is among the problems, he said. He noted that one local supplier, a fabricator, had 25 per cent of its staff test positive for COVID-19.",[]

The province’s real estate regulatory body is advising local strata councils not to hold meetings during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The call from the Real Estate Council of British Columbia (RECBC) comes on the heels of recommendations from various real estate organizations — including the BC Real Estate Association and some local real estate boards — to stop holding open houses.

""In light of the recommendations from government, and the significant health and professional risks, RECBC is advising real estate professionals to avoid open houses, in-person showings, and strata council annual general meetings at this time"" said RECBC's CEO, Erin Seeley in a press release.

""This is an extraordinary situation and we must put public health first. While we are aware that this may have a significant impact on business practices for real estate professionals and consumers, we must continue to prioritize public safety.""

RECBC has a mandate from the provincial government to protect the public by enforcing the licensing and licensee conduct requirements under the Real Estate Services Act.

Not so, according to mortgage experts. In fact, advertised interest rates for new mortgage applications have been climbing significantly over the past few days.

article continues below

In its March 19 update, mortgage comparison website RateSpy.com wrote as an example that TD Bank had just increased its advertised rates:

• three-year fixed: from 2.69 per cent to 2.89 per cent

• five-year fixed (high ratio): from 2.69 per cent to 2.79 per cent

• five-year variable: from 2.85 per cent to 2.95 per cent (no discount on the bank’s prime lending rate)

Alisa Aragon, mortgage broker with Dominion Lending Centres Mountain View, told Glacier Media in an interview March 20, “Lenders started increasing rates last Friday [March 13, the same day that the Bank of Canada made its emergency cut to the overnight interest rate]. That includes major lenders such as Scotiabank, TD, RBC. They’ve also been reducing variable-rate mortgage discounts on the prime rate, which is currently 2.95 per cent, so the discount on most variable rates is barely anything. In the future, we could see no discounts at all.”

She added, “The fixed rates are usually connected to the bond market, but because banks need liquidity right now, they’re increasing the rates.” The bond market had previously dropped in line with the central bank’s interest rate, but has also rebounded over the past couple of days.

Liquidity for the banks is a key issue for the federal government right now, which announced March 20 that it is introducing “changes will help provide stable funding and liquidity to financial institutions and mortgage lenders and support continued lending to Canadian businesses and consumers.”

This follows an announcement by the Ministry of Finance that it is launching “a $50 billion Insured Mortgage Purchase Program (IMPP)... The amendments allow mortgage lenders to pool previously uninsured mortgages into National Housing Act Mortgage-Backed Securities for CMHC to purchase these securities through the IMPP. The impact of this measure will provide financial institutions with more liquidity. This, in turn, will allow financial institutions to continue lending to businesses as well as individuals, while assisting customers who face hardship and need flexibility, on a case by case basis.”

By insuring previously uninsured mortgages, the government is essentially taking on the risk associated with those loans, freeing up banks’ balance sheets to provide more liquidity. The moves are intended to support banks while they offer such programs as six-month deferrals of mortgage payments to customers facing financial hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, Aragon said that the program would not necessarily prevent banks from raising mortgage interest rates. “It depends on the bank’s balance sheets, every bank is different,” she said. “These are unprecedented times.”

Even though rates for new mortgages are currently rising, applicants are rushing to get a mortgage on the back of news that the Bank of Canada has slashed its overnight rate.

RateSpy’s March 20 update added, “Nearly every long-time mortgage broker we’ve talked to is swamped, with some saying they’re having their highest application volume ever for a March.”

Aragon is one such busy mortgage professional. She told Glacier Media she is also fielding countless calls from people who are asking about possible mortgage deferrals, even when they haven’t lost their jobs. She added that some are hoping to stop paying their mortgages so they can use the money to invest in the stock market while it is depressed. “That’s not how you do it,” she added. “These deferral programs are really for people who are struggling financially due to the pandemic, and those customers will be required to provide proof of hardship.”

RateSpy’s March 20 update confirmed this trend, saying, “We’re hearing of cases where people are using HELOCs [home equity line of credit] to buy stocks. These are presumably (hopefully) well-qualified, risk-tolerant clients with financial safety nets. It’s definitely not a strategy for the overwhelming majority.”",[]

The board said that it was making “this explicit recommendation today with the support of real estate brokerages, and after an assessment of the latest information and commentary from public health and other government authorities.”

REBGV said that, earlier in the week, it had also “removed the rule requiring that properties listed on MLS be made available for showings.”

Ashley Smith, REBGV president said, “Realtors want to do their part to help prevent the spread of illness in our communities and to meet the housing needs of residents in a responsible way. We’ve heard from some in the community who are unhappy that their Realtors are not holding Open Houses. To those people, we ask for your understanding given the public health crisis we all face today.”

The board said that “anyone looking to buy or sell a home in today’s environment is encouraged to discuss COVID-19 preparedness with their Realtor” and offered some key tips for buyers and sellers. These include:

• If you recently travelled abroad and/or are unwell, do not view a property, and stay home.

• If you’re a seller, talk with your Realtor about alternative approaches to open houses, such as virtual showings and other technology-based solutions.

• If you’re a buyer, only visit a property when others are not present, sanitize your hands before and after a showing, and avoid touching doorknobs and other surfaces in the property.

The REBGV is also offering other tips for buyer and sellers at www.rebgv.org.

Construction must go on

Announced the same day was approval to B.C. construction companies to continue site operations, as the ban on gatherings of more than 50 people does not apply to construction sites, according to the Urban Development Institute.

The UDI said in a March 19 statement that “a senior provincial government official has contacted UDI president and CEO Anne McMullin to assure our industry and membership the 50-person limit does NOT apply to construction sites. The provincial government official confirmed that all sites can and should remain operating… Sites must continue to conform to Worksafe BC practices and current COVID-19 prevention protocols. That means additional handwashing stations should be made available, that workers should maintain their social distance of 1-2 metres from one another and during any on-site meetings.”

The UDI statement added, “In addition, the Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said during the March 17 news conference… that ‘Construction work outside is not as much of a risk that we are concerned about... but anyone who’s sick should not be going to work.’”

The Homebuilders Association of Vancouver (HAVAN) also sent out a statement March 19 offering advice to construction employers on site safety during the pandemic.

“Our staff are doing everything that they can to keep the approval processes going, including looking at our inspections, where we can conduct inspections in a manner that maintains appropriate social distancing,” he said.

“It's an evolving situation but, again, we are doing what we can to maintain the city part of the approvals process.”

Council already plans to hold a virtual meeting Thursday morning (March 19) when council will vote on the declaration of a local state of emergency, the implementation of emergency powers and amending the 2020 community service grants approvals to encompass COVID-19 response.

Stewart said the city is working to help Vancouver’s most vulnerable populations, and trying to keep the virus out of those communities.

Meanwhile, he’s calling on the province to ban evictions and help people pay rent if needed. He said the Vancouver Rent Bank has been overwhelmed with requests and the city needs provincial help.

During a press conference, Premier Horgan said these are among the many issues the province has on its plate, and government is looking at next steps, using a cross-governmental approach.

""It's not just individual renters that are concerned. Businesses who have rents to pay and no customers coming in the door are equally concerned. So we have a whole range of issues that are piling up and we're looking at what mechanisms we have to assist these individuals,"" he said at the press conference March 17.

""But I want to stress, as I did on Friday, the objective of our government is to provide services for people. That's why we're here. We do not want to come up short. I've made that clear to deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland in our daily discussions — that we all need to work on this together.""

Chandra Herbert, meanwhile, headed up the three-person rental housing task forced that criss-crossed the province in 2018 to come up with recommendations to modernize the Rental Tenancy Act.

Chandra Herbert is now reaching out to many of the same people and groups he dealt with on that file to make short-term and long-term recommendations with respect to the impact coronavirus will have on renters and rental housing.

“It's quick work in terms of short-term [recommendations] given rents come due at the end of the month. We'll have to be looking at that as an issue. We're looking at how to support renters, but also landlords — there's a number of smaller landlords [for whom] the rent cheque is often also the mortgage cheque,” he told the Courier March 17.

“Tomorrow, I understand, the federal government will be making major announcements around rents, in part. We don’t have an early preview of that, but it will inform the work.”

Chandra Herbert has already put out calls to organizations such as the B.C. Non-Profit Housing Association, the Tenant Resource and Advisory Centre and LandlordBC. Within government, he’ll be checking in with B.C. Housing, as well as Vancouver and Victoria’s rental advisory committees.

“It’s not everybody under the sun — we have to work faster than that — but I'm doing my best to get out to as many folks that have key experience in this work,” he said. “I’ve set my own deadline — as soon as possible. The sooner we can get action, the sooner people have some peace of mind, which is in short supply right now.”

Challenges are numerous as April 1 approaches and rent becomes due. Some workers have already lost jobs while others are at risk of losing them. Some residents are in quarantine or self-isolation. Landlords of smaller and larger buildings, meanwhile, as well as those who rent suites in their homes, face mortgage payments.

“[Some renters] may not be able to get rent money because they're not working or they may have been laid off — if you're a casino worker or somebody in the entertainment industry, for example — the film business,” Chandra Herbert said. “In many cases, people are one paycheque away from not being able to afford rent.”

But, he added, some relief sooner than later, depending what the federal government announces Wednesday.

“CMHC on the federal level has said they're looking at mortgage deferrals and questions like that. But really, [after] we hear what the federal cabinet is announcing tomorrow, we'll see what we, as a province, needs to do,” he added.

“They have a considerable fiscal firepower at their disposal. We'll watch them and then see what more we can do. Certainly, we've been encouraging the federal government to look at the challenge of renters, of course, the challenge with mortgage holders, people in the gig economy who might not qualify for EI, and that kind of thing.”

Under the province’s current Residential Tenancy Act, meanwhile, evictions are still possible — an issue renters’ advocates want addressed. Changes could come.

“Most folks aren't paying rent until the end of this month, so it's all on the table,” Chandra Herbert said.

Real Estate Association predicted March 17.

The tentative forecast by the BCREA admitted that “nobody knows” what will happen, but it ran a series of economic models under four scenarios.

article continues below

All four scenarios predicted home sales in the province would drop in the spring and early summer. The market would then likely rebound in the second half of the year “contingent on the outbreak resolving.” However, only one of the scenarios found that home sales in the province would recover to a point of activity higher than if there had been no pandemic, with the other three forecasting a more muted recovery (see graph above).

Although some industry pundits have suggested that the dramatic interest rate cuts in response to the crisis would fuel housing sales, the BCREA said that the suspension of the planned relaxations of the mortgage stress test would “mute the impact of falling interest rates for the BC housing market.”

The BCREA went further by saying that a national recession was possible due to the pandemic-related uncertainty, and in particular its impact on oil prices.

The authors wrote, “The additional shock to the Canadian economy due to a collapse in oil prices – itself the by-product of a price war between the world’s largest oil producers due to COVID-19 – makes the probability of a recession in Canada that much higher.”

Financial aid needed

BCREA also applauded the CMHC’s move to work with mortgage lenders to help homeowners defer payments, but said it was not enough, and that financial aid packages would be needed for households, especially renters.

The report said, “An unfortunate but unavoidable product of recessions is losses in employment and incomes, which may put some financially vulnerable families in an even more precarious position. The CMHC announced that it would be working with lenders to defer mortgage payments by up to six months if needed, which should stem potential mortgage defaults and foreclosures. However, there is still a need to address lost income for those who cannot afford to practice social distancing by staying home from work, and for those who have to make monthly rent payments and can’t take advantage of payment deferrals. For those individuals and families, cash is king. That means these households will need government cash transfers to meet their financial priorities during this time, and we hope this will be part of the yet-to-be-announced stimulus package from the Canadian government.”

James Laird, co-founder of Ratehub.ca and president of CanWise Financial mortgage brokerage, said of the CMHC’s mortgage deferment program, “Any Canadian who will be unable to make an upcoming mortgage payment should reach out to their lender before they miss the payment to discuss options and come up with a plan that works for their financial situation. The goal of lenders and CMHC is that no one will default on their mortgage as a result of COVID-19.""",[]

The federal financial regulator had previously announced that the stress test would be relaxed for insured-mortgage applicants. The new qualifying rate for insured mortgages (those with less than 20 per cent down payment) would have calculated at the weekly median five-year fixed rate from mortgage insurance applications, plus two per cent. This was intended to replace the current calculation, which is the Bank of Canada’s average posted interest rate, or the mortgage applicant’s contracted rate plus two per cent, whichever is the higher.

article continues below

However, following the Bank of Canada’s emergency interest-rate cut on March 13 of 50 basis points, the second such cut in nine days in response to COVID-19, OSFI has suspended the change indefinitely.

The new lower interest rates may have a similar effect as the planned stress test relaxation, and OSFI may be attempting not to compound the effect.

However, many mortgage lenders have not yet passed on the first of the two BoC rate cuts to their customers, and some have even increased fixed mortgage rates.

Jeremy Rudin, the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, said in a statement, “OSFI is focusing its efforts on issues in the environment that require continued vigilance. OSFI is committed to being a risk-based and agile regulator that calibrates responses that are fit for purpose.”

OSFI is also lowering the Domestic Stability Buffer requirement for domestic systemically important banks by 1.25 per cent of risk weighted assets, effective immediately, according to the Department of Finance. Such banks were supposed to see their buffer increased to 2.25 per cent, but this increase is now cancelled.

The department said is a statement, “This action will increase the lending capacity of Canada’s large banks and support the supply of credit to the economy during the period of disruption related to COVID-19. The release of the buffer will support in excess of $300 billion of additional lending capacity.”

Finance minister Bill Morneau stated, “The government is preparing a significant stimulus program, to stabilize our economy, support businesses and protect Canadians… To all Canadians, our government wants you to know that we have your back. We will take every necessary step to give you confidence.”",[]

While petitions and critics call for government intervention, industry experts say it’s a complex market issue with no easy fix. And for some, it’s about to get worse.

article continues below

“We saw half of the stratas get hit on Dec. 31, and the other half are going to get hit on April 30,” said Mike Alavi, senior property manager with Korecki Real Estate Services Inc.

The company manages 7,500 strata units across dozens of buildings in the Lower Mainland. Of the strata corporations that have recently renewed their insurance, Alavi said, around 90 per cent saw premium increases of between 50 per cent and 100 per cent.

That is well above the Insurance Bureau of Canada’s (IBC) provincial average of 35 per cent, but below some of the 300 per cent to 600 per cent increases Condominium Home Owners Association of B.C. (CHOA) executive director Tony Gioventu has heard of.

“I think what we’ve seen is a correction in the market,” Gioventu said. “It’s not like it’s exponentially incorrect, but it’s just that it’s happened all at once.”

CHOA reviewed B.C. insurance premiums dating back to the 1980s and 1990s and found that they are not far off from where they were before industry players began adjusting their rates this past year. Gioventu called it a “bit of a revelation.”

He said on a low-risk building with a good insurance history, an insurance company charges between $0.13 and $0.15 per $100 of insured property. High-risk buildings — ones that are old and poorly maintained — might cost $0.22 per $100 of property.

At that rate, insuring a high-risk property with a replacement value exceeding half a billion dollars — which exists in B.C. — might cost $1.1 million annually. In the event of a total loss, an insurer would be paying out roughly 455 times what it collected in premiums in a given year, meaning — all else equal — the insurer would have had to collect 455 years of insurance premiums to break even on the claim.

Gioventu believes market competition is partly responsible for keeping insurance premiums relatively stagnant over the past several years, despite the fact that buildings have kept aging while property values have increased and risk has grown.

The number of residential strata claims and what they cost has also risen. According to insurance broker BFL Canada, one in three stratas will submit a claim this year. Average losses now cost more than $50,000, and 54 per cent of losses claimed are worth more than $100,000.

Across the country, construction and repair costs have risen. Canadian insurers are getting squeezed by higher rates of reinsurance, which is insurance that insurers buy. Firms are often part of global companies that are dealing with more claims, more catastrophes and more risk of major catastrophic events.

In 2018, Canadian property and casualty underwriters posted their largest loss in a decade. Their return on equity also hit two per cent — the lowest level on record. The average return has fluctuated around 10.5 per cent since 1975, according to IBC.

Under pressure, a number of insurance providers exited Greater Vancouver’s residential strata insurance market last summer.

“It basically reached a tipping point last year,” said Gareth McDonnell, regional vice-president of BFL Canada’s western region.

“It’s really a case of supply and demand, and the insurers that are left standing… are now being overwhelmed with too much demand pressure.”

In soft market conditions, a broker such as BFL Canada might work regularly with a dozen insurance companies to meet the insurance needs of strata corporations in the Greater Vancouver market. If the market is stable, it may not be difficult to find insurance on relatively preferable terms from within that panel of insurers.

But the number of insurance providers willing to protect residential strata properties in the Lower Mainland has been shrinking over the last 12 to 18 months, and those left standing have become more selective with the risk they assume and how they price it.

The market has corrected, as Gioventu put it.

McDonnell said BFL Canada has reached out to more than 80 different insurance companies in Canada and abroad to fill the gaps left in the market by departing insurers.

“That replacement support has been very difficult,” McDonnell said, adding the risk that a building may not find a company willing to insure it is legitimate.

Danielle Russell, partner and vice-president with insurance broker CapriCMW, told BIV that, historically, it would take between three and six insurance companies to cover a property, with each provider assuming a slice of a property’s risk. In current market conditions, she said, that number can often be well in excess of 10.

“We’re seeing a dramatic increase in the number of insurance companies that you would need to provide insurance now, versus two years ago.”

This is one of the markers of a “hard” insurance market, which is characterized by a reduction in available insurance capacity, increased risk scrutiny, higher premiums and higher deductibles.

Markets across the country are being hit with premium increases, but McDonnell said insurers are choking on B.C.’s earthquake risk profile, which comes with higher reinsurance rates and has caused premiums in Canada’s westernmost province to rise faster.

“We have all these market forces that are coming around at the same time that the companies are reviewing their risk appetite and taking a lot closer look at their underwriting requirements,” said Rob de Pruis, IBC’s director of consumer and industry relations in Western Canada.

Across the board, industry told BIV that increases in the number and severity of claims are a major force behind the sometimes shocking jump in premiums stratas face.

Earlier this year, IBC struck a national task force to engage stakeholders across the country on the issue. After a meeting in Edmonton, the bureau released policy recommendations for addressing the affordability of strata insurance, including mandatory education for strata councils, building code amendments and a monetary cap on the amount a strata corporation can attempt to recover from an individual strata lot owner in the event of a loss.

The IBC task force is scheduled to hold a meeting in Vancouver on March 17. CHOA is one of the stakeholders participating.

Gioventu said maintaining and repairing buildings is the best way for strata councils to reduce their risk and mitigate premium increases. He urged strata corporations to complete depreciation reports, which identify building deficiencies and allow strata councils to plan for dealing with them before they create insurance issues. At present, strata corporations can waive the legal requirement to complete such a report.

Homeowners should ensure their suites are maintained too, he explained, especially in connection with water issues, damage from which could result in an owner paying the building’s deductible. That, he said, could bankrupt some people.

Additionally, he believes regulatory tweaks to balance what strata corporations and individual owners are each responsible for covering could help spread liability across more individuals and individual insurance policies, thereby lowering premiums paid by the strata as a whole.

Late last month, Kamloops-South Thompson MLA Todd Stone proposed legislative changes that would require individual owners to obtain liability insurance. His private member’s bill would also require strata corporations to receive the terms of their insurance renewal at least 30 days in advance.

According to Gioventu, stratas have been finding out the day before their insurance expires that their premiums are set to skyrocket.

“This is not a problem caused by the people of British Columbia. So there isn’t a real easy solution by the people of British Columbia.”

Gioventu added that a proposal to create a public insurer warrants some caution.

“We could go down the rabbit hole of a co-operative-style provincial insurer to discover that the insurance costs are in fact higher.”

""This unscheduled rate decision is a proactive measure taken in light of the negative shocks to Canada’s economy arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and the recent sharp drop in oil prices,"" the central bank stated. The statement added the bank’s governing council is ready to further lower rates if that is necessary ""support economic growth and keep inflation on target.”

article continues below

When questioned, Bank of Canada Stephen Poloz said even a negative interest rate is on the table but told reporters it would likely not be needed “because of our financial firepower.”

The leading rate reductions are part of a $10 billion stimulus package announced March 13 by the federal government.

The rate cut immediately reduced the BoC lending rate to 0.75 per cent, the lowest since the global financial crisis more than a decade ago.

“Those borrowers who have stuck with variable rate mortgages now look like geniuses,” said Vancouver mortgage broker Peter Kinch, “Someone who has a variable rate mortgage at minus 1 per cent would be paying a 1.95 per cent rate for a mortgage today” he said.

The rate cut will also affect the mortgage stress test, which was scheduled to be modified on April 6 to make it reactive to the average contract rate for five-year mortgage loans at big banks. The stress test had required a borrower to qualify at the posted five-year mortgage rate, plus 2 per cent, or at the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. rate of 5.19 per cent, whichever was higher.

Now, the mortgage stress test will be linked only to the current average contract rate available at federally regulated banks.

A BIV survey March 13 showed this five-year rate is in an average of 2.42 per cent, which means a homebuyer would need to qualify at 4.42 per cent, the lowest level since the mortgage stress was expanded in January 2018 to include all home buyers.

“The housing market in Vancouver is already heating up and these rate cuts will add fuel to the fire,” said Kinch, head of the Peter Kinch Mortgage Team with Diversifi Alternative Investments Ltd.

Housing sales in Metro Vancouver soared 44.9 per cent in February compared to the same month a year earlier and were up 36.9 per cent from January, according to the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver, The composite benchmark price for a home is now $1.02 million, up 2.7 per cent from six months ago.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau, appearing on live national TV March 13 with Poloz and Canada’s banking regulator Jeremy Rubin, said he would deliver a fiscal stimulus package next week that will include an additional $10 billion in new funding to the country’s two business financing agencies — the Business Development Bank of Canada and Export Development Canada. The financial aid could be expanded: Morneau said the government would “do whatever it takes.”

Kinch said rumours are rife in the mortgage and banking sectors that one measure being considered is an 18-month suspension of the mortgage stress test.",[]

The company, which has already filed a letter of intent with the City of Vancouver, is hosting a pre-application open house tonight (March 12) to seek public input about the proposal. The 25.4-acre property sits between Cambie and Heather streets and 57th and 59th avenues.

article continues below

Onni’s preliminary proposal envisions adding just over 254,000 square feet of rental density to the site. Two currently approved strata buildings in parcels C and E of the site, would be converted to rental buildings, with 25 per cent of the units reserved for moderate income households. The height of the two buildings wouldn’t change.

“The application further proposes shifting the 254,000 square feet of what currently would be ‘market condo density’ to other buildings across the site at a later date, in various phases of the project. This shift would result in multiple buildings throughout the site to increase in modest levels of height, generally three to five storeys,” explained Duncan Wlodarczak, Onni Group chief of staff, in an email to the Courier.

“We approached the city staff, mayor, and council with the idea for this application as while there was no rental housing included in the original policy statement, we are well aware of the city’s desire and need to increase the stock of market rental housing, and in particular units that are at the moderate income level.”

Onni Group believes there’s capacity for additional density given the site's size and proximity to transit.

“We wanted to explore the opportunity as way to work in partnership with the city to tackle housing affordability and diversity within the rental stock,” Wlodarczak added.

Last July, council debated, and approved, staff recommendations to consider extra density, geared toward moderate income households, on the Pearson Dogwood and the Oakridge Transit Centre sites, as well as other major project sites on a case-by-case basis.

A staff report to council at the time noted that the Housing Vancouver Strategy to create 20,000 new secured market rental units over 10 years, with 14,500 designated for households with incomes between $30,000 and $80,000, was not being met — only 33 per cent of the annual target after two years was reached.

“Increasing the supply of rental housing, particularly moderate income-targeted rental housing, is a top priority for the implementation of the city’s housing strategy,” Neil Hrushowy, assistant director of community planning, wrote in the July 23, 2019, report.

“The development industry has demonstrated significant interest in building moderate income rental housing when paired with incentives to achieve project viability. Together with the recent slowdown in strata condominium sales, this interest provides an important opportunity to address this priority.”

If Onni Group ends up submitting rezoning application for extra density, a city-led open house will be scheduled as part of the process, which would also include a staff review and public hearing.

Meanwhile, the first phase of the Pearson Dogwood development — Parcel A — is well under construction.

There were 5,741 residential unit sales were recorded by B.C.’s MLS last month, which is an increase of 26.3 per cent from February 2019

article continues below

Added to that, the average MLS sale price in B.C. last month was $758,863, a 12 per cent increase from one year previously.

However, all that improvement is in comparison to the weak activity seen in early 2019, and merely brings the provincial real estate market back to normal levels.

“Housing markets in BC continued to trend near long-term average levels in February,” said Brendon Ogmundson, BCREA’s chief economist. “Recent declines in mortgage rates and favourable changes to mortgage qualifying rules may provide a boost to home sales heading into the spring, although there is significant economic uncertainty lingering over the outlook.”

With total B.C. MLS home listings down 8.3 per cent year over year, and sales increasing, the ratio of sales-to-active residential listings across B.C. rose to 20.3 per cent. It is considered a seller’s market only when the ratio is above 20 per cent for several months, so the market is still considered balanced at this point.

As ever, the picture changes dramatically when looking at individual real estate markets, with some recovering more than others, and some struggling.

Greater Vancouver saw the biggest sales increase (but not the biggest price rises), while the small markets of Northern Lights and Powell River both saw fewer sales than in February last year. Of the larger markets, only B.C. Northern reported a decline in transactions compared with its active market of one year ago.

Average sale prices rose on an annual basis in every B.C. market except Powell River, which is small enough to see wild percentage changes in sales and prices, and therefore does not indicate a trend. Of the larger markets, the highest average annual price rise was in the Fraser Valley, up 9.4 per cent, followed by Okanagan Mainline and Vancouver Island.

A reverse mortgage is a mechanism for those who have paid off their mortgages to tap into their home’s equity, receiving a monthly or lump-sum payment. It is popular among retirees as it allows them to stay in their home while giving them an income. It is usually only payable upon sale of the home, or death, which means that it is paid off before the rest of the estate is passed to the beneficiaries.

The latest OSFI data shows that there was $4.01 billion in reverse mortgage debt in December 2019, up 0.69 per cent from November 2019, according to Better Dwelling.

This is a 13 per cent increase from one year previously and the first time in Canadian history that reverse mortgage debt has topped $4 billion.

Often the concern is simply how long the process takes, whether it’s for a small restaurant renovation or a brand new purpose-built rental apartment building.

article continues below

Complaints also relate to confusing or incomprehensible planning or building department requirements, such as the need for an arborist’s report on boulevard trees when the proposal is to build a laneway house at the rear of the property.

An architect once complained that the city was requiring an expensive parking elevator to improve accessibility in a very small stacked-townhouse development, when each home could only be accessed by a flight of stairs.

Recently, I had a call from an architect upset about the fire and safety implications of a regulation disallowing a door from a single-family home basement, if its floor elevation was more than four feet below the outside grade.

When I participated with the 2012 Mayor’s Task Force on Affordable Housing, chaired by then-Mayor Gregor Robertson and former Liberal MLA Olga Ilich, I heard so many complaints about how conflicting departmental requirements were adding to housing costs, I recommended the appointment of an Affordability Ombudsman to adjudicate these situations.

Sadly, the city’s website containing my report, and many other excellent reports prepared for the Task Force, has disappeared. However, a brochure which includes many worthwhile recommendations, some of which are now being implemented, can be found HERE.

My previous columns regarding the regulatory process have usually complained about the additional costs resulting from unnecessary “red tape,” a term dating back to the 17th century describing bureaucratic rules and regulations that result in unnecessary paperwork and delays.

However, this column is going to be different since I recently discovered the city has embarked on a comprehensive regulatory review to address the many complaints it hears from professionals, industry associations and the broader public.

Titled “Regulation Redesign: simplifying rules for city building,” its aim is to identify when zoning and building rules and regulations are unnecessarily confusing, in conflict with one another, or needing modification or possibly elimination.

The city wants to simplify and clarify its land use regulations and policies to improve ease of use and reduce permit processing times.

It also wants to modernize its wide array of applicable documents since many were first drafted decades ago. Subsequent revisions and modifications have just added to the confusion.

The city expects the outcomes of this “Regulation Redesign” to be an updated zoning and development bylaw with a more user-friendly format, along with more consistent regulations and greater clarity on the purpose of various land use documents.

Last month, I attended a “Regulatory Redesign” open house at city hall led by Marco D’Agostini, a seasoned and respected city planner, at which staff described the work being undertaken.

I heard about the open house from a company that installs retractable glass systems on balconies and is seeking a better understanding of the city’s differing regulations related to balcony enclosures.

Given the many complaints I have heard over the years about the city’s procedures, I expected the open house to be packed. But it wasn’t. In fact, at one point I was the only person there.

I checked to see what media coverage had been given to this much needed and worthwhile initiative, only to discover that despite the city’s substantial communications department, there was virtually no media coverage.

I was subsequently told the city has been working with professional and industry associations to disseminate information about the project and the consultation opportunities. Members of these organizations sit on an external advisory committee.

A project webpage with information and a sign up for people who want to receive project updates is also available HERE.

While design professionals and builders who regularly deal with city hall have much to contribute to this review, I would urge home and business owners and other organizations who have had unfortunate experiences with the city’s regulatory process to also get involved.

Hopefully your contributions will lead to reduced frustration, lower costs and faster approval times, along with fewer complaints from Courier readers in the future.

Vast majority of older homeowners want to stay in their home,['Joannah Connolly'],,"Downsizing – often referred to these days as “rightsizing” – may be considered a trend among older Canadian homeowners, but perhaps not if you actually ask them.

A new survey found that 86 per cent of older, urban, adult homeowners said they would like to live in their current family home as long as possible.

The Aging in Place report, from polling firm Mustel Group and real estate brokerage Sotheby’s International Realty Canada, also found that this dream is not realistic for everybody. More than one third (36 per cent) of respondents said they are likely to sell their current home and move to a new residence within their lifetime.

Of those respondents planning to sell their home, 76 per cent expect they will reinvest in the real estate market by buying a replacement primary residence. More than half (54 per cent) of those with plans to move to a new primary home expect to choose a condo.

With so many homeowners hoping to stay in their homes as they age, the survey also asked them about their needs for aging in place.

It found that less than half of respondents (46 per cent) said they had considered their needs in terms of aging in place, when buying their current primary home. Of those who had, the report said, “45 per cent considered safety as a key priority in their chosen neighbourhood, while features supporting single-level living factored the most heavily in their home selection. Condominium owners most commonly prioritized having an elevator, indoor fitness and wellness amenities and security services.”

Don Kottick, president and CEO, Sotheby’s International Realty Canada, said, “Our research reinforces the fact that this generation will continue be a dominating influence in our country’s key markets, and that government, the real estate industry and individual homeowners will need to contend with increasing pressure to make homes, neighbourhoods and cities age-friendly for current and future generations of older people.”

The Aging in Place report is the first in a multi-part series focused on baby boomers and older adults, and is based a survey of 1,764 homeowners ages 54 years and above in Metro Vancouver, Greater Calgary, Greater Toronto and Greater Montreal.

Josh O’Neill, general manager of Mustel Group, said, “This is one of the first studies in Canada to focus on the housing aspirations, expectations and realities of the baby boomer generation, as well as those who are older, with findings based on homeowners already invested in the housing market. Results from the survey reflect the latest trends within one of the country’s most influential demographic cohorts.”",[]
120,vancourier,https://www.vancourier.com/news/inside-an-airbnb-bait-and-switch-1.24092962,Inside an Airbnb bait-and-switch,['Brandon Barrett'],,"Sarah was relieved to move with her family to their new home in Brio. After living next to one of those typical Whistler flophouses packed to the rafters with seasonal renters, she was eager to get away from the loud late-night parties and piles of trash left outside. Little did she know then just how much of a nightmare her neighbours would eventually turn out to be.

""It was wrecking our home life,"" said Sarah, whose name Pique has agreed to change. ""They were listing it [on Airbnb] as a four-bedroom house and they would have upwards of 12, sometimes 15, 20 people using it as a party house every weekend.""

article continues below

Sarah wasn't alone in her frustrations.

Since the spring of 2017, dozens of complaints have poured into the municipal bylaw department about the property, not just for the noise and mess, but because the rotating cast of people streaming through the house every weekend seemed to indicate it was being rented illegally on Airbnb. The property owner, initially unaware of the rental scam, was ultimately fined multiple times, totalling $2,500.

As it turned out, that was just the tip of the iceberg.

Tourist hubs across the globe have had to wrestle with the proliferation of short-term rental platforms such as Airbnb — and Whistler is no exception. Years into its own affordable housing shortage, local legislators have had to tighten regulations on illegal nightly rentals. That, of course, has not stopped the practice from running rampant. Currently, hundreds of dwellings in the resort are listed on Airbnb, despite only a handful of neighbourhoods being zoned for it.

Through conversations with the property owner, neighbours, nightly renters, and dozens of pages of bylaw documents and photographs obtained through a Freedom of Information request, Pique offers a rare look inside one of these illegal nightly rentals, as well as the ""bait-and-switch"" scam one of the property's tenants used to allegedly con one woman out of more than $3,000.

Barriers to enforcement

Over the span of just a few months in the spring and summer of 2017, Whistler's Bylaw Services collected reams of evidence against the Panorama Ridge property, including screenshots of the alleged Airbnb listing and numerous photos showing the home's driveway jammed with cars, garbage and cigarette butts littering the grass, a black bear on the deck rummaging through discarded food, and even a naked man firing up an outdoor grill.

A screenshot of the purported Airbnb listing from that period advertised the residential-zoned property as ""The Family ModLodge,"" available for $900 a night.

""Luxurious, bright and modern cabin with all the comforts of home,"" read the listing, which was posted by an Airbnb user with the profile name ""Shawn."" When contacted by Pique, the Vancouver-based homeowner, Shawn Pozer, denied ever renting the property illegally.

""That was not me,"" he said, adding that it was his tenants who listed the home on Airbnb without his knowledge.

""I thought I had long-term renters in there before,"" he added. ""We've maintained that we've tried to follow the bylaws to a T from Day 1, and we have long-term renters in there now.""

Although the home was on the RMOW's radar, initially at least, bylaw officers' hands were tied, despite the clear evidence it was being advertised on Airbnb.

Until a new tourist accommodation bylaw was adopted in July 2017, there was no policy against advertising nightly rentals in a residential zone. Once the new regulation went into effect, the RMOW no longer needed proof that rental activity was taking place, and could enforce against ""illegal marketing"" of a property.

In an Aug. 1, 2017 email to one of the neighbours who had filed a complaint, a bylaw officer said the listing had been deactivated and they expected ""no future nightly rentals from this residence.""

That could not have been further from the truth.

Ghost listing

On March 29, 2018, a Brio resident emailed Bylaw Services to urge them to reopen the file on the property, believing it was once again being rented illegally.

""The renting has been going on for the past few months. This week's current renters today confirmed they are renting the property,"" the neighbour wrote. The responding bylaw officer replied that the home had been brought into compliance the previous summer and allegations of illegal nightly rentals since then had been determined to be unfounded.

Things appeared to cool off over the following year, and neighbours were heartened to learn that a local couple, Liyna Boucher and her partner, had moved into the property in the spring of 2019.

But all was not as it seemed. ""When we met the couple, who we thought was a couple, we were really excited because the owners... said they had rented it for a year to a family. We thought, 'Great, a family in a family neighbourhood,'"" Sarah said. ""Then we learned they weren't a family. That was just a front, and they were doing the same thing... renting it on Airbnb.""

An exasperated Pozer confirmed the couple moved in in May 2019, and he later learned they had listed the home on Airbnb on weekends without his knowledge, even employing a common rental scam known as ""ghost listing,"" which involved the tenant advertising a different, more luxurious home only for a guest to arrive and discover it was not what they paid for.

According to one email sent to Bylaw Services in July 2019, a woman said her daughter-in-law booked the Brio property only to realize upon arrival that it ""looked nothing like the pictures posted on Air B&B [sic] and the address was different than the one she had been told."" The email also claimed that an individual, whose name is blacked out in the bylaw records, told the woman's daughter-in-law that ""she was waiting for changes to zoning in order to rent the home and that in the meantime, she requested that we tell the neighbours that we were friends staying with her"" in order to avoid undue attention from authorities.

This aligns with a notice posted inside the property, a photograph of which was included in Bylaw Service's evidence, urging guests to ""respect the premises and your neighbours,"" and to specifically watch out for a particular neighbour ""of primary concern."" The notice also informed guests that any bylaw fines incurred during their stay would be their responsibility to cover and would result in an additional $1,000 charge per night.

Rebecca, whose name Pique has agreed to change, was another one of the unfortunate few who thought she was booking a spacious, modern cabin for her family's trip to Whistler last summer only to find it was not as advertised.

""I booked a place on Airbnb, this beautiful 4,000-square-foot log cabin,"" she said when reached by phone. ""We showed up and it was that [place] on Panorama Ridge. We were like, 'Is this the right place?'""

Rebecca's ordeal started months before arriving in the resort. On first contacting the Airbnb ""host,"" Boucher — one of the tenants at the Panorama Ridge home — Rebecca was told the house had already been rented. Boucher then allegedly offered a discounted rate if Rebecca wanted to re-book at a future date. When Rebecca contacted Boucher two months later, it was suggested that to ""save some money, we can do [a deal] on the side,"" outside of Airbnb.

Rebecca gave her credit card details to Boucher, who, according to a screenshot obtained by Pique, charged her $3,079.70. The charge was listed under ""I.E. Natural Spa Care Whistler BC."" A LinkedIn profile listed to Boucher names her as the director of spa operations at inspirEarth Natural Spa Care, based in Whistler.

Furious to find the place she thought she booked bore no resemblance to the home in Brio, Rebecca posted about the apparent scam to the popular Whistler Summer Facebook group.

In a screenshot of a text from the same number Pique reached Boucher at, she told Rebecca the whole thing could be chalked up to ""a sincere accident."" Boucher goes on to write that she was trying to arrange a refund, but the money was ""not immediately available"" because of the unexpected expense of Rebecca ""choosing to be dissatisfied with the home and leave."" Boucher also claimed that the cleaning costs — for a property that was never actually occupied — came out to almost $1,000.

Boucher then complained of Rebecca's ""public online harassment, degradation of character and hate speech against me,"" and claimed she would refund the balance if Rebecca removed the Facebook post and agreed not to pursue the issue further. She still has yet to get the money back.

Pozer, the property's owner, said it was only through the five fines he was issued over the course of a nine-week span last summer that he learned the property was being rented again illegally on a nightly basis.

He evicted the couple last fall.

Explaining why it took so long to evict the tenants after receiving multiple fines, Pozer said it was because ""the bylaw people are incredibly incommunicative and very slow in letting you know what's going on, [they] hid behind the Freedom of Information Act and would not release any details of what was going on... I had no information on which to terminate the lease, even though I was asking them.""

Asked for clarity, a municipal spokesperson emailed that: ""A property owner would not receive details about who made the complaint or certain specific details of the investigation. That is information they would need to submit a [Freedom of Information request] for. If they choose to go through the Bylaw adjudication process, they would receive an evidence package from the RMOW as part of the adjudication process.""

Ultimately, it is the responsibility of the property owner to ensure that their tenants are complying with all the applicable local bylaws, something that provincial adjudicator Tajda Mitha with the Residential Tenancy Branch agreed with in an October ruling over Pozer's dispute of an earlier bylaw fine. Mitha was ""satisfied that there is compelling and convincing evidence"" to show that the property was being operated illegally as a tourist accommodation business. In his dispute, Pozer said that the lessees had agreed in writing to cover the cost of the fines. To that, Mitha wrote that Pozer is responsible for any ""unauthorized activities"" on the property, but that he might have a claim for indemnity against his lessees. When reached by phone in December, Boucher confirmed she had rented from Pozer, but wouldn't explicitly say whether she listed the property illegally on Airbnb.

""A lot of homes rented on Airbnb have dual purposes, providing long-term rental for Whistler residents and also helping offset the costs of high rent,"" she said before hanging up.

Playing catch-up

On Jan. 31, two longstanding issues for the City of Toronto — housing and gun violence — converged in a downtown condo, which doubled as a popular weekend party rental on Airbnb, when three young men were killed in a late-night shooting.

The tragedy prompted a quick response from Airbnb, which announced it would begin testing new regulations across Canada to ban local guests under the age of 25 from booking entire homes, an effort to curb so-called ""ghost hotels.""

This followed another shooting that killed five at an Orinda, Calif. Airbnb rental during a Halloween party.

After that mass shooting, as well as an extensive Vice Media investigation last fall that uncovered a U.S.-wide scam run by a prolific grifter (or grifters) exploiting the platform's loosely written rules and enforcement, Airbnb vowed to institute a series of major changes in an effort to regain users' trust. Chief amongst them is a year-long effort the company has committed to that would involve verifying each of the seven million properties listed on Airbnb, part of a dawning realization that ""we have to take more responsibility for stuff on our platform,"" according to CEO and co-founder Brian Chesky, speaking at the DealBook conference in November.

Chesky suggested Airbnb would start asking more specific questions to guests upon checkout, putting the onus on renters to help verify what happens on the platform. While it remains to be seen exactly what it will look like, Airbnb told Vice that the worldwide verification will use a combination of ""Agent reviews and algorithmic screening of the listing contents, pictures, etc., guest verifications of specific feature of a listing, in-person inspections, and virtual walk-throughs.""

If a guest checks into a listing that doesn't meet Airbnb's accuracy standards, Chesky said, they will either be rebooked into a similar listing or receive a full refund.

Matt Hick, CEO of B.C.-based vacation rental service alluraDirect, which boasts more than 270 legitimate Whistler properties for rent, believes verifying the accuracy of a rental property would be easy enough — but he wants Airbnb to go a step further.

""I don't believe they're going to do it, but they could do it, which is verifying the zoning of the property and then verifying if it actually has a legitimate business licence in place,"" he explained.

""So you put the onus back on the company to verify that the business licence is legitimate and that the zoning is correct. We have enough information. As rental companies, we have the full address of the unit, we know who is saying they own the unit. We can check with the RMOW if [a property owner] has a licence in place. We already do this.""

Following the Jan. 31 shooting in Toronto, Airbnb said it would also establish a 24/7 neighbourhood support hotline to connect residents with ""rapid response agents"" to deal with any concerns.

Hick said the effectiveness of such a hotline would depend on how it was set up.

""If the hotline is simply a phone number that phones someone in India or something, and their job is to figure out how to stop the party, really, what they're going to do is call the property host on file, and if they can get ahold of them, then great. Then they're just going to pass the buck to the owner,"" he said. ""But if they can't get ahold of the owner, what's the next step? The next step would obviously be contacting security or police. How are they going to scale that? How are they going to know every security company in every location? It's logistically impossible.""

The added challenge will come when owners have set up their rental property exclusively for the purpose of hosting parties.

""It's next to impossible when the property owners themselves know what's happening,"" Hick said. ""When the properties are set up that way, with cheap furniture, a high damage deposit and they list it at a really high rate, they know what's happening. So how do you curb that?""

Asked how Airbnb's year-long verification process might impact Whistler, Mayor Jack Crompton said it was a step in the right direction. ""It should mean less fraud, and a better overall guest experience,"" he said. ""I don't expect Airbnb's verification will significantly change Whistler's enforcement strategy. If anything the adjustment creates greater alignment between Airbnb and Whistler's tourist accommodation.""

The mayor also believes measures the RMOW has put in place to crack down on properties in neighbourhoods not zoned for nightly rentals is beginning to catch up with the technology.

""It's improving,"" he said. ""A lot of the tools that were in place five years ago were built for a pre-digital era. Much of the work we're doing now is to modernize the tools we have to enforce existing bylaws. The bylaws themselves carry a lot of value when met with a modernized enforcement tool.""

At press time, there were roughly 1,700 Whistler properties listed on Airbnb, and 1,000 or so on VRBO.

The open house was for Domus Homes’ proposal to construct an 81-unit, four-storey rental building on a site at Granville Street and West 32nd Avenue in Shaughnessy.

article continues below

The wording Scott de Lange Boom found offensive is on the “Site & Neighbourhood Context” display board under a section about arterial roads. It notes that the Arbutus Ridge/Kerrisdale/Shaughnessy (ARKS) Community Vision encourages multifamily housing along arterials in locations that meet certain criteria, including: “Shield, to some extent, single family homes from the noise of arterial traffic as the new housing types and their landscaping act as a buffer.”

De Lange Boom, a member of Abundant Housing Vancouver who is supportive of the rezoning application, attended the open house and called the context statement “bad” on social media, saying: “City policy explicitly views renters as a human shield for single family home owners.”

The context statement is bad. City policy explicitly views renters as a human shield for single family home owners pic.twitter.com/JAV5rlPYeG — Scott de Lange Boom 🌐 (@Scott_dLB) March 6, 2020

He told the Courier Friday he didn’t want the issues he has around phrasing “to take away from the fact that I really do support rental properties to be built in Shaughnessy and across the city,” but he objects to the “shield” reference and the fact rental and condo buildings have mostly been limited to arterials.

(Regulation changes are currently in the works to help implement new city policy in areas not already covered by community plans or where community plans are underway. It would allow consideration of rezoning applications for rental buildings in specified transition zones 150 metres off some arterials, and within walking distance — 400 metres — from schools, shopping, parks and transit. There has been mixed reaction to the plans, with pro-housing activists such as de Lange Boom arguing the plans are not aggressive enough. Read more HERE).

“[I’m] concerned that the least affordable type of housing — single-family detached and duplex — is all that is legally allowed to be built in approximately 75 per cent of the city, which is a major contributor to the housing affordability crisis,” de Lange Boom said.

While the display boards were produced by the applicant, de Lange Boom blames the City of Vancouver for what he considers anti-renter and anti-condo owner policies.

“The developer was not tactful in how they phrased their open house material. However they [are] merely describing what is the city's implicit policy, and therefore the majority of the responsibility lies with the city,” de Lange Boom said.

He noted that on page 40 of ARKS’ community vision, approved by council in 2005 under then mayor Larry Campbell, uses almost the same language. It states that “vision participants identified arterials as a location for other housing types to be located on or near.”

“This location would,” among other things, “shield, to some extent, adjacent single family homes from the noise of arterial traffic as the new housing types (with good construction practices like double-glazed windows) and their landscaping act as a buffer.”

De Lange Boom also pointed out Domus Homes' rezoning application was submitted under the city’s Affordable Housing Interim Choices Rezoning Policy, which wouldn’t have allowed the project off an arterial road.

He said he's tired of renters and condo owners being treated as second-class citizens.

“Under city policy, new developments get concentrated on arterial roads where [it is] noisier [and] there's more car pollution from both exhaust and brake dust that has negative health impacts for people who can't afford to buy a single-family home. It's bad for people's health, for the environment and on equity grounds as well,” he said.

“I think the city's figured it’s politically easier to throw renters under the bus on this one rather than deal with neighbours who dislike new housing in their neighbourhoods.”

He added that policies limiting where rental and condo buildings are constructed also put pressure on small businesses on arterials, which have to take the brunt of redevelopment. Aside from being at risk of being knocked down to make way for new buildings, they also have to cover property taxes for the highest and best use of a site.

De Lange Boom would like city policies to encourage what’s been created in the West End, where low-rise commercial buildings are on the main roads that front major streets such as Robson Street and most of the housing is set back from the main roads.

“That allows it to be a lot quieter, takes the pressure off of the businesses there. It creates a much better neighbourhood that has better quality of life when all of the renters, all the new condo owners, aren’t pushed on to the noisy polluted roads.”

Until three months ago, de Lange Boom was living on an arterial road — in an apartment on East Eighth, facing Broadway.

He said traffic noise was a problem, particularly in summer months when motorcycles “would roar down Broadway.”

“I lost a fair bit of sleep and quality of life was definitely impacted. Since moving to an older apartment, built in 1959, away from Broadway, my quality of life has noticeably improved and it is much easier to sleep. There is a real human toll from the current arterial-focused policy.”

Richard Wittstock of Domus Homes said the open house display board was provided as a summary of the policy context and the language is what was written in the ARKS community vision.

“We know the neighbourhood well and we recognize its significance, and we have not taken lightly the responsibility to develop sensitively on this site. The arterials do have the advantage of better access to transit and they minimize traffic impact on the single family areas,” he wrote in a statement to the Courier.

“The presence of the lane behind the arterial also provides a significant and logical separation from the single family homes to the east. This siting and location of the project, along with a robust tree/hedge retention and landscaping program has enabled the development to have virtually no shadowing or overlook impact on neighbouring properties.”

REACTION

This is not the way to respect people who can’t afford a single family home in one of the most expensive places to live in the world. Vancouver’s Mayor and Council should demand a change in this kind of language and approach. 👇👇. #vanpoli https://t.co/1NHtuRJMh7 — Mark Marissen (@marissenmark) March 6, 2020

As identified on the rezoning application page and printed materials - these are APPLICANT Boards, not City boards (or policy).

The cost of catastrophes, construction, claims and reinsurance has pushed insurance premiums on many British Columbia strata corporations, or condo owner groups, through the roof.

article continues below

The concern for individual owners is not having their own suite insurance to handle unforeseen crises, said association executive director Tony Gioventu.

If something from a suite causes damage to common property, the suite owner would be responsible for the deductible of the corporation, he said.

Korecki Real Estate Services Inc. manages 7,500 strata units in dozens of Lower Mainland buildings. Of the strata corporations that have recently renewed their insurance, around 90% saw premium increases of 50-100%, Korecki property manager Mike Alavi said. “We saw half of the stratas get hit on December 31, and the other half are going to get hit on April 30,” Alavi said.

Those jumps are above the Insurance Bureau of Canada’s provincial average of 35%, but below some of the jaw-dropping 300-600% increases Gioventu has heard of.

And, with building insurance rates soaring, so are deductibles, payments an individual could find themselves responsible for.

“Those deductibles are no longer $25,000,” Gioventu said. Instead, an owner could face a bill ranging from $100,000 to $750,000.

A problem, Gioventu said, is many people no longer face the condition of insurance for a mortgage once the latter is paid off. And some don’t reinsure, leaving themselves vulnerable.

Moreover, some don’t maintain their suites, leaving themselves open to huge bills if something goes wrong.

“I am amazed at the number of people who don’t purchase homeowner insurance when they live in condos,” Gioventu said.

He cited an issue of people hanging clothes from fire sprinkler heads.

“These types of claims can easily reach $1 million,” he said.

“You could lose your home.”

Gioventu also stressed the need for strata corporations – especially those in aging structures - to be proactive in maintaining their buildings. Neglect is a recipe for incurring a claim that will make reinsurance harder and more costly, he said.

He said some stratas have received insurance notices with massive increases the day before they are due.

“We have stratas that are in a real crisis,” he said.

Gioventu stressed the importance of depreciation reports that can point a strata corporation toward future problems that should be planned for. But, he said, the provincial government has allowed corporations to opt out of such reports, leaving inspections neglected and planning not done.

“The object is to make sure properties are being maintained or repaired,” he said. “They are restricted by what the owners won’t pay for funding.”

Part of that, he explained, is that strata councils need to remember “ they are a board of directors of a company and [they should] behave like that.”

And, that would make getting insurance harder as claims rise.

“The strata is going to end up paying the cost,” he said. “It could potentially end up bankrupting a community.”

Gioventu said the government has a role in mitigating the problems condo owners face.

One plan might be for government to amend legislation to allow stratas to negotiate insurance fee charges.

This is the first time that the Bank of Canada has cut its overnight target rate by 50 points in a single move since the 2008 economic recession.

article continues below

The Bank of Canada said in a statement, “Before the outbreak, the global economy was showing signs of stabilizing. While Canada’s economy has been operating close to potential with inflation on target, the COVID-19 virus is a material negative shock to the Canadian and global outlooks, and monetary and fiscal authorities are responding.”

Phil Soper, CEO of national real estate brokerage Royal LePage, said, “Today the Bank of Canada joined other central banks in cutting its target interest rate, an appropriate step that it believes will mitigate the damage caused by the coronavirus. This new health scare has impacted families in many countries around the world and in the process has introduced new risks to our economies. While Canadians have been largely spared the full brunt of this health crisis to-date, the global community is coming together to address this international challenge.”

Brett House, vice-president and deputy chief economist at Scotiabank, who predicted today’s rate cut, said, “The scope and scale of the novel coronavirus epidemic are both now much greater than the Bank of Canada anticipated in January.”

Mortgage rate reductions

The move will likely prompt home financing lenders to cut their variable-rate mortgages by a corresponding amount – although, as James Laird, co-founder of RateHub.ca and president of mortgage brokerage CanWise Financial, stated, “there have been times when lenders have not passed along the full savings to their customers.”

RateHub.ca said that, if receiving the full 50-point cut, a mortgage holder with a variable rate of 2.6 per cent and a monthly payment of $2,102 would see their rate decreased to 2.1 per cent and their monthly payment reduced to $1,987. This means the homeowner would save $115 per month, or $1,380 per year on their mortgage payments, compared with what they were paying before the rate cut.

Fixed-rate mortgages, which approximately 80 per cent of Canadian homeowners hold, will not be immediately affected. However, as Laird added, “The bank’s stance will cause bond yields to continue to decrease, which means Canadians shopping for a fixed-rate mortgage can expect rates to fall and will likely approach the record lows of 2016. Anyone shopping for a home should check rates frequently as they will continue to decrease through the spring.”

More buying power

Cuts in variable rate mortgages, and predicted cuts in fixed rates, will give home buyers more buying power, but only in the short term. This effect, combined with the easing of the mortgage stress test qualification level coming into play April 6, could create greater demand for housing, at a time when there is already increasing demand in many markets. In turn, this could push up home prices, eventually cancelling out the increased buying power initially created by the lower interest rates.

Laird said, “The home buying process will become even more difficult as the low rates will increase buying power and bring more demand into the already hot market.""

Soper added, “I have previously spoken to the paradox that interest rate cuts, made in response to economic weakness, can bolster housing markets. Many of our major cities are enduring structurally persistent housing shortages. This excess of demand for housing compared to the supply of homes available, be it for rent or for purchase, puts constant and often unhealthy upward pressure on prices… These moves will be welcomed in markets that are struggling with inconsistent growth, such as in Calgary or St.John’s, and potentially spurn uncomfortably high home-price inflation in our hottest markets.”",[]

Vasant Pragjibhai Patel had his mutual fund licence terminated by WFG Securities Inc. in January 2018, but the industry’s regulator is planning to explore allegations he violated policies by moonlighting for a Langley condo investment led by infamous developer Mark Chandler, who is now in a U.S. jail awaiting criminal fraud charges.

article continues below

After becoming a registered dealer in April 2016, Patel is alleged to have not told his employer about recommending real estate investments to prospective purchasers of the Murrayville House condo development. In 2015, Chandler retained Patel for accounting services. It’s alleged by the MFDA that Patel never informed WFG of his involvement with Chandler and Chandler’s group of companies known as Newmark Group.

The MFDA asserts Patel obtained $425,000 in commission for the unreported financial transactions related to real estate investment recommendations that resulted in $4.3 million going to Chandler, who is alleged to have pre-sold units multiple times and not put deposits in a trust. Subsequently, a receiver was appointed to the development, and it was determined Chandler had secured 149 purchasers for 91 units and was unable to account for $12.2 million paid to his development company, according to MFDA’s hearing notice. Chandler and his company 0981478 Ltd. still face a notice of hearing from the Office of the Superintendent of Real Estate (OSRE), although he is now in a California jail after being extradited last year on fraud charges related to other real estate transactions.

The MFDA alleges Patel lied to its investigators about what he knew about Chandler’s intentions for the money, such as contradicting statements he made to the OSRE.

In September 2017, the OSRE issued a cease marketing order against Chandler’s company. The order cited Patel as a key player in the marketing scheme.

“Mr. Patel stated he facilitated many of the deals that resulted in the 24 agreements and collected a finder’s fee either directly or through 1074936 B.C. Ltd.,” the OSRE order states, referring to a law firm’s claim that 24 units sold to its clients had actually been double or triple sold.

Patel admitted to the OSRE that he personally purchased one unit for $160,000 but was told by Chandler the market price was $280,000. “Mr. Patel then told others about the development.”

It is not stated who Patel sold Murrayville House to nor what his relationship was to the investors. However, the MFDA claims none of Patel’s investors were clients of WFG Securities. The MFDA noted Patel also worked as an accountant for an excavation company, which was approved work by WFG Securities. Patel was also a licensed insurance agent at the time.

According to databases for the Chartered Professional Accountants and the Insurance Council of B.C. — both self regulating bodies — Patel is presently a standing member of only the former.

CPABC communications manager Vivian Tse acknowledged that the organization is aware of Patel’s MFDA notice of hearing and “will monitor its outcome.”

Like the CPABC, the insurance council did not acknowledge whether Patel’s regulatory proceedings have prompted its own investigation, despite the well-publicized allegations. When asked if former members can face discipline, communications manager Melinda Lau said by email, “The Insurance Council does have the legislated authority to conduct investigations of former licensees and has previously issued discipline orders under those circumstances.”

An OSRE hearing that outlines alleged contraventions of the Real Estate Development Marketing Act by Chandler’s company, remains pending and the allegations contained within the notice remain unproven. No one involved in the Murrayville House condo marketing scheme has been criminally charged in Canada, but Chandler and his companies face several civil proceedings.

Some scorned buyers, whose contracts were nullified, told Business in Vancouver in 2018 that their experience is evidence that the B.C. government needs to step in with strict guidelines for developers conducting pre-sales and to issue fines when developers break rules and sell units multiple times and pocket deposits without putting them in trust.

What exasperated buyer Elyse Vroom, for instance, is that Chandler had been in receivership before yet escaped being banned from developing further.

His Chandler Homer Street Ventures Ltd. spiralled into receivership in early 2008 after the BC Supreme Court, in 2007, separately froze $35 million of Chandler’s assets after investors alleged he misrepresented real estate deals and forged a multimillion-dollar mortgage document.

125,vancourier,https://www.vancourier.com/real-estate/are-small-windowless-rooms-acceptable-as-bedrooms-1.24089179,"Are small, windowless rooms acceptable as bedrooms?","[""Naoibh O'Connor""]",,"At 6’3"" tall, Green Party Coun. Michael Wiebe admitted, at a recent public hearing, he was “struggling” with the design of some of the three-bedroom apartments planned for a rental building on the last block of East Hastings near Boundary Road.

The third bedrooms in some of the suites will be small “inboard” rooms.

article continues below

Also known as “borrowed light” bedrooms, they’re internal rooms with no exterior wall or windows.

Usually, inboard bedrooms use sliding glass partition walls or clerestory windows — a row of windows above eye level — to provide access to daylight via rooms that have an external wall with windows.

Typically, they haven’t been allowed as part of secured rental projects in Vancouver, although there have been past examples in other types of projects within the city, as well as in other municipalities such as New Westminster.

Now, a handful will be produced in buildings approved under the city's Moderate Income Rental Housing Pilot Program (MIRHPP), which requires 20 per cent of the residential floor space in such buildings to be reserved for households with incomes between $30,000 and $80,000. Relaxations in unit sizes and configurations are among concessions offered to developers through the pilot program, the goal of which is to ensure some affordability, as well as some family-size suites, are built into the projects.

Wiebe said he would barely be able to “fit crossways in either direction” in such a small bedroom, and he prefers rooms with access to fresh air. Nevertheless, he voted in favour of the rezoning application for the East Hastings building, as well as for an application for a similar building by the same developer — PCI Developments — planned for the same block.

In total, the pair of 14-storey East Hastings Street buildings, which were approved under MIRHPP, will produce 212 rental apartments, 43 of which will be for households earning less than $80,000. Five of those 43 apartments will be three-bedroom suites — the third rooms being inboard bedrooms. The smallest will measure approximately 8’1” by 8’2” while others are larger. Three-bedroom moderate-income units will rent for about $2,000 a month.

In a follow-up interview after the public hearing, Wiebe explained to the Courier why he isn’t sold on inboard bedrooms.

“We need to ensure that everyone feels valued when they get their space, and that we try to ensure that there's not different standards for different classes, and that moving forward we find techniques and architecture that allow us to continue to have the mix that we're going for, which is the family-unit mix,” he said.

“We're trying to create a more family-friendly city and the liveability in the suites doesn't really meet the kind of threshold that we're hoping to have for the city. So I'm supportive, obviously, of the affordable projects, the MIRHPP projects, [but], moving forward, I hope we find architectural ways to eliminate the need for inboarding to meet those affordability targets.”

That shrinking feeling

Finding a family-sized, three-bedroom apartment that’s relatively affordable to rent is a daunting, if not impossible, task in Vancouver.

Only about one per cent of the total purpose-built rental stock in the city are homes with three or more bedrooms, according to the City of Vancouver.

While city policy requires that rental projects undergoing rezoning, including MIRHPP ones, include a minimum of 35 per cent family-size units, defined as those with two or more bedrooms, it doesn’t require a minimum proportion be three bedrooms or larger.

“Delivering a significant number of them in new projects is particularly challenging, especially in non-corner units, and more so at deeply below-market rates,” the city’s communication department told the Courier.

Given that affordable three-bedroom units are in short supply and many families want them, the city decided to consider inboard bedrooms for moderate-income units in MIRHPP buildings “to help address the design and economic challenges of delivering these much-needed larger family-size units.” If the suite is sprinklered, which is current code for all new buildings, an egress window is not required. This applies to all multi-family dwellings, including single family homes with basement suites.

But like Wiebe, COPE Coun. Jean Swanson, who voted against the East Hastings buildings for myriad reasons, questions the livability of inboard bedrooms. She’s especially worried about standards dropping for lower-income people.

“Eight feet by eight feet with no window is more like a closet than a bedroom. Kids and adults need space to play and keep their stuff and do their work,” she said.

Even Green Party Coun. Adriane Carr, a fan of MIRHPP because it’s finally creating apartments that middle-income earners can afford, spoke against inboard bedrooms despite voting in favour of the East Hastings Street buildings.

“I will not be speaking in support of the inboard bedrooms. I’m not really a fan of [them]. I like fresh air and light and direct light into people’s rooms,” she said.

NPA Coun. Melissa De Genova countered her council colleagues’ concerns, arguing testing inboard bedrooms through the pilot program is an added benefit.

Renters, she said, are already turning closets or pantries into bedrooms for their children, so inboard bedrooms are an improvement.

Onboard with inboards

DeGenova is not alone in her defense of the inclusion of inboard bedrooms. Developers see them as a viable way to create family-sized homes.

Take Bryn Davidson who runs Lanefab, a company that builds laneway homes. He said developers have long argued that it would be much easier and cheaper to provide three-bedroom units if inboard bedrooms were allowed.

“On the surface, it seems reasonable to insist on windows in bedrooms, but in practice it means you have to have buildings that have much more articulated exteriors (and are therefore more expensive, space consuming, and a bit less energy efficient to build),” he told the Courier in an email.

“I'm guessing they were allowed in the MIRHPP program to keep costs down and get more housing onto limited land.”

Davidson added that in newer buildings fresh air can be provided through a ventilation system and light can come in through an interior window, so developers and builders don't have to rely on windows for air or light as they did in the past.

Like De Genova, he said many families are already using windowless dens or cold, enclosed balconies as extra bedrooms.

“These are both allowed by the city, but both are substandard relative to inboard bedrooms... so I think the city is being overly uptight in limiting the use of inboards,” he said.

Many loft-style condos, Davidson added, including his, have inboard bedrooms. His own child’s room has curtains on two sides.

While many in the architecture and planning community may support a ban on inboards, he’s of the opinion that the city should try everything during a housing crisis.

“I think there are some fears about tenements etc. that are holdovers from the old days... or fears that it's somehow just a giveaway to developers... but I'm of the general opinion that all housing options should be on the table,” Davidson said. “When it comes to micro-suites or inboard bedrooms, if there end up being problems, then we can always course correct, but we shouldn't shut down housing options pre-emptively.”

Tim Grant, vice-president of development for PCI Developments, said the average size of market and moderate income bedrooms in the two East Hastings Street buildings will be 9’9” x 9’10” for master bedrooms, 9’0” x 9’7” for second bedrooms, and 8’2” x 8’1” for third bedrooms.

The measurements, he said, are consistent with PCI’s recently completed, and fully occupied, market rental building at 388 Kaslo St. developed under the City of Vancouver's secured market rental housing policy.

“The inboard bedrooms are directly adjacent to the living rooms where they have access to shared light, and we have designed them to include internal windows or glazed sliding doors. All bedrooms, including inboard bedrooms, are mechanically ventilated and the size of these bedrooms is consistent with other market rental projects in the area,” he explained in an email.

“Our design team has included suite layouts for all units across both projects, which highlight that all inboard bedrooms can accommodate single, double or queen beds with bedside tables.”

The East Hastings Street projects are just two of the handful of buildings council has so far approved under MIRHPP.

In January, council greenlit a five-storey rental building planned for Stainsbury Avenue near Trout Lake. It will feature five moderate income units with inboard bedrooms. One will measure 8’ by 9’, while the other four will be about 9’ by 12’5” in size.

A third MIRHPP project at Larch and West Second Avenue, which was approved late last year, will include one three-bedroom moderate-income unit with an inboard bedroom measuring roughly 8’3” by 8’3”.

Developer Richard Wittstock of Domus Homes maintains allowing inboard bedrooms is a good way to enable more affordable family-sized suites.

Wittstock also has personal experience with small spaces. When his daughter was a newborn, her room was a five-by-eight walk-in closet.

“I think we need a range of unit types and styles to serve families that need to be housed. I don’t have any issue in principle with inboard bedrooms,” he told the Courier.

""Typically you try to make them feel like funky flexible loft spaces with sliding glass panel doors. The glass panel doors help to get natural light into the bedrooms. But often people like these precisely because they don’t have an outside window... they prefer the dark and quiet for sleeping.”

Wittstock said he’s built hundreds of units with inboard bedrooms in Gastown and Mount Pleasant in the past and, most recently, in New Westminster.

“They sold and rent like hotcakes — people really like them if they’re done right.”

The whole thing was fantastically farcical, if not depressing, and serves as a cautionary tale for would-be renters swimming in a seemingly shark-infested pool, all looking for the same elusive meal.

article continues below

In this case, the meal is an impossibly sweet deal on a brand new apartment in Olympic Village.

The shark-infested pool represents scammers and swindlers looking to capitalize on Vancouver’s white-hot rental market that hasn’t gone above a one per cent vacancy rate since last year.

But first, the backstory.

‘Always on the lookout’

I live near Granville and Broadway in a decent one-bedroom apartment that’s changed ownership and building managers every year since 2014.



It’s to the point that I don’t even know who owns my building, which is your standard four-storey walk-up built in 1965.



To put the yearly flipping ritual in perspective, the property I live at was assessed at $12.1 million in 2017. In 2016, that number was $9.2 million.



The building is being renovated en masse and renovictions have already happened to at least six tenants.



My rent is north of $1,400 for about 650 square feet in a sweet area of town that’s centrally located and close to my work.



It’s not affordable, nor sustainable, but it serves what I need for now.



I know my number will get called soon in the ongoing renoviction process, so I’m always on the lookout for a new place to live.

‘Probably too good to be true’



Which brings us to early October, when my cousin sent me a Craigslist ad.



His email said “probably too good to be true, but worth a try.”



And so I tried, sent an email asking for specifics and the following came back:



“The rent for the whole apartment is $1,175/month utilities included (heat, hydro, water, electricity, maintenance fees, two parking spots, laundry in-suite, washer and dryer also included, cable and internet). In case repairs are need in the apartment, the building management will help you and I will cover the costs. Pets are allowed.”

This screenshot captures snippets of a two-week correspondence between Courier reporter John Kurucz and a would-be Craislist scammer.



Holy jumping Jehoshaphat! This, for a brand new suite, in a brand new building in Olympic Village that’s walking distance to work.



As it turned out, the suite was supposedly purchased by a young couple who was promised 10 years’ worth of work in Canada, but that contract went south and they had to head east — back home to England of all places to work in chemical engineering.



Things smelled fishy right away. I typed the couples’ names into Google, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn and nothing came up.



I slept on the initial response and got back to them two days later with a bit of info about myself: where I work, how long I’ve worked as a journalist and if I needed furnishings. No banking or financial information was exchanged. All they knew about me personally was that I moved to Vancouver in 2003 and my place of employment.



By this time (three days later), the ad had been flagged and removed from Craigslist. I asked why and it was at this point that things completely went off the rails. They didn’t need to meet me in person, the place was mine sight unseen and the damage deposit was only $125. I couldn’t see the place in advance, but I’d get the keys once I’d paid my first months’ rent.



Uh huh.

This screenshot captures snippets of a two-week correspondence between Courier reporter John Kurucz and a would-be Craislist scammer.

Not only that, all transactions would be handled through the vacation website TripAdvisor.com. All I needed to do was provide all of my personal information, banking information and the first month’s rent.



Smelling the bullshit piling up, I decided to play along and asked the following questions: why would you give me your place without meeting me, why is a travel site in charge of transactions and why is the damage deposit far less than half of the rent?



“TripAdvisor has great services and they are really professional. I can access the funds just after TripAdvisor have [sic] your final answer about the transaction. If u refuse to keep the apt you will receive a full refund from them...”

This screenshot captures snippets of a two-week correspondence between Courier reporter John Kurucz and a would-be Craislist scammer.

My final bit of correspondence happened on Oct. 15, when I asked for assurances that the whole thing wasn’t a scam.



I received no response.

‘Eight different red flags’

Reading through the emails after the fact, it’s evident that the tone changes, as does the “landlord’s” grasp of the English language.



So, I turned all of the correspondence over to the Vancouver Police Department, the Better Business Bureau (BBB) and to TripAdvisor as well.



“We tell people all the time if it’s too good to be true, it’s too good to be true,” is what VPD Const. Jason Doucette told me.



Ditto for Jeanette Jackson with the BBB, who noticed eight different red flags within 10 minutes of looking over the correspondence.



“Why are they telling you about their career in a rental ad? Their style of writing in the two emails is completely different,” Jackson said. “The question about ‘Let me know if you have the funds available’ would never be asked by a potential landlord.”



Before someone from TripAdvisor got back to me for this story, a quick Google search yielded answers on the company’s FAQ webpage. The same scenarios and queries have been posed since 2015, and the same answer is offered each time: this is a scam.



TripAdvisor spokesperson Molly Burke emphasized the fact that the company never sells or advertises rental homes on classified sites.



“If you come into contact with a homeowner claiming to be affiliated with TripAdvisor and the conversation was initiated on a site other than TripAdvisor (or one of our subsidiary sites: HouseTrip, Niumba, FlipKey, Holiday Lettings or Vacation Home Rentals), cease communication,” Burke said.



Jackson said the BBB is alerted to these types of scam all the time, though they peak when student housing fluctuates in the spring and fall.



Had I, or someone else, been duped here and took the matter to police, the VPD would have likely pursued fraud charges, among others.



“We encourage anyone who feels they’ve been a victim of a crime or has information about a crime to make a report with their local police,” Doucette concluded. “With something as simple as this, this is too good to be true. It’s like those CRA scams — you just know, don’t do it. The number one thing is, don’t send any money.”



Be forewarned, fellow renters.

Priced at $58 million, the Point Grey home of philanthropists Joe and Rosalie Segal at 4743 Belmont Ave is currently the most expensive home on listings portal REW, and it’s easy to see why.

Built in 1992, the estate, which spans 21,977 square feet, is the result of the collaboration between the owners and Ernest Collins Architect Ltd. According to agents at Sotheby's International Realty Canada, the home’s design process was more than five years in the making and every material, every placement and each appointment throughout the home was carefully chosen to create its opulent feel.

Stepping through the home’s solid oak cathedral doors and into the grand hallway, with streaming natural light, art, and soaring ceilings would make anyone feel like royalty. The hallway’s striking French Ormolu chandelier and grand piano, which has been played by world-class musicians, sets the tone for the rest of the property.

The five-bedroom, 12-bathroom home boasts a traditional European interior with gold ornate trimmings, arched doorways, chandeliers and marble countertops and floors.

The three-storey mansion, as expected, has all the extras, including an elevator (because who likes stairs), a gym, indoor pool, hot tub, library, wine cellar and three fire places.

And, of course, stunning water and North Shore mountain views. Not to mention, sprawling manicured gardens and a stone waterfall feature to top it all off.

The property's most recent BC Assessment value, as of July 2019, was $32,771,000, down from $37,274,000 in 2018 and $42,952,000 in 2018.

The home was marketed privately by Sotheby's in 2017 for $63 million, and recently came onto the MLS at the slightly reduced price of $58 million.

If you are curious, with a 20 per cent down payment of $11,600,000, the luxurious property would cost $212,626 a month on a 25-year loan.

The 16th annual Demographia International Housing Affordability Survey looked at 92 major housing markets around the world, and ranked them based on middle-income housing affordability. It covered 309 metropolitan housing markets in eight countries including: Australia, Canada, China [Hong Kong only], Ireland, New Zealand, Singapore, the United Kingdom and the United States.

The survey determined the middle-income housing affordability ranking by using the “median multiple” — the median house price divided by the median household income.

The study notes that Hong Kong is the least affordable housing market, with a median multiple of 20.8. Last year, the densely populated metropolis had a median multiple of 20.9.

Following Hong Kong, Vancouver is the second least affordable major housing market, with a median multiple of 11.9.

Sydney ranks third least affordable at 11.0, followed by Melbourne at 9.5 and Los Angeles at 9.0. Toronto and Auckland are tied for sixth least affordable at a median multiple of 8.6.

San Jose has a Median Multiple of 8.5 and San Francisco 8.4. London (Greater London Authority) has a Median Multiple of 8.2, which made it the 10th least affordable major market.

Top five least affordable major housing markets:

Hong Kong Vancouver Sydney Melbourne Los Angeles

The report’s authors noted that ""because eligibility for housing subsidies is based on the inability to afford market rate housing, higher house prices increase the cost of subsidized housing programs and increase the number of households that are eligible."" They propose that the most effective way to reduce the shortage of subsidized housing is to improve middle-income housing affordability.

The study also highlights how the ""middle class is under threat."" As a result, adult children aren't likely to have higher incomes than their parents, at least in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland and elsewhere.

Many predicted that sales in 2019 would rebound after a soft 2018. And they were partially right, although it ended up happening too late in the year for the full-year total to be described as a recovery.

So what are the various real estate industry organizations and brokerages predicting for B.C.’s residential sales and prices in the coming year?

article continues below

We compiled this summary of some of the key 2020 forecasts, and took our best stab at a general consensus.

Sales activity

Prone to bullishness about the B.C. housing market by nature, the B.C. Real Estate Association (BCREA) predicts that MLS residential sales across the province will increase 10.9 per cent to 85,500 units in 2020, which would take the annual total to just below the 10-year annual average of 85,800 units. However, it’s worth noting that BCREA’s forecast a year ago that sales would rise 5.2 per cent in 2019 did not come to pass.

What’s also worth bearing in mind is that BCREA’s predicted sales increase is for all of B.C. and flattens out the widely varying predictions across different regions. Most of the recovery in activity is forecast to be driven by rising sales in Greater Vancouver and the Fraser Valley, where the markets were hit hardest by the recent slowdown. Greater Vancouver residential transactions are predicted to increase by 18.2 per cent in 2020, compared with 2019, and Fraser Valley sales are forecast to go up 12.4 per cent next year. In comparison, Victoria’s resale transactions are expected to rise a more modest four per cent in 2020.

Central 1 Credit Union, which tends to forecast with more measured caution, is surprisingly even more optimistic about B.C. home sales in 2020. It predicts that the higher demand seen in the market this summer and fall will mean home sales across the province will rise 12.9 per cent in 2020 — a generous upward revision from its previous forecast of 8.8 per cent.

Brokerage Royal LePage agrees that this demand, particularly in the Greater Vancouver market, will be sustained in 2020. “Sales have picked up significantly this fall and there is momentum in our market. Buyers who took a ‘wait and see’ approach over the past 18 months are returning to the market looking to buy, confident that price drops have levelled off and may start to escalate,” said Randy Ryalls, managing broker of Royal LePage Sterling Realty, in the brokerage’s 2020 forecast.

Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. (CMHC) makes the vote for considerably higher Greater Vancouver sales in 2020 unanimous. The federal housing agency, which breaks down its forecast by census metropolitan area rather than province, predicts that Vancouver CMA will likely recover the home sales lost in 2019 and return, in 2020, to approximately the “normalized” levels of activity seen in 2018. Victoria CMA will see sales level off in 2020 and 2021, said CMHC.

General consensus: The forecast is pretty much unwavering among the various pundits. B.C.’s housing market activity will strengthen on the whole, but most of the recovery will be in the Lower Mainland, where the market had previously been hardest hit.

Home price changes

In another show of bullishness, Central 1 Credit Union is confident that B.C.’s median sale price across the whole year will break new records in 2020, and again in 2021. After the downward blip seen in 2019, in which the median full-year price is expected to have fallen 2.4 per cent to $522,000, the credit union is forecasting a rise of 3.8 per cent to a new all-time provincial record of $542,000 in 2020.

BCREA predicted a similar whole-province average price rise, at 3.6 per cent in 2020. However, it seems the larger increase in predicted sales in the Lower Mainland doesn’t translate to larger increases in predicted home prices. According to BCREA, Greater Vancouver and the Fraser Valley are both expected to see an average MLS sale price rise of just one per cent in 2020. The association’s highest forecast for an average sale price increase is in the B.C. Northern region, where prices are expected to jump 8.1 per cent in 2020.

RoyalLePage mirrored this forecast for Greater Vancouver. It said in its most recent outlook: “In Greater Vancouver, house price appreciation is expected to stabilize in 2020 after declining in 2019. The aggregate price of a home in the region is forecast to rise 1.5 per cent to $1,125,200. Overall, British Columbia’s outlook is positive.”

RoyalLePage’s Ryalls added, “The concern for potential buyers may be that prices will escalate quickly but they should also be concerned that they won’t get the same selection of listings or time to look around. It varies between neighbourhoods, but areas such as East Vancouver are a seller’s market.”

Re/Max didn’t offer a whole-province prediction, but its area-focused forecast was something of an outlier, pegging Vancouver East and Vancouver West as seeing considerably higher price growth next year, at eight per cent and four per cent respectively. It said that Kelowna would see the province’s least amount of price growth, with prices flat to 2019, while Victoria would see a three per cent price uptick.

CMHC thinks that any Vancouver-area price growth will remain muted, but its forecast range predicts that a slight rise is more likely than a slight decline. Victoria’s home prices in 2020 are likely to remain flat with 2019 before rising slightly in 2021, according to the federal housing agency.

General consensus: This one is slightly more varied than the sales forecast, but it averages out to a sense of cautious optimism. Which is to say that B.C.’s average home prices will likely rise a few per cent next year, but Greater Vancouver and Victoria’s price trends will lag somewhat, with modest-to-zero increases and probably no loss of value.",[]
130,vancourier,https://www.vancourier.com/real-estate/technology-trends-reframe-building-design-1.23973072,Technology trends reframe building design,['Hayley Woodin'],,"Virtual reality, artificial intelligence and big data are reframing the operations of an industry often thought of as a technological laggard.

Those technologies are also fundamentally changing how buildings are designed.

article continues below

“Technology is just looming there as the big game-changer,” said David Thom, president of IBI Group, which ranks second on Business in Vancouver’s list of Biggest Architecture Firms in Metro Vancouver.

For many of the firms on the list, technology has changed the way they work. It’s changed their historical business models, their relationships with clients and the traditionally sequential and siloed process of designing and developing buildings.

It has also unlocked the ability to create more complex structures more efficiently, with new building materials and greater precision.

“It’s a data business,” Thom said. “How are these buildings designed? They’re designed by inputting data, not lines on a paper.”

Omicron Architecture Engineering Construction Ltd., for example, integrated data from four different continents into its building information model for the multimillion-dollar Molson Coors Canada Inc. brewery in Chilliwack.

“That’s something we didn’t do five years ago or 10 years ago,” said Omicron CEO Bill Tucker. “The capability and the tools just weren’t there.”

The adoption of parametric modelling allows firms to crunch large amounts of data and compute realistic and incredibly detailed plans in minutes.

“Instead of somebody slaving away, testing different things and you get three out of one week, you’re getting 300 in two minutes,” said Veronica Gillies, managing principal of Western Canada architecture at HDR, the oldest firm on BIV’s list by more than 40 years.

On a $1.5 billion hospital project, HDR can model a plan right down to the level of a single screw. Gillies said that prevents the need for revisions when mechanical engineering and architectural specifications clash, for example.

Virtual reality — and virtual robots

Thom said IBI Group has pioneered the use of robotics in clash detection. The first generation of its tools had virtual robots roaming through the digital twins of to-be-built buildings around the clock to detect clashes. The next generation uses artificial intelligence to determine the best design solution where a clash is detected.

According to Tucker, using virtual reality (VR) and other immersive technologies helps provide clients with a clearer sense of a space than do two-dimensional drawings or miniature renderings. Clients want to see — and now can see — their finished building, down to the tile, before shovels break any ground.

“That’s the most cost-effective time to make changes or tweaks,” said Tucker. “I believe it’s going to be one of the most important tools we have delivering buildings in the future.”

At IBI Group, which has 2,600 employees across the globe, VR allows the firm to assign tasks to the best people for the job, regardless of geography. They can collaborate and work on a model at the same time, in real time. Clients can also use the technology to train staff within a virtual-reality hospital, for example.

Technology and real estate

Technology — and the companies developing it — is also shaping the work of local architecture firms indirectly. Vancouver, as a city of small commercial tenancies — 3,000 to 5,000 square feet — has been supplanted by demand from technology and co-working companies looking for floor plates of between 12,000 and 15,000 square feet or more.

“One of the things that I’m going to find interesting is with all of the tech and co-working space, and the brain gain that we’re going to be getting, is, where are all these people going to live? Where’s the housing?” said Mark Whitehead, a second-generation partner at Musson Cattell Mackey Partnership (MCM), which did work on The Post building in downtown Vancouver, which will house Amazon.

Whitehead said MCM — which has grown to 110 employees from 25, mostly in the past five years — has had clients asking about multi-use campus developments that house employees where they work.

“We always knew that eventually there would be a critical mass here, and I think that is having a big impact on our commercial sector,” said Patrick Cotter, managing partner of ZGF Architects Inc.’s Vancouver office.

He explained that complexity and convergence capture how the industry is being transformed. “We’re now starting to see less distinct building typology,” Cotter said, adding that regional, national and international influences — and the needs and experiences of American technology giants – are increasingly shaping architectural design in Vancouver.

Innovation in timber

Mass timber construction has also generated excitement and opportunity in the industry.

“It feels like the market’s taken a little while to get over that mass timber hump, and it feels like it’s over the hump now,” said Ray Wolfe, partner in Thinkspace Architecture Planning Interior Design, one of only two firms on BIV’s list not based in Vancouver proper.

Thinkspace is designing the four-storey mass timber Robert G. Kuhn Building for Trinity Western University’s school of business.

After completing a six-storey mass timber hotel in Penticton, HDR is now looking at designing a 12-storey mass timber structure.

The cost premium concerns have disappeared, Wolfe said. The challenge is availability.

Net-zero-ready construction is also a dominant trend.

“B.C. needs to catch up, and I’m glad we are,” said Wolfe, who added that Thinkspace is wrapping up a net-zero-ready study for a school in the Lower Mainland.

“We’re not talking LEED [Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design] anymore. We’re talking passive house and beyond,” said Gillies, pointing out that environment-related policies are increasingly mandated and not simply voluntary.

Challenges ahead

As the industry adapts to emerging trends on multiple fronts, interviews with firms on BIV’s top-20 list highlight the need for talent, and the challenges some firms face in acquiring talent for a much more digital and data-driven time.

The cost structure, for some firms, also hasn’t changed, even though expectations around the use of new — and expensive — technologies have.

Despite some challenges, there is excitement in the industry, as new technologies are unlocking opportunities with the power to shape how communities are designed.

For example, Thom said IBI Group has a team working on codifying happiness.

“All the things that make you happy — what’s its connection to the physical environment? And it’s really interesting,” he said. “When I get the answer to that one, I think we’ll really be in the money.”

Ten of 20 rezoning applications allowed under the pilot program have been filed, the latest for 445 Kingsway and 2935 St. George Street, which sits across from Mount Saint Joseph Hospital.

Acton Ostry Architects submitted the proposal for that site. It envisions a mixed-use development with two 14-storey buildings.

The plan is for 215 secured rental units, with 20 per cent of the residential floor area reserved for moderate income households earning between $30,000 and $80,000, which is a requirement of the pilot program. Commercial space would be at grade level.

The City of Vancouver announced the MIRHPP in April of 2018 to create more affordable rental housing for Vancouver workers. Only 20 applications are allowed through the program and it’s fully subscribed. The 10 that have reached the rezoning application stage include:

The remaining 10 proposals are working their way through the pre-application process. The City of Vancouver expects more applications will be filed in coming months, but it’s unlikely all of them will be submitted before the end of the year. Timing depends, in part, on applicants’ decisions to move forward with the rezoning process.

After the city announced the program, it received more than 50 MIRHPP applications and selected 20 to move forward. Six of those 20 applications — 30 per cent — withdrew.

There is no guarantee there will end up being 20 completed projects, although the city still has a waitlist.

The 10 proposals at the rezoning application stage account for approximately 1,162 total rental units, with approximately 235 of those as moderate income rental units. Final unit numbers will be confirmed at rezoning approval.

The city anticipates the first MIRHPP project rezoning reports will go to council for referral to public hearing this fall.

Some proposals have proved controversial, including buildings envisioned for 3600 East Hastings, 3680 East Hastings and 2538 Birch St.

The rezoning application for 445 Kingsway and 2935 St. George St., meanwhile, includes a summary of reaction from a pre-application open house that was held in May. About 3,500 invitations to the open house were distributed but only 35 people attended the event, with 22 comment forms filled out. Of those 22 forms, 16 voiced support for the project, two voiced concerns and four comments were neutral.

The next open house about the rezoning application for 445 Kingsway and 2935 St. George St runs from 5 to 8 p.m. at Glad Tidings Church Sept 19. City staff and the applicant team will be at the event.

The notion of establishing a framework to commercialize cannabis began as a promise by the Liberal Party in the 2015 federal election campaign that led to Justin Trudeau becoming prime minister. The implementation of the policy was not as smooth as first envisioned, and the provincial governments were put in charge of setting guidelines for the sale and consumption of marijuana.

article continues below

Research Co. and Glacier Media have been tracking perceptions about legalization every six months in British Columbia. Our latest survey shows that agreement with the new rules remains high across the entire province, that some residents are starting to ponder a future when other drugs could be treated in the same fashion as cannabis, and that – in stark contrast with what we found last year – marijuana users in British Columbia are starting to acquire all of their product through licensed retailers.

As more time passes, British Columbians appear happier with the decision to end prohibition. Seven in 10 of the province’s residents (70%) agree with marijuana being legal in Canada, while 26% disagree and 3% are undecided.

These findings represent a seven-point increase since a similar survey conducted in October 2019, as legal cannabis approached its first anniversary. The groups that are more likely to voice satisfaction with the new status quo are men (75%), British Columbians aged 35 to 54 (76%) and residents of northern B.C. (80%).

In recent weeks, we have seen more talk about creating a safe supply for drugs that are currently available only through illegal means. The impact of these discussions has led to a shift in the views of British Columbians about legalizing all drugs. It must be completely acknowledged that sizable majorities of the province’s residents continue to oppose a move to place any controlled substance inside a store, but the proponents of this option have grown since late last year.

At least two-thirds of British Columbians are opposed to legalizing ecstasy (66%), powder cocaine (70%), heroin (72%), crack cocaine (73%), methamphetamine or “crystal meth” (74%) and fentanyl (75%).

Support for making some of these drugs available in a fashion that would conceivably meet the same guidelines that govern cannabis has risen over the past six months, to 25% for cocaine (up from 18%) and to 24% for heroin (up from 19%). While these are still low proportions, the fluctuation could signal the start of a trend.

Just 10% of British Columbians say they only consumed marijuana after it became legal. Identical proportions of residents tried it before October 2018 (45%) or have never consumed it in Canada (also 45%). The incidence of “legal-only” marijuana users is highest among residents aged 18 to 34 (18%) and those who live in southern B.C. (19%).

But perhaps the biggest surprise, and a source of satisfaction for policy makers, is the way in which cannabis is being sought by users. Just over half of British Columbians who have consumed marijuana since legalization (51%) say that all of their product was acquired at a licensed retailer. In October 2019, only 31% of cannabis consumers in the province were getting all of their product at a licensed retailer.

We still see 16% of British Columbians who say none of their marijuana has been bought at a licensed retailer – a proportion that climbs to 25% among those aged 55 and over. Two-thirds of cannabis consumers aged 35 to 54 (68%) are buying all of their product at a licensed retailer.

Even though the delivery of cannabis products has improved over the past six months, there are significant regional differences that are indubitably related to the presence of stores in specific areas of the province. Cannabis consumers who reside in southern B.C. and Metro Vancouver are the most likely to be getting all of their product from licensed retailers (63% and 62%). The numbers are significantly lower in Vancouver Island (29%), northern B.C. (24%) and the Fraser Valley (19%).

Finally, the issue of “drug testing” remains a priority for British Columbians, with 61% saying that companies in the province should “definitely” or “probably” be able to administer these examinations to any employee now that marijuana is legal.

After a bumpy start that featured slow store openings and hitches with delivery options, there are signs that cannabis legalization is starting to work in a better fashion. More consumers are getting all of their product through licensed retailers, and the number of “new users” has not increased dramatically. Still, the significant regional disparities suggest that more marijuana outlets will need to be authorized in order to effectively eliminate the black market.

Mario Canseco is president of Research Co.

Results are based on an online study conducted from July 10 to July 12, 2020, among 800 adult British Columbians. The data has been statistically weighted according to Canadian census figures for age, gender and region in British Columbia. The margin of error, which measures sample variability, is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.",[]

Police announced late Tuesday afternoon that two Vancouver residents, 26-year-old Thomas Joseph Brown and 31-year-old Desirae Lorell Cardinal, have been arrested and are facing charges in Monday’s early morning shooting at the Grand Union Hotel on West Hastings Street. A 50-year-old Vancouver man was rushed to hospital with serious injuries.

article continues below

Both are charged with unlawfully discharging a firearm and possessing a firearm contrary to an order. Brown is also facing a charge of possessing a firearm contrary to an order.

Monday’s shooting was one of three that took place in the city’s Downtown Eastside over the course of 15 hours.

The first two shootings happened on Sunday within two hours of one another — one just before 4 p.m., near East Hastings Street and Dunlevy Avenue and the second around 6 p.m. in the area of East Pender and Abbott streets — followed by Monday’s incident at 6:30 a.m.

“The investigations into the three shootings this past weekend remain very active and identifying those involved has been a departmental priority,” VPD media relations officer Sgt. Aaron Roed said in a press release. “Although Crown Counsel has approved charges in Monday’s shooting, we believe there were others involved in these three incidents. It’s very important we hear from anyone with information about these shootings.”

Vancouver police Deputy Chief Howard Chow told reporters Monday that the shootings are the result of a gang turf war taking root in the Downtown Eastside.

“The intelligence that we’re getting is that there is a gang conflict that’s taking place,” he said. “And it’s that drug turf war that’s going on where everybody is vying for that piece of the action. That’s what Oppenheimer has created. It has destabilized that park, which never had those issues.”

Chow added that new gangs are showing up in Vancouver specifically looking to capitalize on those camped out at Oppenheimer Park and other vulnerable residents in the DTES. In years past, individual blocks within the Downtown Eastside were split between rivalling factions.

The deputy chief also said that the department supports an injunction to remove campers from the park who are subject to skyrocketing levels of crime, not just in the park, but across the Downtown Eastside.

Police are appealing for dashcam or cell phone video from anyone who may have been in the area of Hastings to Keefer just before 4 p.m. on Sunday, Sept. 22, and later that day around 6 p.m. along Dunlevy to Heatley. Anyone with video or additional information is asked to call the VPD Major Crime Section at 604-717-2500 or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477.

Provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix announced July 15 that there were 21 new cases in the past 24 hours, including two cases that they call ""epi-linked,"" or presumed cases that have not been proven through testing but are being treated as official cases.

article continues below

The province has now recorded 3,149 cases since the novel coronavirus first appeared in B.C. in late January.

More than 87.4% of those infected, or 2,753 people, have recovered. Of those who haven't, 189 people have died and 207 people are actively fighting the virus. Only 14 people are hospitalized, with five of those in intensive care units. The rest are self-isolating at home. There were no new deaths recorded in the past 24 hours.

Recording at least 20 new COVID-19 cases in a 24-hour period has become common in B.C., and Henry said yesterday that she found that number ""distressing,"" even though, she added, the good news is that the province knows where the clusters of infection are, many of the infections are linked and the number is not really that large given the province's population of more than five million residents.

The numbers in the past week were:

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12;

• 21 new cases on July 13;

• 13 new cases on July 14; and now

• 21 new cases on July 15.

In June, the number of daily new cases many times was in the single digits.

""There is one active community outbreak, in addition to several community exposure events,"" Henry and Dix said. ""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks.""

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,023 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,659 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 216 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 51 people who reside outside Canada.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons is expected to take Sidoo into custody on September 23 and release him from a Pacific Northwest area facility just before Christmas.

article continues below

Sidoo, 61, appeared online via Zoom in front of United States District Judge Nathaniel Gorton of the United States District Court for District of Massachusetts, as well as his lawyers and prosecutors. He wore a plaid suit while sitting in an office space inside his $31.7 million home in Vancouver’s Point Grey neighbourhood.

Sidoo, now a convicted felon, initially pled innocent to fraud and money laundering charges; he teared up before being sentenced and read a prepared statement:

“The last several months have been the hardest in my entire life and today I accept the court’s decision without reservation. No words can express how sorry I am for my decisions and actions that led to this day. I make no excuses, your honour. I broke the law and pled guilty and I now must pay for my actions.

“To my wife and boys, all I ever wanted was your love and respect and to be a good role model. And I know I have made a terrible mistake that has deeply affected our family. To my friends and colleagues and former teammates over the years, I am deeply ashamed today. To the young men and women who looked up to me as a role model, you deserve better. To the court and all of you, I wish to apologize for my actions.

“I will serve my sentence and am committed to returning to the community and doing everything possible to make a positive impact. I hope in time people will not judge me for the worst mistake in my life but for the work in the days, weeks and years ahead in which I am committed to being a better man.”

Gorton told Sidoo he was “impressed” by the businessman’s “obvious remorse.”

But Gorton pointed out two omissions in Sidoo’s statement.

“You expect to put this behind you and go forward and make up for what you called mistakes. I would call it a crime, not a mistake, but nevertheless, it is important that you acknowledge it and realize how many constituencies you have disappointed,” said the judge.

Sidoo also did not explicitly acknowledge that his crimes resulted in two students missing an opportunity to attend the universities his sons, Dylan Sidoo and Jordan Sidoo, were admitted to.

“What you accomplished, along with getting them into college, is to deprive two other deserving students of admittance into those universities — an act that is the very antithesis of one you want to be known for,” said Gorton.

Likewise, United States Attorney Andrew Lelling submitted to Gorton: “Sidoo engaged in serious criminal conduct involving fraud and deception that stretched over multiple years.

“His crimes warrant significant punishment. By engaging in the scheme, with [scheme mastermind Rick Singer] and others, Sidoo was able to steal two college admissions slots for his sons, including one from the University of California at Berkeley, one of the top public universities in the nation.”

Sidoo, said Gorton, “committed a crime that displayed an unbelievable lack of integrity, morality and common sense.

“You have let your selfish desire, your pride and your enormous wealth overcome all of what you apparently want to stand for with your works of charity,” Gorton told Sidoo.

Sidoo’s philanthropy, derived from his earnings in the capital markets, was central to his sentencing defense. According to Sidoo he has donated several million dollars to charitable causes, such as the University of B.C. football program.

In pleading guilty to fraud, Sidoo avoided a maximum prison term of 20 years and prosecutors subsequently agreed to 90 days behind bars, plus a $250,000 fine and one-year of supervised release, which will not be enforced in Canada by the U.S. Probation Department. Prosecutors also agreed to drop the money laundering charge.

The prison Sidoo goes to is expected to have harsher conditions since his options are limited due to his foreign citizenship. His attorney Martin Weinberg said he is expected to spend 14 days in isolation in a “maximum security setting,” due to COVID-19.

Sidoo will get four days credit for time already served. If he serves the full 90 days he will be released December 17 but will have to spend 14 days in isolation at home should B.C. public health rules for international travellers and COVID-19 continue into the fall.

Gorton said Sidoo’s crime would normally warrant more time in jail but there are mitigating circumstances, such as his remorse, lack of criminal record, philanthropy and “collateral consequences,” such as not being able to enter the U.S. as a felon and being stripped last month of his Order of B.C. medal for community service. Sidoo’s attorneys also previously noted he did not directly pay the universities but that his fraud was limited to cheating on the tests.

The former B.C. Lions football player worked as a stock broker in the 1990s and an investment banker between 2000 and 2010. Since 2010 he has made millions of dollars directing a handful of public companies that have failed to generate wealth for retail investors.

Sidoo was arrested March 8, 2019, in San Jose, California, on charges by the U.S. Department of Justice of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering related to the high-profile U.S. college admissions and bribery scandal, brought to light by a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe dubbed Operation Varsity Blues.

One of dozens of parents to be charged, Sidoo initially pled innocent to paying $200,000 total to scheme mastermind William ‘Rick’ Singer, who hired corrupt exam expert Mark Riddell to take Dylan and Jordan’s SAT exams, in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Sidoo also helped falsify one of his son Jordan’s university applications in October 2013 with an essay that originally included a fake claim of Jordan being held up at gunpoint by gangsters, while he was purported to be an intern for an anti-gang organization.

Co-conspirators Singer and Riddell pled guilty last year in exchange for cooperating with the government’s investigation.

The guilty parties in the case, who used Singer’s criminal services, were generally well-off individuals. Celebrities such as actress Lori Loughlin and her clothing designer husband Mossimo Gianulli and actress Felicity Huffman also pled guilty for related crimes and brought much media attention to the investigation.

Sidoo’s sons had no involvement in their father’s crime.

Jordan is now a 2018 history graduate from University of California Berkeley. Dylan graduated in cinematic arts in 2016 from the University of Southern California (USC). The two previously attended Vancouver’s prestigious St. George’s School.

Neither university has announced whether or not their degrees will remain valid. Dylan, according to the sentencing documents, had scored a 1,460/2,400 SAT score until Riddell, using a fake ID in December 2011, bumped up the score to 1,700, which was high enough for Dylan to enter Chapman University (and later transfer to USC). Riddell then scored 2,280/2,400 for Jordan in December 2012, paving the way to Berkley.

Riddell also took a high school test for Dylan. The B.C. Ministry of Education has issued no statement on how its testing process was so vulnerable to fraud.

Both sons have since entered into penny stock promotion with their father.

Exactly one week ago, on July 7, the province recorded 12 new cases. What followed was an uptick in recorded cases:

• 18 new cases on July 8;

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12; and

• 21 new cases on July 13.

""I know it was distressing to me to see 20, especially 25 [new cases] one day,"" Henry said. ""That's way above my comfort zone.""

She added, however, that the slight rise in cases was not unexpected, given that the province has been allowing restaurants and other indoor businesses to reopen.

""We do know where those cases are,"" she said. ""We're testing the people who need to be tested.""

It would be more concerning, she said, if the cases were spread out across the province in an unlinked way. The most recent cluster of cases is linked to the Krazy Cherry Fruit Company in Oliver, she announced yesterday (July 13).

Given B.C.'s population, 20 cases in one day is also better than some other jurisdictions, she said.

The province has identified 3,128 infections since the virus first appeared in the province in late January.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,015 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1649 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 212 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 52 people who reside outside Canada.

Of the 209 people currently fighting COVID-19 in B.C., 14 people are in hospital with five of those in intensive care units. That leaves 2,730 people who have recovered from the virus.

No new deaths from the virus were identified in the past 24 hours, leaving the death toll at 189 people.

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

So far 399 residents and 252 staff at seniors' care facilities have been infected by COVID-19 in B.C.

Health Minister Adrian Dix said that it is his understanding that the federal government and the U.S. government have agreed to extend the closure of the two countries' border for one additional month, until August 21.

""This is obviously positive and necessary news,"" he said. ""Everybody who lives in B.C. knows how inconvenient and how difficult that is for many businesses and many individuals for a variety of circumstances.""

Harry Bains said injured workers have complained for too long that the system lacks fairness and support in times of injury and recovery.

article continues below

Changes Bains proposes include raising the maximum annual salary on which compensation benefits are based; authorizing WorkSafeBC to provide preventative medical treatment before claim acceptance; giving powers to the court to issue WorkSafeBC search and seizure warrants appropriate for investigating workplace safety infractions; and giving people a voice in serious workplace prosecutions and trials by using victim impact statements.

Victoria is also fast-tracking legislation to handle situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic so workers can access benefits more easily.

During the pandemic, the regulator is allowing businesses to defer paying their premiums for six months without penalty or interest. It is also waiving premiums on wages paid to workers of employers receiving the Canadian Emergency Wage Subsidy.

The amendments to the Workers Compensation Act comes after three expert reviews were completed in 2018 and 2019.

The ministry said of the more than 44,000 injured workers currently receiving permanent disability benefits because of a work-related injury, about 35% are in the Lower Mainland, while the rest are spread throughout all regions of B.C.

There are more than 100,000 workplace injury or fatality claims annually.

In 2019, there were 140 workplace fatalities in B.C. Of that number, 84 were due to occupational disease, 40 to traumatic injury and 16 the result of a motor vehicle incident.

B.C. also managed to contain the pandemic and flatten its growth curve better than some other provinces, and it has been able to move earlier on a phased economic restart plan.

""Because of that strength, we were able to take immediate action to help people, to help businesses, to help communities with our $5 billion COVID action plan,"" James said.

She said the province is expecting a loss of $4.2 billion in tax revenue, including $1 billion less in personal income tax revenue, $973 million less in corporate taxes, $1.3 billion in provincial sales tax revenue, $300 million in natural resource revenues and $882 million less in Crown Corporation income.

The province is also spending $5 billion in emergency spending, and has approved $1.3 billion in tax credits and deferrals. In total, the increased spending, lost tax revenue and foregone revenue will bring the deficit to $12.5 billion.

In February, James brought down, but never passed, a balanced budget and modest surplus of $227 million and provincial GDP growth projections of 2% in 2020.

""Mere weeks after the budget 2020 was tabled, our entire world changed,"" James said.

James said the B.C. economy is now expected to contract 6.8% in 2020, according to some forecasters.

Since February, B.C. lost 235,000 jobs, and saw retail sales declined by 23.6% in April compared to February. Overall, home prices dropped 4%.

Home sales declined 45.4% in May, compared to February, and B.C. merchandise exports are down 14.7% year-to-date, compared to January to May 2019.

""While the job losses in March and April were record-breaking, figures for May and June in fact have seen some recovery of the losses that we experienced in the previous two months,"" James said.

Asked if her government planned to resort to spending cuts to address the deficit, James said ""now is not the time to be able to cut back on services and support for people and business in British Columbia.""

As for any long-range plans for dealing with debt and deficits, James said: ""I do not believe that it's going to be a quick fix.""

Asked if the $5 billion that her government has already approved could be added to later this year, James said ""I believe the $5 billion is enough now.""

However, she added no one can predict what might happen should there be a second wave of COVID-19.

As for the $22 billion in capital spending allocated in the 2020 budget over three years for big capital works projects, like new schools, hospitals, bridges and roads, that will continue to be spent.

""This is going to serve us very well because it translates into huge investments,"" James said.

In the pandemic, how do you maintain the trust relationship between employers and employees and maximize resilience in the workforce? The BIV special series on Human Resources today features a discussion with Jennifer Lee, managing partner of growth platforms and value creation services for Deloitte. She is overseeing the company’s global response to COVID-19.

142,vancourier,https://www.vancourier.com/real-estate/gun-violence-imported-from-u-s-is-a-key-concern-for-canadians-1.24169958,Gun violence imported from U.S. is a key concern for Canadians,['Mario Canseco'],,"National governments have a tendency to overreact immediately after they are forced to face an unexpected challenge. No example is better than the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks in the United States, which gave us the “Patriot Act” after just 45 days of deliberation to expand government surveillance of Americans to previously unimagined levels.

In mid-April, the actions of Gabriel Wortman led to the deaths of 22 people in Nova Scotia after multiple shootings and fires. Most Canadians, at the time still under lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, were horrified at Wortman’s actions, which included impersonating a police officer.

article continues below

It took the federal government only 13 days after Wortman’s criminal activity was evident for the entire country to announce a nationwide ban on 1,500 types of military-grade “assault-style” weapons in Canada. Any Canadian who possesses these firearms will have two years to get rid of them. The prohibition led to many new discussions about the role that firearms play in Canada’s urban and rural areas.

We know now that the perpetrator of the 22 murders in Nova Scotia had obtained his weapons illegally from Canadian and American sources. This was not a surprise for Canadian authorities, who have consistently reported that more than 70% of the weapons used in gun-related crimes in our country come from the United States.

On the issue of firearms, Canada is decidedly different from the United States. In Canada, it is not legal for a person to own or carry a firearm for the purpose of self defence against human beings. When Research Co. and Glacier Media asked Canadians about this key precept of Canadian law, more than three in four (77%) agreed with it, while 18% disagreed and 5% were undecided.

Atlantic Canada (31%), Saskatchewan and Manitoba (29%) and Alberta (24%) boast the highest number of residents who openly question Canada’s long-standing regulations for firearms. While higher than what is observed in Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia, these are not proportions of voters that would sway an election, certainly not in the way American statewide and congressional races can be tilted if your candidate can adequately hold a shotgun and recite the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution in a manner that panders to the base.

Fewer than one in five Canadians welcome the notion of citizens carrying firearms for something other than hunting or scaring wildlife away. Any survey measuring opinions on banning “assault-style” weapons would be met with near unanimity. The opposition reacted to the announced ban as it always has under its outgoing leader, by claiming the regulations would affect law-abiding Canadians. Lost in this unfortunate combination of inadequate polling and incapable opposition are the solutions that matter to Canadians.

In our survey, more than three in five Canadians (63%) told us that gun violence in Canada is a “very serious” or “moderately serious” problem – a proportion that climbs to 69% among women and 68% among those aged 55 and over.

Sizable majorities of Ontarians and British Columbians, who have experienced gang wars in urban areas, are more likely to look at gun violence as particularly problematic (76% and 67%, respectively). The COVID-19 pandemic did little to curb gun violence in Toronto, where 61 people were shot in the first four months of the year.

We asked Canadians about the effectiveness of four possible measures, and their responses outline a public that is ready for bold action. More than three in five Canadians (62%) think enacting a complete ban on handguns would be “very effective” or “moderately effective” in reducing gun violence in Canada. Most crimes, after all, are not being committed with the military-grade “assault-style” weapons that the federal government was quick to ban.

A higher proportion of Canadians deem two other measures as effective: imposing mandatory jail terms for crimes committed with firearms (74%) and introducing new outreach programs to steer youth away from gangs (also 74%).

Canadians place dealing with firearms smuggled from the United States as the most important issue that needs to be addressed. Many of the country’s residents also want to make sure gangs are not attractive to our country’s youth and believe mandatory minimum jail sentences would act as a deterrent.

Banning military-grade “assault-style” weapons is low-hanging fruit in a challenge that definitely has Canadians preoccupied and wishing for a type of government intervention that goes beyond a photo-op celebrated by poorly executed survey charity work.

True sociologists know that we learn nothing from posing the wrong questions to Canadians, and capable politicians should go beyond voicing displeasure with plans and proposals just because that is what they are expected to do. Meanwhile, Canadians are still worried about gun violence and expecting their elected officials to do better. •

Five questions with Visit Las Vegas

Las Vegas is open for business. Photo Las Vegas News Bureau

Where does Canada fit in with your yearly visitors?

Canada is a vital market for Las Vegas, it is our number one source of international visitation to the destination. Vegas is now open and we can’t wait to welcome our Canadian visitors back.

With Las Vegas gradually opening, about what percentage of casinos and resorts/hotels are open?

By this weekend, there will be almost 230 hotels open in Las Vegas, and of the ones open, they represent approximately 108k hotel rooms.

However, not all those rooms are bookable/available. Resorts and hotels are operating at an optimal capacity ideal for each individual property.

The Neon Museum has introduced measures to promote social distancing. Photo Sandra Thomas

As Vegas opens, what can visitors expect? For example, how does social distancing work in a casino?

Our guest experience has been reimagined, but they can still enjoy many of the amenities — dining, gaming and relaxation and the “only-in-Vegas” offerings.

The health and wellbeing of our visitors continues to be our number one priority. We recognize the importance of emphasizing that health and wellbeing is a shared responsibility of the destination as well as our individual visitors and in turn launched our Vegas Smart campaign.

The #VegasSmart campaign is a reminder to visitors and locals that the destination is doing everything it can to be smart and help them stay healthy.

Our hospitality partners — which include our hotels and casinos, independent dining establishments and entertainment groups — are all following directives from the governor and Nevada gaming regulators.

Las Vegas entertainment, including live shows, will be phased in over time. These drums are from a previous backstage tour of the Beatles LOVE by Cirque du Soleil. Photo Sandra Thomas

Will there be live shows? Las Vegas’ entertainment will re-emerge in phases as our resort partners look to safely and responsibly bring shows back.

Visitors can still a enjoy a variety of different experiences — from our world-class resorts, to fine dining to outdoor adventure and nature tourism surrounding the city.

You can order the popular Slut coddled egg dish at Eggslut, located in the Cosmopolitan Casino Resort, to go. Photo Sandra Thomas

Do you predict there might be some food/hotels deals to be had in the next couple of months for future travel?

Yes, our guests can look forward to great value in Las Vegas. We have aggregated a collection of deals from various partners on our website to make planning your next trip to Vegas quick, easy and convenient.

144,vancourier,https://www.vancourier.com/living/kumsheen-rafting-offers-socially-distant-white-water-rafting-1.24156483,"Kumsheen Rafting offers socially distant, white water rafting",['Sandra Thomas'],,"Just three hours from Vancouver, Lytton-based Kumsheen Rafting Resort is offering full and half-day trips, with a host of new safety protocols designed to keep adventurers safe in the COVID-19 era.

Braden Fandrich, Kumsheen’s director of operations, says Kumsheen’s top priority has always been the safety of their guests and staff and, although 2020 is presenting some unprecedented challenges, this season’s focus on safety is sharper than ever.

article continues below

“We’ve completely revamped the resort to more than comply with provincial safety guidelines and orders,” says Fandrich in a press release. “We’ve implemented strict cleaning protocols and have worked out a way to get our biggest rafts on to the river in a way that easily complies with social distancing.”

Bigger boats and smaller groups are part of the enhancements introduced at Kumsheen Rafting Resort due to COVID-19. Photo Kumsheen Rafting Resort

Fandrich says since its inception in 1973, Kumsheen has always been a family-oriented resort and with the “new normal” of 2020, in which travellers are urged to stay in small family “pods,” the resort has based this year’s excursions on small groups enjoying the great outdoors on large open-air boats.

In fact, family groups are encouraged to book their own boat whenever possible. Kumsheen has developed an extensive — but flexible — action plan, including:

Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) for all staff.

New check-in procedures to limit contact and ensure physical distancing.

Extensive cleaning and disinfecting protocols. Continued disinfecting of all wetsuits, rain gear and life jackets.

An all-in focus on client and staff safety, on the river and on COVID-19.

""We’ve spent months working as a team and as an industry to make this as safe for you and your family as possible,” Fandrich says. “Our staff, especially Meghan Burrage and Taija Wilson-Rymer, has worked incredibly hard, meticulously reviewing all of our operating procedures and modifying them to deal with social distancing and COVID-19 issues.”

Here’s a timeline of what’s taken place so far at the resort and what is expected to happen in the future.

Mid-June

Opening of a limited number of tenting sites and self-contained RV sites.

Opening of their famous canvas cabins and teepees, with as much time between occupancy as possible in the warm, dry Lytton heat, combined with strict cleaning protocols to reduce the risk as much as possible.

Late June

Half-day power rafting trips through the legendary Thompson River’s Devil’s Gorge.

The resort’s Cutting Board Restaurant will open for takeout service.

Early July

Full-day power rafting trips begin.

Mid-July

Full-day and half-day paddle rafting trips begin.

""We’ve worked with the British Columbia River Outfitters Association to establish protocols, which were submitted to the Provincial Health Officer and approved,” Fandrich explains. “We’ve worked out how to have maximum safety while having maximum fun.”

Smaller groups and bigger boats are just some of the changes introduced at Kumsheen Rafting Resort due to COVID-19. Photo Kumsheen Rafting Resort

Fandrich says the golden rules for the 2020 rafting season include:

Don’t go to the resort if you’re ill or have been exposed to someone who is sick, or if you’ve been out of Canada in the past 14 days.

Observe physical distancing of two metres.

Wash or disinfect your hands often and regularly.

Bring a non-medical mask. A buff or neck tube is preferred and you’ll also be able to wear these on the raft. Be sure to have a bag or container to store your masks. Non-medical masks will be required when on our transport to and from the river.

Bring your own food for lunches and snacks in June, but we’ll have bagged lunches available for full-day trips in July.

Book a trip with your immediate family or those who are in your bubble.

Store your personal belongings in your vehicle if you are not using the resort’s campgrounds or accommodations.

“We’ll offer refunds to anyone who feels sick on the day of the trip,” Fandrich says. “We’re in this together.”

Five questions with Celina Sinclair, Global Markets Specialist, Utah Office of Tourism.

How do you measure tourism numbers for your destination?

The Utah Office of Tourism measures tourism numbers to Utah in several ways, including visitation to our Mighty 5® national parks and 44 state parks, visitor spending, visitor profile reports for domestic travel and Tourism Economics for international travel.

How has COVID-19 impacted tourism in your region?

Like the rest of the world, tourism came to a halt in Utah. The Utah Leads Together Plan helped to mitigate the unavoidable economic impact of COVID-19 through a phased reactivation of Utah’s economy guided by vigilance, data-informed decisions, respect for geographic differences, care for the vulnerable and new protocols for safety.

The Utah Office of Tourism has been supporting our tourism businesses and local communities so they will still be there when it comes time to welcome Canadians and other visitors back to our destination.

The stories of support have ranged from Utah resident and bar owner Ty Burrell (who played Phil Dunphy on Modern Family) donating to support local hospitality workers to Ski Utah contributing to ‘Goggles for Docs’ to provide health care workers with ski goggles as a form of eye protection while fighting COVID-19.

Do you believe the virus has changed the way people are looking at travel?

The pandemic has changed the way we view travel, but that is not necessarily a bad thing.

We are optimistic that when the time is right to travel again, visitors to Utah will approach travel with a new level of planning, a mindful and localized approach, and a desire to travel responsibly.

Travelling responsibly means planning ahead. Reading ahead. Slowing down when possible and stopping to fully appreciate all that is around you, whether you’re travelling alone or with friends and family.

For some, it can mean giving back. Becoming ambassadors of place. And coming back to Utah year after year.

What does the future hold for your destination and when do you think it will be welcoming visitors once again?

It’s too soon to say when we will be welcoming International visitors to Utah again, especially at the pre-pandemic levels that sustained and grew our thriving tourism economy.

We want to be mindful of the fact that everyone is in a different stage and experiencing this pandemic in a different way.

We hope that as people emerge from indoors they will seek the openness and soul-awakening adventure that Utah’s vast landscapes have to offer. Utahns have innovated and shown creativity within constraints throughout the crisis and we fully expect our tourism industry to step up to the challenge of welcoming back our visitors when the time is right.

The Greatest Snow on Earth® will still fall on Utah’s mountains at our 15 ski resorts and together with the red rock landscapes of our Mighty 5® national parks as well as 44 state parks, Utah’s diverse landscapes will beckon visitors, including British Columbians, to visit Utah once again be it for ski season next winter or for that epic family road trip.

What travel trends do you predict for later this year and 2021?

If we could summarize what we predict for travel once it resumes it’s, “pent-up demand meets aspiration.”

As Utah slowly re-opens, we are starting to see local Utahns take full advantage of the “embarrassment of riches” in our own backyard.

We then expect the regional drive markets will look to Utah for that change of scenery they are craving because few destinations match the diversity of landscapes that Utah offers.

Temples of the Sun and Moon in Cathedral Valley, Utah. Photo Tom Till

We also anticipate Canadians — British Columbians and Albertans in particular, especially those who travel by RV — will be the first international visitors to return to Utah when the Canada-U.S. border re-opens.

With a new openness and appreciation for details, our visitors might be more inclined to hire a guide, engage with Utah’s natural and human history, and take the time to better understand the communities at the core of the state’s unique offerings. And these travellers will seek experiences that shape lasting memories.

We expect people to seek out wellness experiences that bridge healing and adventure, whether that’s camping at Northern Utah’s Bear Lake (nicknamed “the Caribbean of the Rockies”), stargazing at one of nearly 20 internationally accredited dark sky parks and communities (more than any destination in the world!) or just walking toward the liminal horizon of the Great Salt Lake.

We often hear visitors share experiences of the healing power of Utah, and it’s that special, quiet power that we expect will call to people even more in the future, and that lends itself perfectly to long-awaited travel experiences rooted in wellness.

Five questions with Marie-Céline Piednoir, head of communications for Coral Gardeners, a coral reef restoration and conservation program located in the Islands of Tahiti in French Polynesia.

Piednoir says the world is not hearing great news about the global warming crisis and ""issues of climate change still reign strong.""

Piednoir adds scientists estimate that by 2050, there will be no more coral on earth. In this world of uncertainty, there are heroes — and we can be sure that this group will continue trying to save it.

Coral Gardeners is an organization led by founder Titouan Bernicot and a group of native Tahitians, who noticed the devastation of the reefs in their islands and decided to act by replanting coral.

How was the idea for Coral Gardeners conceived?

Our project was born in 2017 in Moorea, the sister island of Tahiti, in the Pacific Ocean. We are young surfers and fishermen nicknamed “The Children of the Ocean.”

One day, while surfing, we saw the degradation of the reefs and decided to take action. Young and motivated, we launched a crowdfunding campaign in 2017 and we achieved our objective!

Today, Coral Gardeners is made up of more than 15 international volunteers, more than 12,000 corals adopted and transplanted into the lagoon, and thousands of supporters, either local students, tourists or young people from all over the world.

We have two main missions

Raising awareness

We want everyone around the world to know what is a coral and how coral reefs are essential for the planet. We use local actions but also the tools of social media to reach as many people as possible.

Reef restoration

We have the “adopt a coral” program and we work with “super corals” to rebuild the reef. Once you make a donation to the program, you recieve a certificate, which includes the name you've given your coral, as well as information on its location, including longitude and latitude.

We believe in our actions and intend to go even further in our project, launching a global movement of Coral Gardeners.

Experts believe the world's coral could be wiped out by 2050. Coral Gardeners is doing everything it can to ensure that doesn't happen. Photo Ryan Borne

How can visitors participate in planting their own coral?

At least until 2021, we decided to cancel our eco-tours so visitors cannot come to plant their own coral. Nevertheless, everyone in the world can still adopt a coral to support us.

You can name your coral and you will receive an adoption certificate right after adopting it.

Why is this an important initiative for the Islands of Tahiti? For the world?

It is important because we aim at saving the reefs locally. With our restoration program we are replanting corals onto damaged reefs at different spots around Moorea.

It is important for the world because we aim at scaling up in the future, first to the Pacific region and then to the world, who knows.

Also, one of our key roles is to raise awareness. We want everyone in the world to know what coral is and to be able to support us if they want.

What are the best places to visit in The Islands of Tahiti? When is the best time for Canadians to visit?

Moorea is the place to visit! Amazing lagoons, limpid waters, rich marine life, waves to surf, mountains to climb, waterfalls to jump in, roads to explore, people to meet, local food to taste, local dance to join... Moorea and French Polynesia will bring you so much culturally and visually, it will change your approach to life and it will stay with you forever, this little piece of paradise and peacefulness.

I love the weather during March and November, but honestly all year long is amazing here.

What are some of the things that you personally love about this destination?

The culture and lifestyle! People are smiling, welcoming, chill, enjoying life at their own rhythm. It is like a flow, the feeling of mana, that you have to embrace.

From my personal experience, I feel that this feeling can truly be found only here in the Islands of Tahiti.

Hotel guests can now also begin to enjoy the fitness centre and the rooftop pool will resume weekend operations beginning June 5. At this time, Willow Stream Spa, Fairmont Gold and Botanist will remain temporarily closed.

In celebration of the hotel’s re-opening, the Fairmont Pacific Rim welcomes guests to reserve the limited edition Stay Close, Every Second Night on Us offer, which must be booked between June 3 to 16, 2020.

Ideal for locals looking to explore Vancouver’s backyard like a tourist, or take in some much needed rest and relaxation, this exclusive offer is available for minimum two-night stays from June 10 through June 30, 2021, with every second night complimentary. Reservations can be made online .

“The hotel’s top priority remains the safety, care and wellbeing of our Fairmont Pacific Rim family. As we welcome our friends, family and community back, we are looking ahead to ensure that our valued guests and employees will always be looked after with the highest degree of safety, care and comfort,” said Jens Moesker, regional vice-president and general manager of Fairmont Pacific Rim.

The new operational standards being implemented at Fairmont Pacific Rim and at Fairmont properties across North and Central America were developed and vetted by a team of expert advisors to ensure maximum efficacy in preventing the spread of all viruses and pathogens, including COVID-19.

Those initiatives and policies are being overseen by Bureau Veritas, a world leader in testing, inspections and certification; Dr. Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security and fellow with the Infectious Diseases Society of America; and Ruth Petran, Ph.D., CFS, Senior Corporate Scientist, Food Safety and Public Health, for Ecolab, global leaders in cleaning and hygiene, and trusted advisors to the CDC.

As travel editor at the Vancouver Courier newspaper, a board member of the B.C. branch of the Travel Media Association of Canada, and a member of the Society of American Travel Writers, travel is a big part of my life and I had the contacts already in place to get started.

Now with some destinations looking to slowly reopen, and, in an effort to catch a glimpse of future travel trends, I’m continuing to reach out to travel experts and tourism bureaus across Canada and the globe for answers to five similar questions.

And while no one can predict the future, all are hopeful travel will soon resume. But, how exactly that will look is anyone’s guess.

If you are part of a destination management organization or represent a property and want to share your thoughts, please drop me a line at writersblock5@hotmail.com.

Five questions with Donna Banks, chairperson of the Anguilla Tourist Board.

How do you measure tourism numbers for your destination?

We measure tourism numbers by arrivals to the island and in 2019 we enjoyed our best year ever in terms of stay-over arrivals.

We are confident that in time we will rebuild our industry and recover from this unprecedented event, which has severely impacted the world as well as the global hospitality industry.

How has COVID-19 impacted tourism in your region?

Anguillians are a proud and resilient people and we come together in times of crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic, of course, has severely impacted Anguilla’s economy, as tourism is our largest economic sector and the largest employer.

The Anguilla government has introduced an economic support package to assist those affected financially, economically and socially.

Many of the tourism industry stakeholders on the island have also stepped up, providing assistance to their employees and their families.

Do you believe the virus has changed the way people are looking at travel?

It absolutely will change the way people will travel going forward. Travellers want to feel safe, in how they travel to a destination, where they stay and what they do in that destination and they will want to feel they are being looked after safely and responsibly, in every aspect of their experience.

The stakeholders will have to have a well thought out plan in place to make the entire experience feel safe for travellers going forward.

Anguilla hopes to be able to invite visitors back just as soon as it's safe to do so. Photo ATB

What travel trends do you predict for later this year and 2021?

Having had no active or suspected cases of Covid-19 in Anguilla, on the recommendation of the Chief Medical Officer, we lifted all restrictions on movement and gatherings, effective Wednesday, 29 April.

This means that churches, places of worship, all retail stores, hair salons and barber shops, accommodation suppliers, gyms and spas, recreational facilities, official lotteries, restaurants and bars have reopened.

Our schools reopened on May 11, with a phased approach to in-class teaching and the continuation of thee-learning platforms.

However, we are remaining vigilant, we still require social distancing and good hygiene practices and environmental health officials in Anguilla will be visiting all commercial premises to ensure compliance.

Anguilla’s ports will remain closed for passenger movements until the situation outside Anguilla allows for the safe reopening to external traffic.

What does the future hold for your destination and when do you think it will be welcoming visitors once again?

Anguillalooks forward to welcoming visitors once borders are opened and flights resume.

We are an ideal location in that our beaches are always uncrowded, we have small boutique hotels, and a fantastic array of villas, ideal for families and intergenerational travel.

Destination protocols for opening are being finalized with the Ministry of Health. We have on-going meetings with stakeholders to discuss how they are adapting their product to meet what we expect will be the “new normal” for travellers.

We can guarantee that our visitors will benefit from the best natural immunity and energy boosters — beach, sunlight, fresh air, relaxing atmosphere — stress-free living and, of course, our very own special brand of warm Anguillian hospitality.

And in the meantime…. ""With Love from Anguilla"" series

In April, the Anguilla Tourist Board announced a new social strategy that reflects and addresses the current situation in Anguilla and indeed across the globe.

The series of posts is designed to surprise and delight audiences, building community and connections through their digital channels, with heartfelt messages that make people feel supported, valued and loved.



The content being created falls into one of three categories: Informative, Inspirational and Educational. To that end, the board has enlisted the participation of a wide cross section of Anguillians, including religious leaders, artists, musicians, chefs, historians and wellness practitioners.

Inspirational readings, live yoga sessions on the beach, Anguilla island playlists, award-winning cocktails with prominent mixologists, live culinary demonstrations of Anguillian specialties with leading chefs, fun, Anguilla-themed crossword puzzles, picture puzzles and games are all features that will be shared in the upcoming weeks.

Hopefully it won't be too long before Anguilla welcomes visitors once again. Photo ATB

“We are all part of the global community, and we understand only too well the sense of isolation, fear and uncertainty that this pandemic has fueled,” said ATB chairperson Donna A. Daniels-Banks. “We believe it is important to share content that is uplifting and entertaining; stories that remind us of our common humanity, invoke the simple pleasures that we may have once taken for granted, and speak to how much we still have to be grateful for, despite the challenges we face. We also want to recapture for our repeat guests their favorite Anguilla experiences, and reveal what awaits our potential visitors, once they are ready to travel again.”



In addition, the With Love From Anguilla series will feature special messages from popular Anguillian personalities, exciting virtual tours of Anguilla both by land and sea, including the island’s magical underwater world, and a mouth-watering Anguillan BBQ, set in one of the most beautiful, secluded spots on the island round out the content calendar in development. The Anguilla Book Club, featuring stories and books by Anguillians and about Anguilla was launched in May, traditionally the month of the annual Literary Festival.



The new content appears on all of the board’s digital platforms and will continue over the next three months. Everyone is encouraged to follow along and participate by using the hashtags #AnguillafromAfar and #DreamingofAnguilla.

About Anguilla

Tucked away in the northern Caribbean, Anguilla is a shy beauty with a warm smile. A slender length of coral and limestone fringed with green, the island is ringed with 33 beaches, considered by savvy travelers and top travel magazines, to be the most beautiful in the world.

A fantastic culinary scene, a wide variety of quality accommodations at varying price points, a host of attractions and exciting calendar of festivals make Anguilla an alluring and entrancing destination.



Anguilla lies just off the beaten path, so it has retained a charming character and appeal. Yet because it can be conveniently reached from two major gateways — Puerto Rico and St. Martin — and by private air, it’s a hop and a skip away.

149,vancourier,https://www.vancourier.com/living/government-of-belize-credits-ground-breaking-technology-for-halting-covid-19-1.24137140,Government of Belize credits ground-breaking technology for halting COVID-19,['Sandra Thomas'],,"According to government statistics, the country of Belize has reported no new cases or COVID-19, for more than a month.

Considering this small developing country on mainland Central America depends heavily on international tourism and cross border trade, such a feat is an incredible one.

article continues below

With a population of about 400,000, the country’s public health system could hardly hope to cope with a massive outbreak of Covid-19 if the disease were to spread to uncontrollable levels.

Despite the large numbers in neighbouring countries in its largest tourism market, including the U.S., Belize has had a total of 18 and no new case since April 13th.

The government says, this has not been by accident and it’s due to the early steps it took to manage the disease by quickly closing borders, bolstering its medical capacity, implementing a State of Emergency and by closely managing the population’s movements with an ever-evolving set of laws that were changed at a moment’s notice to suit the situation as it unfolded.

But, one of the least known factors that assisted greatly in achieving this positive outcome, is the use of technology to manage the crisis, and the use of real-time data for decision-making by health and other senior authorities.

From the time of report of the first imported case by a Belizean who returned from travel to the U.S., the epidemiological unit of the Ministry of Health fast-tracked a contact-tracing mode, they used to effectively isolate that first case and quarantined the entire island of Ambergris Caye where she and her mother, the second case, lived while carefully tracing her steps and her contacts since her arrival into Belize.

This exercise was meticulously repeated with the following 17 cases, with a coordinated effort to locate, segregate and trace contacts related to each case.

Behind all this was a secret weapon developed locally, which drove decisions on a day-to-day basis.

Belize was due to commence a national census this month (May), but an early decision to postpone it until 2021 the government’s Statistical Institute of Belize had available resources.

An early decision by the government in late February to dedicate those resources toward combatting Covid19 proved to be a stroke of genius.

A small group of software developers, statisticians and health professionals got together and designed their own in-house tracking, tracing and reporting platform for Covid19, possibly one of the earliest such integrated efforts in the Americas.

This platform started with an application that allowed the field officers tasked with conducting the census into Covid-19 “field detectives” armed with tablets loaded with the institute’s state-of-the-art data gathering and reporting app Open Health.

These first responders and their health counterparts were able to interview “persons of Interest” based on their risk factors, and in real-time upload the data which allowed for a mapping of cases, contact and risk areas.

At the same time, the Ministry of Health’s hotline was armed with their version of the app and were able to convert data gathered from calls pertaining to symptoms and locations of persons of interest or other risks into the same common database.

As a third step, the team developed and launched a self-reporting app that allows citizens to report their own health condition, giving the government a broader view of public health, and the ability to identify risks that may not be captured by the field agent or the hotline.

All data from the self-reporting app goes directly into the common database and gives authorities a universal view of the health of the population, including those citizens that report no symptoms.

In the back-end, several initiatives were developed, including cross mapping among respondents from all sources against tracing data from known cases, a map of all respondents in real time, and an advanced statistical prediction tool that helps to match the Covid-19 risk level against the hospital capacity in each district in real time.

With Belize closing at only 18 cases of the Covid-19, and with no new cases for 28 days as of May 11, the country has been able to begin a gradual return to normalcy, with most businesses and government offices already re-opened — with legislated and enforced physical distancing — and mandatory use of face masks.

Work is already being done by the team to create modules that will allow for mandatory pre- and ongoing screening of returning nationals and visitors once the airport and borders open, and screening of the general population by increased teams of contact tracers once schools and larger gatherings resume.

Win a trip to Belize

Meanwhile the Belize Tourism Board is encouraging Canadians to plan travel post-Covid-19 as they currently stay home through “Dear Belize,” a virtual postcard campaign.

Past visitors and those dreaming to make their first trip to Belize can submit a virtual postcard that shares their love of the Central American destination.

Winners will be selected at random, but submissions will be shared on the Belize social media platforms to inspire creativity and engagement.

The winner will receive a free seven-night trip for two to Belize, including airfare, accommodations and ground transportation.

With no new reported cases of COVID-19 in more than a month, Belize is looking to the future and the day travellers will eventually return with a contest. Photo Getty Images

Belize is a popular vacation destination for Canadians due to its natural beauty and sunny weather — it’s home to the world’s largest Barrier Reef in the Northern Hemisphere and offers opportunities for eco-activities, cultural offerings and lodgings that range from luxury private-island resorts to jungle retreats.

Belize, otherwise known as “A Curious Place” also offers everything from archaeology to birding and caving to lush rainforests, waterfalls, Mayan ruins, dotted islets, incredible scuba-diving and of course, plenty of sea, sun and sand to help the lucky winner re-engage with nature post-Covid-19.

Submission examples and more information on how to enter can be found on the Dear Belize website.

If you are part of a destination management organization or represent a property and want to share your thoughts, please drop me a line at writersblock5@hotmail.com.

Five questions with Travel Nevada with Tracie Barnthouse, public relations specialist, and Kyle Shulz, Travel Nevada's research manager.

How do you measure tourism numbers in your market?

Travel Nevada receives visitation estimates from various sources. These include estimates reported by the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority (LVCVA), Reno Sparks Convention and Visitors Authority (RSCVA), the OmniTrak Group, and Tourism Economics.

How has COVID-19 impacted tourism in your region?

Tourism is Nevada's number one industry and COVID-19 has had a significant impact on our visitation numbers.

Visitors directly spent $40.8 billion in Nevada in 2018 and the industry directly employed nearly 297,000 Nevadans, according to estimates from Tourism Economics.

This means that over $111 million dollars was spent every day in Nevada by visitors to the state. The LVCVA and RSCVA recently released visitation estimates for March, showing a decrease in visitation of over 58 per cent in Las Vegas and over 49 per cent in Washoe County.

Even larger declines were expected for April.

This drop in visitation will not only hurt Nevada's hotels, but will also lead to decreases in gaming revenue and revenue for restaurants and retail shops.

Visitor spending also impacts other industries in the state, and this will affect many more industries and employees of those industries.

Nevada entered phase one of Governor Sisolak's Roadmap to Recovery on Saturday, May 9, and select businesses were able to reopen under strict guidelines to prevent the further spread of the virus. We are hopeful that this is the first step towards Nevada's economic and visitation recovery.

Do you believe the virus has changed the way people are looking at travel?

A recent study by Destination Analysts indicated that excitement to get back out on the road has increased, with 70.6 per cent of American travellers agreeing that they miss traveling and can’t wait to get out and travel again, however, 88 per cent indicated they'd initially travel with some trepidation.

In another survey by Destination Analysts, nearly 40 per cent of respondents indicated they would be changing the types of destinations they choose to visit.

It is likely that people will choose to travel regionally at first, with long-haul domestic travel and international travel likely to return to normal levels at a later time.

Based on this, we anticipate that travelers will stay close to home before branching out to road trips and then air travel. Nevada is an attractive destination for travelers, with our wide-open roads, charming rural towns, and limitless outdoor activities.

Road trips are a backbone of Travel Nevada's marketing strategy and we have 10 road trip itineraries available on our website.

What does the future hold for your destination and when do you think it will be welcoming visitors once again?

Nevada, and Las Vegas in particular, has been and will continue to be a bucket list destination to travelers — and we don't expect that to change.

Our research studies have shown us that prior to COVID-19, an increasing number of travelers have gone off the beaten path to explore Nevada's rural towns, and we expect that to continue and possibly increase as travelers look for less populated destinations.

As the travel pause ends and restrictions are lifted, Travel Nevada will enact a strategic marketing plan to aid in Nevada's recovery efforts.

That plan will focus on Nevadans rediscovering Nevada first, then on to the regional drive markets, air travel, and then international travel.

Canada is an important market for Nevada and is Travel Nevada's top international market. We look forward to welcoming Canadians to Nevada.

Nevada provides plenty of wide-open spaces for travel, including the ""Loneliest Road in America,"" ideal for road trips. Photo Travel Nevada

What travel trends do you predict for later this year and 2021?

Having gone without travel for months, we anticipate a demand for travel once restrictions are lifted.

We also anticipate the idea of freedom to resonate with travelers and there's no better place to enjoy that sense of freedom than on wide open roads, which Nevada certainly isn't lacking! We foresee road trips to be a big focus for not only travelers, but also destination marketing organizations.

We have already seen in various survey results that travel to rural destinations and destinations geared towards outdoor recreation will likely make people feel safer and return more quickly than urban travel.

In Nevada, outdoor activities are limitless, and we are hopeful outdoor enthusiasts will get out on the open road and enjoy the magnitude of outdoor activities available in Nevada.

In addition, the Nevada Gaming Control Board recently released guidelines for reopening casinos in the state and outlined steps that should be taken with regards to health and safety procedures.

Other trends, at least in the near term, will be regional travel as a replacement for long haul travel, road trip travel as a replacement for air travel, and ""staycations"" as a replacement for vacations.

Five questions with Greg Eckhart, director of global sales for Travel Oregon.

How do you measure tourism numbers for your destination?

Canada is Oregon’s top international market with regional travellers from the Pacific Northwest, including British Columbia, contributing to our core visitation.

Travel Oregon measures our visitor economy through a number of industry sources, including, Tourism Economics, Adara, Tour Extract Report and Smith Travel Report.

How has COVID-19 impacted tourism in your region?

We have, of course, seen and felt the economic impacts of the pandemic in Oregon. In 2019, Oregon was in its 10th consecutive year of record growth in travel-related spending and visitation.

Tourism was a USD $12.8 billion industry employing 117,500 Oregonians.

Now, hotel occupancy rates are currently down 63 per cent and the revenue per available room has plummeted by 75 per cent.

Eight in 10 tourism employees are out of work. The Port of Portland has reported the daily number of daily passengers through PDX is down over 95 per cent.

As a positive, the governors of Washington State, Oregon and California have collaborated on a Western States Pact — a working group with a shared vision for fighting COVID-19.

Nevada and Colorado have also recently joined the pact. In Oregon, we are working closely with Governor Kate Brown’s office, and public health officials on phased plans to begin reopening and rebuilding our economy.

Do you believe the virus has changed the way people are looking at travel?

The pandemic may change the way people travel just as the 9/11 attacks did.

Initially, people may be reluctant to get on an airplane or go far from home, but we believe people will be seeking reconnection. At first with family and friends, then regionally and eventually through international travel.

Our visitors to Oregon are already responsible travellers, but we believe that when it is safe to travel again, our state will attract visitors who understand and appreciate our approach to sustainability, environmental stewardship and nature-based wellness and mindfulness.

Initiatives ranging from Take Care Out There (promoting responsible recreation in Oregon) to the majority of Oregon’s wineries being designated as biodynamic, Salmon Safe or LIVE Certified, are part of our everyday fabric in Oregon.

We want to ensure outdoor opportunities for health, connection and joy for generations of Oregonians and visitors to come.

What does the future hold for your destination and when do you think it will be welcoming visitors once again?

It has been with a heavy heart that we have asked our visitors to please stay at home as Oregon, and the world, take action to slow the spread of COVID-19.

It is difficult to predict how industry conditions will play out in coming months as the governor’s office implements plans to reopen the Oregon economy.

As we look towards recovery, our focus will be at the local level as we will be following the governor’s phased reopening plan.

As travel restrictions are gradually lifted, we’ll start pushing out messaging starting with hyper-local markets, then across the state to all Oregonians, then drive markets and finally nationally and internationally.

This approach will be phased and based on the guidance from the Governor and public health authorities.

When it is safe to do so, we’ll be reaching out to Oregonians and urging them to reconnect with other Oregonians that have been hurt by this downturn, and encouraging locals to tangibly reconnect with the state – our incredible parks and natural sites, our charming communities, our world-renowned restaurants, wineries and breweries.

From there, we expect people will go on driving vacations. The Western States Pact will ensure the Western U.S. reopens responsibly.

Visitors from British Columbia, the Pacific Northwest and our fellow Western states will be the first to travel to Oregon and this partnership will be vital to our immediate recovery and long-term economic comeback.

We look forward to welcoming our neighbours back to Oregon!

What travel trends do you predict for later this year and 2021?

Travel is something many of us have taken for granted, and losing the privilege to do so may create a greater sense of gratitude and appreciation among travellers for the places they visit and the people they meet.

Oregon lends itself well to the trends of wellness and “slow” travel – the concept of doing less on vacation and savouring the experiences had.

Travel will be different – nothing is going to go back to just the way it was. We have to be smarter, more strategic, and look at new ways to partner and support all industries in this recovery together.

Visitors will have to adapt to new protocols about how to behave safely while recreating outdoors during the health pandemic from planning before they go out to curbing expectations while they are outside.

Based on this, we predict that we’ll see a rise in local “staycations” – living like a local – and, of course, road trips. Which Oregon is perfect for!

Much of Oregon was formed by volcanic activity which created a series of geothermic hot springs (more than 45), Crater Lake National Park (the deepest lake in the U.S.) and the stunning Oregon Coast (over

580 kms long), as well as other Oregonian icons such as Mt. Hood, Mt. Bachelor and the Painted Hills. Oregon takes its outdoor adventure seriously and offers wellness and mindfulness through its scenic beauty as well as its connection to food, its terroir and the land.

There’s more than one way to explore Oregon from home and Eckhart hopes you’ll be inspired to visit in person — when it’s okay to do so. “And we’ll be here when you’re ready.”

153,vancourier,https://www.vancourier.com/living/five-questions-with-destination-b-c-1.24129135,Five questions with: Destination B.C.,['Sandra Thomas'],,"Like so many others, I love to travel and, typically, as soon as I get back from one trip, set my sights on the next destination on my list and start counting down the days.

As travel editor at the Vancouver Courier newspaper, a board member of the B.C. branch of the Travel Media Association of Canada, and a member of the Society of American Travel Writers, travel is a big part of my life, just as it is with friends and family and the many other travel writers I’ve come to know over the years.

article continues below

But, with the onslaught of the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve found ourselves in an unprecedented situation in which travel as we all know it has been grounded.

With no set date as to when we might once again begin packing too many clothes for that weekend away or trip to warmer climes

In an effort to catch a glimpse of future travel trends and garner information about just when some destinations might once again be open for business, I reached out to travel experts and tourism bureaus across Canada and the globe for answers to five similar questions.

And while no one can predict the future, all are hopeful travel will soon resume. But, how exactly that will look is anyone’s guess.

If you are part of a destination management organization or represent a property and want to share your thoughts, please drop me a line at writersblock5@hotmail.com.

Five questions with Destination B.C.

How do you measure tourism numbers across the province?

Tourism numbers for the province are measured under various performance indicators, which include key tourism statistics such as international visitor arrivals, provincial room revenue, commercial restaurant receipts, provincial and regional occupancy rates and average daily room rates, regional airports, ferries, and convention centres.

We also track the economic value the tourism industry contributes to the province, using 10 years of tourism revenue, gross domestic product, and business and employment data.

Visitor volume and market origin data are also summarized. For more information on our research tools and methods, please visit our website.

How has COVID-19 impacted tourism in B.C.?

With the travel restrictions imposed, tourism operations largely at a standstill until travel is considered safe and encouraged once again, and the need for us all to stay home to help flatten the curve of COVID-19 in B.C., we are naturally seeing a steep decline.

While our regular tourism data for this period won’t be available for another month or two, we know there has been an exponential impact on our industry and we’re already seeing devastating losses from our colleagues across the province.

Right now, we’ve turned our focus to supporting B.C.’s tourism by ensuring they have reliable information about health directives and the relief programs introduced by the federal and provincial governments, while planning an extensive recovery campaign for once the virus is contained and travel is encouraged.

You can read more about Destination B.C.’s response here.

Can you talk about Destination B.C.'s #exploreBC...Later campaign?

While we have paused all of our paid international and domestic marketing campaigns, we’ve turned our collective efforts to supporting the provincial health directives to help flatten the curve of infection.

Destination B.C. is following the direction of the Ministry of Health, and encouraging others to do the same, to help do our part in flattening the curve of COVID-19 in B.C.

The sooner the virus is contained, the sooner we can begin on the road to recovery.

As such, Destination B.C. has ceased all marketing, including to the U.S. and Canada, and is focused on supporting industry and keeping them informed on the latest developments.

With that in mind, we created the #explore BC…later campaign to help us get the message out that now is not the time to travel.

Mile Zero of the Alaska Highway, Dawson Creek. Photo Destination B.C.

While we’re all passionate about exploring B.C., now is not the time to travel and we know that too many Canadians are continuing to travel and gather for leisure purposes.

We are collectively asking everyone to please stay home and follow the advice of health authorities to keep themselves and others safe.

We must all do our part now, so we can all explore B.C. again later. Across our channels, we are urging audiences to stay home and explore B.C. later.

Our tourism industry partners from across the province are also sharing the sentiment, and we are all working together to amplify our collective voice. The more we do today, the sooner we can all explore B.C. again. So, #exploreBClater content is featured across our Destination B.C. channels, for both consumer and industry audiences.

We also released this Dream of Later video, in which we are encouraging British Columbians to pause, stay in and dream of later travel. To date, more than 877,000 people have seen the video on our channels and it was aired as a public service announcement across the Bell and Corus TV networks at no cost.

That said, we are actively planning a significant recovery campaign for the tourism industry in three phases, of which the last two phases can be implemented once circumstances change and public safety is assured:

Response (currently here)

Recovery

Resilience

Once the COVID-19 virus is contained and domestic travel is again considered safe and encouraged, we will launch a major domestic marketing program encouraging British Columbians to travel in B.C. this summer (as appropriate) and long into the fall.

A significant investment is being made into this campaign, re-allocated from other existing marketing budgets.

Extending the potential for tourism industry revenue recovery, by supporting domestic travel further into the fall season, is critical.

Destination B.C. will implement marketing to encourage travel from B.C., Alberta and Ontario. Additionally, once borders re-open and it is safe to do so, Destination B.C. will market to drive-focussed holiday travelers from short-haul U.S. drive markets (Washington or Oregon) and mid-haul fly-driven markets such as California.

We will continue to work with industry through the development of these plans, and to assess communities’ and operators’ abilities to welcome visitors once it is safe to do so

You can read more about the plan here.

Has the virus changed the way people are looking at travel, and what travel trends do you predict for later this year and 2021?

We expect that the world will look different when we all come out of this, and our industry will need to be prepared to meet the new expectations of travellers.

Leveraging our relationships with digital platforms like Google, Trip.com, WeChat and others around the world, we’ve recently set up a new signals team at Destination B.C. to help our organization and our B.C. industry understand how and when consumers are re-entering the travel marketplace.

Currently, consumers feel COVID-19 will influence them to travel closer to home and not to crowded locations or spaces.

During times of economic uncertainty, we know that consumer behaviour shifts quite dramatically. So, as we plan for recovery in the future, we should expect that the majority of consumers will have:

More of a focus on the short-term

Delayed spending on big purchases — travel often being among these

Lower risk tolerance — so your cancellation, refund and raincheck policies become very important

More price-sensitive shopping — financially-stressed consumers will be seeking out deals and lower prices

Seek out brands they trust as an important purchase decision driver.

At this point in time, consumers are saying two things that are important for tourism operators to consider:

I will plan my travel last-minute to be flexible in a fast-changing situation

I will plan my travel as I normally would, if I can get:

free-of-charge cancellations

ticket refunds

waived re-booking fees

travel insurance

What does the near future hold for Destination B.C.?

Once domestic travel is again considered safe and is encouraged, and with industry capacity in mind, we will launch a major domestic marketing program to support the re-start of our industry.

As other markets re-open, we will focus first on opportunities across Canada and, later, cultivate international travel, most likely beginning with U.S. border states. We know that reviving tourism will very much rely on the state of our overall economy at that time and the season we are in.

We believe recovery will require a massive, cooperative effort by our industry and beyond, and we plan to work in a deeply integrated way with our partners through B.C.’s Tourism Data Hub alliance, and from the public and private sectors.

Destination B.C.’s priority is helping tourism businesses — first, to survive, then, to thrive — to regenerate jobs.

To rebuild revenues that circulate in our local economies. To revive consumer confidence in travel. To restore our social license with residents. To revitalize the social, cultural, environmental and economic benefits that tourism brings to us all — as citizens of our province, our country and our world.

But, of course, as with the rest of the world travel anywhere is on hold for the foreseeable future due to COVID-19.

So, I’ve turned to the internet to get my Hawaii fix while hoping it will be sooner rather than later that I can return to visit friends once again.

Here are just a few options for getting into the aloha spirit no matter where you are.

I started following Mayor Kawakami on Facebook weeks ago after he imposed the “stay at home” order for the island.

But, instead of simply ordering everyone home to fend for themselves, Mayor Kawakami began making videos as a way to entertain locals — and entertain he does.

I’ve watched the mayor do everything from finally nailing the moves to a TikTok dance, make a lava lamp from scratch and build a DIY projector out of toilet paper rolls.

Here’s Mayor Kawakami’s recipe for a homemade hydrating moisture mask.

Mash avocado. Mix in yogurt and honey. Leave on your face for 15-20 minutes.

I’ve had the pleasure of drinking too many tropical drinks at this Princeville, Kauai, tiki bar, which is owned by Michele and Todd Rundgren — Todd is a well-known musician known for his work with his band Utopia and producing records for artists including Badfinger, Meatloaf, Grand Funk Railroad, the New York Dolls and XTC.

On Friday nights Tiki Iniki hosts virtual happy hours with talented bartenders who demonstrate how to make authentic tiki cocktails, including everything from mai tais to the tequila-fuelled Iniki.

Tropical cocktail fans can also submit their own creations on Facebook or Instagram with the hashtag #ilovetikiiniki for an opportunity to win a tiki mug. These happy hours take place at 4:20 p.m., Hawaii Standard Time (7:20 p.m. PST).

Since March, the team at Hoʻokuaʻāina Farm has sadly had to cancel more than 40 program events (mostly designed for kids and students) so they decided to get creative and offer a virtual tour.

Hoʻokuaʻāina empowers youth to realize the meaning and purpose of their lives by helping them develop life strategies and skills through the cultivation of kalo/taro and Hawaiian values-based coaching.

Spring is the time when students who participate in farm’s Kupuohi multi-visit education program visit the farm one last time to celebrate their hard work throughout the year through some sort of food preparation.

To make the most of the situation, the Hoʻokuaʻāina ʻohana created this farm tour video for all to enjoy.

There are numerous Hawaiian musicians playing live for an online audience and one who I’ve been following is Jake Shimabukuro, famous for his mind-blowing ukulele skills.

I was lucky enough to meet and have an ukulele lesson from Jake a few years ago and I’m sure he’ll never forget my rousing rendition of “Bad Boys, Bad Boys…”

You can follow Jake on Facebook here.

Meanwhile Hawaii Public Radio keeps a running list of musicians livestreaming their talents for us all to enjoy here.

This historic palace was commissioned by King David Kalakaua and completed in 1882. An earlier palace, known as Hale Alii (House of the Chief), was demolished in 1874.

During a recent visit I was intrigued to learn about King Kalakaua's interest in the modern amenities of the day, including indoor plumbing.

The king also replaced the gas chandeliers installed when the palace was first built with electric lights, just seven years after Thomas Edison invented the first incandescent light bulb.

King Kalakaua also installed a modern communications system, which included the newly invented telephone.

While the Iolani Palace is closed for now, you can still take a virtual tour, which allows visitors to roam through the building beyond the stanchions, climb the majestic koa staircase, and see remarkable artifacts on display on your computer or mobile device.

Five questions with Angella Bennett, regional director of the Canadian office of the Jamaica Tourist Board.

How do you measure tourism numbers for your destination?

Jamaica evaluates international visitors on an annual basis, with the majority of tourists arriving from four primary markets: the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom and Europe.

Prior to the COVID-19 crisis, the destination showed very strong numbers in the beginning of 2020 and welcomed more than o million international visitors to the island in January and February.

How has COVID-19 impacted tourism in your region?

Tourism in Jamaica is all encompassing; it is the most significant area of our economy and the industry impacts the life of everyone on the island. Tourism accounts for nine per cent of the GDP.

And while the effects of COVID-19 are being felt across the globe, the pandemic has had a particularly devastating impact on Jamaica because we rely so heavily on tourism.

Jamaica confirmed its first case of COVID-19 on March 9 and the island’s borders were closed to inbound travellers at the end of March and remain closed until further notice in order to contain the spread of the virus.

With the country closed to incoming arrivals, resorts, hotels and attractions have been forced to close temporarily. Almost 10 per cent of the country’s workforce is employed directly by the tourism sector. To date, 75 per cent of tourism employees — approximately 120,000 people — have been impacted by the crisis.

It's views like this that have tourist from around the world flocking to Jamaica. Photo JTB

Do you believe the virus has changed the way people are looking at travel?

Absolutely. I think the current limitations on movement have given people the opportunity to feel truly grateful for the amazing experiences that travel can create — we will not be taking our ability to hop on a plane for granted ever again.

This period of social distancing is a time of reflection and dreaming of future travel, and checking off those “bucket list” destinations and imagining all the places we want to explore.

While some people may be more anxious to travel internationally in the immediate future, I think the majority of Canadians will be ready and excited to travel again when the time is right.

What does the future hold for your destination and when do you think it will be welcoming visitors once again?

One thing we’ve seen time and time again is that the travel and tourism industry is very resilient, we have recovered from international crises and natural disasters before and I believe Jamaica as a destination will rebound stronger than ever following this pandemic.

Given the nature of this global health crisis, it’s hard to predict when and how we will be able to welcome visitors again, but we are optimistic that things will start to return to normal in the fall and winter season.

As an island, we are working hard to eradicate the virus and open our borders as quickly — and as safely — as possible.

What travel trends do you predict for later this year and 2021?

When social distancing measures are lifted, we predict there will be a lot of pent-up demand for overseas travel.

While people may be inclined to stay closer to home at first, we are hopeful that Jamaica will be one of the first international spots that Canadians gravitate to as the Caribbean will feel low-risk compared to other popular tourist hotspots such as Europe and Asia.

I also think people will be more mindful of personal hygiene and cleanliness when travelling, especially internationally and on airplanes. We’ll likely see increased usage of sanitizing tools and personal masks as people want to protect themselves — and others — when crossing international borders.

With that in mind, the Jamaican government is currently working on developing an online training program in collaboration with employers on the island to ensure all staff in the tourism sector are fully equipped and prepared to operate in a post-COVID environment.

No one can predict the future, but the Jamaica Tourist Board hopes popular events and festivals will return in one way or another in 2021. Photo JTB

But meanwhile…

The Jamaica Tourist Board is working hard to keep Jamaica top-of-mind among travellers, while respecting the calls for social distancing. We understand that travel isn’t possible right now, so we want to bring the spirit of the island home to Canadians.

With that in mind, we’ve launched a few different digital promotions and social media campaigns to provide travellers with a virtual escape:

Escape to Jamaica Instagram Campaign: In March, the @visitjamaica Instagram page launched an “Escape to Jamaica” campaign designed to transport viewers to the tropical destination through a series of videos featuring Jamaican personalities from the island and around the world.

Over the coming weeks, followers can get a taste of Jamaica through a series of recorded wellness sessions, chef demos, cocktail lessons and virtual DJ dance parties. All content will be shared on IGTV to be viewed live or later on.

Spotify Playlist: In a time of uncertainty and social distancing, it's important to try and find new ways to lift your spirits and bring a sense of normalcy back into your life.

The JTB wants to help ease your worries and transport you on a musical island getaway with our specially curated Spotify playlist featuring the country's top musical legends. The destination's Every Little Thing is Gonna Be Alright playlist reminds us to keep our heads high and attitude bright with melodies from Bob Marley, Jimmy Cliff, Beenie Man and many more.

“I wanted to do something creative that day (March 23) to fill the void that the (Gateway) show would have. So, I decided to do it to honour the fact that I was supposed to start rehearsal that day,” explained Jason Sakaki, a Steveston resident and McMath secondary grad.

Gateway Theatre’s production, From Alaska, was cancelled earlier this month due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Sakaki added, “(I didn’t) think it would pick up so much traction with many people being super invested in the show,” which was staged in every room in his house to give the impression of set changes.

Sakaki’s choice of Les Miserables was no coincidence.

Les Miserables is a story about people going through a difficult time, similar to what Richmond and the world is going through today, he explained.

“We’re in this time of ‘what’s happening next’ and no one really knows. Even though the musical takes place in the 1800s, it’s completely relevant to what we’re experiencing right now,” Sakaki added.

Like many residents, the pandemic is affecting Sakaki as a performing artist financially, but the fear of the community turning away from theatre frightens him even more.

“It’s a little bit unsettling for actors because we don’t know when it’s going to end. Since we will not be able to get back to work until it’s fully over. That’s the scary thing right now I think,” said Sakaki.

“What we’re a little scared about is when we come back, are people going to come back to theatres and so … we want to keep them interested in what we’re doing.”

Sakaki will be hosting another one-man production of Beauty and the Beast on April 3 at 7 p.m. on Instagram @jasonsakaki.

With social isolation becoming the new normal and choirs everywhere forced to stop meeting in person, Chor Leoni is launching a new weekly show starting Wednesday, April 1 at 7 p.m.

The Vancouver-area men’s choir will share the livestream on Facebook, YouTube and Instagram.

The Inside Chor Leoni Livestream will be hosted by artistic director Erick Lichte, from his home, and will include high-quality concert videos from the past seven years of filming at the choir’s shows.

The choir will also be creating new video content from its albums, pairing its music with artwork from local artists in an effort to reach out and help all artists as much as it can at a time that’s challenging the entire arts and cultural sector.

The livestream will also include a weekly guest – a locally or internationally recognized music luminary, with an interview and video.

Viewers will also be able to interact within the live comments section.

Lichte underscored the importance of choral music, especially at this time of global uncertainty.

“I believe that choral music has a unique healing quality,” he said in a press release. “It can offer serenity, beauty and can connect with people in ways I don’t even understand. We want to pair this music power with the fun wrapping of a show in a way that is very Chor Leoni.

“Choral music is, for me, the ultimate way in which people can come together. This show won’t replace the community we share as a choir and with our audience, but hopefully it will move us from our current reality to the day we can again bring our voices together and they can be heard.”

For the April 1 livestream, the guest is conductor Ethan Sperry, talking about Translations, his new recording of the works of Latvian composer Eriks Esenvalds on the Naxos label.

The show will also premiere the first video for the album’s recording of Esenvalds’ In Paradisum, paired in video with paintings by renowned Vancouver artist Tiko Kerr.

To soothe any concerns guests might have regarding cruising in the time of COVID-19, many are offering guarantees that include either refunding money back should they decide to cancel their trip or adding extra perks if they rebook.

article continues below

On March 13, Transport Canada issued a formal health advisory, recommending that Canadians avoid going on cruise ships at this time due to COVID-19 and the health risk it poses, particularly in close quarters.

In 2019, Canada welcomed more than 140 cruise ships from more than 10 different countries. The cruise industry brings more than two million travellers to Canada annually.

But, in response to COVID-19, the Government of Canada deferred the start of the cruise ship season in Canada, from April 2 to July 1, 2020 — at the earliest. This deferral applies to cruise ships capable of carrying more than 500 passengers and crew members.

Also on March 13, Cruise Lines International Association, the industry's largest trade association, announced all its member cruise lines would voluntarily suspend cruise ship operations to and from U.S. ports of call for 30 days.

But prior to those cancellations, several major cruise lines continued with planned trips leading to the spread of COVID-19, lengthy quarantines for passengers, and ships stuck in limbo as countries refused to allow them to dock.

But now the cruise ship industry wants to rebuild and many of the major players are offering guaranteed refunds for cancellations, in some cases with as little as 24-hours notice.

Here’s a short list of just some of the cruise lines planning to return to open waters as soon as next month — and what they’re offering.

American Cruise Line: river cruises

Voluntarily suspended operations until April 30, 2020

Cruise with Comfort plan

The new plan includes assurance from American that it will protect Travel Advisor (agents) commissions for bookings impacted by COVID-19. Earlier this month, American proactively rolled out flexible new options for guests and has now bundled them into one simple Travel Advisor Assurance Plan for agents.

This new option offers flexibility to guests for all new and existing bookings on cruises departing through Aug. 31, 2020. Guests opting for this offer have the ability to cancel for any reason up to 24-hours prior to the start of their cruise package and to receive cruise vouchers equal to 100 per cent of the amounts paid.

Guests booked on any cruises that have been suspended by American have the option to receive a full money-back refund or cruise vouchers equal to 125 per cent of all amounts paid for their package.

Globus: Globus, Cosmos, Monograms and Avalon Waterways

Voluntarily suspended operations until April 30, 2020

Peace of Mind plan

The plan provides travellers booked to depart from now through April 30, 2020 the freedom to reschedule their vacation in 2020, 2021 or 2022 to any destination, with any of the Globus family of brands, without incurring cancellation fees.

The plan also offers travellers an additional credit of $50 to $200 CDN per person (depending on which brand they originally booked with) when they reschedule their plans.

Norwegian Cruise Line

Voluntarily suspended operations until April 11

Peace of Mind policy

Guests who were booked on suspended cruises with embarkation dates from March 13 through April 11, 2020 will automatically receive a 125 per cent or 150 per cent refund (depending on the original cruise date) of their cruise fare in the form of a future cruise credit, which can be applied towards any Norwegian Cruise Line voyage through Dec. 31, 2022. Future cruise credits will be applied to their account by April 1, 2020.

For all cruises through Sept. 30, guests can cancel up to 48 hours prior to their vacation start date and receive a future cruise credit for sailings through December 2022.

For all cruises Oct. 1 and beyond, guests can cancel for a full refund up to 120 days before their cruise.

Other changes include: rigorous pre-embarkation screenings, no-touch temperature checks for all guests and crew, disinfection and sanitization protocols on all ships

Royal Caribbean

Voluntarily suspended operations until May 12

Cruise with Confidence

Royal Caribbean will now let guests cancel any cruise that sets sail from now through July 31, 2020. Whether it’s a booking you already have or one you make right now, you’re covered.

As long as guests cancel at least 48 hours before they set sail, they’ll receive a future cruise credit, which can be used toward any cruise that sets sail through Dec. 31, 2021.

Carnival Cruise Lines

Voluntarily suspended operations until April 10

Health and safety updates

Carnival is also offering full refunds on certain cruises and extra credits up to $600 for guests who reschedule their cruise.

Staring this year, Carnival will be denying boarding to guests 70 years of age or older unless they have a letter from their physician confirming they are fit to sail.

Additionally, all guests will be asked if they have been hospitalized in the past two months or if they have a history of chronic or severe medical conditions. Chronic conditions are defined as an illness persisting for a long time or constantly recurring, such as diabetes, heart, kidney or lung disease.

Additional severe medical conditions include: suppressed immunity (active cancer, taking steroids) or if the person requires oxygen for any reason. Guests with chronic or severe medical conditions will not be allowed to sail.

Holland America

Voluntarily suspended operations until April 15

Book with Confidence

For cruises departing on or before July 31, 2020, guests can cancel their cruise no less than 48 hours before departure and a future cruise credit will be automatically applied to their mariner number in approximately two weeks — no further action is required.

For bookings made between March 1 and April 30, 2020 on cruises departing Aug. 1 to Oct. 15, 2020, guests must complete a form to receive a future cruise credit.

Canadians who are planning to travel abroad are reminded to consult the Government of Canada’s Travel Advice and Advisories and register with the Registration of Canadians Abroad service.

Under the Canadian Transportation Agency’s (CTA) new Air Passenger Protection Regulations (APPR), which roll out Dec. 15, passengers will be provided with compensation of up to $1,000 for flight delays or cancellations, for reasons within the airlines control (except safety reasons).

article continues below

Passengers will also be provided with amenities, for example, food and drink, access to communication and hotel accommodations, in the event of delays or cancellations.

The regulations apply to any airlines flying to, from and within Canada.

Starting Sunday, airlines will have to take steps to seat children under the age of 14 near to their accompanying adult at no extra cost.

Proximity to the accompanying adult will depend on the child’s age. For example, if a child is under 5 years old, the adult will need to be in an adjacent seat, but if the child is 12 or 13 years old, they will be separated from the adult by no more than one row.

“Air travellers will now have full rights when things don’t go as expected,” said Minister of Transport Marc Garneau.

“With input from air travellers and the air industry, we have created a world-leading approach to air passenger rights that is clear, consistent, transparent and fair.”

If airlines fail to follow the new rules, they could face a penalty of up to $25,000 per incident, according to the CTA.

“Both air passengers and airlines deserve a consistent approach that allows passengers to be treated fairly while ensuring the industry remains strong and competitive,” said Garneau.

The CTA has also developed an online tool, available at airpassengerprotection.ca, to help passengers learn about their rights and file air travel complaints.

An earlier update to APPR came into effect in July, which provided regulations related to denied boarding, transporting musical instruments, communication and lost or damaged baggage.

The CTA began developing the APPR in May 2018 and conducted a three-month consultation with travellers, consumer rights groups and the airline industry.",[]

Book a cozy cabin stay

Rowena’s Inn on the River is situated in Harrison Mills, B.C. and is a boutique resort with golf course that has been welcoming guests since 1995. The property was first developed a century ago by the Pretty family, though the last surviving member of the family opted to sell it to Sandpiper Resort, who has operated it since 2016.

Guests staying at Rowena’s are either in the manor house or in private cottages that are outfitted with all the amenities of home, including roomy bathtubs for soaking your cares away, and romantic fireplaces for evening cuddles. Rowena’s recently debuted a slate of brand-new one-, two-, and three-bedroom luxury cabins, complete with gas fireplaces and TVs (if you want your fireplace snuggle paired with cable or your Netflix or Disney+ account – both apps are built in).

The new cabins are spacious and well-equipped, including a full-size fridge and kitchen gear (everything but a stove/oven) and are just a stone’s throw from the original cottages on site, giving you easy access to walking trails, the golf course, and the clubhouse restaurant.

Go eagle watching

Bald eagles are a huge part of the draw at Rowena’s – in fact, the property prides itself on offering prime eagle viewing. Whether you are just a casual observer or a dedicated eagle-eyed eagle watcher or photographer, you will definitely see plenty of the majestic birds during your stay as they swoop from their tree-top perches to the river to get their salmon. There’s a marked trail that leads to a viewing deck along the river’s edge where you can set up a watching post, however you will also spy eagles just as you move about the resort property.

Explore Harrison Hot Springs

As their motto goes, Harrison Hot Springs really is “just up the road.” Not only is it an easy drive from Metro Vancouver (and can be a lovely leisurely one if you take the Lougheed Highway, aka the “Scenic 7”) but if you’re based at Rowena’s at Harrison Mills, the charming lakeside down is just a short drive away.

In Harrison Hot Springs you can walk along the lakeshore and Esplanade, poke in the gift shops, take a soothing swim in the public hot springs pool, and enjoy the surrounding nature.

Search for Sasquatch

Look for Sasquatch while in Harrison Hot Springs. You might find a few! Photo Lindsay William-Ross/Vancouver Is Awesome

The legend of Sasquatch looms large in the region. Particularly ideal for families, there’s a self-guided Sasquatch “trail” in Harrison Hot Springs you can follow, which makes for a fun way to see the sights, learn a bit, and enjoy the day away. Start off at Tourism Harrison Hot Springs’ office on your way into town (well, first you may want to stop at the welcome sign for your first big photo-op) and check out the Sasquatch Museum.

As you make your way around town, keep an eye out for all sorts of tributes to the Sasquatch. They make for great selfie spots, and are a lot safer than running into the real deal.

Eat delicious food

If you’re staying at Rowena’s, you’re in luck – the Clubhouse restaurant on site is open for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and weekend brunch. They focus on local and seasonal ingredients, so you’ll find things like Harrison salmon and Fraser Valley Duck in dishes, or beautiful B.C. strawberries in their crave-worthy strawberry balsamic salad dressing. Daytime eats lean towards the casual – including portable breakfast eats like bagels and smoked salmon or a breakfast sandwich for golfers or explorers on the go. Come dinnertime, they have a range of salads, soups, appies, and mains, including house specials like a salmon Wellington, roast beef with Yorkshire pudding, and Schnitzel. Their weekend brunch spread is a standout, with everything from build your own tacos to waffles and whipped cream.

Down the road in Harrison Hot Springs, look for spots that celebrate all things local, like Muddy Waters Cafe, a casual bistro that features affordable, approachable fare that often showcases local bounty. Even somewhere like the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory takes a cue from the local scene; owner Mark Schweinbenz makes chocolate Sasquatch feet available on sticks, or big caramel ones loaded with toppings for an extra sugar rush.

Enjoy the drive

It’s worthwhile to make the time to take the slower route on Highway 7 for some or all of your trip out to Harrison Mills and Harrison Hot Springs. Called the “Scenic 7,” you can wind your way through diverse landscape and choose your own adventure along the way. Do some shopping, get fresh-made cheese from local producers, go on hikes, or just enjoy the views.

And while it would be nice for everyone to know the right answers when addressing finance and personal debt, this isn’t always the case.

article continues below

A recent Loans Canada survey of 1655 credit-constrained Canadians revealed upwards of 70 per cent of those surveyed perceived themselves as financially literate, however when questioned about their financial habits, their performance told a different story.

The study affirmed that many Canadians are not saving regularly. And while over half of the survey respondents felt confident about their financial literacy, many admittedly are not tracking their expenses or spending habits or paying their credit card bills in full every month.

And the most surprising survey finding? Those who believe to be financially knowledgeable typically have more debt than people who claim their financial literacy is lacking.

Read all of LoansCanada.ca’s findings here.

Why are Canadians in Debt?

Canadians spend money fairly easily with the average Canadian consumer debt looming around $8,500, which doesn’t include their mortgage. Approximately 12 per cent have consumer debt of over $25,000.

Forming bad spending habits combined with not tracking expenses or paying credit card bills in full each month can lead to debt – quickly. The larger the debt, the more difficult it becomes to pay off.

People in Vancouver who lack basic financial literacy and management skills often find themselves in debt, making it challenging to climb out of a personal financial crisis.

Almost half of credit-constrained Canadians have taken out multiple loans, with 44 per cent doing so just to make ends meet.

The devastating effects of financial illiteracy and the consequences of debt

Canadians who are financially illiterate may find themselves in overwhelming debt, with poor credit ratings and derailed savings plans which in turn creates barriers to make ends meet or meet future goals or aspirations.

How can Canadians get a better grasp of debt problems?

Keep track of all debts

Making a detailed debt list will give a clear financial picture. This assessment will help form the best strategy to reduce or eliminate debt.

Maintain a monthly budget

Creating a monthly budget, which outlines financial obligations including car and mortgage payments, variable costs and debt repayment, is an important step. Get creative, determine needs from wants, and find new ways to reduce spending.

Pay bills on time, pay in full (if possible)

Many survey respondents believe that making the minimum credit card payment avoids interest charges. It doesn’t. Paying on time and in full helps avoid interest payments and potential credit score damage.

Lower the cost of debt

It’s smart to pay down high-interest rate debts first. Refinancing or consolidating high-cost loans may lead to a lower payment.

Financial well-being is achieved by improving financial literacy. Loans Canada’s research shows that being confident about financial knowledge does not guard against the pitfalls of bad financial behaviours.

""Canadians have access to free financial literacy resources, made available from both government and private institutions,” explains Cris Ravazzano, Loans Canada Chief Technology Officer. “For example, Canada.ca has a whole section dedicated to money and finances with great information that all Canadians can benefit from. And at Loans Canada we're always creating educational content about credit building and debt saving strategies. I think more effort is required to increase awareness about these types of resources.""

Gaining and maintaining financial literacy is the foundation of good financial outcomes and greater financial health as a whole.",[]

""While we're already popular with locals for day trips, we'd love to have them experience all there is to do when you stay in Resort for a longer period.""

Whistler Mountain – once called London Mountain, was stumbled upon more than 50 years ago by Vancouver businessman and outdoor enthusiast, Franz Wilhelmsen.

""Wilhelmsen and his friends had to spend hours logging their way through,"" Kevin says. Undeterred, Wilhelmsen and his friends kept the dream alive and officially opened the first Whistler Mountain ski run in 1966.

""They didn't want the mountain to have the same name as a city renowned for its fog,"" Kevin laughs, ""so they changed the name to Whistler after the whistling sound made by the hoary marmots who lived there.""

In 1981, another group of entrepreneurs opened a ski run on Blackcomb Mountain. The two resorts maintained a friendly rivalry until March 1997, when ownership merged to create Whistler Blackcomb.

""Today, we're not just known for the skiing or snowboarding,"" Kevin says. ""We're a four season resort with something for everyone in the family.""

Resort Reservations Whistler was established in 2001 as a one-stop booking and information channel for Whistler Blackcomb. “Whether you’re seasoned on the slopes, or just looking for a relaxing escape from the city, Whistler has something for you,” says Kevin, “our website allows you to book everything from your accommodation and lift tickets, to a day at the spa.”

But Doug Burnett, Senior Food and Beverage Manager with Whistler Blackcomb says the resort is challenging that idea with its array of dining options, from the casual to the ultra-luxe. “We spend a lot of time trying food trucks in Vancouver to see what our market is interested in,” he explains. Here are three on-mountain dining experiences to enjoy this summer:

1) Mountain Top Summer Feast. Burnett says the dining offering he is most excited about this season is “the brand new deck space at the Roundhouse Lodge at the top of the Whistler Village Gondola where every Friday, Saturday and Sunday there’ll be an incredible, mountain-top buffet feast with live music, situated at 1,800 meters (6,000 feet).” June 23 – Sept 2, seating at 5:30, 6, 6;30 and 7 pm; June 16, Sept 8, 15, 22 & 20 Saturdays only 5:30, 6, 6:30 and 7 pm.

2) Christine’s on Blackcomb. Perched high in the Blackcomb Mountain alpine, inside the newly renovated Rendezvous Lodge, Christine’s Restaurant elevates the definition of summer dining at Whistler Blackcomb. The menu showcases the flavour of modern West Coast cuisine. With panoramic views of the Coast Mountains, the experience is just as savory as the meal itself. Open June 30 – Sept 2.

3) Winemakers Dinner. Winemaker-hosted après and dinners are a Whistler Blackcomb must-do, with a B.C. winemaker speaking and a new winery featured each month in the winter, and once in the summer. Saturday, July 28, the mountain is featuring SunRock Vineyard with presentations by viticulturalist Troy Osbrone, of Arterra Wines Canada. Brush up on all your vine knowledge, and toast at the new Umbrella Bar at the Roundhouse Lodge. As Jennifer Smith, Public Relations Senior Specialist with Whistler Blackcomb Vail resorts, puts it: “A winemaker’s event, whether summer or winter, is a beautiful way to connect with your inner foodie, and having access to a viticulturist to learn about the way the grapes are grown really will really take the mountain-top dining experience to the next level.”

There’s nothing quite like the buzz of the casino for a night out: The thrill of hitting the tables or playing the slot games and winning, the atmosphere, and the overall experience. But if you’re more interested in gambling than the glitz, online casinos might be a better option.

First, there’s simple convenience: You don’t need to get in your car or battle the crowds on a busy night. Modern online casinos can be accessed from your PC or mobile, without you needing to download software or apps. There’s also the range of choice. Online casinos from around the world offer thousands of different slot machines. The ones that cater to Canadian players tend to provide the entire selection from multiple developers, usually resulting in a selection of over 1,000 different games. There are also better graphics such as 3D animations.

Then, there’s the money. Overheads for land-based casinos are much higher than for online, so they need to make more profit, which disadvantages the player. Online, there are higher payout percentages (the percentage of the money you wager that you will get back), sometimes exceeding the payout percentages of table games. There are also promotions that don’t exist in the conventional casino world.

Casino slot bonuses are only available at online casinos and add to your gaming opportunities. The majority of online casinos provide players with slot bonuses from the moment they sign up. These special promotions give you additional cash to play your favourite games and discover new ones.

There are many different slot bonuses available, of which the cash bonus is the most popular. These are known as match bonuses that give you additional cash when you make a deposit so that you can play more games or even increase your betting values with each spin to activate the biggest jackpots.

You can also activate these bonuses in the form of a free spin, which is similar to a match bonus, but instead of giving you the cash in the very beginning, the casino allows you to play some of the latest games and activate your bonus at the same time.",[]

The support extends beyond donations and sponsorship, through direct involvement, volunteerism and engagement.

Every Monday night from 6 to 8 p.m., music will be lowered at the indoor trampoline park and the trampolines will be turned over to those with autism and other children with special needs.

“There’s not a lot of places where people with special needs can go and be embraced,” says Morey Chaplick, owner of Sky Zone Trampoline Park in Surrey. “We just want to give back.”

Sensory Nights is launching during Autism Awareness Month. The staff have had a training session with the Canucks Autism Network in preparation for the evening sessions.

The initiative is just one of the ways Chaplick is making Sky Zone accessible for a wide range of people. The park currently welcomes people of all ages, from toddlers on up.

“If you can walk, you can jump,” Chaplick says.

Sky Zone offers Toddler Time sessions throughout the week, so that the little ones can bounce around without the big kids, and at half the price. There’s also a separate toddler court at all times, though regular prices are in effect any time other than Toddler Time.

There’s no charge for caregivers, and Sky Zone also has a parents’ lounge where grownups can relax while experienced court monitors ensure their children are safe.

Teenagers also have their own special night. Teens 16 yrs. or older can come out at 10 p.m. on Saturdays for SkyJam. The evening includes 90 minutes of jump time, plus two pizza slices and a soda. SkySlam, Ultimate Dodgeball and the Foam Zone will all be available, so that teens can listen to music and bounce around the park with their friends.

“Old-growth trees are historic giants that slowly grew to immense sizes over a period of 1000-2000 years,” says Josh Hooge, co-owner of J&S Reclaimed Wood Custom Furniture in Vancouver. “Due to fierce competition for sunlight, water, and nutrients, the coniferous trees of the Pacific Northwest historically grew up to 400ft feet tall and were 20ft in diameter, and they produced dense, strong timbers of very tight grain.”

article continues below

“The only remaining source of that old-growth lumber is from torn down structures like old barns and heritage buildings,” Josh says. “Almost all the old-growth trees were harvested more than 100 years ago. The only ones left are solitary giants found in protected parks and hard to reach mountainsides.”

So Josh, with his business partner, Steve McFarlane, salvage the old timbers to make beautiful custom furniture like dining tables, coffee tables, bar carts and bookcases.

In addition to old growth wood, J&S Reclaimed Wood also salvages lumber from shipping pallets to make their furniture. Shipping pallets are often too expensive to ship back for reuse, so they are made to use one time and then discarded, collecting in alleyways or dumped in the landfill to be incinerated.

“Pallet wood is usually rough-sawn planks of oak, maple, hickory, ash, poplar, mahogany, pine, and fir that have nail holes, wear marks from use and aging from its journey that is unique to each pallet,” says Josh. “We collect the unwanted pallets, break them down at our shop and reuse the planks to make our furniture. There’s no waste left over; we recycle the nails, and the broken pieces get picked up with all our scraps for firewood.”

“Our customers and clients want to support sustainable practices and support local businesses,” Steve adds. “We make everything from local products and materials, purchased from local businesses as much as possible”

Besides being environmentally friendly, each piece of hand-made furniture tells a story.

“With wood, the colour, weight, growth rings patterns, and grain patterns tell the story of the life of the tree,” says Steve. “You can tell about the different climate events the tree experienced, floods and fires, harsh winters and droughts, local terrain and growing conditions, how long the tree took to grow and if it’s old-growth or not.”

Furniture made from old-growth lumber also preserves our local history, says Josh. “They represent the loggers who felled the trees by axe and saw, the old sawmills and mill workers who cut the logs into planks, and the historic buildings that were built from them.”

“The timbers are part of our heritage in Vancouver,” he adds, “from small muddy backwater to a growing international city. It’s also part of our country’s heritage and identity.”

1. How is the cannabis extracted?

article continues below

Most makers of cannabis oil use solvents to extract it from the plant – the whole plant is soaked in chemicals such as butane or ethanol. Afterwards, the solvent is removed, but this usually leaves some residue and by-products that are potentially harmful. Consultant Tony Antal, who works with B.C.-based company Pure Pulls, believes that CO2 extraction is a cleaner, safer option. “CO2 is non-toxic and after extraction, it’s completely gone, so all you get is the pure oil,” he says.

“Pure Pulls was the first company in the Canadian cannabis industry to invest in a CO2 extraction machine.”

2. Which active compounds are present in the product?

The medical component of cannabis is CBD, while the psychoactive component is THC. Antal says consumers shouldn’t be put off by the mind-altering effects of THC. “In fact, THC has its own medical properties so it makes a good complement to CBD – when the two are combined, the CBD may minimize the psychoactive effects, while the THC may amplify the medical ones. The ideal proportions are 80 per cent CBD, 20 per cent THC,” he says.

3. Where was the cannabis sourced?

When you buy your cannabis at a dispensary, you should ask to see the test information on the product. This will tell you the proportion of different compounds in the oil, where it was grown, and so on. Many producers don’t release that information, but Pure Pulls tests and labels every batch of its oils, which are extracted from plants grown in B.C.

4. What is the recommended method of consumption?

According to Antal, the preferred option for most medical cannabis users is vaping, because research suggests that this limits carcinogen exposure, compared to smoking. Vaping is also more discreet and allows the user to better regulate their dosage.

5. How is the cannabis industry regulated?

Currently, most laws relate to business owners running shops and dispensaries. As of today, there are no set standards governing the quality of the product itself. Pure Pulls’ self-imposed standards are similar to those put in place by the cosmetics and foods industry, and are designed to provide consumers with a consistent, safe experience.

Coastal Sleep is a sleep clinic with six locations on the Lower Mainland, offering testing and treatment for sleep apnea in English, French, Punjabi, Mandarin and Cantonese.

""With our team of trained Registered Respiratory Therapists (RRT), we've been helping people get to the root of their sleep issues for almost 15 years, "" says Paul Sweeney, a Registered Respiratory Therapist (RRT) and President of Coastal Sleep.

Testing for sleep apnea is the first step, says Paul. Just ten years ago, that involved spending a night in the hospital hooked up to numerous wires and contraptions. It also involved a very long wait list.

""We can help expedite the process of being tested,"" Paul says. ""We offer an in-home testing kit that allows you to do the test in the comfort of your own home.""

The test involves a take-home monitor, nasal device, and pulse and oxygen detector. That’s it.

""Your family doctor might refer you to us,"" Paul says, ""or you can call directly. In either scenario, we like to work closely with your physician. We share your test results with them and usually they will refer you back to Coastal Sleep for treatment.""

That one phone call can relieve your loved ones from the anxiety and discomfort related to shopping around for the best funeral services rate at a time of emotional stress.

""Unfortunately, we live in denial,"" says Nicole.

The notion of establishing a framework to commercialize cannabis began as a promise by the Liberal Party in the 2015 federal election campaign that led to Justin Trudeau becoming prime minister. The implementation of the policy was not as smooth as first envisioned, and the provincial governments were put in charge of setting guidelines for the sale and consumption of marijuana.

article continues below

Research Co. and Glacier Media have been tracking perceptions about legalization every six months in British Columbia. Our latest survey shows that agreement with the new rules remains high across the entire province, that some residents are starting to ponder a future when other drugs could be treated in the same fashion as cannabis, and that – in stark contrast with what we found last year – marijuana users in British Columbia are starting to acquire all of their product through licensed retailers.

As more time passes, British Columbians appear happier with the decision to end prohibition. Seven in 10 of the province’s residents (70%) agree with marijuana being legal in Canada, while 26% disagree and 3% are undecided.

These findings represent a seven-point increase since a similar survey conducted in October 2019, as legal cannabis approached its first anniversary. The groups that are more likely to voice satisfaction with the new status quo are men (75%), British Columbians aged 35 to 54 (76%) and residents of northern B.C. (80%).

In recent weeks, we have seen more talk about creating a safe supply for drugs that are currently available only through illegal means. The impact of these discussions has led to a shift in the views of British Columbians about legalizing all drugs. It must be completely acknowledged that sizable majorities of the province’s residents continue to oppose a move to place any controlled substance inside a store, but the proponents of this option have grown since late last year.

At least two-thirds of British Columbians are opposed to legalizing ecstasy (66%), powder cocaine (70%), heroin (72%), crack cocaine (73%), methamphetamine or “crystal meth” (74%) and fentanyl (75%).

Support for making some of these drugs available in a fashion that would conceivably meet the same guidelines that govern cannabis has risen over the past six months, to 25% for cocaine (up from 18%) and to 24% for heroin (up from 19%). While these are still low proportions, the fluctuation could signal the start of a trend.

Just 10% of British Columbians say they only consumed marijuana after it became legal. Identical proportions of residents tried it before October 2018 (45%) or have never consumed it in Canada (also 45%). The incidence of “legal-only” marijuana users is highest among residents aged 18 to 34 (18%) and those who live in southern B.C. (19%).

But perhaps the biggest surprise, and a source of satisfaction for policy makers, is the way in which cannabis is being sought by users. Just over half of British Columbians who have consumed marijuana since legalization (51%) say that all of their product was acquired at a licensed retailer. In October 2019, only 31% of cannabis consumers in the province were getting all of their product at a licensed retailer.

We still see 16% of British Columbians who say none of their marijuana has been bought at a licensed retailer – a proportion that climbs to 25% among those aged 55 and over. Two-thirds of cannabis consumers aged 35 to 54 (68%) are buying all of their product at a licensed retailer.

Even though the delivery of cannabis products has improved over the past six months, there are significant regional differences that are indubitably related to the presence of stores in specific areas of the province. Cannabis consumers who reside in southern B.C. and Metro Vancouver are the most likely to be getting all of their product from licensed retailers (63% and 62%). The numbers are significantly lower in Vancouver Island (29%), northern B.C. (24%) and the Fraser Valley (19%).

Finally, the issue of “drug testing” remains a priority for British Columbians, with 61% saying that companies in the province should “definitely” or “probably” be able to administer these examinations to any employee now that marijuana is legal.

After a bumpy start that featured slow store openings and hitches with delivery options, there are signs that cannabis legalization is starting to work in a better fashion. More consumers are getting all of their product through licensed retailers, and the number of “new users” has not increased dramatically. Still, the significant regional disparities suggest that more marijuana outlets will need to be authorized in order to effectively eliminate the black market.

Only 14 people are hospitalized, with five of those in intensive care units. The rest are self-isolating at home. There were no new deaths recorded in the past 24 hours.

Recording at least 20 new COVID-19 cases in a 24-hour period has become common in B.C., and Henry said yesterday that she found that number ""distressing,"" even though, she added, the good news is that the province knows where the clusters of infection are, many of the infections are linked and the number is not really that large given the province's population of more than five million residents.

The numbers in the past week were:

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12;

• 21 new cases on July 13;

• 13 new cases on July 14; and now

• 21 new cases on July 15.

In June, the number of daily new cases many times was in the single digits.

""There is one active community outbreak, in addition to several community exposure events,"" Henry and Dix said. ""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks.""

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,023 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,659 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 216 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 51 people who reside outside Canada.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons is expected to take Sidoo into custody on September 23 and release him from a Pacific Northwest area facility just before Christmas.

article continues below

Sidoo, 61, appeared online via Zoom in front of United States District Judge Nathaniel Gorton of the United States District Court for District of Massachusetts, as well as his lawyers and prosecutors. He wore a plaid suit while sitting in an office space inside his $31.7 million home in Vancouver’s Point Grey neighbourhood.

Sidoo, now a convicted felon, initially pled innocent to fraud and money laundering charges; he teared up before being sentenced and read a prepared statement:

“The last several months have been the hardest in my entire life and today I accept the court’s decision without reservation. No words can express how sorry I am for my decisions and actions that led to this day. I make no excuses, your honour. I broke the law and pled guilty and I now must pay for my actions.

“To my wife and boys, all I ever wanted was your love and respect and to be a good role model. And I know I have made a terrible mistake that has deeply affected our family. To my friends and colleagues and former teammates over the years, I am deeply ashamed today. To the young men and women who looked up to me as a role model, you deserve better. To the court and all of you, I wish to apologize for my actions.

“I will serve my sentence and am committed to returning to the community and doing everything possible to make a positive impact. I hope in time people will not judge me for the worst mistake in my life but for the work in the days, weeks and years ahead in which I am committed to being a better man.”

Gorton told Sidoo he was “impressed” by the businessman’s “obvious remorse.”

But Gorton pointed out two omissions in Sidoo’s statement.

“You expect to put this behind you and go forward and make up for what you called mistakes. I would call it a crime, not a mistake, but nevertheless, it is important that you acknowledge it and realize how many constituencies you have disappointed,” said the judge.

Sidoo also did not explicitly acknowledge that his crimes resulted in two students missing an opportunity to attend the universities his sons, Dylan Sidoo and Jordan Sidoo, were admitted to.

“What you accomplished, along with getting them into college, is to deprive two other deserving students of admittance into those universities — an act that is the very antithesis of one you want to be known for,” said Gorton.

Likewise, United States Attorney Andrew Lelling submitted to Gorton: “Sidoo engaged in serious criminal conduct involving fraud and deception that stretched over multiple years.

“His crimes warrant significant punishment. By engaging in the scheme, with [scheme mastermind Rick Singer] and others, Sidoo was able to steal two college admissions slots for his sons, including one from the University of California at Berkeley, one of the top public universities in the nation.”

Sidoo, said Gorton, “committed a crime that displayed an unbelievable lack of integrity, morality and common sense.

“You have let your selfish desire, your pride and your enormous wealth overcome all of what you apparently want to stand for with your works of charity,” Gorton told Sidoo.

Sidoo’s philanthropy, derived from his earnings in the capital markets, was central to his sentencing defense. According to Sidoo he has donated several million dollars to charitable causes, such as the University of B.C. football program.

In pleading guilty to fraud, Sidoo avoided a maximum prison term of 20 years and prosecutors subsequently agreed to 90 days behind bars, plus a $250,000 fine and one-year of supervised release, which will not be enforced in Canada by the U.S. Probation Department. Prosecutors also agreed to drop the money laundering charge.

The prison Sidoo goes to is expected to have harsher conditions since his options are limited due to his foreign citizenship. His attorney Martin Weinberg said he is expected to spend 14 days in isolation in a “maximum security setting,” due to COVID-19.

Sidoo will get four days credit for time already served. If he serves the full 90 days he will be released December 17 but will have to spend 14 days in isolation at home should B.C. public health rules for international travellers and COVID-19 continue into the fall.

Gorton said Sidoo’s crime would normally warrant more time in jail but there are mitigating circumstances, such as his remorse, lack of criminal record, philanthropy and “collateral consequences,” such as not being able to enter the U.S. as a felon and being stripped last month of his Order of B.C. medal for community service. Sidoo’s attorneys also previously noted he did not directly pay the universities but that his fraud was limited to cheating on the tests.

The former B.C. Lions football player worked as a stock broker in the 1990s and an investment banker between 2000 and 2010. Since 2010 he has made millions of dollars directing a handful of public companies that have failed to generate wealth for retail investors.

Sidoo was arrested March 8, 2019, in San Jose, California, on charges by the U.S. Department of Justice of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering related to the high-profile U.S. college admissions and bribery scandal, brought to light by a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe dubbed Operation Varsity Blues.

One of dozens of parents to be charged, Sidoo initially pled innocent to paying $200,000 total to scheme mastermind William ‘Rick’ Singer, who hired corrupt exam expert Mark Riddell to take Dylan and Jordan’s SAT exams, in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Sidoo also helped falsify one of his son Jordan’s university applications in October 2013 with an essay that originally included a fake claim of Jordan being held up at gunpoint by gangsters, while he was purported to be an intern for an anti-gang organization.

Co-conspirators Singer and Riddell pled guilty last year in exchange for cooperating with the government’s investigation.

The guilty parties in the case, who used Singer’s criminal services, were generally well-off individuals. Celebrities such as actress Lori Loughlin and her clothing designer husband Mossimo Gianulli and actress Felicity Huffman also pled guilty for related crimes and brought much media attention to the investigation.

Sidoo’s sons had no involvement in their father’s crime.

Jordan is now a 2018 history graduate from University of California Berkeley. Dylan graduated in cinematic arts in 2016 from the University of Southern California (USC). The two previously attended Vancouver’s prestigious St. George’s School.

Neither university has announced whether or not their degrees will remain valid. Dylan, according to the sentencing documents, had scored a 1,460/2,400 SAT score until Riddell, using a fake ID in December 2011, bumped up the score to 1,700, which was high enough for Dylan to enter Chapman University (and later transfer to USC). Riddell then scored 2,280/2,400 for Jordan in December 2012, paving the way to Berkley.

Riddell also took a high school test for Dylan. The B.C. Ministry of Education has issued no statement on how its testing process was so vulnerable to fraud.

Both sons have since entered into penny stock promotion with their father.

What are the legal obligations for employers toward employees in the pandemic? Lindsie Thomson, managing partner at the Harris and Co. law firm, discusses the challenges of remote work and returning to work as part of a week-long video podcast series on human resources.

Exactly one week ago, on July 7, the province recorded 12 new cases. What followed was an uptick in recorded cases:

• 18 new cases on July 8;

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12; and

• 21 new cases on July 13.

article continues below

""I know it was distressing to me to see 20, especially 25 [new cases] one day,"" Henry said. ""That's way above my comfort zone.""

She added, however, that the slight rise in cases was not unexpected, given that the province has been allowing restaurants and other indoor businesses to reopen.

""We do know where those cases are,"" she said. ""We're testing the people who need to be tested.""

It would be more concerning, she said, if the cases were spread out across the province in an unlinked way. The most recent cluster of cases is linked to the Krazy Cherry Fruit Company in Oliver, she announced yesterday (July 13).

Given B.C.'s population, 20 cases in one day is also better than some other jurisdictions, she said.

The province has identified 3,128 infections since the virus first appeared in the province in late January.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,015 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1649 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 212 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 52 people who reside outside Canada.

Of the 209 people currently fighting COVID-19 in B.C., 14 people are in hospital with five of those in intensive care units. That leaves 2,730 people who have recovered from the virus.

No new deaths from the virus were identified in the past 24 hours, leaving the death toll at 189 people.

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

So far 399 residents and 252 staff at seniors' care facilities have been infected by COVID-19 in B.C.

Health Minister Adrian Dix said that it is his understanding that the federal government and the U.S. government have agreed to extend the closure of the two countries' border for one additional month, until August 21.

""This is obviously positive and necessary news,"" he said. ""Everybody who lives in B.C. knows how inconvenient and how difficult that is for many businesses and many individuals for a variety of circumstances.""

Harry Bains said injured workers have complained for too long that the system lacks fairness and support in times of injury and recovery.

article continues below

Changes Bains proposes include raising the maximum annual salary on which compensation benefits are based; authorizing WorkSafeBC to provide preventative medical treatment before claim acceptance; giving powers to the court to issue WorkSafeBC search and seizure warrants appropriate for investigating workplace safety infractions; and giving people a voice in serious workplace prosecutions and trials by using victim impact statements.

Victoria is also fast-tracking legislation to handle situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic so workers can access benefits more easily.

During the pandemic, the regulator is allowing businesses to defer paying their premiums for six months without penalty or interest. It is also waiving premiums on wages paid to workers of employers receiving the Canadian Emergency Wage Subsidy.

The amendments to the Workers Compensation Act comes after three expert reviews were completed in 2018 and 2019.

The ministry said of the more than 44,000 injured workers currently receiving permanent disability benefits because of a work-related injury, about 35% are in the Lower Mainland, while the rest are spread throughout all regions of B.C.

There are more than 100,000 workplace injury or fatality claims annually.

In 2019, there were 140 workplace fatalities in B.C. Of that number, 84 were due to occupational disease, 40 to traumatic injury and 16 the result of a motor vehicle incident.

In a fiscal update Tuesday, B.C. Finance Minister Carole James said the COVID-19 pandemic will result in ""the worst downturn experienced in our province in recent history.""

article continues below

""The projected numbers are staggering, but they're not without hope,"" James said, in summing up B.C.'s fiscal position.

She said B.C. had entered the pandemic perhaps better situated than other provinces, as it had a balanced budget, a triple AAA credit rating and one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country.

B.C. also managed to contain the pandemic and flatten its growth curve better than some other provinces, and it has been able to move earlier on a phased economic restart plan.

""Because of that strength, we were able to take immediate action to help people, to help businesses, to help communities with our $5 billion COVID action plan,"" James said.

She said the province is expecting a loss of $4.2 billion in tax revenue, including $1 billion less in personal income tax revenue, $973 million less in corporate taxes, $1.3 billion in provincial sales tax revenue, $300 million in natural resource revenues and $882 million less in Crown Corporation income.

The province is also spending $5 billion in emergency spending, and has approved $1.3 billion in tax credits and deferrals. In total, the increased spending, lost tax revenue and foregone revenue will bring the deficit to $12.5 billion.

In February, James brought down, but never passed, a balanced budget and modest surplus of $227 million and provincial GDP growth projections of 2% in 2020.

""Mere weeks after the budget 2020 was tabled, our entire world changed,"" James said.

James said the B.C. economy is now expected to contract 6.8% in 2020, according to some forecasters.

Since February, B.C. lost 235,000 jobs, and saw retail sales declined by 23.6% in April compared to February. Overall, home prices dropped 4%.

Home sales declined 45.4% in May, compared to February, and B.C. merchandise exports are down 14.7% year-to-date, compared to January to May 2019.

""While the job losses in March and April were record-breaking, figures for May and June in fact have seen some recovery of the losses that we experienced in the previous two months,"" James said.

Asked if her government planned to resort to spending cuts to address the deficit, James said ""now is not the time to be able to cut back on services and support for people and business in British Columbia.""

As for any long-range plans for dealing with debt and deficits, James said: ""I do not believe that it's going to be a quick fix.""

Asked if the $5 billion that her government has already approved could be added to later this year, James said ""I believe the $5 billion is enough now.""

However, she added no one can predict what might happen should there be a second wave of COVID-19.

As for the $22 billion in capital spending allocated in the 2020 budget over three years for big capital works projects, like new schools, hospitals, bridges and roads, that will continue to be spent.

""This is going to serve us very well because it translates into huge investments,"" James said.

188,vancourier,https://www.vancourier.com/living/gun-violence-imported-from-u-s-is-a-key-concern-for-canadians-1.24169958,Gun violence imported from U.S. is a key concern for Canadians,['Mario Canseco'],,"National governments have a tendency to overreact immediately after they are forced to face an unexpected challenge. No example is better than the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks in the United States, which gave us the “Patriot Act” after just 45 days of deliberation to expand government surveillance of Americans to previously unimagined levels.

In mid-April, the actions of Gabriel Wortman led to the deaths of 22 people in Nova Scotia after multiple shootings and fires. Most Canadians, at the time still under lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, were horrified at Wortman’s actions, which included impersonating a police officer.

article continues below

It took the federal government only 13 days after Wortman’s criminal activity was evident for the entire country to announce a nationwide ban on 1,500 types of military-grade “assault-style” weapons in Canada. Any Canadian who possesses these firearms will have two years to get rid of them. The prohibition led to many new discussions about the role that firearms play in Canada’s urban and rural areas.

We know now that the perpetrator of the 22 murders in Nova Scotia had obtained his weapons illegally from Canadian and American sources. This was not a surprise for Canadian authorities, who have consistently reported that more than 70% of the weapons used in gun-related crimes in our country come from the United States.

On the issue of firearms, Canada is decidedly different from the United States. In Canada, it is not legal for a person to own or carry a firearm for the purpose of self defence against human beings. When Research Co. and Glacier Media asked Canadians about this key precept of Canadian law, more than three in four (77%) agreed with it, while 18% disagreed and 5% were undecided.

Atlantic Canada (31%), Saskatchewan and Manitoba (29%) and Alberta (24%) boast the highest number of residents who openly question Canada’s long-standing regulations for firearms. While higher than what is observed in Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia, these are not proportions of voters that would sway an election, certainly not in the way American statewide and congressional races can be tilted if your candidate can adequately hold a shotgun and recite the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution in a manner that panders to the base.

Fewer than one in five Canadians welcome the notion of citizens carrying firearms for something other than hunting or scaring wildlife away. Any survey measuring opinions on banning “assault-style” weapons would be met with near unanimity. The opposition reacted to the announced ban as it always has under its outgoing leader, by claiming the regulations would affect law-abiding Canadians. Lost in this unfortunate combination of inadequate polling and incapable opposition are the solutions that matter to Canadians.

In our survey, more than three in five Canadians (63%) told us that gun violence in Canada is a “very serious” or “moderately serious” problem – a proportion that climbs to 69% among women and 68% among those aged 55 and over.

Sizable majorities of Ontarians and British Columbians, who have experienced gang wars in urban areas, are more likely to look at gun violence as particularly problematic (76% and 67%, respectively). The COVID-19 pandemic did little to curb gun violence in Toronto, where 61 people were shot in the first four months of the year.

We asked Canadians about the effectiveness of four possible measures, and their responses outline a public that is ready for bold action. More than three in five Canadians (62%) think enacting a complete ban on handguns would be “very effective” or “moderately effective” in reducing gun violence in Canada. Most crimes, after all, are not being committed with the military-grade “assault-style” weapons that the federal government was quick to ban.

A higher proportion of Canadians deem two other measures as effective: imposing mandatory jail terms for crimes committed with firearms (74%) and introducing new outreach programs to steer youth away from gangs (also 74%).

Canadians place dealing with firearms smuggled from the United States as the most important issue that needs to be addressed. Many of the country’s residents also want to make sure gangs are not attractive to our country’s youth and believe mandatory minimum jail sentences would act as a deterrent.

Banning military-grade “assault-style” weapons is low-hanging fruit in a challenge that definitely has Canadians preoccupied and wishing for a type of government intervention that goes beyond a photo-op celebrated by poorly executed survey charity work.

True sociologists know that we learn nothing from posing the wrong questions to Canadians, and capable politicians should go beyond voicing displeasure with plans and proposals just because that is what they are expected to do. Meanwhile, Canadians are still worried about gun violence and expecting their elected officials to do better. •

189,vancourier,https://www.vancourier.com/living/sex-with-mish-way-rat-sex-and-the-female-orgasm-1.1420625,Sex with Mish Way: Rat sex and the female orgasm,['Mish Way'],,"Professor Jim Pfaus of Montreal’s Concordia University studies female rats. More specifically, he studies the neurological changes in female rats when they are mating. He’s interested in how female rats feel desire, stimulation. He’s the rat sex guy.

I came across Pfaus’s work in Daniel Bergner’s 2013 book What Do Women Want: Adventures In The Science of Female Desire. Bergner’s coverage of various scientists studying female desire is fascinating and ground-breaking, but Pfaus’s work with the female rats was particularly intriguing to me, because not only did he find that female rats are capable of desire, but that their reason for wanting sex is based on pure pleasure. How long has female pleasure been ignored from the mix of variables of scientific research about sex? Got three hours for me to spout it all off?

article continues below

Rats, like all animals, do not fuck with the conscious motivation of reproduction. They have been designed by evolution to perpetuate their species, but the individual rat does not sit there and think, “Today, I would like to get pregnant and have a million babies.” A rat’s sex drive is based on immediate reward: A desire to bang and get off. We’re talking the battle between seretonin, dopamine, and opioids in the brain.

Pfaus did a bunch of studies. Basing his work off Martha McClintock’s earlier studies on sex with rats (she pioneered the idea that female rats had the will to fuck, they were not just passive vessels as they had been thought of up until the ‘90s), Pfaus set up a cage with a Plexiglas divider big enough for a female rat (not a male) to crawl through. A female rat would determine the pace of sex (like McClintock had discovered years earlier), she would pop in and out of the divided sections, prolonging the sex for as long as she could. She would also always choose a chamber that reminded her of the sex she just did, even when the chamber not associated with sex was much more pleasant than the prior.

Pfaus wasn’t sure about clitoral orgasms in rats, until he had one of his students take a tiny brush and stimulate a female rat’s clitoris for a moment or so, then put the rat back in it’s cage. Almost immediately, the rat climbed up the cage, clamping her teeth down on the student’s sleeve, trying to tell her, “More!” The student brushed the rat again and put her down. She crawled up and begged again. It went on.

This is the thing: The rat’s clitoris had been completely ignored by science for decades. This totally active, nerve-rich protuberance that distinctively stuck out of the animal’s genitals was viewed as unnecessary to the animals mating process because, like the human clitoris, doesn’t serve the body to reproduce, but for pleasure.

The scientific language surrounding heterosexual mating has largely ignored a woman’s pleasure. If you are a woman who has gone through menopause and can no longer make babies, your sexuality is basically invisible.

Last month for a research piece in VICE, I tried out Foria: A THC-infused, coconut oil pre-lube designed to help women who have trouble orgasming relax enough to get in that zone. Foria’s creator, Matthew Gerson, told me his carefully designed product has been most successful for women past menopause. I used it on my vulva as well as ingested it orally, because being slightly stoned makes sex all that much better. Foria is the only thing on a market today of it’s kind: An aid to female sexual dysfunction with the prime concern being pleasure. It’s not approved by the FDA and you can only get it in California, but Foria has become a sensation and curiosity worldwide.

Fucking isn’t just for function. Yes, reproduction is beautiful and I think being a mother is the most incredible job in the world, but sex is also about pleasure. And focusing on only reproduction excludes so many couples who don’t identify within heterosexuality.

Regardless, the pleasure conversation has been opened up. Even science recognizes the importance of female pleasure. If female rats crave orgasms, the most satisfying and basic of all rewards, then of course female humans do too.

When Daniel Bergner titled his book, “What Do Women Want?” I don’t think he expected the answer to mirror that of his own.",[]

What do I say?,['Mish Way'],,"I’m a 25-year-old straight woman who needs help. My boyfriend and I have been dating for around three months. I met him through mutual friends and we hit it off right away. We get along so well, the sex is great and I love spending time with him. However, I recently heard that he had slept with one of my best girlfriends right before we started dating. This was just gossip, so I decided to go straight to the source and ask my friend. She said it was true. They had slept together a few times in what can be described as a “hook-up buddy” situation.

article continues below

She swears she had no real feelings for him and that he didn’t for her. I believe her. I mean, if they liked one another, they would be dating and I wouldn’t be with him, right? I’m not angry at my friend, and we have talked it out. What happened before I met him is not my concern, but I can’t help feeling stupid – like I was left in a dark. I don’t want to let this bother me, but it’s eating away at me. I think about times where we were all together and they had this big secret that I was just oblivious to. I feel like an idiot.

Do I tell my boyfriend I know or do I just leave it? How do I get over this? Help.



Major sucksville on your end, girl. Like a bad sunburn, this isn’t a life-threatening situation, just an irritating pain. You are going to have to practice some serious meditative control.

I just have to say one thing before I launch into how to deal with your boyfriend. I am very impressed about the calm, cool attitude you managed to retain when your friend let you know the truth. This is half the battle, so I applaud you, Miss Cucumber. Very impressive.

You have zero control over what happened in your boyfriend’s sex life prior to you, and like you said, had there been true feeling there, he would be happily shacked up with your girlfriend and not you. Yes, your friend knows what your boyfriend’s balls look like. Yes, she has seen his peaceful, snoring face. Yes, she may even know what it’s like to be cradled to sleep by his strong, warm big-spoon hug, but so what? There’s a bunch of other girls who have experienced this, too. Your friend did the right thing by being truthful with you when the time was right. I think it’s better that you initiated this, not her. Imagine the other option? You tell her about this new guy you are dating, how you like him so much, and winces her face to say, “Ummm, yeah I fucked him, like, six times last month.” Way worse! She didn’t tell you about the incident until you asked because she didn’t want to upset you over something so inconsequential. You both handled the situation well.

Now, what to do about Mr. Right Now. Personally, I would save this little nugget as ammo for the future. Whether you want to use it punishingly in one of your first real fights, or in a more light-hearted manner to just get to watch your movie choice that night, is up to you. (I vote light-hearted. The other choice is kind of psycho.) If you are going to bring it up with him, I suggest you do with that same coolness that you exercised with your pal. There is no point being mad at him about this. He wanted to have sex. Your friend did too. They satisfied an animal urge. They were probably drunk each time they did it. Big whoop. He wasn’t in love with her. You have to laugh this off. It’s so much better for everyone, especially you, if you can find the humour. It’s a powerful, juicy little nugget. Use it wisely, Miss Cucumber.",[]

Based on the novel by Jenny Han, the movie is the story of Lara Jean Covey (Lana Condor), a 16-year-old whose younger sister takes the bold but well-meaning step to send out love letters Lara Jean has been hoarding to the five boys she’s had crushes on in her young life.

The film is smart and sweet, and hits a lot of notes that are appealing to a vast audience. And for viewers in Vancouver, there’s a lot that might look familiar, from the Vancouverite cast members (i.e. Emilija Baranac, Anna Cathcart, and Madeleine Arthur) and the principal locations.

There aren’t many locations used in the film (shortened to TATBILB for hashtag and convenience), but the ones they do use feature prominently in the film. And no surprise, while TATBILB is set in Portland, Oregon (though the books are set in Han’s home state of Virginia), it was filmed in Vancouver.

Die hard fans, take note. Here are the primary Vancouver locations used in To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before. And if you haven’t seen it (or need to see it again), it’s perfect long weekend viewing.

Point Grey Elementary School in Vancouver fills in for Adler Secondary in To All the Boys I've Loved Before.

Adler High School: Point Grey Secondary School

Lara Jean, Peter, Josh, Christine, and Gen all attend the Adler High School, and there is a lot of on screen action here. Filmed at Point Grey Secondary School, you’ll recognize the bright blue track and field (no spoilers!) where a lot of important moments went down, along with the picnic benches, parking lots, and bleachers–though those bleachers were put in for the movie. This school has some famous alumni (like Seth Rogen) and is used quite often for location shoots, so you may also recognize it from shows like Riverdale or The Man in the High Castle.

When Lara Jean needs a break from her life, she heads to the Corner Cafe for a drink and a think. It’s also where she spends some quality time with the men in her life–namely Peter and her dad. The seemingly frozen in time spot holds a lot of memories for the Coveys. They used the exterior and the interior of this quirky North Vancouver diner for the movie.

“I wanted to do something creative that day (March 23) to fill the void that the (Gateway) show would have. So, I decided to do it to honour the fact that I was supposed to start rehearsal that day,” explained Jason Sakaki, a Steveston resident and McMath secondary grad.

Gateway Theatre’s production, From Alaska, was cancelled earlier this month due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Sakaki added, “(I didn’t) think it would pick up so much traction with many people being super invested in the show,” which was staged in every room in his house to give the impression of set changes.

Jason Sakaki took to Instagram for a one-man live stream of Les Miserables. Photo: Video screenshot

Sakaki’s choice of Les Miserables was no coincidence.

Les Miserables is a story about people going through a difficult time, similar to what Richmond and the world is going through today, he explained.

“We’re in this time of ‘what’s happening next’ and no one really knows. Even though the musical takes place in the 1800s, it’s completely relevant to what we’re experiencing right now,” Sakaki added.

Like many residents, the pandemic is affecting Sakaki as a performing artist financially, but the fear of the community turning away from theatre frightens him even more.

“It’s a little bit unsettling for actors because we don’t know when it’s going to end. Since we will not be able to get back to work until it’s fully over. That’s the scary thing right now I think,” said Sakaki.

“What we’re a little scared about is when we come back, are people going to come back to theatres and so … we want to keep them interested in what we’re doing.”

Sakaki will be hosting another one-man production of Beauty and the Beast on April 3 at 7 p.m. on Instagram @jasonsakaki.

With social isolation becoming the new normal and choirs everywhere forced to stop meeting in person, Chor Leoni is launching a new weekly show starting Wednesday, April 1 at 7 p.m.

article continues below

The Vancouver-area men’s choir will share the livestream on Facebook, YouTube and Instagram.

The Inside Chor Leoni Livestream will be hosted by artistic director Erick Lichte, from his home, and will include high-quality concert videos from the past seven years of filming at the choir’s shows.

The choir will also be creating new video content from its albums, pairing its music with artwork from local artists in an effort to reach out and help all artists as much as it can at a time that’s challenging the entire arts and cultural sector.

The livestream will also include a weekly guest – a locally or internationally recognized music luminary, with an interview and video.

Viewers will also be able to interact within the live comments section.

Lichte underscored the importance of choral music, especially at this time of global uncertainty.

“I believe that choral music has a unique healing quality,” he said in a press release. “It can offer serenity, beauty and can connect with people in ways I don’t even understand. We want to pair this music power with the fun wrapping of a show in a way that is very Chor Leoni.

“Choral music is, for me, the ultimate way in which people can come together. This show won’t replace the community we share as a choir and with our audience, but hopefully it will move us from our current reality to the day we can again bring our voices together and they can be heard.”

For the April 1 livestream, the guest is conductor Ethan Sperry, talking about Translations, his new recording of the works of Latvian composer Eriks Esenvalds on the Naxos label.

The show will also premiere the first video for the album’s recording of Esenvalds’ In Paradisum, paired in video with paintings by renowned Vancouver artist Tiko Kerr.

The Instagram jam is the brainchild of Andy Schichter, a record producer and owner of Park Sound Studio on Columbia Street just east of the Ironworkers bridge.

article continues below

“We thought it would be a nice idea to do it for a lot of our friends who have been affected by all this,” he says Friday morning.

After a winter spent writing and recording, spring is usually harvest time for indy bands who hit the road before major festivals and monster bands move in for summer.

“All of them have had their shows cancelled for the next little while,” he notes.

The weekly performances at neighbourhood pubs that are bread-and-butter gigs for musicians are also off the table as stringent restrictions are enacted to stem the public health crisis, he notes.

“Lots of lost income. A lot of them do shift work so they’ve had hours cut back and had to apply for [employment insurance.]”

Some musicians don’t have a safety net, notes Victoria Williams of the Vancouver band Porteau.

“A lot of musicians are in that gig economy and EI isn’t necessarily applicable for them,” she says, noting some of her bandmates who double as music teachers have seen both sources of income dry up recently.

“Quite stressful not knowing . . . when the next bit of support may come their way,” she says.

To provide that support, the Saturday night Instagram concert is a fundraiser with 100 per cent of donations split equally among the artists, according to Schichter.

“We’re trying to just do something to help them out a little bit and hopefully this thing takes off,” he says.

Park Sounds will host the show from its Instagram page at @parksoundbc. The plan is to have each artist pop up in a room big enough to accommodate at least one guitar and one cellphone and play two or three songs.

“We don’t really know what to expect. We didn’t ask,” he says. “We want to be surprised as well. It’s a live show.”

Depending on the logistics of uniting the far-flung members of Porteau by Saturday, Williams says she and her fiancé/bandmate Craig Stevenson may perform a stripped-down acoustic set as a duo.

Porteau, which tends to meld synth and steel guitar with folklore and pop, had been planning to record new music. But as those sessions have been postponed, Williams says they may unveil some new tunes Saturday.

“[It’s a] cool way to play some songs that are on our minds anyway,” she says. “It’ll be nice to share with people.”

The show is meant to supply one of those things music lovers have been missing, Schichter says.

“It’s one of those luxuries that we take for granted, being able to see live music,” he says. “That’s one of many things taken away from us at this moment.”

“We want to make music and we want to lift spirits,” Williams agrees. “All of that is very appreciated in a time when art and culture are momentarily pushed to the wayside by necessity.”

Fans will need an Instagram account to catch the live show. However, Schichter said he’s hoping to post the concert on Facebook on Sunday.

So far, he’s had an enthusiastic response from bands he knows and from band he doesn’t. If all goes well, Schichter says they’ll host a similar show either every Saturday or every other Saturday during the pandemic.

Asked why people should check out the show, Schichter laughs.

“It’s Saturday night: what else are you doing?”

Performers for Saturday’s show also include Elle Wolf, Noble Son, Matt and Sam's Brother, Georgia Lee Johnson and Rabbit Hole, among others.

Twilight will be open every night from Friday, March 20 through Thursday, March 26, rain or shine. They'll be screening Sonic the Hedgehog (PG) at 7:40 p.m. and The Invisible Man (18A) at 9:35 p.m.

Twilight is one just a few remaining operating permanent drive-in theatres in Canada, and one of only a couple left running in British Columbia. They first opened for business in 2005, and operate typically from late winter to late fall, and they show new films only–not classics.

Slated to be shown this season – pending any further changes due to the COVID-19 crisis – include films like Disney Pixar's Soul, Top Gun Maverick, Peter Rabbit 2, Artemis Fowl, and more. Some studios and distributors, however, have already indicated they are postponing releases in 2020 due to COVID-19.

But this week most movie screens in Canada went dark.

Cineplex, the largest movie theatre chain in Canada with 165 cinemas across the country, announced Tuesday that it would close its doors until April 2. Vancouver’s independent cinemas The Cinemateque and the Rio also closed this week, with plans to reopen April 15. And Vancity Theatre suspended all screenings with plans to resume business Thursday, April 16 “at the earliest” and invites regulars to the downtown not-for-profit theatre to help them during this challenging time by purchasing gift cards for future showings at viff.org. A press release from Vancity further says “Since VIFF’s inception, we’ve sought to further empathy and understanding through the art of cinema. We encourage everyone to take this opportunity to demonstrate those attributes as we navigate these unprecedented circumstances as global citizens.”

article continues below

We’re not alone, of course. Stateside, AMC theatres – which had already been limiting audiences to 50 people or less – are now closed for six to 12 weeks. Regal closed all 543 of its theatres “until further notice”. Movie houses in Quebec were ordered closed for a two-week period while home of the Toronto International Film Festival – the Lightbox – has closed until April 14. The same goes for theatres in New York, Los Angeles and Seattle, as well as in other major cities.

Some of the season’s biggest releases had already been scuttled to a later date. Disney’s live-action remake of Mulan was bumped, and the 25th Bond film – No Time to Die – moved from April to a November release date. Paramount Pictures pulled A Quiet Place Part II, starring Emily Blunt, saying “we believe in and support the theatrical experience, and we look forward to bringing this film to audiences this year once we have a better understanding of the impact of this pandemic on the global theatrical marketplace.”

In an unprecedented move, NBCUniversal announced earlier this week that recently released Universal titles The Invisible Man and The Hunt, plus Focus Features’ Emma, will be made available on demand as early as this weekend at a suggested price of $19.99 for a 48-hour rental period. “Given the rapidly evolving and unprecedented changes to consumers’ daily lives during this difficult time, the company felt that now was the right time to provide this option in the home as well as in theaters,” read NBCUniversal’s release. DreamWorks Animation’s Trolls World Tour, set to open in theaters April 10, will hit home audiences the very same day. “We hope and believe that people will still go to the movies in theaters where available,” said NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell, “but we understand that for people in different areas of the world that is increasingly becoming less possible.”

Independent movies are going the same route. For example, Lorcan Finnegan’s Vivarium, starring Jesse Eisenberg and Imogen Poots, debuted during Critics’ Week at Cannes and was set for a March 27 release. But, lucky you! Canadian distributors Mongrel Media announced that the film will be available on the Apple TV app and VOD March 31.

So what can a housebound cinephile to do? There are top-10 pandemic movie lists all over the internet, if panic is your thing, but here are a few other film-related activities you can do while self-isolating as much as possible:

Stream, Stream, Stream

There is a reason that #QuarantineAndChill is trending right now: the masses are streaming their hearts out. Services that usually offer free trial periods are being extra generous during this time. Acorn TV, which specializes in Canadian, British and Australian dramas, comedies and thrillers, is offering a free 30-day trial for new subscribers (just sign up at acorn.tv and enter the special code FREE30). Amazon Prime, Hulu and Netflix also offer 30 days; you can enjoy Criterion’s collection for 14 days, while many others such as Disney Plus and Britbox are available free for a week.

Rent – yes, you can still rent – a movieTo press time, Videomatica and both Vancouver locations of Black Dog Video were open for business (check websites for updated info). There are a few mom-and-pop shops scattered around the city that rent, too. Go old-school and rent a flick… just promise to be quick.

Curate your collection

If you’re like me you have a pretty impressive collection, culled somewhat over the years by garage sales and trips to the charity shop, of DVDs. If you’re also like me, however, your kids won’t even look at them, preferring the one-click convenience of On Demand. If your family is guilty of this, rediscover old favourites and titles you never even got to among those lonely DVDs gathering dust on the shelf.

The Oscar goes to… me!

I also have a few – wait for it – VHS tapes of my six months spent in Japan (recorded on a camera so big it sat on my shoulder) and my disastrous first appearance on cable TV. Dust off the VCR in your closet (you know it’s there somewhere) and cue family memories you haven’t relived for a while. Nothing distracts from a pandemic like really embarrassing footage from your childhood!

You’ve seen the movie, now read the book

OK, so you might not be up to reading all 864 pages of Anna Karenina to see if Keira Knightly nailed it in the 2012 film version, but how about dusting off that childhood copy of Little Women, downloading Gone Girl on your device, or ordering Crazy Rich Asians online? Better yet, read Dune by Frank Herbert, The Woman in the Window by A.J. Finn, or Agatha Christie’s classic Death on the Nile: all have big-screen adaptations in the works, so you’ll be prepped and ready when the films come out.

Get Creative

Rumours abound that Shakespeare wrote King Lear while quarantined by the plague. You’re such a film buff, why not finally put pen to paper and write that story that’s always bouncing around in your head? Who knows: you may just have the next great screenplay at your impeccably sanitized fingertips.

And finally, pledge to get out there when it’s all over. Let’s hope that this enforced embargo on big-screen entertainment makes us realize how much we’ve missed the movies and the shared experience of laughing, sniffling or being terrorized alongside like-minded folks in a darkened theatre. Hang in there, film friends, we can do this.

Tonight (Thursday), The Cultch — which runs York Theatre, Historic Theatre and the Vancity Culture Lab — will start broadcasts of Theatre Replacement’s MINE.

The multi-media play follows mother-son narratives — from the Beowulf saga, Bambi and The Terminator — using the video game Minecraft.

• The Boy in the Moon from Neworld Theatre (March 31 to April 11);

• Briefs (April 14 to May 2) and Briefs: Brat Kids Carnival (April 19 and 26 and May 3);

• The Cultch fundraising gala (April 25)

• and IGNITE! youth festival (April 27 to May 3).

The following rental events have also been postponed: The Manifestation Tour, Access Futures, The Official Cissy Book Launch, Vancouver Badass Film Festival, Buffy Prom and Sedna.

This Friday, March 20, independent East Vancouver cinema the Rio Theatre had planned to screen the eerily prophetic, star-studded film about the rapid progress of a lethal airborne virus that kills within days and the worldwide medical community’s race “to find a cure and control the panic that spreads faster than the virus itself.”

article continues below

However, as concerns over COVID-19 (coronavirus) have spread, the Rio has decided to cancel all movie screenings for the foreseeable future.

In a statement on its website, the operators of the Rio said: “Effective immediately, we will be temporarily dimming our lights and powering down the projector. Some events are being postponed, and others canceled — we will do our best to connect with ticket-holders and advise them of future plans as soon as they are made clear to us. In the meantime, stay safe out there! We’ll let you know when we’re able to start buttering your popcorn again, and we look forward to seeing you then. We’re gonna get through this, people! Until then, lots of love from everyone at the Rio.”

Rio’s announcement coincides with cinemas across the city, including the Cinematheque, Vancity Theatre and all Cineplex theatres, suspending screenings during the current pandemic.

Contagion’s resurgence in popularity has been noticed by media outlets around the world. Earlier this month, the New York times noted that Warner Bros. had the film listed as No. 270 among its catalog titles at the end of December, but since the start of 2020, it has jumped to second, just below its Harry Potter movies. Currently, Contagion is the third most downloaded movie on iTunes.

The Vancouver film and television industry — one of the busiest and most profitable sectors in the province — is all but stalled.

article continues below

No one’s arguing that these productions shouldn’t have shut down. Productions like Riverdale have upwards of 60 people on set at any given time, making social distancing virtually impossible.

Regardless, the closures have real-world consequences for film workers, many of whom are freelancers who work paycheck to paycheck and who are now, for all intents and purposes, unemployed without a safety net.

“People are scared,” said Keith Martin Gordey, president of the Union of British Columbia Performers (UBCP), an autonomous branch of the Alliance of Canadian Cinema, Television and Radio Artists, during an appearance on the YVR Screen Scene Podcast on Monday.

“They’re not only scared for their health, but they’re frightened about their livelihood, and their ability to pay rent and to buy food and keep the lights on,” he said.

While the industry shutdown is unprecedented, Gordey wouldn’t go so far as to call it an emergency.

“It’s a unique situation definitely, and it was encouraging to hear the Prime Minister say [during his press conference on March 16] that he was going to address the needs of part-time workers,” said Gordey. “The government needs to step up and help people in the gig economy. The gig economy has grown in the last decade considerably. There are people who don’t qualify for EI, because they’re not viewed as employees in the same way. That includes performers.”

UBCP/ACTRA members are eligible to apply to the Actors’ Fund of Canada (AFC) for financial support. Gordey said that the AFC received three weeks’ worth of applications over the weekend. For its part, UBCP/ACTRA has extended its annual membership dues deadline from April 1 to May 1.

“Basically on a daily basis, we look at the situation and see how we can step in and make things better and give people some comfort and support,” says Gordey.

Film workers who find themselves wrestling with mental health challenges during this period of social distancing and isolation are encouraged to utilize the services of Calltime: Mental Health (calltimementalhealth.com). The web site is the brainchild of a multi-union working group (including UBCP/ACTRA, IATSE 891, and the B.C. Branch of the Directors Guild of Canada) and provides mental health and addiction resources to those who either work in the film industry or are concerned about someone who works in the film industry.

During this period of social distancing and film industry shutdown, UBCP/ACTRA — like the other film unions — is still working for its members. Says Gordey: “We’re making sure the cheques keep going out to our members. We’re taking care of our staff, allowing some people to work from home. We’re lobbying government to make sure money flows to people in the gig economy.”

Gordey’s message to film workers who are despondent during this challenging time can be found in the work of Douglas Adams.

“Look at your copy — if you have one — of Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, which on the cover says, ‘Don’t panic,’” says Gordey.

Just because film artists can’t gather together in large groups to make art doesn’t mean they can’t still make art.

On March 16, filmmaker and community organizer Joel McCarthy announced the launch of the Vancouver Quarantine Performance Project.

Teams of up to three people are invited to create and submit two-minute videos in the following categories: original monologue, original song, original speech or stand-up comedy routine and talent show number. Submissions are due April 3, and a live variety show will be broadcast on YouTube April 10.

McCarthy was inspired to launch VQPP after watching viral videos of quarantined people in Italy singing on their balconies. “I want to use this time for creativity and connection,” says McCarthy.

“We’re going to get through this,” adds McCarthy. “The human race is resilient.”

In its 24 years of existence, Black Dog Video’s flagship location on Cambie Street has survived a fire, the construction of the Canada Line and what Gay calls “the tyranny of Netflix and all the streaming stuff.”

article continues below

Now he has to contend with another, potentially devastating, adversary – the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak and the tyranny of self-isolation.

On paper, it might not seem like such a bad prospect – thousands of people facing days, if not weeks, of downtime, bored out of their skulls and in need of home entertainment. But so far, the lumpen masses have been more concerned with hording toilet paper and Lysol disinfectant wipes than stockpiling DVDs and Criterion Collection Blu-ray discs.

“Ten years ago, we would have probably had a big lineup of people coming in and stocking up,” says Gay, while a live version of “Hey Jude” by the Grateful Dead wafts through the near empty store. “But because of all the streaming services, a lot of people are content to stay home and watch whatever, they don’t care, just as long as they don’t have to leave the house.”

While business has been “OK” at his Commercial Drive store, the Cambie Street location is a different story. “For whatever reason at the Cambie store you can see sage brushes blowing through here on certain days,” he says as he rings up a customer’s rental of Dario Argento’s 1993 Italian horror flick Trauma.

On top of that, the Cambie Street location was just hit with a substantial property tax increase.

“I don’t know how this is going to work out because it’s still in the early stages,” Gay says. “I like to think we’re pretty resilient. But even on days without a pandemic, it’s hard.”

Despite the anxiety and dread that owning a video store and the coronavirus outbreak have in common, Gay isn’t without a sense of humour, albeit a dark one.

In addition to Black Dog’s “pandemic special” -- three new releases for the price of two, five regular movies for $10 and “lots stuff you still can’t get on Netflix or Amazon” — Gay has set up a pandemic movie section in his Commercial Drive store. Films include Contagion, Outbreak, 28 Days Later, Ebola Syndrome, Andromeda Strain, Omega Man, Blindness, World War Z and The Seventh Seal.

Still not sold? Well, Gay has one more, hard-to-resist enticement for anyone worried about coming in close contact with an infected population.

“If people are worried about being in a space with a lot of people, you’re welcome here,” he says.

Provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix announced July 15 that there were 21 new cases in the past 24 hours, including two cases that they call ""epi-linked,"" or presumed cases that have not been proven through testing but are being treated as official cases.

article continues below

The province has now recorded 3,149 cases since the novel coronavirus first appeared in B.C. in late January.

More than 87.4% of those infected, or 2,753 people, have recovered. Of those who haven't, 189 people have died and 207 people are actively fighting the virus. Only 14 people are hospitalized, with five of those in intensive care units. The rest are self-isolating at home. There were no new deaths recorded in the past 24 hours.

Recording at least 20 new COVID-19 cases in a 24-hour period has become common in B.C., and Henry said yesterday that she found that number ""distressing,"" even though, she added, the good news is that the province knows where the clusters of infection are, many of the infections are linked and the number is not really that large given the province's population of more than five million residents.

The numbers in the past week were:

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12;

• 21 new cases on July 13;

• 13 new cases on July 14; and now

• 21 new cases on July 15.

In June, the number of daily new cases many times was in the single digits.

""There is one active community outbreak, in addition to several community exposure events,"" Henry and Dix said. ""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks.""

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,023 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,659 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 216 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 51 people who reside outside Canada.

At Forest Lawn Funeral Home, they understand this almost better than anyone else.

Andrew Knapman, the manager at Forest Lawn Funeral Home located in Central Burnaby, said that a lot of grief is acknowledging that your life has changed traumatically. “Your life will never be the same and you won’t really be the same person that you were, because part of your identity, as the spouse, child, relative or friend of this person who is no longer alive, has changed,” Knapman explained.

article continues below

At Forest Lawn, they believe that moving forward, your self identity changes and being involved in the service of a loved one can assist you in dealing with that change. Once a family member has died, Forest Lawn gives each family access to an Imagine Book.

“It’s a way to open the family’s mind, and to focus their mind, on celebrating the individual’s life and making their service less generic and far more specific to the person who has passed away,” Knapman said.

In many Western societies, death has become very compartmentalized and separated from our everyday life. Knapman spoke of older eras when families would be more involved in the funeral process, from viewing in the home to even the digging of the grave. “There was very much a more hands on approach back then as compared to now, so we’re trying to invite people to be a little more involved and to make it more personal,” he said.

“The reasoning is that their involvement in the celebration of their loved ones life, though it may be difficult at the time, can assist in their grieving process,” Knapman said. What Forest Lawn Funeral Home does for families is help them by easing their burden through the arrangement, onwards to the service which helps them acknowledge their bereavement and begin the grieving process.

But did you know that both destinations offer amazing scenery, trails, and golden beaches along with fascinating cultural events?

""Cycling is very popular in Taiwan,"" says Linda Lin, Director – San Francisco Office of the Taiwan Tourism Bureau, ""with Sun Moon Lake elected by CNN Travel as one of the world's best cycling routes.

Island hopping is a popular tourist pursuit in Hong Kong. The outlying islands offer a sharp contrast from Hong Kong's trademark hectic pace.

""Take the island of Cheung Chau, for example,"" says Michael Lim, Director of Canada, Central and South America for the Hong Kong Tourism Board, ""it has no cars, beautiful scenic walks, fresh seafood and the popular Bun Festival. It's a great place to relax and experience the culture and lifestyle of the fisher folk.""

With nine national parks and a rich marine ecology, it's not difficult to see why the Portuguese used the name ""Formosa,"" meaning beautiful island, to describe Taiwan when they arrived in the 16th century. In the 21st century, the customs and traditions of Taiwan's indigenous people are still celebrated through events such as the Harvest Festival (Smatto), the Worship of Hunting (Mabuasu), snake worship, totemism, and various other spiritual rituals.

More information on Taiwan's vibrant cultural and traditional festivals and activities can be found here.

""The best thing to do,"" Michael says, ""is to come and walk through the various neighbourhoods in Hong Kong and Taiwan and enjoy the different experiences. See how people live and interact with each other. Enjoy the street markets of Hong Kong and make sure to visit the night food markets in Taiwan. Both destinations are about living the culture.""

For the first time visitor, the Tourism Boards of Taiwan and Hong Kong in conjunction with China Airlines can recommend a wide variety of packaged trips or guided tours to experience the fascinating cultures, vibrant cities and dramatic outdoor experiences of both Hong Kong and Taiwan.

“I developed an allergy to wheat,” Kadonoff explains. “I had to quit my job to get away from it; in a regular bakery it’s everywhere.”

Instead of giving up her passion, however, Kadonoff decided to try her hand at gluten-free baking, inventing her own recipes for delicious gluten-free pastries, squares and even croissants.

“I still wanted to be able to eat bread,” she says. “I have high standards and I couldn’t really find anything gluten-free in town that I liked, so I thought I’d create a test kitchen and figure out how to get things to taste good, through trial and error. It just grew from there.”

The response to her recipes was overwhelming.

“When my friends and family tried out the new recipes, the general reaction was ‘Wow! This is really good!’” she says. “So I started thinking that maybe I could open up a bakery and let others try them out.”

With its central location at 3385 Cambie Street in Vancouver, Lemonade Gluten Free Bakeryhas become a popular local stop since opening almost 4 years ago, even winning a People’s Choice Award.

From the adversity Kadonoff experienced came something she never could have imagined.

“This is where the name Lemonade Gluten Free Bakerycomes from,” she says. “When life hands you lemons you make lemonade. It also fits with a lot of our customers, because they are gluten-free!”

Kadonoff finds that customers love her products, whether they have gluten intolerance or not.

Her flour blends include organic quinoa and millet flour, sorghum flour, and organic corn flour. She uses non-GMO canola oil, eggs from free-run chickens, and many products are dairy free. There are no preservatives or additives.

Miss CEO Nail Salon takesa conscious and clean approach to beauty, using non-toxic nail polishes and waterless hand and foot care using a medical pedicure machine—making it the first of its kind in B.C. to do so.

Not only are the cosmetic treatments safe and 100% bacteria-free, but they also guarantee long-lasting results.

After all, water and nail polish have never been friends.

If you’re fed up with paying for a gel manicure, only to have it chip a week later, the waterless method can help. That’s because your nail temporarily expands after your hands are soaked, which causes the nail polish to buckle and chip once your nail returns to its original shape.

Instead, Miss CEO Nail Salon will use a electrical device equipped with a rotating burr that hygienically and gently files away tough skin in less time than with a standard file.

Enjoy longer-lasting silky feet while saving water and the planet with this European pedicure technology, available exclusively at Miss CEO Nail Salon at 835 Drake Street in Yaletown.

Visitors can enjoy the best of both worlds when they land at Planet Bingo in Mount Pleasant (2655 Main Street).

article continues below

That’s because the long-running venue offers bingo play using electronic machines, which offer a choice of multiple games where you can get hands-on in the “dabbing” action, and experience the convenience of playing on a drop-in basis.

“When most people think of bingo, they think of session bingo,” says Abby Dy marketing manager for Planet Bingo, which is operated, on behalf of the British Columbia Lottery Corporation, by the Community Gaming Management Association (CGMA). “That’s your typical setting where you have to arrive at a certain time and it ends at a certain time.”

At Planet Bingo, drop-in bingo means just that.

“You don’t have to get here at a specific time and play all of the games during that time period to get your money’s worth,” Dy says. “With us you can come in literally anytime during your operating hours and play.

“And you can stay for an hour, a half hour, all day, it’s totally up to you.”

Helping provide that flexibility is Planet Bingo’s 300-plus, electronic bingo machines. Planet Bingo was the first in B.C. to graduate from paper bingo cards to the high-tech version back in the late 1980s, and since then there has been a steady evolution of technological upgrades to the machines that has enhanced game play.

“When people think of bingo they more than likely think of paper cards you physically dab with ink,” Dy says, adding players now press their video screen to mark a number called out on their card. “With electronic bingo, you will also never miss a bingo if you are pressing the ‘quick dab button,’ which keeps track of everything for you.”

That allows players to play as many as 60 cards at one time.

“Some people even play two terminals at a time,” Dy says, adding in old style, paper bingo there’s no way you’d be able to keep track of that many.

Micheal, General Manager of West Coast Liquor Company, manages the Fraser Street outlet and works with local wineries to host a wide range of products not usually sold in the government liquor stores.

""Some of the bottles we sell are cheaper than if you bought them from the winery,"" Micheal says. ""And our well-trained staff can help a customer choose just the right bottle for a meal, gift, or a special occasion.""

West Coast's Fraser Street store has been serving the local wine and beer-loving community for eight years, while just across town, the Kerrisdale location has been open for six years.

""Wine is the fastest growing segment in the Fraser Street store,"" Micheal says, ""In the past, many of our customers were looking for good quality budget beers, but with the influx of more millennials into the area, we're noticing customers are becoming more adventurous in their tastes.""

Both the Fraser Street and Kerrisdale stores try to support smaller wineries and craft breweries by offering their products at a smaller profit margin.

""We like to support smaller businesses offering VQA (Vintner Quality Assurance) wines. It gives us a chance to highlight good quality local wines at a reasonable price.""

The Kerrisdale location promotes items that generally cannot be found in a B.C. Liquor Store.

""Kerrisdale caters to people looking for that special bottle,"" Micheal explains. ""If you're looking for a hard to find wine, for example, or an expensive wine for a special occasion, you will likely find it in our Kerrisdale location. They offer wines in the $4,000 range in addition to lower-priced B.C. wine.""

Beer, cider, and wine tastings are available at both locations, as are in-store specials.

""We always feature products at special prices, or wines that are unique to each store,"" Micheal says. ""There are beer and wine special pricing events for long weekends, but generally, you can always find a quality product at a great price in any of our stores.""

Canada has let the world know that it is welcoming people who are willing to invest their talents here. It has set targetsof 350,000 new arrivals a year by 2021.

“We are 40 million people and yet we don’t have enough people living here to fulfill all the opportunities for growth,” says Rachel Gary, COO of Canada Direct. “The Canadian government is giving people the chance to have a good life here but there is the expectation that you contribute to the economy as well.”

The Canadian immigration system works on a points system. Points are given for such things as education, proficiency in English or French, and work experience. Some points can be earned in the country of origin but people can also gain points here.

When people reach out to Canada Direct for help, a team member takes them through a questionnaire that outlines the client’s qualifications. An assessment report is then sent to one of Canada Direct’s regulated Canadian immigration consultants.

Education is an important eligibility factor. Most bachelor and master’s degrees from other countries meet Canadian standards and will be accepted, opening doors to immigration. Complications arise when post-secondary education is at a technical school.

For instance, Gary says that in many Central American countries, a person can have management experience without a university degree. It’s not that they’re not educated; rather, the level of education is not as stringent a job requirement as it is in Canada.

If they want to continue working in their field, Gary suggests that they come to Canada on a student visa and study to get their university degree or college diploma. Canada Direct can also get them a work visa that allows them to earn both an income and more points for immigration.

What if you are older than 35 and have a high school diploma only? This makes it more challenging but Gary says it is not impossible. Manitoba is the most lenient when it comes to eligibility criteria and does not require applicants to pass an English language test. Another option is to apply for a student visa, no matter what your age. This allows you to study for the qualifications that are required for employment.

A good example is the recent push for more environmentally friendly home improvement products, he adds. Wizard’s unique screen doors improve summertime air circulation and household temperature without damaging the environment.

Currently Western Canada’s leading screen door and awning manufacturer, the family-run operation now has operations in Victoria and Calgary, in addition to their head office in Vancouver.

They’ve been an approved vendor for Home Depot USA since 2007.

“Screen doors aren’t simply for single family homes,” Bedford points out when asked about the widespread appeal of Wizard’s screens. “A significant number of our customers live in apartments or townhouses. Our products can be customized to fit whatever kind of home you have.”

Wizard is responsible for bringing several leading innovations to the industry, including screen doors made with steel mesh, which keeps people from entering the home.

“We encourage people to learn more about our products at our authorized dealers,” says Bedford. “The more they know about us, the better our products look.”

A proud member of the Canadian Home Builders Association, Wizard Industries is committed to delivering products that are both aesthetically pleasing and highly functional.

“Consumers typically think that screen doors are primarily to keep insects out of your home during the spring and summer months,” Bedford says. “While screen doors certainly do this, they also save you money and help the environment by naturally creating a cool air flow in your home.”

The buzz of conversation is punctuated by shouts from the shuckers whose puns are as good in real time as they are on their t-shirts.

The Vancouver restaurant’s website, however, was very old school. It was hard to navigate on a desktop computer let alone the mobile phones that customers have glued to their hands. You couldn’t even make a reservation online.

article continues below

These were some of the problems that Dan Brag quickly identified when his company, BragDeal, was asked to revamp the site.

Rather than simply come up with an easier-to-navigate design, BragDeal’s team also wanted to drive business to the two locations. They researched the restaurants’ clientele — developing a user persona — as well as analyzed what the competition was doing.

The website is now as dynamic and tech-savvy as the restaurants’ target audience.

“Websites have five seconds to get their message across,” Brag says. “One of the things we focus on is interactivity. Nowadays people don’t like to read. The attention span of a viewer is quicker than ever before. They want to see visuals and find what they are looking for right away.”

In those five seconds, a website not only has to provide useful information, but also “give a certain feel that makes people curious and want to check out the place,” Brag says. “We want them to want to continue to go through the pages. The more they stay on the page, the better the Google metrics are. It improves the business’s ranking.”

The strategy worked. In this video testimonial, Rodney’s social media and marketing manager discusses the instant increase in business.

Brag is a young Vancouver-based entrepreneur but he’s been designing websites for a long time. “I started when I was 13 and understand the technology very well. Ever since the beginning, my entire goal was to drive the most traffic to a site and once I had reached that goal, to figure out where I can get it to next. With time I learned how to make the sites more efficient, have faster load times, better content and the next thing you know I have a business.”

Having a website that is mobile friendly is a definite must. “I was at a Google seminar and they said that, on average, people log onto their phones 150 times a day so if a website isn’t mobile friendly, they’ll go to the next site.”

“I think I had a guardian angel,” says Martin, who had a liver transplant in 2017 and now serves as a Canadian Liver Foundation board member and mentor for other transplant patients. “I had absolutely no symptoms whatsoever. I was, as far as I knew, a very healthy person.”

But in June 2015, she and her husband were on their way to see a movie when another driver slammed into their vehicle. The accident totalled the other driver’s car and left Martin with bumps and bruises she got her doctor to look at.

It was then, when blood tests conducted during the checkup came back it showed some serious concerns.

“It was only then there was an indication something was wrong,” Martin says, adding the danger with liver disease is that there can sometimes be no warnings.

“Usually, there are no symptoms until it’s too late.”

Even her family medical history didn’t ring any immediate alarm bells. The diagnosis of liver disease came as a complete shock.

“I was angry and thought, what have I done to cause this? Where did I go wrong, and what do I need to do to change this?” Martin says, adding she subsequently battled disbelief and stubbornness, declining to go on the transplant list.

That was until her doctor told her a transplant was a matter of life and death.

Faced with that devastating news, Martin went on the list. And all the time she was going through the ordeal, the option of seeking help from an outside source, like the Liver Foundation, was not apparent.

“That’s why I decided to embark on this mentoring program,” she says.

Now, within the next three months or so, hopes are the foundation will have the program in place to help guide patients through the pre-transplant process.

Since her surgery, life has been positive for Martin who has enjoyed good health and looks forward to her role as a mentor.

“The message I want to get out there is that you don’t have to go through this alone,” she says. “You only have one life to enjoy, so make sure you are informed about your own health.”

The notion of establishing a framework to commercialize cannabis began as a promise by the Liberal Party in the 2015 federal election campaign that led to Justin Trudeau becoming prime minister. The implementation of the policy was not as smooth as first envisioned, and the provincial governments were put in charge of setting guidelines for the sale and consumption of marijuana.

article continues below

Research Co. and Glacier Media have been tracking perceptions about legalization every six months in British Columbia. Our latest survey shows that agreement with the new rules remains high across the entire province, that some residents are starting to ponder a future when other drugs could be treated in the same fashion as cannabis, and that – in stark contrast with what we found last year – marijuana users in British Columbia are starting to acquire all of their product through licensed retailers.

As more time passes, British Columbians appear happier with the decision to end prohibition. Seven in 10 of the province’s residents (70%) agree with marijuana being legal in Canada, while 26% disagree and 3% are undecided.

These findings represent a seven-point increase since a similar survey conducted in October 2019, as legal cannabis approached its first anniversary. The groups that are more likely to voice satisfaction with the new status quo are men (75%), British Columbians aged 35 to 54 (76%) and residents of northern B.C. (80%).

In recent weeks, we have seen more talk about creating a safe supply for drugs that are currently available only through illegal means. The impact of these discussions has led to a shift in the views of British Columbians about legalizing all drugs. It must be completely acknowledged that sizable majorities of the province’s residents continue to oppose a move to place any controlled substance inside a store, but the proponents of this option have grown since late last year.

At least two-thirds of British Columbians are opposed to legalizing ecstasy (66%), powder cocaine (70%), heroin (72%), crack cocaine (73%), methamphetamine or “crystal meth” (74%) and fentanyl (75%).

Support for making some of these drugs available in a fashion that would conceivably meet the same guidelines that govern cannabis has risen over the past six months, to 25% for cocaine (up from 18%) and to 24% for heroin (up from 19%). While these are still low proportions, the fluctuation could signal the start of a trend.

Just 10% of British Columbians say they only consumed marijuana after it became legal. Identical proportions of residents tried it before October 2018 (45%) or have never consumed it in Canada (also 45%). The incidence of “legal-only” marijuana users is highest among residents aged 18 to 34 (18%) and those who live in southern B.C. (19%).

But perhaps the biggest surprise, and a source of satisfaction for policy makers, is the way in which cannabis is being sought by users. Just over half of British Columbians who have consumed marijuana since legalization (51%) say that all of their product was acquired at a licensed retailer. In October 2019, only 31% of cannabis consumers in the province were getting all of their product at a licensed retailer.

We still see 16% of British Columbians who say none of their marijuana has been bought at a licensed retailer – a proportion that climbs to 25% among those aged 55 and over. Two-thirds of cannabis consumers aged 35 to 54 (68%) are buying all of their product at a licensed retailer.

Even though the delivery of cannabis products has improved over the past six months, there are significant regional differences that are indubitably related to the presence of stores in specific areas of the province. Cannabis consumers who reside in southern B.C. and Metro Vancouver are the most likely to be getting all of their product from licensed retailers (63% and 62%). The numbers are significantly lower in Vancouver Island (29%), northern B.C. (24%) and the Fraser Valley (19%).

Finally, the issue of “drug testing” remains a priority for British Columbians, with 61% saying that companies in the province should “definitely” or “probably” be able to administer these examinations to any employee now that marijuana is legal.

After a bumpy start that featured slow store openings and hitches with delivery options, there are signs that cannabis legalization is starting to work in a better fashion. More consumers are getting all of their product through licensed retailers, and the number of “new users” has not increased dramatically. Still, the significant regional disparities suggest that more marijuana outlets will need to be authorized in order to effectively eliminate the black market.

Results are based on an online study conducted from July 10 to July 12, 2020, among 800 adult British Columbians.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons is expected to take Sidoo into custody on September 23 and release him from a Pacific Northwest area facility just before Christmas.

article continues below

Sidoo, 61, appeared online via Zoom in front of United States District Judge Nathaniel Gorton of the United States District Court for District of Massachusetts, as well as his lawyers and prosecutors. He wore a plaid suit while sitting in an office space inside his $31.7 million home in Vancouver’s Point Grey neighbourhood.

Sidoo, now a convicted felon, initially pled innocent to fraud and money laundering charges; he teared up before being sentenced and read a prepared statement:

“The last several months have been the hardest in my entire life and today I accept the court’s decision without reservation. No words can express how sorry I am for my decisions and actions that led to this day. I make no excuses, your honour. I broke the law and pled guilty and I now must pay for my actions.

“To my wife and boys, all I ever wanted was your love and respect and to be a good role model. And I know I have made a terrible mistake that has deeply affected our family. To my friends and colleagues and former teammates over the years, I am deeply ashamed today. To the young men and women who looked up to me as a role model, you deserve better. To the court and all of you, I wish to apologize for my actions.

“I will serve my sentence and am committed to returning to the community and doing everything possible to make a positive impact. I hope in time people will not judge me for the worst mistake in my life but for the work in the days, weeks and years ahead in which I am committed to being a better man.”

Gorton told Sidoo he was “impressed” by the businessman’s “obvious remorse.”

But Gorton pointed out two omissions in Sidoo’s statement.

“You expect to put this behind you and go forward and make up for what you called mistakes. I would call it a crime, not a mistake, but nevertheless, it is important that you acknowledge it and realize how many constituencies you have disappointed,” said the judge.

Sidoo also did not explicitly acknowledge that his crimes resulted in two students missing an opportunity to attend the universities his sons, Dylan Sidoo and Jordan Sidoo, were admitted to.

“What you accomplished, along with getting them into college, is to deprive two other deserving students of admittance into those universities — an act that is the very antithesis of one you want to be known for,” said Gorton.

Likewise, United States Attorney Andrew Lelling submitted to Gorton: “Sidoo engaged in serious criminal conduct involving fraud and deception that stretched over multiple years.

“His crimes warrant significant punishment. By engaging in the scheme, with [scheme mastermind Rick Singer] and others, Sidoo was able to steal two college admissions slots for his sons, including one from the University of California at Berkeley, one of the top public universities in the nation.”

Sidoo, said Gorton, “committed a crime that displayed an unbelievable lack of integrity, morality and common sense.

“You have let your selfish desire, your pride and your enormous wealth overcome all of what you apparently want to stand for with your works of charity,” Gorton told Sidoo.

Sidoo’s philanthropy, derived from his earnings in the capital markets, was central to his sentencing defense. According to Sidoo he has donated several million dollars to charitable causes, such as the University of B.C. football program.

In pleading guilty to fraud, Sidoo avoided a maximum prison term of 20 years and prosecutors subsequently agreed to 90 days behind bars, plus a $250,000 fine and one-year of supervised release, which will not be enforced in Canada by the U.S. Probation Department. Prosecutors also agreed to drop the money laundering charge.

The prison Sidoo goes to is expected to have harsher conditions since his options are limited due to his foreign citizenship. His attorney Martin Weinberg said he is expected to spend 14 days in isolation in a “maximum security setting,” due to COVID-19.

Sidoo will get four days credit for time already served. If he serves the full 90 days he will be released December 17 but will have to spend 14 days in isolation at home should B.C. public health rules for international travellers and COVID-19 continue into the fall.

Gorton said Sidoo’s crime would normally warrant more time in jail but there are mitigating circumstances, such as his remorse, lack of criminal record, philanthropy and “collateral consequences,” such as not being able to enter the U.S. as a felon and being stripped last month of his Order of B.C. medal for community service. Sidoo’s attorneys also previously noted he did not directly pay the universities but that his fraud was limited to cheating on the tests.

The former B.C. Lions football player worked as a stock broker in the 1990s and an investment banker between 2000 and 2010. Since 2010 he has made millions of dollars directing a handful of public companies that have failed to generate wealth for retail investors.

Sidoo was arrested March 8, 2019, in San Jose, California, on charges by the U.S. Department of Justice of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering related to the high-profile U.S. college admissions and bribery scandal, brought to light by a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe dubbed Operation Varsity Blues.

One of dozens of parents to be charged, Sidoo initially pled innocent to paying $200,000 total to scheme mastermind William ‘Rick’ Singer, who hired corrupt exam expert Mark Riddell to take Dylan and Jordan’s SAT exams, in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Sidoo also helped falsify one of his son Jordan’s university applications in October 2013 with an essay that originally included a fake claim of Jordan being held up at gunpoint by gangsters, while he was purported to be an intern for an anti-gang organization.

Co-conspirators Singer and Riddell pled guilty last year in exchange for cooperating with the government’s investigation.

The guilty parties in the case, who used Singer’s criminal services, were generally well-off individuals. Celebrities such as actress Lori Loughlin and her clothing designer husband Mossimo Gianulli and actress Felicity Huffman also pled guilty for related crimes and brought much media attention to the investigation.

Sidoo’s sons had no involvement in their father’s crime.

Jordan is now a 2018 history graduate from University of California Berkeley. Dylan graduated in cinematic arts in 2016 from the University of Southern California (USC). The two previously attended Vancouver’s prestigious St. George’s School.

Neither university has announced whether or not their degrees will remain valid. Dylan, according to the sentencing documents, had scored a 1,460/2,400 SAT score until Riddell, using a fake ID in December 2011, bumped up the score to 1,700, which was high enough for Dylan to enter Chapman University (and later transfer to USC). Riddell then scored 2,280/2,400 for Jordan in December 2012, paving the way to Berkley.

Riddell also took a high school test for Dylan. The B.C. Ministry of Education has issued no statement on how its testing process was so vulnerable to fraud.

Both sons have since entered into penny stock promotion with their father.

Exactly one week ago, on July 7, the province recorded 12 new cases. What followed was an uptick in recorded cases:

• 18 new cases on July 8;

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12; and

• 21 new cases on July 13.

""I know it was distressing to me to see 20, especially 25 [new cases] one day,"" Henry said. ""That's way above my comfort zone.""

She added, however, that the slight rise in cases was not unexpected, given that the province has been allowing restaurants and other indoor businesses to reopen.

""We do know where those cases are,"" she said. ""We're testing the people who need to be tested.""

It would be more concerning, she said, if the cases were spread out across the province in an unlinked way. The most recent cluster of cases is linked to the Krazy Cherry Fruit Company in Oliver, she announced yesterday (July 13).

Given B.C.'s population, 20 cases in one day is also better than some other jurisdictions, she said.

The province has identified 3,128 infections since the virus first appeared in the province in late January.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,015 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1649 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 212 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 52 people who reside outside Canada.

Of the 209 people currently fighting COVID-19 in B.C., 14 people are in hospital with five of those in intensive care units. That leaves 2,730 people who have recovered from the virus.

No new deaths from the virus were identified in the past 24 hours, leaving the death toll at 189 people.

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

So far 399 residents and 252 staff at seniors' care facilities have been infected by COVID-19 in B.C.

Health Minister Adrian Dix said that it is his understanding that the federal government and the U.S. government have agreed to extend the closure of the two countries' border for one additional month, until August 21.

""This is obviously positive and necessary news,"" he said. ""Everybody who lives in B.C. knows how inconvenient and how difficult that is for many businesses and many individuals for a variety of circumstances.""

Harry Bains said injured workers have complained for too long that the system lacks fairness and support in times of injury and recovery.

Changes Bains proposes include raising the maximum annual salary on which compensation benefits are based; authorizing WorkSafeBC to provide preventative medical treatment before claim acceptance; giving powers to the court to issue WorkSafeBC search and seizure warrants appropriate for investigating workplace safety infractions; and giving people a voice in serious workplace prosecutions and trials by using victim impact statements.

Victoria is also fast-tracking legislation to handle situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic so workers can access benefits more easily.

During the pandemic, the regulator is allowing businesses to defer paying their premiums for six months without penalty or interest. It is also waiving premiums on wages paid to workers of employers receiving the Canadian Emergency Wage Subsidy.

The amendments to the Workers Compensation Act comes after three expert reviews were completed in 2018 and 2019.

The ministry said of the more than 44,000 injured workers currently receiving permanent disability benefits because of a work-related injury, about 35% are in the Lower Mainland, while the rest are spread throughout all regions of B.C.

There are more than 100,000 workplace injury or fatality claims annually.

In 2019, there were 140 workplace fatalities in B.C. Of that number, 84 were due to occupational disease, 40 to traumatic injury and 16 the result of a motor vehicle incident.

In a fiscal update Tuesday, B.C. Finance Minister Carole James said the COVID-19 pandemic will result in ""the worst downturn experienced in our province in recent history.""

article continues below

""The projected numbers are staggering, but they're not without hope,"" James said, in summing up B.C.'s fiscal position.

She said B.C. had entered the pandemic perhaps better situated than other provinces, as it had a balanced budget, a triple AAA credit rating and one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country.

B.C. also managed to contain the pandemic and flatten its growth curve better than some other provinces, and it has been able to move earlier on a phased economic restart plan.

""Because of that strength, we were able to take immediate action to help people, to help businesses, to help communities with our $5 billion COVID action plan,"" James said.

She said the province is expecting a loss of $4.2 billion in tax revenue, including $1 billion less in personal income tax revenue, $973 million less in corporate taxes, $1.3 billion in provincial sales tax revenue, $300 million in natural resource revenues and $882 million less in Crown Corporation income.

The province is also spending $5 billion in emergency spending, and has approved $1.3 billion in tax credits and deferrals. In total, the increased spending, lost tax revenue and foregone revenue will bring the deficit to $12.5 billion.

In February, James brought down, but never passed, a balanced budget and modest surplus of $227 million and provincial GDP growth projections of 2% in 2020.

""Mere weeks after the budget 2020 was tabled, our entire world changed,"" James said.

James said the B.C. economy is now expected to contract 6.8% in 2020, according to some forecasters.

Since February, B.C. lost 235,000 jobs, and saw retail sales declined by 23.6% in April compared to February. Overall, home prices dropped 4%.

Home sales declined 45.4% in May, compared to February, and B.C. merchandise exports are down 14.7% year-to-date, compared to January to May 2019.

""While the job losses in March and April were record-breaking, figures for May and June in fact have seen some recovery of the losses that we experienced in the previous two months,"" James said.

Asked if her government planned to resort to spending cuts to address the deficit, James said ""now is not the time to be able to cut back on services and support for people and business in British Columbia.""

As for any long-range plans for dealing with debt and deficits, James said: ""I do not believe that it's going to be a quick fix.""

Asked if the $5 billion that her government has already approved could be added to later this year, James said ""I believe the $5 billion is enough now.""

However, she added no one can predict what might happen should there be a second wave of COVID-19.

As for the $22 billion in capital spending allocated in the 2020 budget over three years for big capital works projects, like new schools, hospitals, bridges and roads, that will continue to be spent.

""This is going to serve us very well because it translates into huge investments,"" James said.

239,vancourier,https://www.vancourier.com/entertainment/gun-violence-imported-from-u-s-is-a-key-concern-for-canadians-1.24169958,Gun violence imported from U.S. is a key concern for Canadians,['Mario Canseco'],,"National governments have a tendency to overreact immediately after they are forced to face an unexpected challenge. No example is better than the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks in the United States, which gave us the “Patriot Act” after just 45 days of deliberation to expand government surveillance of Americans to previously unimagined levels.

In mid-April, the actions of Gabriel Wortman led to the deaths of 22 people in Nova Scotia after multiple shootings and fires. Most Canadians, at the time still under lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, were horrified at Wortman’s actions, which included impersonating a police officer.

article continues below

It took the federal government only 13 days after Wortman’s criminal activity was evident for the entire country to announce a nationwide ban on 1,500 types of military-grade “assault-style” weapons in Canada. Any Canadian who possesses these firearms will have two years to get rid of them. The prohibition led to many new discussions about the role that firearms play in Canada’s urban and rural areas.

We know now that the perpetrator of the 22 murders in Nova Scotia had obtained his weapons illegally from Canadian and American sources. This was not a surprise for Canadian authorities, who have consistently reported that more than 70% of the weapons used in gun-related crimes in our country come from the United States.

On the issue of firearms, Canada is decidedly different from the United States. In Canada, it is not legal for a person to own or carry a firearm for the purpose of self defence against human beings. When Research Co. and Glacier Media asked Canadians about this key precept of Canadian law, more than three in four (77%) agreed with it, while 18% disagreed and 5% were undecided.

Atlantic Canada (31%), Saskatchewan and Manitoba (29%) and Alberta (24%) boast the highest number of residents who openly question Canada’s long-standing regulations for firearms. While higher than what is observed in Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia, these are not proportions of voters that would sway an election, certainly not in the way American statewide and congressional races can be tilted if your candidate can adequately hold a shotgun and recite the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution in a manner that panders to the base.

Fewer than one in five Canadians welcome the notion of citizens carrying firearms for something other than hunting or scaring wildlife away. Any survey measuring opinions on banning “assault-style” weapons would be met with near unanimity. The opposition reacted to the announced ban as it always has under its outgoing leader, by claiming the regulations would affect law-abiding Canadians. Lost in this unfortunate combination of inadequate polling and incapable opposition are the solutions that matter to Canadians.

In our survey, more than three in five Canadians (63%) told us that gun violence in Canada is a “very serious” or “moderately serious” problem – a proportion that climbs to 69% among women and 68% among those aged 55 and over.

Sizable majorities of Ontarians and British Columbians, who have experienced gang wars in urban areas, are more likely to look at gun violence as particularly problematic (76% and 67%, respectively). The COVID-19 pandemic did little to curb gun violence in Toronto, where 61 people were shot in the first four months of the year.

We asked Canadians about the effectiveness of four possible measures, and their responses outline a public that is ready for bold action. More than three in five Canadians (62%) think enacting a complete ban on handguns would be “very effective” or “moderately effective” in reducing gun violence in Canada. Most crimes, after all, are not being committed with the military-grade “assault-style” weapons that the federal government was quick to ban.

A higher proportion of Canadians deem two other measures as effective: imposing mandatory jail terms for crimes committed with firearms (74%) and introducing new outreach programs to steer youth away from gangs (also 74%).

Canadians place dealing with firearms smuggled from the United States as the most important issue that needs to be addressed. Many of the country’s residents also want to make sure gangs are not attractive to our country’s youth and believe mandatory minimum jail sentences would act as a deterrent.

Banning military-grade “assault-style” weapons is low-hanging fruit in a challenge that definitely has Canadians preoccupied and wishing for a type of government intervention that goes beyond a photo-op celebrated by poorly executed survey charity work.

True sociologists know that we learn nothing from posing the wrong questions to Canadians, and capable politicians should go beyond voicing displeasure with plans and proposals just because that is what they are expected to do. Meanwhile, Canadians are still worried about gun violence and expecting their elected officials to do better. •

We learned earlier this month that it was for Chang’s new series on Netflix, Breakfast, Lunch & Dinner, and the show dropped all four of its episodes on Oct. 23.

Episode 1 is the Vancouver episode, and it’s a real love letter to Vancouver.

Even though it’s a drab and dreary day, Rogen and Chang cover plenty of ground, from the nostalgic to the iconic – with stops for some delicious food in between.

Watch the duo blaze up in Queen Elizabeth Park, and in the afternoon get lost in the massive maze at VanDusen Garden. They even head out on the waters of Burrard Inlet for some fishing, and go behind the scenes at a legendary local doughnut shop to see how the jelly gets squirted and glaze gets poured (prime stoner stuff right there).

You can see Chang affirming his love for Vancouver in the show — and, we do know now that the love is serving a further purpose; Chang is opening a Momofuku Noodle Bar here in 2020.

If you want to trek around town on the same journey Rogen and Chang went on, as seen on Netflix, you can use this handy map to guide your way. We’ll leave it up to you whether you want to fuel your day with some puff-puff pass action.

That alone isn’t so unusual. Actors are human beings; not all human beings get along with each other in the same way. But what is unusual is admitting that you prefer one of your co-stars to a journalist during an interview.

article continues below

And the Vancouver actress is clear, and adamantly so: Diesel vom Burgimwald is her favourite co-worker, full stop.

This becomes less of a scandalous scoop and more of an adorable anecdote when you learn that vom Burgimwald is a two-year-old German shepherd who plays the titular Rex in Hudson & Rex, Citytv’s canine cop procedural that premieres on March 25.

“He’s a very special dog,” says Nguyen of vom Burgimwald. “He’s got this beautiful temperament. He’s a puppy, but he’s so — I want to say professional. It’s funny to apply that word to a dog, but he does have this professional air to him. Sometimes I forget that he’s a dog because he’s just one of us.”

It’s mid-February and Nguyen is calling in from St. John’s, Nfld., where she’s been filming Hudson & Rex’s 16-episode first season since October.

Hudson & Rexstars sometimes-Vancouverite John Reardon (Arctic Air) as Charlie Hudson, a St. John’s detective who partners with Rex when the dog’s original partner is killed. Hudson recognizes that Rex has a very particular set of skills — namely, he can sniff out details that are usually overlooked by human detectives — and together they solve all manner of crimes, with help from colleagues like Nguyen’s character, Dr. Sarah Truong.

Dr. Truong is head of forensics. “I’m a doctor, but what is really great on this show is I’m not stuck in a lab,” says Nguyen. “I’m on the scene a lot. I take an active role.”

Dr. Truong and Nguyen have a fair bit in common. Until recently, they’ve both been based in Toronto, and they’re both experiencing something of a culture shock in St. John’s. “It’s so cold here, and also really wet,” she laughs. “There’s no getting away from it. The wind is out of control. But it’s also majestic out here and quite beautiful.” She’s full of love for the people of Newfoundland, who she describes as “storytellers, with a sharp, caustic wit.”

Nguyen was born and raised in Vancouver and attended Eric Hamber secondary school. She was in Grade 11 when she caught the acting bug during a production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream.

“I don’t think prior to that I wanted to be an actor, but definitely that experience got me and I couldn’t imagine doing anything else,” says Nguyen.

Alas, when Nguyen told her father that she was intent on being an actor, he wasn’t too impressed.

“I come from a Vietnamese family and my dad, back then at least, would have preferred if I had been a doctor or a lawyer,” she says. “He was not into it at all. I think it just got to be that thing where he didn’t really have a choice. I clearly was not going to go to law school, but I’ve played a lawyer and I’ve played a doctor, so there you go, Dad!”

Nguyen’s lengthy list of credits includes fan favourite roles on Rookie Blue, But I’m Chris Jericho!, Cracked, ReGenesis and SyFy’s Killjoys. On Killjoys, Nguyen plays ruthless politician Delle Seyah Kendry, and she describes her as “not a character that I typically play. She’s not something that I think of myself as being close to in terms of character, and so there is something now where I’m like, ‘Oh, I think I need to investigate those kinds of roles a bit more because there was something there that caught me off guard.’”

Hudson & Rex represents a couple of firsts for Nguyen: her first time working with a dog and her first time relocating for work. “We had a shoot on a boat and I threw up when we were done,” she says. “I’d never experienced the North Atlantic in that way and so much of the show is about being in St. John’s, and I think you’ll get that from the show. I’ve not met this landscape before. It’s a beautiful place and so unique in Canada.”

Hudson & Rex premieres March 25 at 8 p.m. on Citytv.

As the owner of Funhouse Tattoos on Cambie, his tattoos adorn thousands of living canvases across Vancouver. But some of his best work rarely sees the light of day.

Nipples.

article continues below

For breast cancer survivors who have undergone a mastectomy, Godoy will tattoo hyper-realistic nipples on their chest, giving them back some semblance of normalcy after having had so much taken from them.

“These women, they feel like they don’t own their bodies anymore,” says Godoy. “They feel miserable all the fucking time, so when they find out they have this as an option, and they can make their nipples anyway they want them, they’re excited.”

The first set of nipples Godoy ever tattooed were for a woman named Catherine who had both breasts removed to stop the spread of cancer, and replaced with implants. Catherine brought in magazines with examples of exactly the kind of nipples she wanted. Godoy made a stencil, and carefully measured to make sure they would be symmetrical.

“When she sat down in the chair and took her shirt off, it was like she had nothing to hide. You could tell she felt sexless… her breasts were just a smooth shiny surface,” he says. “When I was done, she looked at her self in the mirror, and instinctively covered herself up.

“It didn’t feel like she had her breasts back until there were nipples on them.”

Godoy estimates he’s done more than 30 sets of nipples for cancer survivors over the years. While some doctors offer nipple tattoos to mastectomy patients, the result is usually a crude circle that looks nothing like a nipple.

“Some doctors attempt to do it, but it looks like a pink bingo dabber,” says Godoy. “They don’t know what they’re doing. To make it look real, you need the little bumps, the shadowing, it needs to look like its sticking out.”

Godoy says he offers cancer survivors a discount on the work he does.

“I can’t do charity all the way, but I do a sliding scale based on what people can afford,” he says. “It’s more important to help give people’s lives back than make a buck.”

The cancer survivors Godoy tattoos are among his favourite clients to work with.

“They don’t act like your typical first-timer, they have their minds made up, so there’s no apprehension,” he says. “It’s cool to see. I love doing it, I love the reaction I get.”",[]

The flick, set predominantly in San Francisco, filmed in Vancouver for about a month and half in the spring and summer of 2018, followed by a few days on location in San Francisco.

Keen-eyed Vancouver viewers will easily spot some key locations in the movie, particularly the restaurants. Wong plays high-powered celeb chef Sasha Tran, whose flashy restaurant empire covers both coasts, while Park plays her childhood pal who is a little bit stunted in their hometown of San Francisco.

article continues below

Real-life restaurant folk will give some heavy side-eye to Tran’s hiccup-free and rapid-succession opening of two huge restaurant projects in San Francisco and New York while running a major L.A. hot spot (as well as her copious amounts of free time in the process to cavort around town). But much like good cooking, you can take this kind of fun romantic comedy romp with a dash of salt.

For the movie, Wong’s food was created by Los Angeles chef Niki Nakayama; in Vancouver, Wong was aided by local chef Juno Kim, who has a brief appearance at the end of the film as a sous chef. Also, keep an eye out for CTV Vancouver morning show personality Sonia Beeksma as a red carpet reporter.

Be warned, some of the locations below reveal a bit of plot, so if you haven’t watched yet, consider this your spoiler alert.

Glowbal: Knives + Mercy

When we first meet Sasha Tran, she’s the big boss lady at a sleek, modern, bustling restaurant in Los Angeles called Knives + Mercy, which is actually downtown’s Glowbal restaurant. Located on Georgia at Seymour, Glowbal’s sweeping arches over the patio as well as some of the posh interior and semi-open kitchen are seen in the movie.

Nightingale: Saintly Fare

Chef Tran is opening a restaurant in San Francisco, called Saintly Fare. The beautiful two-level restaurant with its bird accents is actually Nightingale on Hastings at Burrard, the acclaimed David Hawksworth restaurant.

Vancouver Art Gallery: Site of Food & Wine Awards

For a big sweeping gesture, Marcus chooses to ambush Sasha outside the venue where she is set to receive a big food industry award. While the rows of trees sparkling with lights might have thrown you (movie magic!), it’s actually the Georgia Street plaza in front of the Vancouver Art Gallery, really decked out for a swank evening.

Cinara/Autostrada: Judy’s Way

Cinara became Judy’s Way. Since filming, Cinara morphed into sibling spot Autostrada. Screenshot/Netflix

Here’s a spoiler alert: Sasha swiftly conceptualizes, funds, secures a location, renovates, preps, and launches a third restaurant in the last bit of the film. Judy’s Way is a clever and deeply personal nod to Sasha and Marcus’s childhood, and the warm interior and smaller space throws off everyone in Sasha’s life who is used to her being a bit more splashy. That charming restaurant is Autostrada on Pender, which, at the time of filming, was still Cinara (same owners, similar concept).

New Town Bakery: Best Luck Dim Sum

They filmed this cute scene at New Town in Chinatown. Screenshot/Netflix

Although Sasha grows up to become a prominent chef specializing in modern Asian cuisine, she and Marcus rekindle their love… of affordable dim sum. While Sasha marvels at how much she never gave the modest shop credit, Marcus shows off that he’s a regular there. They filmed this cute scene at New Town in Chinatown.

Streets of Chinatown

Sasha and Marcus talk about life in San Francisco…in Vancouver’s Chinatown. Screenshot/Netflix

The streets of Vancouver’s Chinatown stand in for San Francisco’s — you’ll easily recognize plenty of local businesses and signage (although the production inserted large black-on-white San Francisco street signs) and lots of TransLink blue and yellow buses move about on the streets. You’ll definitely spot places like Sai Woo and its beautiful replica neon sign, as the would-be couple stroll about, as well as Say Hey Café and DD Mau.

Commercial Drive

You’ll also spot them walking by the big rainbow and coffee cup mural of Joe’s Cafe. Screenshot/Netflix

After an awkward dinner with Marcus’ current girlfriend Jenny, Marcus and Sasha take a stroll on Vancouver’s Commercial Drive. Don’t be fooled by the white 23rd Street sign, those banners say “The Drive.” You’ll also spot them walking by the big rainbow and coffee cup mural of Joe’s Cafe.

Biltmore Cabaret

Marcus is in a band called Hello Peril, and you can catch them playing in the film at Vancouver’s Biltmore Cabaret.

Sasha’s Rental Home

When Sasha comes to San Francisco to open Saintly Fare, she puts herself up in a super practical massive mansion outside the city core with gorgeous sweeping bay views. Mind you, the bay is Horseshoe Bay, as the house they used is located in West Vancouver.

He was well known for his physical fitness and lightning-fast martial arts moves – qualities that will be on display in the two films he wrapped before he died: Pound of Flesh and Kickboxer: Vengeance, both with Jean-Claude Van Damme (he can also be seen in the upcoming George Clooney feature, Tomorrowland).

article continues below

So when Darren – who lived in Vancouver for 13 years and worked in the local film and television industry before moving down to Los Angeles a couple of years ago – died in mid-January, he left behind one big unanswered question: How could a healthy man die in his sleep?

More than three months after Darren died, the Los Angeles County Department of Coroner has issued its official Coroner’s Report, and the truth is out: Darren died of natural causes.

Darren died of “a sudden and fatal heart attack,” his family wrote in a statement. “He was found to have Atherosclerosis (also known as arteriosclerotic vascular disease or ASVD). His left anterior descending artery was 95% blocked, which must have been worsening for several years.”

There's also this important clarification: “Darren had no drugs or medications in his body, and only 0.02% BAC (Blood Alcohol Concentration); to put this into context 0.08% is the BAC Driving Limit for both the US & UK. There are no other medical factors linked to his death.”

Here’s the Shahlavi family’s statement in its entirety:

Darren's family recently received a Coroner’s report from the Los Angeles County Department of Coroner, and would like to share the results with his friends, colleagues and fans.

Darren died on January 14, 2015 of natural causes: a sudden and fatal heart attack. He was found to have Atherosclerosis (also known as arteriosclerotic vascular disease or ASVD) His left anterior descending artery was 95% blocked, which must have been worsening for several years.

Darren had no drugs or medications in his body, and only 0.02% BAC (Blood Alcohol Concentration); to put this into context 0.08% is the BAC Driving Limit for both he US & UK. There are no other medical factors linked to his death.

It seems unlikely that someone as fit as Darren – who was so dedicated to exercise and fitness and had such a healthy low fat/dairy diet – should have heart disease, but we have been told that a genetic predisposition resulted in the development of heart disease and is not uncommon in otherwise healthy young men, including athletes and other professional sportsmen and women.

Evidence for Darren’s level of physical fitness at the time of his death can be seen in his recent work. Darren had just finished filming Pound of Flesh and Kickboxer: Vengeance, both with Jean-Claude Van Damme – not to mention Tomorrowland with George Clooney. He was, as far as physical fitness goes, at the top of his game.

Darren’s family are devastated that his underlying heart condition was never diagnosed to allow him the opportunity of treatment. Typically, Atherosclerosis begins in childhood, and Darren showed no apparent symptoms prior to death. Who would have thought that Darren who was regarded as very fit would die so suddenly as a result of this silent killer!

We have all been in shock for the past 11 weeks with so many unanswered questions, but would now like to focus on the lessons that can be learned from Darren's untimely death. We do feel that Darren would be the first to join us in sending warnings and advice to the friends and colleagues that he loved that regular health screening can save lives.

This is our message and we do hope that somehow positive publicity in Darren's name can be made available to other young men and women, that may help them to take seriously the possibility that their body holds terrible secrets that can be revealed if they are tested routinely throughout life.

We hope that no other family has to go through the grief and pain that we are experiencing and that their loved ones get screening and subsequent treatment if necessary, that could prevent the tragic outcome that all who loved Darren are trying to come to terms with.

Between March 23 and 29 Vancouver police responded to eight overdose-suspected deaths – the most in a single week since August 2019, and in contrast to the decline in overdose deaths in the city.

article continues below

“The drug supply remains toxic with fentanyl and other contaminants present in many local illicit drugs,” the city said in a press release. “Insite and Powell Street Gateway remain open and Vancouver Coastal Health is working with service providers to ensure overdose prevention sites are open for people to access.”

And while encouraging physical distancing to help prevent the spread of COVID-19, the health authority is asking people to continue to use supervised consumption sites and overdose prevention sites, and is recommending that housing providers continue to allow visitors and other strategies so people are not using drugs alone in their rooms.

Last week, the B.C. government announced new measures that will allow drug users to take home — and have delivered — prescribed medications as alternatives to poisoned street drugs.

Under the new provision health care providers are able to get safe, prescription alternative medications such as hydromorphone and dextroamphetamine into hands of drug users not in a treatment program, or who regularly visit a doctor.

The medication is restricted to oral doses and excludes prescription injectable heroin, which continues to be offered to about 100 patients at the Crosstown Clinic in the Downtown Eastside.

Pharmacies can have employees deliver medication, extend prescriptions, transfer prescriptions to other pharmacists and allow prescribers such as a doctor to refill a prescription over the phone.

Clinics are also set up to offer “telemedicine” for clinical assessments, which means a patient and doctor can talk to each other via a computer to accelerate a person’s access to medication.

The pandemic coupled with the overdose crisis presents unprecedented risks for drug users unable to self-isolate, keep their physical distance from people or quarantine to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

That group includes people who are homeless and living in shelters and single-room-occupancy hotels, which are often set up with shared bathrooms and common areas, including kitchens.

Also last week, Coal Harbour and Roundhouse community centres were set up as temporary shelters for homeless people during the pandemic in an effort to allow for more physical distancing.

Heather Redfern, the executive director of the Vancouver East Cultural Centre, was the lone speaker in a chamber that was only occupied by Mayor Kennedy Stewart and a couple of city staff while councillors participated in the meeting via their phones.

article continues below

“I wish I could say that our arts organizations will all be fine, but I can’t,” said Redfern, reading from a speech on her phone screen, pausing several times as she choked up at the lectern.

“Unfortunately, the viability of many of these organizations and the ability of our artists to live in our city and have a livelihood are in real jeopardy.”

She said organizations such as the cultural centre, also known as the CULTCH, rely on earned and donated revenues for 80 per cent of their funding. At this time of the year, all grants are long gone and 100 per cent of revenue must come from donations and earned revenue, she said.

But with the closure in mid-March of theatres and venues to adhere to physical distancing measures, facilities and artists have taken a big hit in loss of revenue, as have businesses and other operations across the city.

“In one day, on March 15, we lost 100 per cent of our earned revenues and a significant amount of our fundraising revenues,” Redfern said.

“For the CULTCH, this amounts to about a half a million dollars to the end of May, which is our year end.”

In the end, city council unanimously approved the $6.2 million in grants for 208 arts and cultural organizations, including $150,000 in an operating grant for the CULTCH. The funding also covered projects and financial assistance for organizations.

Other organizations to receive funding included Ballet BC ($100,000), Full Circle: First Nations Performance Society ($90,000), Music on Main Society ($44,000), The Coastal Jazz and Blues Society ($90,000) and The Vancouver Out on Screen Film and Video Society ($50,000).

Major institutions such as The Vancouver Art Gallery Association ($2.1 million), the Vancouver Museum Society ($758,000), the H.R. MacMillan Space Centre Society ($519,400) and the Vancouver Maritime Museum Society ($400,000) also received funding.

Whether that money will sustain organizations and artists this year is a question neither Redfern nor city staff could predict, as the wave of the pandemic continues to roll over the city and province, with more people infected by the virus each day.

As of Tuesday, more than 1,000 people in B.C. had contracted COVID-19.

“We are currently facing 90 per cent unemployment in the arts sector in this city,” said Redfern, acknowledging governments have recently announced various financial aid packages for Canadians.

“For some, the federal wage subsidy will delay and perhaps in the long term help to mitigate that reality. For most artists though, already living in precarious financial circumstances, that subsidy will not be an option.”

During council debate Tuesday, Coun. Colleen Hardwick said she was concerned how the city will continue to maintain its own operations while simultaneously providing funding for arts groups and other organizations that depend on city funding.

City manager Sadhu Johnston, who was also dialed in to the meeting, suggested a dire financial forecast for the city, noting the suspension of parking and the closing of civic theatres will mean big losses in revenues.

“Our revenues have dropped by 90-plus per cent — from parking to civic theatres and many, many other areas across the organization,” Johnston said.

“So we’re going to be looking at hundreds of millions of dollars that we’ll be needing to look to make up in some way or other through cuts and other measures, if this [pandemic] lasts through the end of the year and into next year, potentially.”

He described the $6.2 million in grants as a “critical bridge” for the arts and culture sector, noting organizations and artists were anticipating the funding prior to the COVID-19 outbreak. The amount of money, he added, was “negligible” when considering the overall financial picture for the city.

“We think that while the funding is absolutely critical to non-profits, we’re going to need to make up for it in the work that we do in cost-cutting and other solutions in partnership with other levels of government,” said Johnston, referring to the various financial aid and stimulus programs rolled out by the provincial and federal government.

In approving the grants, Coun. Pete Fry noted the emergence of the Renaissance, one of the greatest epochs for art, architecture and literature in human history, came after the Black Plague.

“These kind of adversary situations give us an opportunity to grow from them, and I think by nurturing the arts we give ourselves the space to create, the space to express ourselves,” he said.

“The institutions we’re supporting today will be valuable in our recovery efforts and really allow Vancouverites to express themselves, and to really help their mental health in surviving this COVID-19 pandemic.”

Coun. Sarah Kirby-Yung noted how it is difficult at the best of times to financially support the city’s arts and culture community.

“These are not the best of times, these are the worst of times — to use a sort of Dickensian analogy,” she said.

""That is why, more than ever, we need to come together and send an unequivocal sign to our [arts and culture] community who are experiencing extreme stress, extreme grief. It’s palpable, we heard it in the comments from Ms. Redfern.”

Coun. Jean Swanson quoted late American author Ursula Le Guin, who was best known for her works of speculative fiction, in her reasons for approving the grants.

“She said, ‘We live in capitalism. Its power seems inescapable. So did the divine right of kings. Any human power can be resisted and changed by human beings. Resistance and change often begin in art, and very often in art,’” Swanson said.

“So that’s what I’m hoping for. And after we pass [these grants], then on to getting some housing and some art spaces that these folks can afford.”

Teachers will be back at work, but kids won’t be in classes.

article continues below

Rather, the first week back will mostly entail planning logistics, for both the immediate and longer-term futures.

The early part of the week will be spent with school principals talking to teachers and arranging for teachers to pick up any essential supplies, Vancouver School Board superintendent Suzanne Hoffman said in a video update posted on Twitter.

📽️Tune-in: #VSB39 superintendent @SAHoffman provides a third #COVID19 video update on what parents, students and staff can expect next week: https://t.co/lWcELGSERa — SD 39 Vancouver (@VSB39) March 27, 2020

Later in the week, families can expect a phone call from their school, checking in and asking if their child has left anything important at school. Pick up times, with appropriate social distancing, will be arranged.

Also, teachers will be planning how to move forward with teaching their students remotely.

""… (I)t is vital students have a sense of routine and continued opportunities to learn while they are at home,"" Rob Fleming, B.C.’s minister of education, said in a news release.

The decision to suspend in-person classes is the right one. Children’s role in spreading the virus is largely unknown, although a study in Wuhan found that children tend to get milder illness, but they can sometimes become very ill or even die.

In California, a teenager’s death was linked to the virus and in Illinois, a baby who tested positive for COVID-19 died. It’s in the public interest to prevent any more deaths of young people and also to prevent them from passing it on to their family members.

However, learning and socializing is important for children’s development, so keeping some form of education and connection between schools and children is the right thing to do. We don’t know how long social isolation is going to be necessary. If it has to continue past September, laying the groundwork for at-home learning now will help.

In Alberta, on Saturday, school funding for support staff was abruptly cut, until schools reopen. That decision in that particular province could be political — a way to shift the burden of payments on to the federal government. I hope we don’t see anything similar here in B.C.

For now, the province says their main priority is a healthy and safe environment for all students, families and employees. But, this has to be done while still offering learning opportunities for all, supporting vulnerable students and making sure essential workers have child care.

Readers might think essential workers are merely those who work in healthcare. Not so. The list is long and includes everything from health care to food banks to transportation to grocery stores to mechanics to weather forecasters and many more.

There could be a lot of children requiring care. In Vancouver, child care for essential service workers is all being organized by Westcoast Child Care Resources Centre, not by VSB staff.

As we go through this, it will be important to remember that everyone is charting new waters – none of us have been here before.

“There is no expectation that we can duplicate a normal school day at home,” Fleming said. By working together and supporting each other, we will get through this.""

The province has promised all students will get a final mark and all 45,000 Grade 12 students who are eligible to graduate will graduate. They’ve also created a new website, called

Open School with many tips for parents, such as staying on a regular schedule or creating a space for school work. It’s also stocked with lots of learning resources — fancy a virtual trip through the St. Lawrence Seaway, anyone — and activities people can do with their children to ensure they’re keeping up their reading and math skills.

While I’m sure no one had this in mind when they talked about “personalized learning,” this is definitely an opportunity to create it.

“I know everyone is pulling together on behalf of our students,” the VSB’s Hoffman said in her video chat. “We’re going one week at a time and seeing what happens during that week and then looking ahead to the next week.”

Taking it one day at a time, or one week at a time, is a good way to go. We don’t have much choice.

Meanwhile, as thousands of Canadians have lost their jobs and many businesses have closed, The Courier has put freelance columnists on hold. As such, this will be my last column here for a while. But I certainly hope to be back, writing about education and other social issues in B.C., before too long. In the meantime, follow me on Twitter @tracysherlock or visit my education blog HERE.

250,vancourier,https://www.vancourier.com/news/here-are-tips-for-new-home-gardeners-hoping-to-keep-their-mind-off-covid-19-1.24109993,Here are tips for new home gardeners hoping to keep their mind off COVID-19,['Naoibh O Connor'],,"If you’re feeling isolated or have too much time to spare because COVID-19 is keeping you close to home, perhaps planting a garden, large or small, is a way to keep your mind occupied through the pandemic.

The Courier checked in with Seann Dory and Suzy Keown for tips on how to manage a garden, particularly for those who’ve never planted one before. They’re farming at Southlands in Tsawwassen, described as one of North America’s largest “agrihoods” — 530 acres are being developed into a community modeled on agrarian villages and rural farmsteads — and have a farm called Salt and Harrow.

article continues below

Dory was also co-founder of Sole Food Street Farms in Vancouver, which transforms vacant lots into gardens, while Keown grew up on a farm and was previously operations manager at Dogwood Brewing.

Farmers Suzy Keown and Seann Dory who are based out of Southlands in Tsawwassen, which is described as one of North America’s largest “agrihoods” — 530 acres are being developed into a community modelled on agrarian villages and rural farmsteads. They have a farm called Salt and Harrow.

Q: If a person was new to gardening, how big should they go in terms of a plot?

Dory: It’s all time dependent, really. You can go as small as a few square feet and as big as you have space for. But for every foot that you do have, you have to have time to manage it. We always start people with a four-by-four foot box and then they go from there.

Q: How much money should someone invest in a basic garden? Is it costly?

Dory: For a small garden, it’s not costly at all. Just some seeds and you want to make sure you’re really focused on the compost that you’re putting down, and you want to be paying attention to the ground you’re using. If it’s in a box, it’s easy. You’re just using compost, which is great. If you’re on a piece of ground that’s never had anything on it, you might want to test it or see if anything is growing. You might want to top dress it… or anything to get it to the point where it can grow something.

Q: What are the easiest fruits or vegetables to grow?

Dory: It depends on what you want. Quick is radish or lettuce.

Keown: You can re-seed those many times throughout the season to make sure you have a supply of them.

Dory: Yes, if you’re looking to have a constant supply of salad, those are things that are seeded constantly and you can get the reward really quick and get that feedback right away. They sprout within a couple of days and they’re ready to eat within three to four weeks’ time.

Keown: It’s fun to go with exotic stuff but we’re in a specific [gardening] zone.

Dory: Anybody in the Lower Mainland is in zone seven. You can grow most things here.

Keown : You want to look for things that grow easily or well in zone seven.

Q: What would you say are the most difficult fruits or vegetables to grow, which people who are just starting out should avoid?

Keown: Brussels sprouts. They’re delicious but delicious to a lot of pests as well.

Dory: The longer something has to stay in the ground, sometimes the harder it can be to maintain. If you don’t have the time to be managing that regularly, there’s more chances for it to go wrong. That said, things like tomatoes which are in the ground for a very long time, are quite resilient. If you’re looking for continuous bounty, things that have multiple harvests are great like kale or chard or tomatoes or peppers. Those things will keep giving for a long time.

Keown: And there are things to grow with them that keep pests away. If you want to keep them in an organic fashion, marigolds keep aphids away, so, if you’re growing kale, or something like that, you’d want to plant just a couple of patches.

Q: Are different places in the Lower Mainland better for growing different types of things. Would Vancouver be different from Richmond, for example?

Dory: The further inland you go, it’s not quite as wet as right on the coast so sometimes the biggest worry you have, especially in the spring, is just drowning when the plants get too wet.

Keown: The heat of the city helps.

Dory: Yes. The heat of the city can increase the zone, or even just a sheet of cloth or plastic over something. For every type of cover you put over something, you’re also increasing your zone. It’s basically like going south.

Q: What are some of your top tips for gardening?

Dory: The two most important things are paying attention to the soil and paying attention to the water. Those are absolute rules of thumb. It’s all about watching and observing. The faster you can pick up on whether or not there’s a pest or something going on that you don’t understand, the better.

Keown: Don’t get over zealous about what you’re planting. One plant goes a long way for a family. You don’t need six tomato plants or you’ll never want to eat a tomato again.

Dory: I would also say keep it simple at the beginning and then go from there. Don’t try to grow everything in the seed catalogue.

Q: If you had to pick three things to grow, what would they be?

Dory: As I was saying before, if you’re wanting a constant supply of fresh things, always plant those things that either come again or are multiple pickings — your tomatoes, your kale, your chard. Even lettuce that can be harvested multiple times and grow back. Those are things I would focus on. The return of those plants is much higher.

Keown: And peppers and cucumbers because they’re delicious and pickling is fun, too.

Q: How much time would a person have to devote to maintaining a garden patch?

Dory: Not very much. It just has to be consistent. It’s not really about a whole bunch of time, it’s about making sure you’re checking in with it every day.

Q: What are the biggest mistakes people make?

Dory: The biggest one is water — over or under. You don’t want it so the soil is sopping wet. You also want it to be able to hold together but crumble.

Keown: The other thing is not giving the plants enough of what they require — people trying to fit a lot into a little space. There are guidelines for it. West Coast Seeds has good guidelines for plant spacing and there’s a reason for it. You’ll get a better yield. You don’t have to cram everything in.

Q: Are there other resources you can suggest for people seeking advice?

Dory: The age of Google is amazing. Anything you want to know is there. Locally, like we said, West Coast Seeds is a great place. Figaro’s Garden Centre on Victoria Drive is also a great local garden centre people can go to.

Keown. And UBC Farm.

Q: What would you say to people who might be intimidated by the prospect of gardening?

Dory: When I started, I had no experience and I killed basil on my balcony on the first try before I started farming. Now we farm 20 acres of vegetables. If I can learn how to do it, anyone can.

Keown: Things will die but plants are shockingly resilient and forgiving.

Q: I think a lot of people are considering planting a garden as a result of COVID-19 and the fact they have more time at home. Are you hearing that and do you think gardening also has a therapeutic value?

Dory: I absolutely believe we’re not meant for isolation as a species. I think doing anything physical right now, especially getting your hands dirty or just getting out and getting the sun on your face, is a really good idea.

COVID-19, however, is the biggest game changer he's seen over two decades in business. And how it changes the game, Charko still isn't sure of.

But he's giving an attempt to maintain his business the old college try.

Charko has owned the Dunbar Theatre for more than 20 years and, as of March 22, the screens have been blank.

Charko stopped showing films despite his belief that he could make physical distancing work. He's got room for more than 300 moviegoers and was poised to keep showing films to groups of five and 10 provided they were far enough apart.

That's not an option now, so the ex-NPA member is banking on popcorn.

And lots of it.

Charko is running a drive-through stand outside the theatre selling all manner of junk food, including pop, candy, ice cream and popcorn. He's also contemplating selling fresh vegetables in the future.

Charko makes no bones about the health benefits of his popcorn. In short, there are none.

“Every step of the path that we do where we can make it healthy or bad for you, we choose to make it bad for you,” Charko told the Courier. “This is the worst popcorn ever for you but it tastes great.”

Outside of the pivot to selling munchies, a GoFundMe campaign has been started to help the Dunbar theatre stay afloat. The fundraiser was initiated March 26 by resident and theatre patron Kevin Tipper. More than $550 of the $1,000 goal was reached in five days.

“Not only is the theatre a place for the community to come together and share in the joy of movies, but it also employs many students in the area and has over the last 20-plus years,” Tipper wrote on the crowdfunding page.

Charko has five employees and maintains their jobs are safe for the time being. In fact, the Arbutus Street resident says keeping those people financially stable during the pandemic is the main reason he's staying open.

How long that can be sustained, Charko isn't sure.

“I'm stubborn and I don't know when that is,” he said.

The Dunbar is one of the last and oldest independent theatres in Vancouver. It was listed as the fourth most endangered building on Heritage Vancouver's 2019 Top 10 Watch List. In the last 15 years, Vancouver has lost the Ridge Theatre and Varsity Cinema, which Charko once operated.

The Hollywood Theatre flirted with closure before being saved two years ago and the Rio Theatre was in the same boat.

Having run municipally under the NPA and then more recently with Coalition Vancouver in 2018, Charko says he understands the reality of doing business in Vancouver.

Given the barren streets and length of time before life returns to normal, Charko has no idea when things go back to business as usual.

“Nothing has compared to this. This, in my mind, is the generational event that will define us. This is going to affect the world more than 9/11 and almost as much as [the Second World War],” Charko said.

Located at 4555 Dunbar St., the theatre is open weekdays from 3 to 9 p.m. and from 2 to 9:30 p.m. on weekends.

The COVID-19 wave continues to roll over the city and province, washing out much of what we have come to appreciate and take for granted in a functioning society.

article continues below

Your existence on Earth being number one.

Number two would be earning a living to buy food and pay for rent or a mortgage.

Human contact is also high on the list.

All of this threatening reality has unfortunately but necessarily fed news coverage, as have stories about exhausted health care workers, shuttered businesses and a freefalling economy.

So much news, so much of it dire.

The escalation in the number of people who have tested positive for the novel coronavirus has become a bit of a macabre scoreboard-watching exercise.

Which is horrible to say considering these are people we’re talking about, many of them elderly and defenceless against a deadly virus that lives in at least 13 B.C. care homes, including several in Vancouver.

As last count, 19 people in B.C. had died of the virus.

Understanding the trajectory we’re on, and tracking the velocity of the virus, is obviously important information to gather so we know the level of calamity ahead.

But there is some good news to report.

As we heard Monday from Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry, 469 of the 970 people who contracted COVID-19 since the outbreak in January have recovered.

Henry pointed out the recovery rate represents 48 per cent of total cases, and noted more than 70 people who were in hospital — some in intensive care — were among those who successfully combatted the virus.

“That’s really a testament to the importance of being in hospital at the right time, being ventilated at the right time — if they need it — and recovering from this,” Henry told reporters during a dial-in news conference from Victoria.

“That’s an incredibly important thing for us to remember. My hands go up to all of the care teams in our hospitals who are looking after these people.”

Henry didn’t mention him by name, but among those who did recover was a 99-year-old West Vancouver man living at the Hollyburn House retirement home.

The CBC’s Andrea Ross brought us this inspiring story. The photograph of a smiling Reuben Huva giving a thumbs-up is awesome, particularly when so many grandparents across the country have succumbed to the virus.

Where the good news doesn’t get as good is in the mounting number of people hospitalized, which is now at 106, with 60 people in intensive care.

The rest of the people with the virus are in isolation at home, which is important to note, especially when we see the images of over-run hospitals in New York City and Italy.

Like everyone else covering and following the news, it’s been astonishing to hear what we’ve heard this month from Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix about how our city and province has changed, and is preparing for change.

We heard Dix say Monday at the same news conference that the Vancouver Trade and Convention Centre is being set up as a 271-bed “off-site treatment centre.”

Never in my lifetime would I have thought I’d write that sentence.

But then I wasn't expecting to write about states of emergency, the widespread closure of businesses and having pharmacies deliver prescription medications to drug users.

Yet here we are.

Dix clarified the centre would only be used if it was required, noting “lower acuity or less ill” patients at hospitals would be moved there to free up space for COVID-19 patients in hospitals.

But he said a couple of times during the news conference that recent moves by government such as cancelling elective surgeries have freed up 4,233 hospital beds in B.C.

“With 4,000-plus empty beds, we’re not moving anyone there soon,” the minister said.

Whether there will be good news in the days and weeks ahead is up to every British Columbian, said Henry, who used part of her time at the microphone to again rally citizens.

It’s a critical time, she said, and the next few weeks of adhering to physical distancing and other measures will determine whether hospitals see “a trickle” of new cases or “dramatic increases.”

“We are not through the storm yet,” she said.

“We have not yet reached our peak. We have more people every day who are in hospital, and in our intensive care units. So we need to do all we can across government, across our health system and in our community. Every person needs to do their bit.”

Dr. Michael Schwandt, who was one of the first infectious disease specialists from Vancouver Coastal Health to help contain outbreaks at sites like the Lynn Valley Care Centre, made the comments not long after a group of 239 scientists from 32 countries wrote an open letter to the World Health Organization, successfully appealing for the world health body to change its guidance on aerosolized transmission.

“We'll be watching closely the science around airborne transmission. At this time, we don't think it's played a major role in the outbreaks in Vancouver Coastal Health that we've had direct experience with,” said Dr. Schwandt.

The new W.H.O. guidance, which came last Thursday, accepts that the novel coronavirus can spread through aerosolized particles — tiny droplets in the air — in crowded indoor settings for prolonged periods of time.

“There have been reported outbreaks of COVID-19 in some closed settings, such as restaurants, nightclubs, places of worship or places of work where people may be shouting, talking, or singing.

“In these outbreaks, aerosol transmission, particularly in these indoor locations where there are crowded and inadequately ventilated spaces where infected persons spend long periods of time with others, cannot be ruled out,” reads the W.H.O.’s new guidance, which also calls for more research into aerosol transmission. aerosol transmission.

But Dr. Schwandt said his team doesn’t view the airborne versus droplet transmission debate as a binary, and that while the virus can be traced at varying distances at concentrations, most of the cases he’s come across in Vancouver Coastal Health region, home to the first outbreaks in the country, have been from “face-to-face” transmission.

The proof, he said, comes from Vancouver Coastal’s success in tracing contacts based on direct contact, an experience a spokesperson for Fraser Health told the Tri-City News has been echoed in their health authority.

“Without taking airborne transmission into account as a risk factor, we've been able to bring outbreaks under good control, really looking at close physical contact as the main risk factor,” said Dr. Schwandt.

That means, at the moment, current ventilation systems in places like long-term care homes are not considered a risk factor in the spread of the virus.

Airborne or not, sharing air in large, indoor public gatherings raises everyone’s risk of transmitting the virus, as Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry reminded British Columbians in her daily update Tuesday.

“Stay away from closed spaces as much as possible,” she said. “If it’s a house party, you may not know all the people who are there.”

And like the W.H.O., health officials in B.C. said they are keeping an eye on the science.

“If more evidence were to develop around airborne or aerosol transmission, then naturally we'd need to look at preventative measures that include attention to ventilation,” said Dr. Schwandt.",[]

In a letter sent Wednesday to various ministers, the country's largest airline says the situation is becoming ""increasingly urgent"" as Canada has made virtually no change to its quarantine restrictions since mid-March despite improvements in containing the spread of the virus.

Air Canada's chief medical officer, Dr. Jim Chung, wrote that the restrictions are severely impacting the airline, its customers and employees, as well as an overall recovery.

He says the proposed measures mirror those adopted by the European Union, Britain and other jurisdictions.

The Montreal-based airline says it is not proposing relaxing U.S. border restrictions that are expected to be extended until at least late August.

It notes that requirements in place to travel to various countries include pre-departure medically certified negative COVID-19 tests to enter the Caribbean; a waiver of quarantine requirements after a negative test on arrival to Iceland, Austria and Luxembourg; and mandatory testing on arrival to South Korea, Hong Kong, Macau and the United Arab Emirates.

""There are many other interests affected by the quarantine restrictions — not only jobs and pensions, but also the social and economic well-being of individuals and communities that rely on air travel, as well as basic freedoms of mobility,"" says Chung.

""Business and labour leaders alike have implored the government to act on easing these restrictions in order to strike a better balance, without adversely impacting public health.""

In one cluster, at least 17 cases have been traced to a group of people who met up in Kelowna, some from the Interior and Alberta, others from the Lower Mainland.

“There are a number of people who have been exposed in those events,” said Henry Tuesday.

More troubling still is the emergence of new cases at the Krazy Cherry Fruit Company in Oliver, where two have been identified among migrant workers. They were among 62 cases identified in B.C. between Friday and Monday.

“Public health teams are monitoring the situation closely and have placed restrictions on those living and working on the farm to limit the potential for further transmission,” said Dr. Henry in a written statement today.

But others have expressed concerns that not enough is being done to prevent outbreaks among vulnerable groups. Where newly arrived immigrants were disproportionately affected at earlier outbreaks at poultry plants in Coquitlam, others say migrant agricultural workers still run higher risks due to inadequate housing.

“As anticipated,” said Byron Cruz of Sanctuary Health, an organization that works to protect migrant workers from predatory practices. “We knew that something was going to happen because the situation for housing in that farm is terrible. They were all crowded.”

‘WAY ABOVE MY COMFORT ZONE’

Yesterday, Dr. Henry warned 25 cases a day was “distressing” and “cautionary to us.” And while not unexpected due to the increased travel and social interaction of phase 3, she said “That’s way above my comfort zone.”

Dr. Henry urged anyone who attended Canada Day parties in the vicinity of the Kelowna cluster to self-monitor for even the mildest of symptoms, noting that anyone can be tested should they feel they’ve been exposed.

Just how quickly a province or state can backslide has been painted in stark relief among our neighbours to the south.

In comments to the press Tuesday, Health Minister Adrian Dix pointed to surges in several U.S. states where record breaking daily caseloads in several states have led jurisdictions like California to re-introduce physical distancing protocols, in what Dix described as “lockdown 2.0.”

“All our neighbouring jurisdictions continue to see an increase, whether it’s our neighbouring province to the east, Alberta, or others, Washington, Oregon and California, in Nevada, Arizona and in other American states — we’ve seen record days of new cases of COVID-19 recently,” said Dix.

Here in B.C., Henry said that on Monday, she checked how weekly caseloads are tracking with the province’s modelling that suggests British Columbians keep their social contacts to 65% of normal.

“We are still skirting that line. The RT, the reproductive number, is hovering around one… which is sort of pushing the limits of where we need to be,” she said.

While health officials work to contain the outbreak in Oliver, it’s unclear how a potential surge in cases will affect that calculation, and Byron Cruz of Sanctuary Health said he expects more cases to crop up in coming days due to their tight living quarters.

What is clear is the more cases are contained to a single cluster, the easier they are to track.

“This is going to be our dance over the next few months, where we do what we can do, we travel, we have those social interactions, but we do it in a thoughtful way so we do it with the people we know we’re with,” said Dr. Henry.",[]

The question is whether strong summer sales — driven in part by delayed purchasers waiting to buy since spring's lockdown — will carry forward to fall, experts said.

The Canadian Real Estate Association on Wednesday reported that June sales were up 63 per cent on a month-over-month basis, and 15.2 per cent higher than the same time last year. Prices also rose from June 2019, up 6.5 per cent to an average $539,000.

""Home sales, prices and starts have effectively regained all the ground lost during the shutdown,"" BMO chief economist Douglas Porter wrote in a note to clients.

""However, fair point that some of this outsized strength is simply pent-up demand for the lost sales from the key spring season.""

The real estate industry came to a near standstill earlier this year as non-essential businesses closed to help slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. CREA said the jump in sales returned them to ""normal levels"" for June, noting they were up 150 per cent from where they were in April.

Porter said the housing market now must keep up its momentum headed into autumn. Though at a glance, the numbers appear to suggest nothing ""amiss in the economy whatsoever,"" the market will have to balance slowing immigration levels, low interest rates and short housing supply, he said in the note. This tension will come with lasting scars, he said.

Also on Wednesday, the Bank of Canada released its quarterly outlook, forecasting an uncertain economic recovery ahead, and suggesting housing activity will slow over the next few years.

Royal LePage CEO Phil Soper said that the ""pent-up demand"" in the market has been boosted by first-time homebuyers looking for bargains during the downturn. That can crunch the number of new listings, since first-time owners don't have a home to sell, he said, noting CREA's data showed housing inventory at a 16-year low. The association said that the number of newly listed properties climbed 49.5 per cent from May to June.

If there are too many home buyers and too few listings available, that can drive up prices, said Soper. Soper predicts that more existing homeowners may list their homes in the fall, which may cause price increases to level off.

""We're seeing upward pressure on prices, and the highest levels of demand in Ontario and Quebec,"" said Soper. ""Things are good in other parts of the country, but they're quite calm, where the number of people looking for homes and the number of homes available for sale are roughly equal.""

Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Dominion Lending Centres, said in a client note that home prices are declining in Calgary, while elsewhere on the prairies, prices are either flat or rising.

Tim Otitoju, a Regina, Sask.-based real estate agent and chairperson of the province's real estate association, said that while the supply of homes for sale is steady and a bit low, sellers are getting more comfortable with the provincial measures to re-open business.

""We saw a surge in demand in June — we are actually attributing that to the buyers that held off during the shutdown,"" said Otitoju. ""It seems that buyers and sellers are showing a lot of confidence in the provincial reopening plan. Sellers are starting to put their houses back on the market.""

Soper said that he was reassured by the recovery in the West, given oil price volatility and regulatory changes in British Columbia. If immigration does slow, said Soper, it may be a few years before the long-term impacts surface, since homeownership for new Canadians spikes between three and seven years after arrival.

While home sales may be hitting ""normal levels,"" the overall housing market is ""obviously not back to normal at this point,"" said Shaun Cathcart, CREA's senior economist.

""The market has recovered much faster than many would have thought, but what happens later this year remains a big question mark,"" said Cathcart in a statement.

""That said, daily tracking suggests that July, at least, will be even stronger.""

The Canadian Federation of Independent Business surveyed more than 4,500 small business owners online from June 26 to July 2 and found that 2,100 respondents took on an average $135,000 in debt ($285.4 million for the responding group as a whole).

article continues below

Laura Jones, the executive vice-president of the organization that represents at least 110,000 small businesses, said debt has ballooned as 58 per cent of small businesses re-opened fully.

About 35 per cent are back to full staffing but only 24 per cent are back to normal revenue, she said.

""I've talked to many businesses that are open again, but are worried about being able to outrun the debt they have accumulated, particularly with sales still down,"" Jones said in a statement.

At the national level, that debt amounts to billions of dollars.

To finance COVID-19 revenue shortfalls and extra costs, the CFIB survey found 37 per cent of businesses are relying on personal savings, 34 per cent on credit cards, 18 per cent on bank loans, 11 per cent on retirement savings and 9 per cent each on mortgages and loans from families and friends.

Josie Rudderham, a co-owner of Cake and Loaf Bakery in Hamilton, Ont., wasn't surprised by the findings because her 12-year-old company was hit hard when COVID-19 began.

Cake and Loaf temporarily closed one location, permanently shut down a second and laid off workers right as the company's busiest season — Easter — hit. It emptied out what treats it had ready for sale and sent them home with employees or over to health care workers and food banks.

""A lot of expenses didn't stop, the overhead really didn't slow down that much, insurance itself is a big chunk of what we pay and that didn't get reduced. In fact, it went up,"" she said.

Rudderham, who has since reopened a location for curbside pickup, had to take out a loan to deal with cash flow issues and said many of her fellow small business owners did the same because they don't have the cash reserves larger companies do.

""I anticipate it will take us more than a decade to pay off some of this debt that we've had to take on because we are never aiming for profit,"" she said. ""We're aiming to break even every year and then every year we also increase wages because living wage gets recalculated every year.""

James McIntosh, the founder of Meaford, Ont.-based Duxbury Cider and chair of the Ontario Craft Cider Association, also stumbled on troubles when bars and restaurants were forced to close in March.

Duxbury's sales dropped 53 per cent, but McIntosh still considered himself fortunate because his family operates the farm and only has a few workers on staff.

He took out a loan and later, when patios reopened saw about a fifth of his licensed business came back.

Others borrowed money and didn't have such luck. They could be trying to cover what they lost for far longer, he said.

""Some of the smaller guys were really hurt because they didn't have an LCBO or grocery store (selling arrangement),"" he said. ""They were basically relying on what business they could drum up locally with bars and restaurants.""

According to the polling industry's generally accepted standards, online surveys cannot be assigned a margin of error because they do not randomly sample the population.

“The decision about criminal jury trials is entirely in the hands of the chief justice of the Supreme Court and the judiciary,” David Eby said. “On our end, the sheriffs and court services branch are working very closely with the judiciary to support the courts in getting jury trials up and running as soon as we can.”

The court is expected to make an announcement on criminal jury trials this week.

The pandemic has created a significant backlog in court cases, Eby said. Four thousand cases were adjourned when in-person hearings were restricted in B.C. Supreme Court. The provincial court has adjourned more than 10,000 cases, including traffic tickets, family matters, minor prosecutions and small claims.

To help deal with the backlog, Eby has proposed a one-year restriction on civil jury trials.

But people accused of a criminal offence have a constitutional right to a jury trial. It’s considered the key to a fair and just system. To choose a jury, whether civil or criminal, requires the assembling of a significant number of people, Eby said.

“Potential solutions include larger venues for jury selection and doing tiered selection, where you bring in one group of people, and then another group of people, as opposed to typically bringing in around 200 people and selecting from the pool,” he said.

The order of the provincial health officer limiting all public gatherings to 50 people makes it a challenge, he said.

At the Victoria courthouse, defence lawyers have been setting criminal jury trial dates for the fall, even though they believe it’s unlikely their trials will go ahead.

Criminal defence lawyer Jordan Watt said it’s difficult to conceptualize getting 12 people together, approximately one foot apart from each other, to listen to the evidence throughout a trial which could last one week or up to three or four months.

“Then to get them to deliberate together without there being some type of massive construction to the current courtroom setup that we have right now, it’s just not going to happen,” Watt said.

“Even if you go a step further, I think you’re going to have problems getting people to come to court in order to be selected as jurors.”

All the provinces are struggling with the issue, said Eby, who is part of a national committee co-chaired by Chief Justice Richard Wagner and federal Justice Minister and Attorney General David Lametti.

The committee offers national guidance to chief justices, judges and court administration officials on the gradual resumption of court operations across Canada. The action committee is dealing with the challenges of jury trials and hearings in small court rooms, circuit and remote courts. It has released a document around best practices for jury trials and how to try and conduct jury trials in the COVID-19 era.

Eby has repeatedly asked Lametti to give increased discretion to judges under the Criminal Code around jury trials to address the realities of COVID-19.

“He’s indicated that he’s willing to look at those things, but the earliest they could be in the legislature is in the fall, so we’ve got quite a period of time before that happens,” Eby said.

The provincial attorneys general have also been asking the federal government for guidance on the timelines of the Jordan decision during COVID-19, Eby said.

In July 2016, in R. v. Jordan, the Supreme Court of Canada created new limits of 18 months from the time a charge is laid until the trial is completed in provincial courts and 30 months in superior court. Anything longer violates the accused’s right to be tried within a reasonable time, unless the prosecution can show exceptional circumstances.

“It’s clear that in exceptional circumstances you can go beyond the Jordan timelines,” Eby said. “The question for everybody is how long is the exceptional circumstance in relation to COVID.”

He hopes the federal government can give the provinces a legislated COVID-19 period that is deemed to be an exceptional circumstance “so we don’t end up with different exceptional circumstances across Canada and different standards of access to justice for the accused.”

Eby is calling for mandatory arbitration of ICBC claims to deal with the backlog.

“There were already a significant number of people waiting a long period of time for their trials,” he said. “Now we’re looking at allowing plaintiffs to require ICBC to enter into a binding arbitration process so they can have their matter heard sooner and relieve pressure on the court.”

Another strategy would allow people to appear virtually in both traffic and family matters. This would free the court from restrictions on how many courtrooms and how much spacing is needed, he said.",[]

That’s been the automatic response in most of the world. It’s undeniably effective, and an overwhelmingly popular approach. So Finance Minister Carole James committed Tuesday to carrying on. But her fiscal update vividly illustrated what the government is up against.

article continues below

Her February budget was balanced, with a few hundred million in reserve.

The new estimate is a deficit this year of $12.5 billion, the biggest ever, and one that developed almost instantly.

That’s not a forecast. The situation is so wildly unpredictable they’ve give up doing forecasts. They’re just “scenarios” now. So it could go higher.

As James said: “That's why we've developed a scenario, rather than a typical forecast, because of the unprecedented nature of COVID-19 and the uncertainty regarding the magnitude of the economic decline caused by the pandemic.”

She’s acknowledged there will be deficits for at least the next three years. But it’s more likely to be a decade or more.

(Two years ago officials marked the elimination of just one component of B.C.’s debt, the operating debt stemming mostly from accumulated deficits. It took 40 years to accomplish that.)

The federal government did a similar update last week. Its projected deficit of $34 billion has jumped to $343 billion because of the pandemic.

So the on-going federal-provincial plan to keep helping people is based on borrowing more and more money to pay for it.

Rock-bottom interest rates will ease some concern about the hole they’re digging.

And there are projections that the economic collapse will only last for a year. So an optimistic outlook would be a one-year catastrophe followed by a bounce back in 2021, followed by years of whittling deficits back down to size.

Government finances obviously depend entirely on the private sector economy. James’ briefing included an exhaustive list of crises in different sectors.

Roughly half the new deficit is the new spending to help people cope ($5 billion in direct aid, $1.3 billion in deferred taxes and extensions). The other half arises from a collapse in government revenues.

There is a billion less in personal income tax, another billion less in corporate income tax and $1.3 billion less in sales tax, as examples. That’s all due to retail sales dropping 24 per cent, home sales down 45 per cent, 235,000 fewer jobs, corporate profits down 36 per cent and a seven to eight per cent drop in the provincial GDP, all in the last five months.

“No one has a playbook for dealing with this,” James said. So the plan they’ve fashioned is based on the fervent hope this is a one-year nightmare.

She has plans to announce a “recovery plan framework” in September, which would outline the expectations for how $1.5 billion in stimulus spending might be used.

But all the “scenarios” depend on the COVID-19 daily counts. Any sustained increases or outbreaks could delay recovery plans. That would make economic calamity even grimmer and more protracted than it already is.

Whatever the virus does in the next while, COVID-19 will be around for years as an economic factor.

Just So You Know: James spent 60 minutes detailing the extent of the economic catastrophe. She ran through 24 slides showing devastating impacts on every single aspect of the economy.

But the official news release covering her update was a study in deliriously-upbeat positivity. It was headed: “B.C.’s strong fiscal response, economic foundation support people.”

It rehashed all the previous good news announcements, ignored all the alarms and buried the stunning news there “could be” a $12.5 billion deficit.

It’s probably a firing offence for communications staff to write anything that leaves a negative impression in these sorts of releases.

But in a world where governments are spending more than ever, getting their own news out and covering themselves on all platforms as they see fit, the release is a reminder: It’s good to get an independent view.

Amendments to the Workers Compensation Act would increase the maximum insurable earnings to $100,000 from $87,100.

article continues below

The government says it is aiming for at least 90 per cent of workers to have 100 per cent of their earnings covered if they are can't work because of an injury suffered on the job.

The bill would also allow the safety agency to obtain search and seizure warrants when it investigates workplace safety infractions, if authorized by a court.

As well, it would allow victim impact statements to be heard in court in serious workplace prosecutions.

Labour Minister Harry Bains said the changes will help injured workers and their families, while also giving WorkSafeBC more tools to investigate workplace incidents.

""This bill makes modest but important improvements to several aspects of British Columbia's workers compensation system,"" Bains told the legislature.

The legislation would strengthen the way occupational diseases caused by viral pathogens are handled by fast-tracking the presumption for when a virus was contracted on the job, if established by WorkSafeBC's board of directors.

The government says this would mean people who are at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 at work are able to get benefits more quickly.

It would also expedite health care for a worker before a claim is accepted in cases when treatment would likely prevent a significant deterioration in health.

The government says in a statement that the legislation would allow WorkSafeBC to adjust a one-year time limit on mental health claims because it ""is not realistic for most workers, given the delay or gradual onset of some mental disorders.""

The amendments to the Workers Compensation Act were developed after three expert reviews, which included consultations with employer, labour and Indigenous organizations.

The government says it also considered systems that are in place elsewhere in Canada and took into account the possible effects of the changes on employer premium rates.

More than 100,000 new claims are made in B.C. every year due to workplace injuries or fatalities, the government says.

There were 140 workplace fatalities last year, with 84 of them caused by occupational disease, 40 by traumatic injury and 16 the result of a motor vehicle incident.

The province says WorkSafeBC conducted 141 investigations in 2019.

Exactly one week ago, on July 7, the province recorded 12 new cases. What followed was an uptick in recorded cases:

• 18 new cases on July 8;

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12; and

• 21 new cases on July 13.

""I know it was distressing to me to see 20, especially 25 [new cases] one day,"" Henry said. ""That's way above my comfort zone.""

She added, however, that the slight rise in cases was not unexpected, given that the province has been allowing restaurants and other indoor businesses to reopen.

""We do know where those cases are,"" she said. ""We're testing the people who need to be tested.""

It would be more concerning, she said, if the cases were spread out across the province in an unlinked way. The most recent cluster of cases is linked to the Krazy Cherry Fruit Company in Oliver, she announced yesterday (July 13).

Given B.C.'s population, 20 cases in one day is also better than some other jurisdictions, she said.

The province has identified 3,128 infections since the virus first appeared in the province in late January.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,015 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1649 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 212 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 52 people who reside outside Canada.

Of the 209 people currently fighting COVID-19 in B.C., 14 people are in hospital with five of those in intensive care units. That leaves 2,730 people who have recovered from the virus.

No new deaths from the virus were identified in the past 24 hours, leaving the death toll at 189 people.

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

So far 399 residents and 252 staff at seniors' care facilities have been infected by COVID-19 in B.C.

Health Minister Adrian Dix said that it is his understanding that the federal government and the U.S. government have agreed to extend the closure of the two countries' border for one additional month, until August 21.

""This is obviously positive and necessary news,"" he said. ""Everybody who lives in B.C. knows how inconvenient and how difficult that is for many businesses and many individuals for a variety of circumstances.""

In a fiscal update Tuesday, B.C. Finance Minister Carole James said the COVID-19 pandemic will result in ""the worst downturn experienced in our province in recent history.""

article continues below

""The projected numbers are staggering, but they're not without hope,"" James said, in summing up B.C.'s fiscal position.

She said B.C. had entered the pandemic perhaps better situated than other provinces, as it had a balanced budget, a triple AAA credit rating and one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country.

B.C. also managed to contain the pandemic and flatten its growth curve better than some other provinces, and it has been able to move earlier on a phased economic restart plan.

""Because of that strength, we were able to take immediate action to help people, to help businesses, to help communities with our $5 billion COVID action plan,"" James said.

She said the province is expecting a loss of $4.2 billion in tax revenue, including $1 billion less in personal income tax revenue, $973 million less in corporate taxes, $1.3 billion in provincial sales tax revenue, $300 million in natural resource revenues and $882 million less in Crown Corporation income.

The province is also spending $5 billion in emergency spending, and has approved $1.3 billion in tax credits and deferrals. In total, the increased spending, lost tax revenue and foregone revenue will bring the deficit to $12.5 billion.

In February, James brought down, but never passed, a balanced budget and modest surplus of $227 million and provincial GDP growth projections of 2% in 2020.

""Mere weeks after the budget 2020 was tabled, our entire world changed,"" James said.

James said the B.C. economy is now expected to contract 6.8% in 2020, according to some forecasters.

Since February, B.C. lost 235,000 jobs, and saw retail sales declined by 23.6% in April compared to February. Overall, home prices dropped 4%.

Home sales declined 45.4% in May, compared to February, and B.C. merchandise exports are down 14.7% year-to-date, compared to January to May 2019.

""While the job losses in March and April were record-breaking, figures for May and June in fact have seen some recovery of the losses that we experienced in the previous two months,"" James said.

Asked if her government planned to resort to spending cuts to address the deficit, James said ""now is not the time to be able to cut back on services and support for people and business in British Columbia.""

As for any long-range plans for dealing with debt and deficits, James said: ""I do not believe that it's going to be a quick fix.""

Asked if the $5 billion that her government has already approved could be added to later this year, James said ""I believe the $5 billion is enough now.""

However, she added no one can predict what might happen should there be a second wave of COVID-19.

As for the $22 billion in capital spending allocated in the 2020 budget over three years for big capital works projects, like new schools, hospitals, bridges and roads, that will continue to be spent.

""This is going to serve us very well because it translates into huge investments,"" James said.

According to the survey released on Tuesday, 19.3 per cent of businesses could operate at their current level of sales and spending for less than six months but would have to take additional action if it lasts for a longer duration. Nearly 35 per cent of hotels and restaurants only have the runway for six more months of lockdown measures, says the survey conducted May 29 to July 3.

The results come as many businesses are looking at government programs or credit to remain afloat.

Almost 64 per cent of survey respondents said they were approved for outside credit or government funding programs such as Canada Emergency Business Account loans or wage subsidies. Less than 24 per cent of businesses said in the survey that their rent or mortgage payments were deferred during the pandemic.

While working from home has increased during the pandemic, only about a quarter of survey respondents indicated they would likely offer teleworking as an option going forward after COVID-19 spread is contained.

The version released on Tuesday was a follow-up to a crowd-sourced questionnaire on the Statistics Canada website, a collaboration launched in April, with the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, that surveyed 12,600 businesses. The sample was not designed to reflect the overall Canadian economy.

The Canada-U.S. border has been closed to ""discretionary"" travel like vacations and shopping trips since the pandemic took hold of the continent in mid-March, a rolling 30-day agreement that's currently set to expire July 21.

Officials on both sides of the border who are familiar with the ongoing talks, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss matters not yet public, say another extension until late August is all but inevitable, thanks to a towering wave of new COVID-19 cases that's swamping efforts to restore a modicum of normality in the U.S.

New York Rep. Brian Higgins, one of several members of Congress from northern states keen to see a plan for reopening the border, expressed dismay Tuesday at news he called disappointing but hardly surprising.

""With no leadership from President Trump to address the pandemic, cases in the United States are spiking and as a result U.S. citizens are not welcome in several countries around the globe, including many of our allies,"" Higgins, a Democrat, said in a statement.

Recent calls from Higgins and others for a plan to start easing border restrictions have been greeted with social-media scorn and derision in Canada, where recent polls make clear the idea of allowing entry to Americans any time soon is a non-starter.

The novel coronavirus has been particularly resurgent in southern states like Florida, Texas, Georgia and Louisiana, where businesses tried to reopen early, contrary to the advice of public health officials, and the wearing of face masks became a partisan issue.

""The U.S. and Canada should be developing a plan that lays out what continued, nuanced management of the border during a prolonged pandemic will look like,"" Higgins said.

""But the administration's failure to develop a national plan for widespread testing, (personal protective equipment) distribution and the rejection of social distancing and mask-wearing to slow the spread doesn't inspire confidence that such a plan is in the works.""

Wearing a mask, perhaps the simplest way to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus, has evolved into one of the most complex and flummoxing points of division in the U.S., thanks in part to conflicting signals early in the crisis about its effectiveness and the obvious reluctance of the commander-in-chief to embrace the idea.

It was only just this past weekend — nearly four months into the crisis — that Trump himself was photographed wearing one in public, during a visit with wounded service members at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.

Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, urged Americans to mask up Monday, saying facial coverings for everyone in the country would break the pandemic's back in less than two months.

""It's our major defence to prevent ourselves from getting this infection,"" Redfield told a news conference in Charlotte, N.C. ""If all of us would put on a face covering now for the next four weeks, six weeks, I think we could drive this epidemic into the ground.""

Paradoxically, new online polling from Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies suggests the idea of mandatory masking in public is more popular in the U.S. than it is in Canada.

Leger's latest online poll, conducted July 10 to 12, found 72 per cent of 1,001 American respondents supported the idea of mandatory masks indoors, compared with 67 per cent of the survey's 1,523 Canadian participants. Of those surveyed in the U.S., 41 per cent said they would consider it a violation of their personal freedoms, compared with 27 per cent of those in Canada.

""Americans are far more likely to agree that rights are at issue,"" said ACS president Jack Jedwab. ""Yet, despite the fact that Americans strongly agree that the mask requirement is a rights infringement, they nonetheless believe that mask wearing should be mandatory.""

Trump appears to be capitulating on other border issues as well: on Tuesday, facing a lawsuit from Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the administration abandoned a controversial measure that would have forced international students whose courses move entirely online to either transfer schools or leave the country.

That news likely comes as a relief to untold thousands of Canadian students studying south of the border, many of whom have been forced into virtual classrooms with colleges and universities having cancelled in-person classes.

Dr. Howard Njoo, Canada's deputy chief public health officer, was reluctant Tuesday to discuss the worsening COVID-19 situation in the U.S. in any detail.

But he said cross-border travel in a public health emergency is usually a matter of ensuring that both countries have a similar grip on the circumstances, taking into account factors like their respective health-care systems, testing and contact-tracing regimes and strategies for preventing transmission.

Given that a number of U.S. states are experiencing community transmission of COVID-19 and don't have the situation under control, it will likely be weeks or even months before the benefits of additional preventative steps become apparent.

""It will take some time,"" Njoo said. ""If I were to travel anywhere, I would stick to Canada for the time being.""

Bruce Clark, president and CEO of the biopharmaceutical company Medicago, cautions observers against holding unrealistic assumptions that his product — or any of the numerous vaccine hopefuls in development globally — can bring the pandemic to a screeching halt if proven viable.

Clark notes more than 120 companies are trying to come up with a COVID-19 vaccine, many of which have never been in the vaccine space before.

He doesn't doubt that ""something's going to come out of this,"" but he questions how effective it may be.

""Whatever vaccine we get in this first round — unless it's a miracle — it's not going to be perfect,"" says Clark, whose company began trials for its proposed vaccine Monday in Quebec City.

""It's going to have to undergo development, it's going to take probably years to come up with an understanding of the right vaccine, the right approach. It's not the panacea.

""To assume that we can have, in 18 months, the solution to a pandemic that comes around once in a generation, is naive.""

Canada's deputy public health officer Dr. Howard Njoo expressed similar cautions Tuesday, while acknowledging the need to develop viable vaccines and therapies.

""Lots of different steps are still ahead of us before we might even anticipate that there might be a safe, effective vaccine that would be available for use in the general population,"" said Njoo.

So much is still unknown about COVID-19, notes Clark, including how it may manifest during the flu season later this year.

He suspects a more likely scenario is that a vaccine will offer only part of the solution, along with new therapeutics and ongoing public health interventions.

Medicago's first phase of clinical trials will test the safety of a plant-based product on 180 healthy men and women, aged 18 to 55.

The randomized, partially blinded study uses technology that does not involve animal products or live viruses like traditional methods.

Clark notes that vaccine developers typically use chicken eggs to propagate a virus, but Medicago uses recombinant technology involving the genetic sequence of a virus, with living plants as the host.

The resulting virus-like particles mimic the shape and dimensions of a virus, which allows the body to recognize them and spark an immune response.

Clark says the plant-based approach is significantly faster and offers more consistent results than egg-based or cell-based methods.

It's the same method Medicago has used for a proposed seasonal flu vaccine that Clark says is currently being reviewed by Health Canada. If approved, Clark says it would be the first plant-based vaccine in the world.

While it takes five to six months to propagate a virus in eggs, the plant-based technique requires just five to six weeks, he says.

""In a pandemic, something like COVID, if you're able to cut that much time off development, you have a substantial impact on public health.""

Meanwhile, Clark says viruses are prone to mutations as they adapt and grow in an egg, which could result in a vaccine that doesn't exactly match the circulating virus. In contrast, ""a plant is a plant,"" and that makes production easily scalable.

""One plant behaves like 100,000 plants,"" he says.

The trial will evaluate three different dosages alone, or with one of two adjuvants provided by GlaxoSmithKline and Dynavax. An adjuvant can boost the effectiveness of a vaccine for a better immunological response, thereby reducing the required dose, Clark adds.

He hopes to know the safety of the product, as well as effectiveness of the adjuvants and dosing by October. Based on that, researchers would kick off a second, more targeted trial phase involving about 1,000 participants.

If that's successful, Clark says a third phase would involve about 15,000 to 20,000 subjects, include older cohorts, and may be a global study, depending on circumstances of the pandemic by then.

If the vaccine proves effective, Clark points to another uncertainty.

Because the company's commercial plant is across the border in Durham, N.C., he says there's no guarantee of a Canadian supply.

""'Guarantee' is a strong word,"" says Clark. ""Strange things happen to borders in the context of a pandemic.""

Such border complications were made clear to Canadians in April when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau complained about problems with incomplete or non-existent deliveries of critical COVID-19 supplies. At the time, U.S. President Donald Trump ordered U.S. producers to prioritize the domestic market.

Clark suggests similar hurdles could impact vaccine distribution, putting immediate pressure on Medicago to complete construction of a large-scale manufacturing facility in its home base of Quebec City.

""Certainly, we need a facility in Canada,"" Clark says.

""There's no guarantee on the easy flow of materials back and forth across the border should we have a successful vaccine. We have to keep the focus on completing the Canadian facility so that we have domestic capacity. I think this is what most countries are concerned about.""

By the end of 2023, the Quebec City plant is expected to be able to produce up to one billion doses of a COVID-19 vaccine annually.

Until then, Medicago says it expects to be able to make approximately 100 million doses by the end of 2021, assuming its trials are successful.

Clark says countries must temper any nationalist agendas that might emerge with a viable vaccine and acknowledge that the fight against COVID-19 is global.

Meeting that demand would require multiple manufacturers, multiple distribution routes, and lots of co-operation, he says, possibly through the World Health Organization.

""There has to be some ability to share those around and distribute, whether that's through an entity like the WHO, or something equivalent.""

The Liberals last week revealed this year's projected deficit sits at $343 billion, driven by an estimated $231.9 billion in COVID-19 spending, so far, and a massive drop in government revenue.

article continues below

With the deficit at levels not seen since the Second World War, Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies asked 1,523 Canadians whether they felt the government ought to immediately and quickly begin to scale back pandemic support programs to Canadians and to business.

Forty-one per cent said yes to that question, 44 per cent said no and 15 per cent said they didn't know or preferred not to answer.

The survey was conducted between July 10 and 12, just after the Liberals released their projections.

It cannot be assigned a margin of error because online polls are not considered truly random.

This week, the Liberal government announced that one of the biggest benefit programs — a federal wage subsidy — will be extended until the end of this year.

It covers 75 per cent of wages, up to a weekly maximum of $847, for eligible companies and non-profits that have lost at least 30 per cent of their revenues.

""Over the last three months you have seen me come out to talk with Canadians about what we're doing to help you and your family, your employer, your local businesses deal with this pandemic,"" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Monday in announcing the extension.

""We're going to continue to do that vital work.""

As of July 6, the wage subsidy had paid out $18.01 billion to 252,370 companies. Last week's fiscal and economic update from the Liberals increased the overall budget to $82.3 billion.

The other marquee support program, the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit, is set to expire in the fall.

The $500-a-week benefit had, as of July 5, paid out almost $54.8 billion to 8.25 million people.

Of those surveyed, 78 per cent said they were worried about the size of the deficit and how it may affect things in Canada in the long term.

In releasing the deficit projections, the Liberals didn't set out a plan for how or when they might get the books back to balance.

The survey asked respondents which of two routes traditionally use to cut deficits they would support.

In the survey, 60 per cent said the government ought to focus on cutting government spending, while 21 per cent said the focus should be on raising taxes.

Finance Minister Carole James said the numbers are staggering with job losses of 235,000 since February and a predicted GDP decline of 6.8 per cent by the end of this year.

article continues below

“We were preparing for economic moderation, we were well-equipped to be able to weather the challenges,” James said at a news conference Tuesday.

“What came next was unprecedented. Mere weeks after Budget 2020 was tabled, our entire world changed.”

The government has provided $6.26 billion in financial aid to businesses and individuals. Among the losses it anticipates this fiscal year because of the pandemic are close to $1 billion in personal income tax, $973 million in corporate income tax and $1.3 billion in provincial sales tax, James said.

The projected GDP decline in 2020 would be the worst on record going back to the 1980s, although it is also projected to increase by 3.1 per cent in 2021.

James said for context, B.C.’s real GDP has only declined twice in the past 40 years, falling by 2.4 per cent in 2009 and 6.4 per cent in 1982.

“As those numbers remind us, this could be the worst downturn experienced in our province recent history,” she said.

B.C.’s restart plan is showing signs of hope for the economy as consumer confidence increases, she said. The unemployment rate is slowly rebounding and fewer wildfires and floods have helped the bottom line.

However, she warned that the province’s financial forecast could change depending on many risk factors, including the possibility of a second wave of infections, the possibility of a vaccine, as well as the success of relief measures and central bank policy.

Regardless of how B.C. copes with the pandemic, James said its economy is also subject to the economic health of other jurisdictions, particularly those that buy from the province.

James said it wouldn’t help the economic recovery to pull back on spending, but the government will review every cent spent as it heads into the next budget year.

The B.C. government has tabled legislation giving itself room for three years of deficits, which James said will be re-examined each year.

James said she believes people care about provincial deficits because they understand it’s taxpayer money, but they also understand the emergency the pandemic created.

She declined to predict how long the recovery would take, given the many moving pieces at play.

“There is no question that COVID-19 has had a profound impact on the economy of British Columbia and that’s not short term,” she said.

The job losses have been widespread but some have been disproportionately affected, depending on a worker’s age, gender or which sector they work in, James said.

Young workers are among the hardest hit, with the unemployment rate rising sharply from 9.1 per cent in February to 29.1 per cent in June for those aged 15 to 24.

Women, who dominate the service industries and many of whom have also left jobs to care for family members, are another group more affected. Their unemployment rate rose from 4.8 per cent in February to 13.4 per cent in June.

The hardest hit industries include wholesale and retail, accommodation and food services, construction, culture and recreation.

The overall unemployment rate of 13 per cent remains at its highest level since 1987. While the job losses in March and April were record breaking, the figures for May and June have seen modest recovery as the economy started to reopen.

“The projected numbers are staggering but they’re not without hope. Things are getting better each and every day when we follow the provincial health officer’s advice,” James said.

The NDP government’s fiscal update was met with calls for an economic recovery plan by its political opponents, with the Opposition B.C. Liberals asking what happens when federal benefits like the Canada Emergency Response Benefit run out.

Liberal Leader Andrew Wilkinson also suggested the government should reconsider its pre-pandemic spending priorities.

“People in every corner of B.C. have had to adjust to a new normal and adapt their household budgets, so why is this government pretending it’s business as usual?” he asked in a statement.

The Green party said the province should transition to a green economy by helping traditional industries become more sustainable, spending on training and building local businesses into the supply chain.

“We can seize the once in a generation opportunity to strategically drive stimulus spending towards a future British Columbians want: an innovative, low-carbon, sustainable, just and inclusive economy for all,” interim leader Adam Olsen said.

That brings the total confirmed cases to 3,115. Of that number, 51 are non-residents who live outside of Canada but are currently in B.C. Although public health officials aren't saying where these non-residents are from, it is likely that some are temporary foreign farm workers, as there have been outbreaks at a number of farms in B.C.

There have been two deaths since Friday attributed to COVID-19. While there have been no new community outbreaks in long-term care or acute care facilities, there have been a number of community exposure events in the Okanagan.

Public health has issued an isolation order for the Krazy Cherry Fruit Co. in Oliver, where two cases have been identified at the farm. Interior Health has also issued alerts for possible community exposure events in Kelowna.

The agency previously reported that year-over-year inflation declined by 0.2 per cent in April, then took a further drop of 0.4 per cent in May as lockdowns put a damper on consumer spending.

article continues below

But a look under the headline figures showed consumers were spending more on items that don't weigh as much in the consumer price index, which tracks inflation. And they were spending less on things that weigh more in the calculation.

In a numbers experiment to better reflect pandemic spending, Statistics Canada found the annualized inflation figures for April and May would have been 0.0 and -0.1 per cent.

The research paper made public Monday says a specific consumption pattern, such as that happening during the pandemic, would need ""to be sustained in order to have a subsequent impact"" on year-over-year headline numbers.

The research was aided by data from the Bank of Canada, which targets an annual inflation rate of two per cent as measured by Statistics Canada's consumer price index.

The bank has warned that the economic shock wrought by COVID-19 and structurally low interest rates is having a deep effect on the inflation rate, which is far below the target.

The basket of goods used to form the consumer price index has been shaken by a shift in consumer spending habits during the pandemic.

People are buying less gasoline, which usually receives a heavier weight in calculating inflation, as its price has plunged and the frequency of car travel has dropped. Canadians are travelling much less, while grocery-buying is up.

Statistics Canada is to report June's inflation rate next week.

The Bank of Canada said in April that it expected inflation to be close to zero in the second quarter.

Beyond the end of June, the bank was less clear, citing the high level of uncertainty around the course of the pandemic.

The federal government's economic ""snapshot"" last week pegged inflation at 0.5 per cent for this year, then rising back to two per cent in 2021.

The reading was based on the average of forecasts from 13 private sector economists.

On Wednesday, the central bank will release its updated outlook. Governor Tiff Macklem has described what's coming as a ""central planning scenario"" for the economy and inflation, as well as related risks — such as local, but not national, lockdowns.

Indigenous communities closed during pandemic but at economic cost,['Nick Wells'],,"Indigenous bands along the west coast of British Columbia say their borders will remain closed to tourists and non-residents, despite the economic impact, as they work to raise awareness about the threat COVID-19 poses to their communities.

The Nuu-chah-nulth, the Heiltsuk Nation and the Haida Nation have all closed or restricted access to their territories and reserves.

article continues below

""Of course it's negatively impacting. But our directors have said, our chiefs have said, people before economics,"" said Judith Sayers, the president of the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council, in an interview. ""I think everyone is slowly realizing the impact economically, but right now we just really feel that we want to protect the members first.""

Members of the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council, made up of 14 First Nations along the west coast of Vancouver Island, have deployed a variety of tactics to help ensure their borders are kept sealed from non-residents.

Members of the Ahousaht First Nation, who live in the remote area of Flores Island, have deputized citizens to act as peacekeeping officers, Sayers said.

The Ahousaht issued a notice on July 2 that their territory, which covers a large area of land and water north of Tofino, including provincial parks, will remain closed to tourists and non-residents as there ""is still no vaccine, no anti-serum and no cure for COVID-19.""

Others, like the Tla-o-qui-aht in Tofino, had been stopping cars in an effort to convince them to turn around.

While Tofino is now welcoming back visitors, the Tla-o-qui-aht communities of Ty-Histanis, Esowista and Opitsaht remain closed to those who haven't been invited. The closure includes part of Long Beach in Pacific Rim National Park.

The concern, Sayers says, lies in the ability to test and contain any potential COVID-19 outbreak.

""A lot of our communities are remote and testing is not easily available,"" she said. ""If you're in Port Alberni, or Nanaimo, or Victoria, or somewhere (else), you can get testing and get results in 24 hours. It's not the same with our communities.""

The closures have resulted in disputes between Indigenous groups and local businesses.

The Haida Nation in Haida Gwaii have turned away non-residents at the ferry terminal, discouraged leisure travel and called on two local fishing lodges to rethink their reopening plans.

""We're such a close-knit community, I think that once we get a case of COVID, I think that it'll spread like wildfire,"" said Duffy Edgars, the chief councillor of the Old Massett Village council in Haida Gwaii.

Edgars said many local fishing lodges are respecting the Haida Nation's state of emergency, but is frustrated by others who want to open up.

""It's disrespectful,"" he said. ""These bigger (lodges) are coming in and just doing whatever they want.""

The fishing lodges that have opened say visitors and staff will not have contact with the Haida Gwaii communities, and they have emergence evacuation plans in place if a COVID-19 case were to develop.

Leaders and representatives from the Nuu-chah-nulth, Heiltsuk and Haida all say they would like to see more co-operation from the provincial government in working with Indigenous communities.

""It's really frustrating,"" said Marilyn Slett, the chief councillor of the Heiltsuk. ""We have a limited amount of time here, we think, before that anticipated second or third wave so right now is the time for us to be sitting down and having those discussions so going forward we're all working collaboratively together.""

Part of the issue, she says, lies in B.C. politicians encouraging residents to take part in inter-provincial tourism.

""We're seeing a lot more vessel traffic on the coast, we're seeing a lot more recreational boaters, and that's a really high concern for our community,"" said Slett.

The closures — many of which began in March — have been felt at a variety of levels.

The pandemic forced the cancellation of the Heiltsuk's Spawn-on-Kelp fishery this year, an event Slett says employs 700 people and is a hugely important economic driver for the community.

""Certainly our community put forward the health and safety before the economic driver,"" she said. ""So our community has been hit hard.""

Sayers says when the pandemic first broke out and restrictions were placed on communities, First Nations were bringing in food for members so they didn't have to leave their reserves and face possible exposure at grocery stores.

The Heiltsuk, Nuu-chah-Nulth and the Tsilhqot'in issued a statement in late June, criticizing the provincial government's reopening plan and what they saw as a lack of dialogue with First Nations groups.

All three want the province to commit to four conditions, which would allow border restrictions being lifted: COVID-19 information sharing, screening, rapid testing and culturally safe contact tracing teams.

Until those are met, Slett says, she can't see Indigenous communities fully opening their borders.

But the provincial government says it is committed to working with Indigenous communities.

""Many tourist-depending communities are now safely welcoming the gradual return of out-of-town visitors,"" said Sarah Plank, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation. ""At the same time, we acknowledge some smaller and more remote communities and First Nations continue to be concerned about visitors to their communities.""

The government is also working on scheduling a meeting with the Nuu-chah-nulth, Tsilquot'in, Heiltsuk and Haida Nations and other communities, she added.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologized on Monday for not recusing himself from discussions about the administration of Ottawa's $900 million student volunteer program.

WE Charity was initially selected to deliver the initiative under a nearly $20 million contract. Trudeau said he was aware of his family's ties to the organization, but unaware of the honorariums his mother and brother received for their involvement.

""It is not a surprise to me that they got paid by WE, but I did not know that they got paid by WE,"" Trudeau said.

""In this situation, I should have recused myself,"" he added, acknowledging that his involvement in Ottawa's student volunteer program has created controversy. Members of the Conservative Party of Canada have called on Trudeau to address his involvement before Ottawa's ethics committee.

""I get that. I made a mistake in not recusing myself immediately from the discussion.""

Trudeau said he will evaluate any requests to address the issue before parliament. He also said that, because of his involvement, the rollout of the student volunteer program has been a bit delayed – an outcome he deeply regrets.

In addition to addressing the issue, Trudeau said on Monday that the federal government will extend its wage subsidy program until the end of the year. More information on the extension is expected this week.

The prime minister also said he spoke with U.S. president Donald Trump earlier in the day about the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement – which took effect July 1, – Black Lives Matter, China, the two Canadians who remain detained in China and U.S. aluminum tariffs.

""I highlighted to the president that the pandemic has disrupted usual manufacturing processes and supply chains,"" said Trudeau. ""It would be a shame to see tariffs come in between our two countries at a time when we're celebrating the new NAFTA.""

Trudeau briefly told reporters to expect a joint announcement regarding the closure of the Canada-U.S. border.

Non-essential travel across the border is banned until late July.

But the government is being warned it may have to move the end date into 2021.

The program is the heart of the Liberals' promise to help Canadians get back to work, even if has to be at a slower pace, as the pandemic wanes.

Speaking outside his Ottawa residence, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the extension to give ""greater certainty and support to businesses as we restart the economy.""

Trudeau didn't say how the government will reshape the eligibility rules for the program that critics have said stop some employers from getting aid they need.

He promised more details in the coming days.

While some companies are back open with restrictions easing, other parts of the economy are still reeling from the effects of COVID-19.

Some sectors will only start up in the fall or even the winter and will need help into next year, said Ross Laver, senior vice-president for strategy at the Business Council of Canada. He pointed to airlines as one example where rehiring may be slow.

""I don't think anybody expects that those industries that have been really hard-hit, that everything is going to be fine by Dec. 31,"" he said.

""We need to bear in mind that some of them are going to need help for an extended period of time.""

The wage subsidy previously was to expire the first week of June but the Liberals announced an extension to the end of August in mid-May.

The government has yet to share eligibility requirements for July.

Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said the extension would be welcomed by many small companies that have seen costs return faster than revenues.

He also pressed the need for eligibility rules to understand how to qualify.

""Not a single employer in Canada understands whether they qualify for the July wage subsidy and we're in mid-July. So they need to do an awful lot better,"" Kelly said.

""It sounds great to have an announcement to extend the subsidy, but businesses in order to use it really need to understand whether they would qualify and what the rules of the game are.""

The program covers 75 per cent of wages, up to a weekly maximum of $847, for eligible companies and non-profits. Companies must show a 30-per-cent drop in revenues, a cliff that may discourage companies from growing, lest they find themselves suddenly cut off from federal aid.

""You don't want people to think that you get over the threshold and then automatically lose"" the subsidy, said Hassan Yussuff, president of the Canadian Labour Congress.

Yussuff also said the extension would bring some stability to reopening phases, and likely bolster job gains seen over May and June.

Last week, Finance Minister Bill Morneau hinted at changes to revenue-reduction thresholds when he spoke about reducing ""disincentives to growth"" in the program.

Kelly said the government could consider a graduated approach with smaller subsidies at lower levels of revenue loss, or dropping the requirement altogether, either of which would give employers the confidence to rehire faster, Kelly said.

The Liberals originally saw the wage subsidy as the key tool in helping cushion the economic blow from COVID-19 by helping workers stay tied to their employers so businesses could get back to normal quickly once lockdowns lifted.

The pace of spending on the program has been below expectations, with $18 billion paid to 252,370 companies as of July 6.

Instead, the budget for the program dropped as more workers accessed the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) for people who lost their jobs or nearly all their hours.

The $500-a-week benefit had, as of July 5, paid out almost $54.8 billion to 8.25 million people.

The budget for that program is now at $80 billion, but it's scheduled to end in the fall. Yussuff said the government needs to soon release details on how workers without jobs will transition to the employment insurance system, which was largely supplanted by the CERB.

The government's fiscal and economic ""snapshot"" last week boosted the cost of the wage subsidy program to $82.3 billion from $45 billion, in a sign of impending changes.

Perrin Beatty, president of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, said changes to the wage subsidy ""must encourage Canadians to transition"" off the CERB, and ""create a positive incentive to return to work.""

The July 8 fiscal update noted that small employers make up the largest share of approved wage subsidy applications, with the largest numbers of employees covered in manufacturing, accommodation and food services.

The ""snapshot"" also said men may be ""slightly more likely"" to be covered than women although there aren't firm numbers to rely on.

Adrian Dix said during a news conference Monday that warnings of possible exposures at a restaurant, spin studio, bed and breakfast and resort are believed to stem from ""private parties"" at the hotels.

article continues below

Eight positive tests for the disease are linked to visits to downtown Kelowna and the city's waterfront between June 25 and July 9, said an email from Interior Health, the regional health authority.

""When people come together for private parties — in this case it was primarily people in their 20s and 30s — the risks are considerably higher,"" Dix said.

The exposures follow the move to a new phase of reopening in B.C. that allows for tourism within the province. Although the accommodation industry was not ordered to close during the pandemic, many operators did so voluntarily but began welcoming guests again as part of the new phase.

Infections in B.C. inched up on Monday as health officials announced 62 new cases since Friday.

Two more people also died for a total of 189 deaths in B.C.

The new figures bring the total number of confirmed cases in the province to 3,115, while 2,718 people have fully recovered from COVID-19.

Interior Health also issued an isolation order for Krazy Cherry Fruit Co. in Oliver after two positive tests associated with the farm. Public health officials are monitoring the situation and placed restrictions on those living and working on the farm, the government said in a news release.

The cases linked to Kelowna involved people who live in three regions of the province, including the Interior, Fraser and Vancouver Coastal Health regions, said Dix. He credited contact tracers with making the connections.

He said the tourism industry has done a good job of creating safe environments for guests, but it's also up to guests to ensure they respect physical distancing guidelines and group size limitations.

""Whether it's a trip or a party at home, the same risks and the same rules apply,"" Dix said.

If you're gathering with friends and family, you should consider the increased risk that indoor locations pose and determine how many people can maintain a safe distance accordingly, he said.

""We have got to live with COVID-19 for the next year so that means the responsibility is on all of us to understand the risks and understand our responsibilities to one another.""

Interior Health issued an exposure advisory for the resort and bed and breakfast on Friday and added the restaurant and spin studio in a statement on Sunday.

Visitors to the Boyce Gyro Beach Lodge on July 1 or the Discovery Bay Resort from July 1 to July 5 were advised to self-isolate and monitor themselves closely for symptoms.

The health authority is now urging visitors to Kelowna's Cactus Club restaurant on Water Street between July 3 and July 6, or the Pace Spin Studio on July 2, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9 to self-monitor and get tested if COVID-19 symptoms appear.

The B.C. Centre for Disease Control also warns that a case or cases were confirmed on an Air Canada flight from Kelowna to Vancouver on July 6, but Dix could not say if that warning was linked.

Public health contact tracing is underway and the health authority said it's reaching out directly to anyone who has been exposed, where possible.

Testing is recommended for anyone with novel coronavirus symptoms, including fever, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, or a loss of taste or smell, said Interior Health.

""Milder symptoms may include runny nose, fatigue, body aches ... diarrhea, headache, sore throat, vomiting and red eyes,"" it said in a statement.

Anyone with even mild symptoms is urged to stay home and avoid travel.

Efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19 include physical distancing, regular hand washing, not touching the face and avoiding gatherings of more than 50 people, the health authority said.

Powell River-Sunshine Coast MLA Nicholas Simons has been adapting to new ways of carrying out democracy, mandated by regulations required to cope with the pandemic.

article continues below

Simons said he is going to be attending the legislature next week for the first time in what is being called a hybrid session. He said this means some people are in Victoria and others are functioning in their communities via videoconferencing.

“It’s very busy and there are a lot of issues that are related directly to the pandemic that I assist with when I can,” said Simons. “There continue to be issues for me relative to other sectors, including, of course, ferries, forestry and other ongoing interests.”

Simons said up until now, every day the legislature sits, he has been going onto Zoom and participating in the debate. He said if he is rostered to be doing his chamber duty in the legislature, such as next week, he simply attends in Victoria, where the number of MLAs has been substantially reduced due to physical distancing and maximum assembly numbers.

He said one significant change in legislative business has been the voting schedule. Rather than votes taking place during the day, they all get lined up and voted on at the end of the day, negating the need for everyone to be at their computer constantly from 10 am to 6:30 pm. The system, for the most part, has been working well, although there is the occasional glitch, said Simons.

There was one situation where the MLA who was voting remotely could not be heard, and so the clerk at the table phoned the member and got confirmation regarding the member’s vote.

Simons said those running and coordinating the hybrid system have done an “amazing job.” There are four screens in the legislative chamber and those in that setting can see members participating from their constituencies.

Simons said this is the first time a hybrid form of parliament has been conducted, so once again, BC is leading the way.

He said Question Period has taken on a new dimension because the chamber is not packed with close-together bodies “stuffed like sardines.” He said the opposition still has the opportunity to ask questions and the government has the chance to explain its actions on issues.

“It’s important for democracy,” said Simons.

When asked if British Columbians were being well served by the new system, Simons said: “I hope so. We’re making every effort to adjust the needs of our communities. There are challenges that everybody is facing.

“What we have to continue to do is figure out how government can best help our communities, our businesses, our industries and get to the challenges that are lying before us.”

Simons said with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the incredible focus by health minister Adrian Dix, and his dedication to the issue, has served the province well. He added that Dr. Bonnie Henry, as provincial health officer, has all of the necessary abilities to give confidence to the public.

“In this kind of situation, when you have dedicated people, incredible changes have been made to our health system,” said Simons. “We were prepared for the worst and we managed to relay good medical advice and the vast majority of people adhered to the recommendations and continue to do so.

“The message is as important today as it has always been. I’m completely confident that our government and our health officer have done their absolute best and the statistics indicate that we have been an outlier in our success.”

The new normal in the legislature has no horizon. Simons said the impact of COVID-19 will be present for a while.

“We are doing what we need to do,” he added, “and everybody recognizes that British Columbia can continue to stay strong.”",[]

The province said in a document released in late April that Stage 3 would include ""opening all workplaces responsibly"" and ""further relaxing the restrictions on public gatherings.""

The document didn't get into specifics, though it did say restrictions would remain on large gatherings such as concerts and sporting events.

Meanwhile, health officials in Quebec, the epicentre of the pandemic in Canada, are concerned about a spike in COVID-19 cases in Montreal linked to the reopening of the city's bars.

Over the weekend Montreal's public health authority urged patrons and employees who have frequented bars since Canada Day to get tested for the coronavirus.

Quebec reported 114 new COVID-19 infections Sunday, boosting its total to 56,521 cases.

The province is to introduce mandatory masks on public transit starting today, with a two-week grace period before users will be denied service as of July 27.

Montreal has also indicated that it intends to bring in mandatory masks for enclosed public spaces as of that date.

On the East Coast, Prince Edward Island is reporting another new case of COVID-19 — a woman in her 80s from Queens County tested positive and is self-isolating at home.

P.E.I. has reported four new cases of the infection since July 4 after being COVID-free during the months of May and June.

""I can't say no to a good time,"" said Edmonton Oilers fan Jeet Jermana. ""I'd be hard-pressed not to jump into a big party.""

article continues below

On Friday, the NHL board of governors and NHL Players' Association said they had ratified the return-to-play plan, paving the way for the league to resume its pandemic-hit season later this summer.

Toronto and Edmonton were also officially unveiled as hub cities where all games will be played, beginning Aug. 1. Training camps start Monday in the 24 cities with teams still in the running for the Stanley Cup, including six in Canada.

In 2017, when the Oilers nearly advanced to the Western Conference final, Jermana was among the thousands of fans who partied in Ford Hall at Rogers Place arena and in bars along the popular Whyte Avenue district.

But with COVID-19 this year, where teams will play in empty arenas, Jermana said he'll likely watch more games at home, maybe with just a few friends.

That is, he said, until the Oilers advance and he and other fans won't be able to resist going out.

""Once it becomes the 'real playoffs' I think more and more the momentum will grab,"" he said.

Matt Black of Hotel X Toronto, located west of the city centre where multiple media outlets have reported that several teams will be based, said the prospect of any accommodation for celebratory fan gatherings, even outdoors, seems unlikely.

Nevertheless, Black said he expects citywide excitement will be palpable, even with empty arenas.

""You look back to those scenes of Jurassic Park and Maple Leaf Square and all of that ... it would be great for people to be able to get together again but you just need to make sure that you're doing it in a safe manner,"" said Black.

The players themselves aren't to have any contact with the general public.

Dr. Vinita Dubey, Toronto's associate medical health officer, said in an emailed statement that players and staff arriving from abroad will also have to serve a modified 14-day quarantine as well as undergo rigorous screening and daily testing protocols, wear masks in indoor settings, physically distance and wash hands often.

An Edmonton police spokesperson said the service wouldn't be able to comment over the weekend on what sorts of preparations they might make for crowds when the season resumes.

Geoff Grimble with the City of Edmonton said the city's civic events management team would likely discuss the issue during a scheduled meeting on Monday.

""The City of Edmonton's first priority is public safety and we'll continue to follow the advice and requirements of the Chief Medical Officer of Health to ensure fans, players, coaches and staff remain healthy,"" Grimble said.

Oilers fan Brendan McLeod admitted he may be lured to a street celebration when — not if — his team advances, but said he still wants to maintain physical distancing.

""We have to get through this together or else it's not going to change,"" said McLeod.

But Shadi Merhej, who said he enjoys both hockey and the Oilers, noted the sport doesn't have quite as strong attraction for him in the summer.

""It's daylight 'til 11 o'clock. You don't want to spend half your day watching hockey,"" Merhej explained.

""I'd rather go for a bike ride, or rollerblade or golf.""

Shaw told reporters on a Zoom conference call that he was ""a little tone deaf"" with the tweets last Friday that were ""out of frustration"" and that he took responsibility for them and didn't want them to become a distraction.

article continues below

""I apologize for that, at no point was I saying I was going to break the rules or we're going to break the rules,"" Shaw said. ""We know as a team that's not an option and to get through this season, everybody is going to have to buy in and everybody is going to have to adhere to whatever protocols we're set under.""

He noted if other teams don't follow public-health guidelines, the season may be derailed in any case.

Shaw had raised concerns about the length of time players may need to stay in their current environment. He replied to a tweet from TSN reporter Scott Mitchell, who reported that multiple sources told him players could face a $750,000 fine and potential jail time if seen outside the ballpark — which also are the same maximum punishments in the Quarantine Act.

""We were told two weeks... not all summer... all summer is a bit much,"" Shaw tweeted.

In an email reply, the club said arriving in Toronto, players understood the maximum penalties for leaving the Rogers Centre footprint during camp.

""The rules have kind of changed a little bit from when we first got up here, it was the first I was hearing about that we could be possibly be in here all summer,"" Shaw said, adding he should've chosen his words differently.

He explained he'd rented a place one block from the Rogers Centre and had looked forward to taking walks by the water to get away from the game. Living in a hotel was not an ideal situation, he said.

Shaw said Blue Jays management — president Mark Shapiro and general manager Ross Atkins — spoke to players on Saturday about the situation.

""I was a little bit tone-deaf to the situation, I should have said what I said, should have worded it a little bit differently,"" Shaw said. ""I apologize for that, take full responsibility.""

The Blue Jays are training in Toronto while figuring out where to play this coming season as the shortened 60-game schedule starts in less than two weeks.

Ottawa has given the ball club the green light to hold training camp in Toronto, but hasn't made a call on games. No fans will be in the stands.

The Buffalo News reported over the weekend the club had checked in with that city about playing in that city, usually the home of the their triple-A club. Blue Jays officials have said Dunedin, Fla., the club's spring-training facility, is the most likely venue for home games if the team can't play in Toronto.

For his part, Shaw said he and his teammates are hopeful Toronto is the club's home this season.

He noted that weather and the COVID situation in Florida means that Dunedin would put the Blue Jays at a competitive disadvantage.

The Blue Jays are slated to open the season July 24 at Tampa Bay. The home opener is July 29 against the Washington Nationals.

Shaw said he doesn't foresee opting out of the 2020 season, given he was looking to this year as a bounce-back season on a one-year contract after an admittedly poor 2019.

Meanwhile, Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoyo said right-hander Chase Anderson is day-to-day with an oblique strain.

Anderson was projected to be a member of the Blue Jays' five-man starting rotation.

PETERSBURG, Fla. — Florida shattered the national record Sunday for the largest single-day increase in positive coronavirus cases in any state since the beginning of the pandemic, adding more than 15,000 cases as its daily average death toll continued to also rise.

According to state Department of Health statistics, 15,299 people tested positive, for a total of 269,811 cases, and 45 deaths were recorded.

article continues below

California had the previous record of daily positive cases — 11,694, set on Wednesday. New York had 11,571 on April 15.

The numbers come at the end of a grim, record-breaking week as Florida reported 514 fatalities — an average of 73 per day. Three weeks ago, the state was averaging 30 deaths per day. Since the pandemic began in March, 4,346 people have died in Florida of COVID-19, the state says.

Testing has doubled over the last month, going from about 25,000 tests per day to almost 50,000, but the percentage of people testing positive has risen even more dramatically. A month ago, fewer than 5% of tests came up positive on a daily average. Over the past week, the daily average exceeded 19%.

About 10.7% of Saturday’s 143,000 tests came up positive, with an average age of 38. ""I still think we need to increase our testing a little bit more,"" said University of Florida epidemiologist Dr. Cindy Prins, adding that the state and local health departments should ramp up their contact tracing.

Prins said that she's still concerned about large crowds, gyms and some restaurants as being places of mass transmission. Reports of illegal clubs and raves in South Florida is also a worry, she said.

""I really do think we could control this, and it’s the human element that is so critical. It should be an effort of our country. We should be pulling together when we’re in a crisis, and we’re definitely not doing it,"" she said. ""I know people want to live their lives. There have been a lot of other times, people have made those sacrifices in order to benefit our society. It’s almost like a war effort. That’s what we need right now.""

Terry Shaw, AdventHealth’s president and CEO, said Sunday on CBS’ Face the Nation that the peak of COVID-19 hospitalizations in Florida will be ""sometime in front of us in July.""

While on the program, he said that the health system, which has hospitals in nine states including 30 in Florida, has adequate PPE, a stockpile of ventilators and a clinical team that’s learned how to better treat the disease.

""I give you an example. Our length of stay in our ICU for COVID patients has dropped in half. The number of people coming in to our hospital with COVID that need a ventilator, we’ve also been able to cut that in half. And because of those things, our death rate has also been cut in half"" since the beginning of the pandemic,"" he said

The health system’s ICU capacities in Florida are currently running at about 85% to 90%. He said the system could turn some ""progressive care units"" into ICU units if needed.

Hospitals in several counties have stopped doing elective surgeries. HCA West Florida have ceased inpatient elective procedures at hospitals in Hillsborough, Pinellas and six other nearby counties, said an HCA spokeswoman on Sunday. Florida ceased elective surgeries statewide from March until early May in order to free up beds, and to reserve personal protective equipment for health care workers caring for COVID-19 patients.

Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach are the top three counties for hospitalizations, with 3,232 people hospitalized — 42 per cent of the 7,542 people in hospitals statewide for coronavirus.

Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez told CNN on Sunday that his county's hospitals will soon reach capacity, but he said more beds can be added, including for intensive care.

""We still have capacity, but it does cause me a lot of concern,"" he said.

Throughout May and into June, the state reopened much of its economy with some restrictions — and the number of positive cases began rising, but it wasn't until the last week that the daily death total began rising, too.

Because of the increase in cases and the positivity rate, doctors have predicted a rise in deaths, saying the mortality rate usually increases two to four weeks later as some of those infected get sicker and eventually die. Health experts are concerned that people are gathering in crowds, and have expressed concern that the Republican National Convention's nomination party for President Donald Trump will be held in Jacksonville in August.

On Saturday, the Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom reopened at Walt Disney World in Orlando, concerning health experts who urge people not to gather in groups. Guests at the park said that people were wearing masks and social distancing, and videos showed near-empty parks.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said that even with the rising rates, he still wants the schools to reopen as scheduled next month, saying children have not proven to be vectors for the disease in states and countries where campuses are open. He said while each county will have to come up with procedures, depending on their local infection rate, not opening the schools would exacerbate the achievement gap between high- and low-performing students.

""We know there are huge, huge costs for not providing the availability of in-person schooling,"" he said. ""The risk of corona, fortunately, for students is incredibly low.""

Helen Ferre, a spokeswoman for DeSantis, said Sunday that the state has tested more than 2.4 million people for COVID-19.

Ferre said the important statistic isn’t the raw number of positives, but the percentage — on Sunday, it was just over 11%, about 8 percentage points lower than the weekly average.

""The more people who get tested and are proportionately reporting negative for this virus is meaningful,"" she wrote in an email to The Associated Press.

Meanwhile, a commissioner for a county near Jacksonville is seriously ill with the virus, according to a posting by his daughter on Facebook.

St. Johns County Commissioner Paul Waldron had recently voted against a county ordinance requiring masks, but not because he opposed them. He said he wanted more answers from county administrators about which masks are most effective and whether the county had enough for employees and visitors at government buildings.

So what about 142 days?

""Every game might end 0-0,"" the Calgary Flames general manager quipped.

With summer training camps set to open Monday as the NHL lurches forward in its plan to restart a season stopped in its tracks four months ago by COVID-19, the temptation might be to spring a surprise or two — maybe a new power-play setup or a tweak to the penalty kill — when the games return Aug. 1.

Coaches for the 24 teams set to feature in the league's return have had ample time to plan, brainstorm and re-assess their systems and rosters. The 16 taking part in the best-of-five qualifying round have known for nearly seven weeks which opponent they'd be lining up against if the league got back up and running.

But don't expect to see massive changes — especially early — from the men standing behind the benches in those empty arenas in Toronto and Edmonton once the puck is dropped.

They have enough to worry about when it comes to their own players.

""Every coach is going to look at and break down the opponent and have a game plan to attack,"" continued Treliving, whose club will take on the Winnipeg Jets in the qualifying round. ""But because of the uniqueness of this time, there's more of a focus to get your team ready. I remember last year preparing for the playoffs and we're sitting there going, 'What are we going to do with the four days between our last regular-season game (and the playoffs)?'

""We thought we had two months to prepare last year and we were dealing with four days. You're dealing with four months here. So the focus for the 24 teams is how do we get up to speed? How do we get to our 'A' game when we haven't played for so long?""

Like most teams, Montreal Canadiens head coach Claude Julien and his staff met remotely via video conference on a regular basis after the NHL suspended the schedule because of the pandemic in mid-March.

And after it was announced they'd be facing the Pittsburgh Penguins in the qualifying round, those preparations ramped up significantly.

""I'm a believer that as a coach you can never get too much information — as much as you can get is great,"" Julien said. ""The important part is what you share with your players. That's where you have to be careful.""

Penguins head coach Mike Sullivan said his focus will be shaking off the rust and getting his group prepared for a situation that will see teams go from zero to 100 in short order.

""There are significant challenges from a mindset standpoint and making sure that we get out of the summer hockey mode or the social distancing skates into real competitive hockey,"" he said. ""Because that's what we're going to be faced with in a short period of time.""

But Toronto Maple Leafs winger Zach Hyman, whose club is set to face the Columbus Blue Jackets in the qualifying round for a spot in the usual 16-team playoffs, still believes there could be some subtle changes around the league.

""This is the unknown,"" he said. ""When you go in from the regular season into playoffs, you don't really tweak too much, you just kind of roll into the playoffs, rolling off your momentum from the regular season. This is a completely different beast, where what you watched a couple months ago may not be the team that you're playing against in the summer. It's almost like a brand new year with the same rosters.

""It'll be interesting to see how everything turns out around the league with the long layoff.""

Canucks defenceman Christopher Tanev said he expects Vancouver's coaches to have plenty to share about the Minnesota Wild.

""I'm sure they'll have a lot of information,"" he said with a smile. ""They'll know every little detail about the team and every player.""

The Wild, however, shouldn't expect more than the basics on the other side.

""It's unique that we've known who we're playing here for a while,"" Minnesota interim head coach Dean Evason said. ""The challenge, at least for our group, is we don't want to overload them.""

The Boston Bruins are in a slightly different position as one of the top-4 teams in the Eastern Conference. They'll take part in round-robin games against Washington, Tampa Bay and Philadelphia to determine the No. 1 seed on that side of the playoff bracket, but the Bruins won't know their first-round opponent until after the qualifiers.

""We're not going to introduce a whole lot of new concepts,"" Boston head coach Bruce Cassidy said. ""Even though you've had a lot of time to dream up a lot of different things, I don't know if it's the best time — a short turnaround with a lot of the line — to start messing too much with your game.

""We're going to try to keep it as simple as we can.""

For all the time coaches have had, that might end up being their best play.

Ferries is loosening some restrictions and increasing capacity as summer travel within the province grows.

Passenger numbers have risen to about 70 per cent of what they were at this time last year, said Tessa Humphries, communications manager for B.C. Ferries. In the early days of the pandemic, they were about 20 per cent of normal.

Passenger capacity had been capped at 50 per cent, but that restriction is being phased out to increase service, Humphries said.

That level was set by Transport Canada, which gave operators a choice between limiting capacity and implementing enhanced cleaning and physical- distancing measures.

Humphries said B.C. Ferries implemented both measures at first but has now decided to phase out the capacity limit. B.C. Ferries consulted with Transport Canada on the change, she said.

Enhanced physical-distancing and cleaning protocols, including clear plastic barriers and face- coverings, remain in place. Passengers are asked whether they’re experiencing COVID-19 symptoms prior to travel, and those in vehicles are allowed to remain inside their cars.

More than 300 sailings per month have been added on major routes between the Island and the Lower Mainland since the start of June. The company is aiming to keep capacity about 20 per cent above demand, Humphries said.

“We will have fewer sailings than in summer schedules of the past, but significantly more than what was available as a result of the service cuts in April,” she said.

The company has also added an additional vessel on the route between Departure Bay and Horseshoe Bay on Fridays and Sundays, and a second vessel on the route that services the southern Gulf Islands on Thursdays through Mondays.

“We did also hear from the communities that there was a struggle for capacity there,” Humphries said, adding that it wasn’t uncommon for sailings on Gulf Islands route to be completely booked.

Passengers travelling by car are encouraged to book in advance or choose less busy times to travel.

Humphries said B.C. Ferries expects it will take a couple of years before passenger numbers return to pre-pandemic levels.

Onboard food services have resumed on some minor routes, including between Swartz Bay and the Gulf Islands, and the Passages gift shop reopened Friday on sailings between Swartz Bay and Tsawwassen. Packaged food and limited hot food resumed on three major routes between the Island and the Lower Mainland in June.

The Lands End Café in the Swartz Bay terminal also recently reopened. Markets in the Departure Bay and Tsawwassen terminals reopened in late June.

The drop in ferry traffic has cost B.C. Ferries millions of dollars in lost revenue.

Humphries said the company is evaluating the financial situation daily and reopening onboard amenities will provide another revenue stream.

“But we’re all doing all of that carefully and gradually, as well as safely reintroducing these services,” she said.

But even the best efforts have left doctors stymied about the source of more than one-third of this country's known COVID-19 infections. Not knowing where cases come from makes outbreaks that much harder to stamp out.

article continues below

Now medical researchers and supercomputers are turning genetics labs into virus detective agencies, looking first to find the novel coronavirus itself within blood samples from thousands of infected patients, and then comparing all of those isolated viruses to each other looking for places they differ.

Every close match will draw a line from patient to patient, ultimately painting a picture of how the virus spread.

""This is the big effort over the next four weeks,"" said Andrew McArthur, director of the biomedical discovery and commercialization program at McMaster University.

""What's going to come out of there pretty soon is a glimpse of what just happened, how did it move around the province, how did it move between provinces or how big was Pearson (airport) in the early days of the airport being open.""

Knowing how the virus spread will show where there were weaknesses in public health measures early on, said McArthur. Being able to keep divining genetic codes from samples will mean when there are flare-ups of cases, they can be quickly compared to each other to see if they're all related or are coming from multiple sources.

It means, for example, a long-term care centre should be able to quickly know if its 10 new cases are because one case spread widely or arose from multiple carriers coming into the facility.

""That's a very different infection-control problem,"" said McArthur.

It also means that maybe, just maybe, the second COVID-19 wave most think is coming won't be as bad, or as hard to control, as the first, because the sources can be isolated very quickly.

""A second wave is likely,"" McArthur said. ""But we've never spent this kind of money and effort before, either, so maybe we'll beat it.""

The kinds of genetic technology being used for this project did not exist when SARS hit Canada in 2003.

This genetic mapping is constantly on the look-out for mutations. Thus far, SARS-CoV-2, the official name for the virus that causes COVID-19, has not mutated as quickly as many others do. Influenza, for instance, changes so much over a year the vaccine has to be retooled every summer to keep up.

But there are enough subtle changes still happening among the 28,000 individual markers that make up a genome for SARS-CoV-2 that cases can be traced backward and linked to the ones that came before. McArthur said it takes a lot of data storage, a lot of high-capacity computer analysis, and a lot of money, to run the comparisons among them all.

The federal government put $40 million on the table in April for genetic research on COVID-19. Half is to keep tabs on the virus as it spreads, look for any changes it undergoes, and map its pathway across the country. The other half is to look at the genetic structures of the patients who get infected, trying to answer the puzzling question of why some people die and others have symptoms so mild they never even know they are sick.

Genome Canada is administering the project, with six regional genomics agencies overseeing the work locally and labs like McArthur's doing the testing and analysis. The funding is intended to create genetic maps from 150,000 patients. Canada thus far has had about 108,000 positive cases, and the expectation is that almost every one of them will be gene-mapped.

The results will be loaded into a global site comparing all known infections of COVID-19, but also be analyzed for national and regional reports.

In New York, genetic sequencing was used to figure out that COVID-19 in Manhattan wasn't coming from China and Iran as imagined, but from Europe. In Canada, it is suspected that much of the virus came into this country from travellers returning from the United States in early March. But the work is only now beginning to confirm that belief.

McArthur estimates the first data will be available for Ontario in about four weeks, but warns it will take many more months to complete all of the tests. His lab sequenced 600 samples on Wednesday alone.

Overall, McArthur expects the genetics project to last for two years.

Trump flew by helicopter to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in suburban Washington to meet wounded servicemembers and health care providers caring for COVID-19 patients. As he left the White House, he told reporters: ""When you're in a hospital, especially ... I think it’s a great thing to wear a mask.""

article continues below

Trump was wearing a mask in Walter Reed's hallway as he began his visit. He was not wearing one when he stepped off the helicopter at the facility.

The president was a latecomer to wearing a mask during the pandemic, which has raged across the U.S. since March and infected more than 3.2 million and killed at least 134,000. Most prominent Republicans, including Vice-President Mike Pence, endorsed wearing masks as the coronavirus gained ground this summer. Republican governors have been moving toward requiring or encouraging the use of masks as the pandemic has grown more serious in some states in the South and West.

Trump, however, has declined to wear a mask at news conferences, coronavirus task force updates, rallies and other public events. People close to him have told The Associated Press that the president feared a mask would make him look weak and was concerned that it shifted focus to the public health crisis rather than the economic recovery. They spoke on condition of anonymity to describe private matters.

While not wearing one himself, Trump has sent mixed signals about masks, acknowledging that they would be appropriate if worn in an indoor setting where people were close together. But he has accused reporters of wearing them to be politically correct and has retweeted messages making fun of Democratic rival Joe Biden for wearing a mask and implying that Biden looks weak.

Questions remain whether Trump will wear a mask with any regularity.

The wearing of masks became another political dividing line, with Republicans more resistant to wearing them than Democrats. Few masks were seen at recent Trump campaign events in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Phoenix and South Dakota’s Mount Rushmore.

The only time Trump has been known to wear a mask was during a private part of a tour of a Ford plant in Michigan.

A spokesman for the Biden campaign cast the president's action as too little, too late.

""Donald Trump spent months ignoring the advice of medical experts and politicizing wearing a mask, one of the most important things we can do to prevent the spread of the virus,"" spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement. ""Rather than taking responsibility and leading, he wasted four months that Americans have been making sacrifices by stoking divisions and actively discouraging people from taking a very basic step to protect each other.""

On its website, Walter Reed carries this recommendation: ""Whenever you’re out in public, like at your local grocery store or pharmacy, where it’s difficult to maintain 6 feet of social distance, you should wear a cloth face covering."" The facility also notes that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends wearing cloth face coverings to slow the spread of the coronavirus.""",[]

While hundreds of people could be employed in positions relating to the games and hubs — such as security jobs, rink staff, food services and hotel housekeeping — the financial benefit of two bubble communities under tight seal would be ""modest"" at best, suggested Bank of Montreal chief economist Douglas Porter.

article continues below

""When you think of how many tourists would normally be in Toronto during peak tourist season, I'm quite sure this is less than one per cent,"" he said.

""The reality is, it's not going to move the needle.""

But Porter, a lifelong hockey fan, said he anticipates a ""reasonably meaningful positive"" morale boost to Canadian sports fans who've been eagerly anticipating players returning to the ice in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The games are slated to start Aug. 1 with six Canadian teams qualifying for the 24-team resumption of play. No fans will be in the seats.

Edmonton and Toronto were confirmed as the NHL's hub cities on Friday night.

""The fact that part of our world is getting back to some kind of normal will help reinforce the sense that things, generally, are moving in that direction and could help support the recovery,"" Porter said.

The gradual comeback of major sporting events has drawn plenty of interest in recent weeks, with debates raging over the risks of putting players back into the games, even if spectators aren't allowed in the facilities.

Further questions have been raised over whether rigorous testing is enough to prevent outbreaks within the isolated community, which could potentially throw the whole plan into a costly disarray.

Many of these factors make placing a value on hockey's return especially difficult.

Michael Naraine, a professor at Brock University in St. Catharines, Ont., said the largest amount of money is on the line at large corporations, which he said is driving the return of major sporting events.

""The primary revenue driver for sports is broadcasting,"" said the assistant professor of digital sport management and marketing.

""They need television advertisers come back. The league itself needs to gain its revenue from NBC and Sportsnet here in Canada.""

Politicians have preferred to emphasize the positive aspects of a deal with the NHL.

Alberta Premier Jason Kenney eagerly promoted Edmonton as the ultimate hub city for the hockey league, posting videos on Twitter that prominently featured the Rocky Mountains and other popular destinations in the province.

Naraine said those public expressions by leaders are more an attempt to ""pander"" to their constituents than actually drive any meaningful economic impact. He said this is especially the case in Edmonton.

""Having major events come to town allows them to beat their chests and say, 'We exist. We're on the map. Come look at us,'"" he said.

""But the fact that the hub city will be in Edmonton is no different than whether the hub city would be in Toronto or Vancouver or elsewhere. It's not going to significantly drive tourism all of a sudden.""

Patrick Rishe, a sports professor at Washington University in St. Louis, said he sees value in showcasing a lesser known Canadian city on broadcast television with ""beauty shots"" of the locale. He said it may also sit well with NHL executives.

""You never know,"" he said. ""Doing and serving a good deed for the league now, this could pay dividends down the road.""

Any semblance of a regular hockey season would be welcomed by Dana Parris, owner of the Lockeroom sports bar in Barrie, Ont.

Even though her business is over 100 kilometres away from downtown Toronto, she anticipates the excitement would reverberate to her customers.

""If we could have sports come back and we hit Stage 3 (of Ontario's COVID reopening plan) around the same time, I will probably stop crying myself to sleep,"" she said.

""If those two come together it's just going to be the most beautiful thing.""

Collins made the comments in a July 8 update on summer travel and the impact of COVID-19 on the ferry service.

article continues below

Local governments on the Sunshine Coast and the Southern Sunshine Coast Ferry Advisory Committee have been pressing Ferries to add more trips to the Langdale-Horseshoe Bay route to meet the anticipated demand from residents, businesses and tourists now that travel within the province is no longer being discouraged.

Although BC Ferries is now running eight round-trips a day on Route 3, with two additional sailings on Fridays and Sundays starting July 10, there have still been frequent overloads and delays.

In a recent letter to BC Ferries, Sechelt councillors pointed out that the Sunshine Coast economy is “heavily reliant on tourism” and reduced capacity on the Langdale route could “limit our community’s recovery.”

“Our vision for Route 3 this summer is simple – provide the same level of service as last summer,” the letter said. “This would include the additional sailings we had last summer and maintaining increased time between sailings to ensure ferries run on time.”

Councillors in Gibsons are also sending BC Ferries a letter, asking the ferry company to “recognize the needs of small businesses on the Coast requiring deliveries of materials, including perishable goods, for their operations.”

In his update, Collins said traffic is beginning to grow again after dropping around 80 per cent in March and April and is expected to continue to increase throughout the summer.

“This summer, we are going to need your help, your patience and your understanding,” Collins said. “While we’re adding sailings as fast as we can, there still will be some sailing limitations this summer as we weren’t able to hire and train summer seasonal staff in March and April due to COVID-19. We are planning for summer service to exceed demand, but we won’t have the same number of sailings as last summer.”

Collins also acknowledged the inconvenience caused by schedule changes, some of which have happened on short notice. Sunshine Coast residents in particular have complained about trouble with rebooking reservations and long waits on hold with customer service.

“Over the past month or so, we’ve revised our schedules more often than normal, as we bring more sailings back into service,” he said. “I know this has impacted some of our customers, but every time we add more sailings, we need to revise the schedules one more time.”

Collins said BC Ferries is putting the bulk of its efforts into brining back service and is working with the province “to examine the impact COVID-19 is having on the ferry system.”

“We need to protect the core of the ferry system and continue to provide safe, reliable service to British Columbians.”",[]

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreaks at Tabor and at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred to those homes from the hospital. The outbreak at the Tabor long-term care home was declared over on July 7.

B.C.'s provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix said in a July 10 joint statement that the province recorded 25 new cases in the past 24 hours, for a total of 3,053 cases since the virus that has caused a global pandemic first appeared in B.C. in late January.

North Island-Powell River MP Rachel Blaney has been working through her parliamentary commitments to ensure the reshaped government is being responsive to Canadians.

Blaney, in an interview on July 8, said she had just sat through a hybrid sitting of the House of Commons, which was “one for the record books.”

article continues below

“We’ll see what happens next but it was interesting,” said Blaney. “There were some parliamentarians in parliament and the rest of them were across the country. When we are sitting in front of our screen, we are seeing our colleagues from all over in their offices and their homes. We are participating in our democracy in a completely different way.”

Blaney said as the parliamentarian who represents the NDP on the procedural and house affairs committee, what is being done by the committee is looking at what the House of Commons can look like in the fall, and how to address the issue of being able to do the full spectrum of work that is usually done, understanding that everybody cannot be in the house simultaneously. She said a report will come out and will be made public.

Blaney said there have been a lot of discussions at the committee level about security, such as with online platforms, and what kinds of methods should be looked at in terms of voting.

“We all know that is very important,” said Blaney, about voting. “If there is any voting happening now, it’s just the members in the house, percentage wise, representing each party. It’s definitely been an experience doing the work that you’ve done for your career but doing it in a very different way.”

Running the federal government in a hybrid system has many complexities. There are 338 parliamentarians, so accommodating the sheer number of people in the House of Commons and online is an issue. Blaney said one intricacy is that as parliament does its work, everything has to be simultaneously interpreted in French and English.

She said one of the things being looked at in the report is around the reality that in the last parliament, there was also some indigenous language spoken with an interpreter present, so there is a process that has to happen to allow that in the revised House of Commons.

“Now that we are in a different format of parliament, we are trying to find a way to follow the rules we’ve set for ourselves for that kind of flexibility,” said Blaney.

She said the committee has looked at other parliaments across the planet, seeing how other governments are coping with administration of democracy during the pandemic.

“I’m not sure what the final recommendations will be but I do believe there has to be a way to allow people who can only participate virtually to have a voice,” said Blaney. “It’s really important to honour those voices and make sure they have the capacity to represent their regions.”

In more remote areas of the country, where internet service is not as robust as it is in other areas, there may also be some issues with connectivity, said Blaney. She said the committee has worked closely with the House of Commons to make sure those issues are taken into consideration.

“If we’re in a position of taking a vote, how do we make sure those folks don’t miss out because of some sort of technical challenge that has happened?” said Blaney. “The committee has been looking long and hard into those issues, wanting to make sure we really honour parliament and the history of parliament, but recognizing that sometimes we have to adapt to these new circumstances.”

She said she is ultimately looking forward to going back to Ottawa and participating in parliament and seeing all of her colleagues there, because she thinks that part of the work is very important. Blaney acknowledges that a return to the old method of governance is an unknown. COVID-19 is the reality and everyone has seen how things have fundamentally changed, she added.

The work of the all-party COVID-19 committee in parliament is done, said Blaney, so parliamentarians will continue to meet through the hybrid system.

She said the hybrid parliament will be meeting at least four times this summer and it is something the NDP fought for during negotiations.

“We wanted to make sure, during changing times, the government was held to account twice a month over the summer months because things are changing quickly and we need the ability to ask questions and to hold the government to account during these very challenging times,” said Blaney.

She said the parliamentary structure is fundamental to Canada, and if it is going to be changed or altered, she said she hopes the government is thoughtful in how it is going to change it, and that parliament is not taken for granted.

“We need to focus on how we are going to do the work,” said Blaney, “in the middle of a pandemic.”",[]

Metro Inc. was aware of Loblaw Companies Ltd.'s decision to stop its so-called pandemic pay program before it made a similar decision, chief executive Eric La Fleche told the House of Commons standing committee on industry, science and technology Friday.

article continues below

La Fleche said that a Metro competitor's move was one of several influencing factors in its decision-making process.

He joined the Loblaw president and Empire Co. Ltd. chief executive at a two-hour session about why they stopped paying a temporary wage bump to employees as of June 13.

""Let me be absolutely clear, we did not co-ordinate our decisions,"" said Michael Medline, Empire CEO, in his opening statement before the committee. Medline, whose company owns the Sobeys and Safeway brands, was the first of the trio to give his opening remarks.

""The decision was our own.""

Loblaw president Sarah Davis echoed the sentiment, but noted she sent a ""courtesy email"" to both competitors, as well as Walmart and Save-On-Foods, on June 11. The latter two did not appear at the hearing.

The email notified competitors of Loblaw's decision to end its pandemic pay program on June 13. The company had already informed its roughly 200,000 employees, she said, and recognized ""the news would be public immediately.""

La Fleche said in later questioning that he was aware of the email when Metro made its decision to end its bonus pay program on the same day.

""We made our own decision based on the information we had, which included that last piece of information, yes,"" he said.

He called it ""one factor among others"" contributing to its decision. Other factors included the broader economic reopening, other retailers starting to open their doors, lower business volumes and a gradual return to more normal conditions.

Empire had not received Davis's email when the company made its decision to terminate the extra wages, said Medline, but had heard through the grapevine that Loblaw was considering doing so.

Davis received a reply to her June 11 email, and said she would provide copies of the original and all answers to the committee.

She also sent a courtesy email to competitors when Loblaw decided to begin its extra pay program. Davis said she doesn't recall sending courtesy emails to competitors on other topics, including executive compensation.

In addition to receiving the email, La Fleche said he made several phone calls to competitors in May and June to ask whether they planned to extend their bonus pay programs or end them on previously announced dates.

""In perfect compliance with The Competition Act, I asked my counterparts their intentions regarding whether or not they would maintain the temporary bonus,"" he said, in a translation from French, during his opening remarks.

In each case, competitors, including Medline from Empire and Davis from Loblaw, told him they had not yet decided.

""Whatever the case, those calls were made in a decisional process that was much larger and ... did not inform our decisions.""

When asked why he made the phone calls, La Fleche answered he ""wanted as much information as I could have in order to make a best decision for our company, our employees at the right time.""

He said he would ""absolutely not"" characterize those conversations as trying to obtain a tacit agreement on wages.

Those who sent emails and made phone calls said they consulted with company counsel before doing so and lawyers were present during at least one phone discussion.

The appearance was a chance for the executives to admit they were wrong to end the pay increases, said Jerry Dias, president of Unifor, a private sector union.

""What we got instead was highly paid grocery executives insisting they did not collude, and then going on to say — remarkably — virtually the same thing over and over again,"" he said in a statement.

""The executives all admitted to exchanging 'courtesy emails' and 'courtesy calls' on pandemic pay, and yet insist there was no collusion. I look forward to the committee's ruling on that.""

Unifor has been critical of retailers ending temporary wage increases while the pandemic continues and has called for the pay bump to be permanent.

The statement says the matriarchs are upholding Haida law through the occupation of the villages, Jung and Sk'aawats.

Both the fishing lodge and club say they are fully complying with orders and guidelines issued by the B.C. government, health authorities and WorkSafeBC.

Brian Clive, vice-president of sales and corporate development for the lodge, said it has had several meetings with Haida leadership and developed plans so that workers do not go into town or anywhere near a Haida community. It also has medical staff on site and if a COVID-19 case were to develop, there's a plan in place to evacuate the affected person by air to Vancouver.

""We have gone to incredible lengths to avoid any contact with the communities and therefore have created what we call a zero-risk chance of contamination in the communities,"" he said.

The lodge expects about 80 guests at a time, down from the typical 125, he said. None will be travelling from the United States because the border is closed, he said.

President Brian Legge said the West Coast Fishing Club is remotely located about 83 kilometres from the nearest community and only accessible by boat or air. It also has an emergency evacuation plan in place.

""First and foremost we would never put the health and well-being of Haida Gwaii communities and residents at risk and equally as important our staff and clients,"" he says in a statement.

""That's why we have worked hard and gone to significant expense to eliminate all contact with the residents of Haida Gwaii and their communities through direct helicopter transportation from the mainland to our remote island and back.""

Without the plan, the club's employees would have been out of work and the business faced possibly unsustainable losses, Legge said.

The club is continuing to speak with the council of the Haida Nation, he added.

Duffy Edgars, chief councillor of Old Massett Village, said he supports the matriarchs and expected 20 to 30 people to occupy the villages. He said he didn't expect any interactions with lodge staff.

""We're just occupying our land and doing some fishing,"" he said.

Haida member Deana Young, who was on her way to support the matriarchs, said the community is following physical distancing protocols, while children have not returned to school and are not seeing their elders.

""One person coming from outside our region is one person too many,"" said Young.

The occupation of the land is an exercise of Haida rights to the land, she said.

""What we are doing is occupying our lands, asserting our rights to harvest the foods that we live on and to ensure food security for our communities,"" she said.

Cargill's beef plant near High River, south of Calgary, employs about 2,200 people. It shut down for two weeks in April because of an outbreak that affected 350 staff.

article continues below

It reopened after bringing in safety measures that included temperature testing, physical distancing, cleaning and sanitizing.

Eventually nearly half of the workers contracted the virus and two employees died.

The lawsuit, which needs to be approved by a judge, was filed by Guardian Law Group and seeks damages for the harm done to family members, friends and other people who were in close contact with Cargill employees who contracted the novel coronavirus.

The plaintiffs do not include the employees themselves, who are covered by labour and worker compensation laws.

The statement of claim alleges that despite warnings and guidelines issued by the Alberta government, Cargill Ltd. failed to take ""reasonable precautions"" at the beginning of the outbreak to limit its spread.

""This is a sophisticated facility and a company well-versed in proper safety procedures. That's why it's so shocking to see them fall so far below the standard of acceptable behaviour that we expect from employers in this situation,"" said Mathew Farrell of Guardian Law Group Friday.

""Businesses bear a responsibility to the community to take reasonable measures to limit the spread of this disease, and where they fail to do so, we will hold them to account for the harms that result.""

The allegations have not been proven in court.

Daniel Sullivan, a Cargill spokesman, said the company does not have a comment to make at this time regarding the class action. He gave a general statement in an email.

""At Cargill, we take seriously our responsibility to feed the world and that keeping people safe is core to our values.""

The High River plant is back at full operation and processes about 4,500 head of cattle a day — more than one-third of Canada's beef-packing capacity.

Cargill Ltd. is a subsidiary of U.S.-based Cargill Inc., one of the largest privately owned corporations in the United States by revenue.

The league and NHL Players' Association announced Friday the return-to-play protocols — featuring Toronto and Edmonton as hub cities — and a four-year extension to the current collective bargaining agreement have been ratified.

article continues below

The NHL board of governors and the union's full membership gave the documents, which were tied together in an all-or-nothing bundle, the thumbs up in separate votes.

""It was pretty civil,"" Vancouver Canucks captain Bo Horvat said of negotiations on the deal that was tentatively agreed to Monday. ""We're happy to get things going.""

Bringing the hubs to Canada, where coronavirus infection rates are largely under control, proved to be the logical choice after a significant spike in cases across the United States in recent weeks.

""While we have all worked very hard to try to address the risks of COVID-19, we know that health and safety are and will continue to be our priorities,"" NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said in a statement. ""We know that all of our fans are excited about our return to the ice.""

Training camps for the 24 teams primed to compete in the league's restart to a 2019-20 campaign that was suspended March 12 are scheduled to begin Monday — also the deadline for players to opt out of participating with no penalty — in each franchise's home market.

The plan will then see Eastern Conference clubs report to Toronto on July 26, while those from the Western Conference head to Edmonton before the games resume Aug. 1. The conference finals and Stanley Cup will be held in Edmonton as part of a first-of-its-kind NHL Final Four that could stretch all the way to Oct. 4 and result in next season being pushed into December or early January.

Once in Canada's largest city and Alberta's capital, players are set to be kept away from the general public in so-called ""bubbles"" that include strict health measures, daily testing, and mostly confine teams to hotels and empty arenas.

The extension of the current CBA, which was slated to expire in September 2022 and now runs through at least the 2025-26 season, provides both players and owners clarity on a number of challenging financial realities caused by COVID-19.

It also give the green light for negotiations with the International Olympic Committee and the International Ice Hockey Federation on participation at the 2022 and 2026 Winter Games. The NHL skipped the 2018 Olympics after taking part in five straight between 1998 and 2014.

The salary cap's upper limit will remain at US$81.5 million in 2020-21 and stay there until hockey-related revenue returns to $4.8 billion — this season's projected total prior to the pandemic. Players have agreed to defer 10 per cent of next year's salaries, and have owners pay that back over three consecutive seasons starting in 2022-23.

""This agreement is a meaningful step forward for the players and owners, and for our game, in a difficult and uncertain time,"" NHLPA executive director Don Fehr said. ""We are pleased to be able to bring NHL hockey back.""

Escrow payments, a consistent thorn in the side of players that guarantees a 50/50 split of HRR with owners, will be capped at 20 per cent in 2020-21, and decrease throughout the deal. If teams are still owed money following the 2025-26 campaign, the CBA will be extended another season.

The agreement marks the first time in Bettman's 27-year tenure as commissioner the NHL has bridged two CBAs without a work stoppage. Both the 1994-95 and 2012-13 seasons were cut to 48 games because of lockouts, while the 2004-05 campaign was cancelled.

Alberta Premier Jason Kenney was the most outspoken politician with regards to having his province host one of the hubs, pointing to a low infection rate and Edmonton's facilities.

He also penned a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in hopes of securing a waiver for the NHL when it came to Canada's mandatory 14-day quarantine for anyone arriving in the country. The federal government approved the league's proposal of a cohort quarantine last month, granting an exception that paved the way for Toronto and Edmonton to get the nod as hubs.

Speaking outside Rogers Place, Kenney said Friday's news will create jobs and millions of dollars in economic activity.

""The Stanley Cup is coming back to Edmonton, to Alberta,"" Kenney said in a video posted to Twitter as he stood next to a statue of Wayne Gretzky. ""We are going to get an unbelievable amount of free advertising across North America and around the world that will set us up well for the future relaunch of our tourism industry when travel comes back post-COVID.""

The Cup was last awarded in Edmonton when Gretzky hoisted it over his head for a fourth and final time on May 26, 1988.

Each team will be permitted to bring a maximum of 52 people into the bubbles, including a maximum of 31 players.

Meanwhile, it was also announced the NHL draft lottery's second phase has been tabbed for Aug. 10. The eight losing teams from the qualifying round will have an equal shot at the first pick in the draft, which is tentatively scheduled for Oct. 9-10.

Much like Kenney, Ontario Premier Doug Ford and Toronto Mayor John Tory supported their city's hub potential.

""There is no better place for the NHL season to continue,"" Tory said. ""We will make sure we put on a great show for the game of hockey ... while following all proper health and safety protocols.""

Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist at Toronto General Hospital, said choosing to hold the NHL's restart in Canada reduces the overall risk, but it's far from a fool-proof endeavour.

""We'd be blind to think that there isn't COVID-19 in Canada, there's just significantly less of it here compared to parts of the U.S.,"" he said. ""Everyone has to pay close attention to COVID-19 because even with the best laid plans, there still can be small weaknesses that might be exploited by this virus.""

Vancouver was the other Canadian city originally in the running to host, along with seven American markets, before the provincial government expressed concerns about the NHL's health and safety protocols.

Ford was asked prior to Friday's announcement why the plan worked for his province when it didn't for British Columbia.

""They have very stringent rules and regulations for their players,"" Ford said of the NHL. ""When they told me (players are) getting tested every single day, I'm no medical professional, but I don't think they need testing every day.""

The 24-team format — which includes every Canadian franchise, save for Ottawa — will see the top-4 clubs from both the East and West play mini-tournaments to determine playoff seeding, while the other 16 will battle in a never-before-seen qualifying round.

Boston, Tampa Bay, Washington and Philadelphia are set to compete for the No. 1 slot in the East, while defending champions St. Louis, Colorado, Vegas and Dallas will do the same out West.

The East's best-of-five qualifying series include Pittsburgh vs. Montreal, Carolina vs. New York Rangers, New York Islanders vs. Florida and Toronto vs. Columbus. In the West, the matchups are Edmonton vs. Chicago, Nashville vs. Arizona, Vancouver vs. Minnesota and Calgary vs. Winnipeg.

In all, there will be as many as 52 games played over the first nine days before the teams get a break on Aug. 10.

The four winners of the best-of-five series in each conference will then be pitted against the top-4 seeds to fill out the usual 16-team playoff bracket.

There could, however, still be choppy waters before the 2019-20 season can actually resume.

Players won't be quarantined during training camp, but instead asked to practise physical distancing when not at the rink in hopes isolation and testing will be enough to avoid any outbreaks.

Of the 396 NHLers tested at team facilities between June 8 and Monday during voluntary workouts, 23 results came back positive. The league said it's also aware of 12 other positive tests for players not taking part in those optional sessions.

The Stanley Cup has been awarded every year since 1893, except for 1919 because of the Spanish flu outbreak and in 2005 when the lockout scratched the entire season.

There's now a firm plan in place to — hopefully — see it handed out this fall.

The Burnaby Community Action Team (BCAT) on the Overdose Crisis penned a letter to council in late May with two calls to action for the city, including providing overdose response training and supplies to warming centre staff.

article continues below

“As illicit drug overdoses continue to rise, it is imperative that facilities supporting the homeless population in our city follow best practice measures,” reads the letter. “This means ensuring warming centre staff have access to overdose response supplies and basic training in relation to overdose recognition and response.”

The letter is cosigned by Michel Pouliot, executive director of Burnaby Family Life, and Dr. Lindsay McCaffrey with the Burnaby Division of Family Practices, along with several BCAT member organizations, including the Progressive Housing Society, Mosaic Burnaby Centre for Immigrants and the Burnaby Society to End Homelessness.

“In the event of an overdose, the wait time between a call to first responders and their arrival can cause permanent brain injury or death. Such experiences can be incredibly upsetting for witnesses and for staff,” reads the letter.

“Frontline workers who are not provided with the training and tools to respond often feel traumatized and powerless.”

The letter notes staff have taken sick leave in other jurisdictions as a result of that trauma, and some Burnaby warming centre staff are already taking naloxone to work.

In a report to council this week, staff said the city would need to “evaluate the operational implications of the request and would have to determine the advisability and feasibility of the request in order to evaluate whether or not this would be an effective additional measure to prevent overdoses in this context.”

Asked why the city would need to study the measure when naloxone training has been widely available for years, city spokesperson Chris Bryan said it is “standard for the city’s risk manager to review all procedures which may affect the health and safety of our patrons and staff, and which may result in liability exposure.”

The BCAT letter also called on the city to expand its resources for the homeless community in Burnaby during the pandemic, including keeping the warming centres, the last of which closed on July 1, open until an emergency shelter has been established in the city.

An emergency shelter is currently planned for the Burnaby Lake Sports Complex, and in the meantime, BC Housing has secured more hotel rooms to house local homeless individuals.

That Burnaby Lake emergency shelter, however, is only expected to be open until December, when construction of the Burnaby Lake complex replacement is set to begin.

“As the health of this population is already compromised, a COVID-19 outbreak would have a devastating impact,” reads the letter. “We know that the proposed locations for the ERC may serve as recreational sites when restrictions are lifted but the need to support vulnerable people and save lives must absolutely supersede residents’ access to such facilities.”

Staff also suggested the city work with community partners to develop short- and long-term actions to address homelessness.",[]

Finance Minister Carol James said Friday the latest numbers paint a picture of cautious optimism with a long road ahead on B.C.'s path to recovery during the COVID-19 pandemic.

article continues below

Gains in May and June bring back about 40 per cent of the total number of jobs lost since the start of the pandemic in February, when B.C.'s jobless rate was five per cent, she told a news conference.

The greatest losses have been in the service sector, but James said that's also where jobs are being added as accommodation and food services accounted for half of last month's gains.

Despite positive signs, James said thousands of people and businesses are still struggling, and net job losses stand at 235,000.

She said youth unemployment in particular stands out at 29.1 per cent, up slightly since May, while 45,000 young people did find jobs last month.

Women in B.C. are also more likely to have lost their job due to COVID-19 than men, James said.

She said the high jobless rate in June reflects increased demand for jobs and confidence that people will have the opportunity to return to work once they start looking again.

James also mentioned the loss of international visitors in the tourism sector, particularly in Metro Vancouver and Victoria, as a factor.

Businesses are restarting cautiously, she added.

""They're making sure that their employees are safe, they're making sure their customers will be safe, and people are starting to see that confidence by going back to businesses.""

James is set to provide more information next week on the post-pandemic spending B.C. has made so far, as well as updated revenue and deficit forecasts.

B.C. health officials reported 25 new cases of COVID-19 on Friday, as well as one additional death.

That brings the death toll to 187 among 3,053 people who have tested positive for the disease so far, Health Minister Adrian Dix and provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said in a joint statement.

Of 187 active cases, 16 people were in hospital, and there were ongoing outbreaks at two long-term care or assisted living facilities and one acute care facility.

While there are no active community outbreaks, Dix and Henry said exposure is still happening.

""When spending more time with friends and family, whether that is close to home or on vacation elsewhere in the province, we remind all British Columbians to avoid closed spaces, crowds and close contact with others,"" read their statement.

For the past four months, the legendary Toronto stage that's hosted the likes of the Rolling Stones and the Police has gone dark, and its famed checkerboard floors immortalized in the Tragically Hip's ""Bobcaygeon"" left empty.

article continues below

Like most smaller Canadian music venues, the future is anything but certain.

""The live-venue industry right now in Canada is on the verge of bankruptcy,"" Cohen said.

""We're not opening, probably, until the end of this year — maybe next year... We have no income coming in whatsoever. It's a bad scene.""

Along with several other indie concert venue owners, Cohen has been making noise about the troubling years ahead for Canada's live music scene in hopes the federal government will take more action.

There was a glimmer of hope on Tuesday when Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault outlined a program that lets owners of for-profit venues apply for a piece of $20 million promised to support the live music sector.

The money will be divided among numerous corners of the industry, including venues, concert promoters, booking agents, managers and music festivals. The funding is part of the second phase of support in the $500-million emergency support measures introduced in May for Canada's arts and culture organizations.

Anyone who's granted approval will receive a minimum contribution of $5,000 that's supposed to last until the end of September.

Beyond the live music business, the federal government has earmarked $5 million for the recording industry that will be administered by Factor and Musicaction, which specialize in developing and supporting Canadian music talent.

Erin Benjamin, chief executive of the Canadian Live Music Association, which advocates for the industry, called the move by Canadian Heritage to support venues ""a good start"" that needs to be built upon in short order.

""It's better than nothing,"" she said.

""It'll help some companies for a very short amount of time...but we're not done here. We can't be done.""

While Cohen doesn't know if he'll qualify for a portion of the venue funding, he's skeptical about how much it'll actually help the Horseshoe.

""I'll be able to pay two weeks of rent,"" Cohen said, pointing out it's roughly $40,000 a month for the downtown location.

""It'll be something, and we'll be grateful for it... but I'm skeptical until I actually see the payments.""

He suspects the Horseshoe may also fail to meet some of the requirements outlined on the Factor website. Among them, a venue must have booked at least 50 per cent Canadian musicians at its venue last year to qualify.

""Horseshoe Tavern was open 360 days last year, I don't think we wrote down which bands were Canadian and weren't. I don't think we even know,"" Cohen said.

""The eligibility makes no sense.""

Smaller venues have been able to tap into other financial support measures, which include the Canada Emergency Response Benefit and the emergency wage subsidy.

In Toronto, city council recently passed legislation that allows property owners to claim a tax break of 50 per cent tax on spaces that operate primarily as live music venues. The intention is for those savings to trickle down to the tenants who are still not allowed to reopen.

Live venues in other Canadian cities are at different stages in a process many anticipate could stretch well into next year.

Vancouver bars were some of the first to reopen, though several clubs in the city warned that patrons may have been exposed to COVID-19 in recent weeks.

Montreal's music venues were allowed to legally reopen in late June, but concertgoers have to remain seated and dancing is forbidden.

In Halifax, Karen Spaulding reopened the Carleton Music Bar and Grill in the final days of June, but it hardly feels the same to her.

""It is at half capacity for three days a week, instead of normally five to seven, and it's acoustic shows only,"" she said.

""Just the world, the audience and the guests, all feel different.""

The Carleton operates as a restaurant, which helped Spaulding's attempt to get the business back on its feet, though she said overall revenues have dropped somewhere between 50 to 75 per cent.

But as much as she's concerned for her business, she's also worried about local Canadian musicians who relied on these venues to make a living. That's motivated her to look for solutions as she faces a long winter that brings a whole new round of questions.

Spaulding said she's been in conversations with lenders, while also tapping into other government programs that help support her staff. She's also looking into whether it would be worthwhile to launch streaming online concerts that would ""put more money in the artists' pockets"" over the coming months.

""I'm going to personally go out on a limb to keep the venue going,"" she said.

""We're huge believers in live music.""

Rep. Adam Schiff couldn't resist: ""We may all be moving to Canada soon,"" he deadpanned.

article continues below

But as a resurgent COVID-19 ravages the U.S., fuelled by cavalier openings in states like Florida and Texas and a White House determined to resurrect the economy at all costs, the red-alert status spreading across the continent's lower half has more Canadians than ever ignoring America's increasingly persistent knock.

An online poll by Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies released this week found a whopping 86 per cent of respondents in Canada opposed to letting U.S. tourists north of the border, compared with 11 per cent who supported it. An Abacus Data poll out Friday found much the same thing.

And when Rep. Brian Higgins, a New York Democrat, updated his bipartisan call for a plan to reopen the border, the ensuing Twitter barrage of sarcasm, satire and outright anger belied Canada's reputation as a bastion of civility, replete with memes of building walls, slamming doors and Bugs Bunny taking a handsaw to the 49th parallel.

Higgins took it all in stride.

""I don't blame them for wanting us out of there,"" the congressman said Friday of the Canadian reaction.

""I have an obligation to be honest, and I have an obligation to always keep trying. And if anything, what I hope will come from all of this is an appreciation for the tale of two neighbouring countries' response to COVID-19: America's has been deplorable, and the Canadian response has been fast, strong and united.""

When the outbreak first took hold in North America in March, Canada and the U.S. agreed to close their shared border to discretionary travel while allowing the movement of goods and essential workers to continue. That initial 30-day agreement has been extended three times now, and will surely be extended again before its next July 21 expiry date.

Since March, the U.S. has seen more than 3 million cases and 133,000 deaths, and the crisis is accelerating in states across the union. Florida is breaking records daily for new COVID-19 cases and deaths. In Arizona and Texas, one in four tests is coming back positive. Further north, states like Wisconsin and Michigan are seeing fresh spikes in their active caseloads. Hospitals are again rapidly nearing capacity.

In their letter last week to acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf and Canada's Public Safety Minister Bill Blair, Higgins and 27 other members of Congress, Democrat and Republican alike, urged the two countries to stop kicking the can down the road and draft a detailed plan for the gradual reopening of the border.

""The continual 30-day extensions without a plan for how restrictions will be modified prolongs uncertainty for both communities and creates unnecessary tension as we approach each new expiration,"" they wrote.

""We are asking that the United States and Canada immediately craft a comprehensive framework for phased reopening of the border based on objective metrics and accounting for the varied circumstances across border regions.""

That doesn't mean throwing open the border to Americans, Higgins said. But it could mean redefining essential travel to include foreign property owners and people with business interests or family members on the other side, provided they wear masks and practice physical distancing.

""Never in our lifetime have we had a situation where the health of you and your family is dependent on your fellow citizens to do the right thing,"" he said.

""A phased opening could expand the category of 'essential traveller,' but (include) certifying some way that you are adhering to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's protocol as it relates to stopping the spread of COVID-19.""

Ontario Premier Doug Ford, a pro-trade conservative and longtime champion of Canada-U.S. ties, has been among those urging zero tolerance at the border until the crisis in the U.S. has passed — a position spokeswoman Ivana Yelich reiterated Friday.

""The premier has been clear: the border must remain closed to non-essential travel until the U.S. has made significant progress in containing COVID-19,"" Yelich said. ""The recent spike in the number of COVID cases in the U.S. is very concerning. As such, the premier will continue to support restrictions at the U.S. border beyond the July 21 deadline.""

The worsening public health situation in the U.S. has not diminished the importance of cross-border business travel, including face-to-face meetings or technical on-site visits, to the health of Canada's economy, said Mark Agnew, director of international policy with the Canadian Chamber of Commerce.

Despite the best efforts of both countries, the current border measures have been confusing for some, causing stress and delays even for those who have work permits that allow them to cross, Agnew said.

""It would be helpful for the government to set out the circumstances under which border measures will start to normalize, to enable companies to plan.""

Despite the political challenges the U.S. outbreak now poses for the federal Liberal government in Canada, it's past time to start thinking about how to ease the border restrictions, said Laurie Trautman, director of the Border Policy Research Institute at Western Washington University in Bellingham, Wash.

""There is an immediate need to be more thoughtful and strategic about how our countries go about doing that,"" Trautman said, floating the idea of wider family exemptions and allowing homeowners to visit their foreign properties.

In northern Washington state, law enforcement is growing concerned about the challenge of protecting vacant homes owned by Canadians, she added.

""Grandparents should be able to see their grandkids,"" Trautman said. ""Exempting these two groups from the restrictions would not ‘open up the floodgates’ and seem reasonable and empathetic to me.""

Statistics Canada's labour force survey released Friday showed 953,000 jobs were added last month, including 488,000 full-time and 465,000 part-time positions. The unemployment rate fell to 12.3 per cent after hitting a record-high of 13.7 per cent in May.

As in May, even though more people found jobs, more people were also looking for work as the labour force grew by about 786,000 after a gain of 491,000 in May, bringing it to within 443,000 of its pre-pandemic level.

Statistics Canada said the unemployment rate would have been 16.3 per cent had it included in unemployment counts those who wanted to work, but did not look for a job.

Job gains were made in every province, including by 378,000 in Ontario, marking the first increase since the COVID-19 shutdown, Statistics Canada said. It didn't include any gains in Toronto as restrictions in that city loosened after the survey week.

Despite the good news, economist Jim Stanford said there remains a historic crisis in the job market with high unemployment and hundreds of thousands who have left the labour force altogether.

Also, gains nationally were not shared equally among groups, with women, youth and low-wage workers still slower to rebound, which Stanford said could be problematic if those jobs don't ever come back.

""I worry about a coming second round of layoffs motivated not by health restrictions, but by companies deciding their businesses are going to be permanently smaller. So that would be qualitatively different and in a way worse,"" said Stanford, director of the Centre for Future Work in Vancouver.

""We aren't remotely out of the woods yet, but this was a really encouraging step forward.""

Some three million jobs were lost over March and April due to the pandemic, and 2.5 million more had their hours and earnings slashed. By last month, some 3.1 million were affected by the pandemic, including 1.4 million who weren't at work due to COVID-19.

Brendon Bernard, an economist at Indeed Canada, said recapturing jobs at the same pace in the coming months will be tougher.

""A lot of areas of the economy still aren't running at full capacity,"" Bernard said. ""So while doors may be open and customers might be coming in, business hasn't come back to normal.""

Despite the overall improvement, the oil and gas industry continues to struggle.

The PetroLMI Division of Energy Safety Canada says direct oil and gas employment fell by more than 6,700 positions in June compared with May, with about 70 per cent of the net job losses in Alberta.

Compared with a year earlier, employment in the oil and employment sector was down 17 per cent.

The overall job losses were unprecedented in speed and depth compared with previous recessions, Statistics Canada said, and the rebound to date sharper than previous downturns.

Ottawa's response has been equally unprecedented: a deficit of at least $343.2 billion this fiscal year as the Trudeau Liberals dole out some $230 billion in emergency aid.

In June, 28.3 per cent of Canadians aged 15 to 69 reported receiving some form of federal aid since mid-March, Statistics Canada said. Meanwhile, the proportion of households reporting difficulty paying the bills dropped to 20.1 per cent in June from 22.5 per cent in May.

""Without the federal government being there to support Canadian workers, Canadian businesses and the Canadian provinces and territories, we would be in a bigger mess in this country right now,"" Hassan Yussuff, president of the Canadian Labour Congress said in an interview this week.

The Bank of Canada and federal government believe the worst of the economic pain from the pandemic is behind the country, but Canada will face high unemployment and low growth until 2021.

In a statement, federal Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough touted the overall jobs numbers as a sign the government's plan was working, before adding many Canadians still ""face real challenges during this time.""

She and other ministers are now reshaping programs so fewer workers stay on the $80-billion emergency benefit, and more get tied to jobs through the $82-billion wage subsidy program.

""We understand the need for those emergency programs. We also understand as we reopen and recover, we have to move away from emergency programs and into stimulus and recovery,"" said Leah Nord, senior director of workforce strategies for the Canadian Chamber of Commerce.

She said there are other issues to resolve around health and safety in the workplace, transit, and child care to help more Canadians get back to work.

In provinces where daycares reopened for children five and under, employment levels returned to pre-pandemic levels for fathers in June, but not for mothers. Similarly, mothers with children under 18 were more likely than fathers to work less than half their usual hours in June, Statistics Canada said.

Job gains have come at a faster clip for men. Their unemployment rate hit 12.1 per cent in June compared to 12.7 per cent for women. And the underutilization rate — which counts those who are unemployed, those who want a job but didn't look for one, and those working less than half their usual hours — was 28.3 for women and 25.5 per cent for men.

Economist Armine Yalnizyan said the numbers underscore the need to provide child care as well as options for schooling in the fall so mothers can work.

The alternative, she said, could pull back any economic gains.

""It means that even if there are jobs, some women won't be able to take them because there's no way they can leave their kids,"" said Yalnizyan, a fellow on the future of workers at the Atkinson Foundation.

""So we are looking at the potential for an economic depression instead of talking about paces of recovery and pivoting to building to better.""

Three Cabinet ministers in the administration of Bolivian leader Jeanine Áñez have also tested positive for the virus, including Health Minister Eidy Roca and Presidency Minister Yerko Nuñez, who is hospitalized.

article continues below

The infections in Venezuela, Brazil and Bolivia, which is seeing a spike in cases, come after Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández tested positive in June and was briefly hospitalized.

Áñez said she will remain in isolation for 14 days when another test will be done, but she will continue to work remotely from the presidential residence.

""I feel good, I feel strong,"" she wrote on her Twitter account.

Bolivia’s Health Ministry says the Andean country has 42,984 confirmed coronavirus cases and 1,577 deaths, and is seeing a rebound in the number of new cases amid reports that hospitals are being overwhelmed in some regions. In the highland city of Cochabamba, scenes have emerged of bodies lying in the streets and coffins waiting for days in homes to be taken away.

Bolivia is scheduled to hold a presidential election Sept. 6. Áñez is running third in opinion polls. Former Economy Minister Luis Arce, who represents the party of ousted President Evo Morales, is in front, with ex-President Carlos Mesa in second.

In Venezuela, meanwhile, socialist party chief Diosdado Cabello revealed that he had tested positive for COVID-19, making him the highest-ranking leader in the distressed South American nation thus far to come down with the virus.

Cabello is considered the second-most powerful person in Venezuela after President Nicolás Maduro and made the announcement on Twitter, stating that he is isolated, getting treatment and will overcome the illness.

""We will win!"" he wrote in conclusion.

Economically struggling Venezuela is considered one of the world’s least prepared countries to confront the pandemic. Hospitals are routinely short on basic supplies like water, electricity and medicine.

The nation has registered considerably fewer COVID-19 cases than others in the region, but the number of infections has grown in recent weeks. As of Wednesday, the government had reported 8,010 confirmed cases and 75 deaths.

Cabello was last seen Tuesday, when he met with South Africa’s ambassador, Joseph Nkosi. Photographs released by the government showed him standing alongside and bumping fists with the diplomat while wearing a black mask.

The 57-year-old politician is head of the National Constituent Assembly, an all-powerful legislative body created by Maduro’s government in 2017. He had missed his weekly television program Wednesday, stating at the time that he was ""fighting against a strong allergy"" and resting.

Maduro said in a broadcast Thursday that Cabello’s diagnosis was confirmed with a molecular exam — a test that is usually conducted with a nasal swab sample. Venezuela has done far fewer of these tests than neighbouring countries, instead largely deploying rapid blood antibody tests. Some experts fear that relying so heavily on the rapid tests, which don’t detect signs of illness early in an infection, means cases are being missed.

""Venezuela is with Diosdado,"" Maduro said. ""I am sure soon enough we will continue on in this fight.""

In Brazil, President Jair Bolsonaro was diagnosed with COVID-19 on Tuesday.

He appeared Thursday on an online broadcast from the presidential residence as defiant as on previous occasions. He coughed once, but did not show other symptoms of the disease that has killed more than 69,000 people in the South American nation.

Bolsonaro repeated his view that the economic crisis brought on by the pandemic is more dangerous than the coronavirus itself. He insisted that mayors and governors need to reopen the country for business.

""We need governors and mayors, within their responsibilities, to reopen commerce. Otherwise the consequences will be harmful for Brazil,"" Bolsonaro said, wearing a gray shirt and sitting comfortably in front of two national flags.",[]

The Montreal-based company announced Thursday that it is sending notices to terminate the leases at the 124 stores to take effect in 30 days. The move would affect about half of its workforce of nearly 2,500, including all 366 employees in the United States.

It will also seek more favourable lease terms for the remaining 100 stores in Canada and may permanently shut additional locations if landlords are unwilling to negotiate suitable leases.

It had warned in mid-June that it could begin a formal restructuring depending on the outcome of its talks with landlords.

The company said at the time that it hadn't paid rent on any of its stores for April, May and June.

The store closures are part of its restructuring plan after it obtained court protection from creditors under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act and Chapter 15 in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.

""With the upcoming closure of 124 unprofitable stores across North America, we are certainly making good progress in creating a stronger business model for the future and ensuring the long-term success and sustainability of DavidsTea and our beloved brand,"" company founder and interim CEO Herschel Segal said in a news release.

Chief financial officer Frank Zitella said that with the closure of ""a significant number of money-losing stores"" it will focus exclusively on e-commerce sale which had a penetration rate of close to 43 per cent in the market before COVID-19.

""All 100 remaining DavidsTea stores have been closed since March 17 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and will remain so until further notice,"" he stated.

DavidsTea last month reported that it lost $23.2 million last year on $146.5 million in revenues. That includes a US$4.3 million loss in its fiscal fourth quarter on US$54.8 million of revenues.

The move by DavidsTea comes three years after Starbucks announced the closure of all of its Teavana brand stores. The coffee giant acquired Teavana Holdings in 2012 for US$620 million.

The cancellation of the 2020 national football championship game because of COVID-19, and U Sports not altering an age eligibility rule, accelerates the swan song of roughly 300 football players.

article continues below

U Sports has said student-athletes whose championships are cancelled in 2020-21 because of the pandemic will not lose a year of eligibility.

But football players have seven years after graduating from high school to complete their five-year eligibility. Many play junior football before entering the university ranks.

The only U Sports sport with an age limit is football.

University of Calgary quarterback Josiah Joseph of the defending Vanier Cup champion Dinos is among those caught in a rule designed to limit the age of players in Canadian university football to under 25.

Players who turn 25 before Sept. 1 age out of university football. Joseph turns 25 on July 10, 2021.

Approximately 300 players out of 2,335 will be similarly impacted in 2021, according to U Sports.

Joseph hoped U Sports would make an exception for players like him.

""All they would have to do is amend the rule and push it to maybe January first due to extreme circumstances,"" he told The Canadian Press.

""It's devastating there's that many players in my position.""

U Sports adopted a football age cap to prevent large gaps in physical maturation and experience between players in a collision sport, and also to create room on rosters for younger players, according to U Sports interim CEO Dick White.

""I really understand the disappointment of the players that this affects,"" said White, who took over for departed CEO Graham Brown last month.

""Our legal advice that we received was very firm. If we believe the age cap should be 25 for the health and safety of athletes then we should not under any circumstances alter that.

""The reasons for having that age cap have not changed even though we've had the tragedy of COVID.""

Joseph argues there is no physical or experience difference between a player who turns 25 in March and one who turns 25 in October.

""There's already 25 year olds playing in the league so what's the difference of a couple months?"" he asked. ""There is none.""

U Sport cancelling the 2020 Vanier Cup and the two bowl games — Mitchell and Uteck — that serve as semifinals doesn't stop conferences from playing football in the fall.

But Canada West, Ontario University Athletics and Atlantic University Sport have already declared there won't be football in 2020 because of the pandemic.

The Reseau du sport etudiant du Quebec is still working on running football this fall.

University of Bisons head coach Brian Dobie points out fifth-year players aren't the only ones impacted.

Any current university football player whose birthday falls before Sept. 1 will lose a year of football eligibility because of the combination of the pandemic and the current rule.

""What about that kid who had two years left and he just got a starting spot? Now Johnny has one year left. What about Billy who had three years left and now has two years left?"" Dobie asked.

""If you have one kid in your program that is negatively affected by this, as a coach you should be outraged. Every kid should count just the same and you should be outraged.""

Losing a year of football eligibility also means losing a year of athletic scholarship to pay for school, Dobie added.

""The reality is the age cap is 25 and it's not 26 and somewhere you draw the line,"" White said.

""If the football institutions wish to re-address the age cap to 26 or no age cap, that's up to our member institutions. There's a process to do that.

""The big picture here was there was a very good reason we put the age cap in. Our board of directors, supported by the legal opinion, said 'don't move it.'""

Joseph doesn't buy that rationale.

""It doesn't seem like it's reflecting the interests of a lot of coaches and players that make up U Sports football that make it successful, the guys that are going to be there for five years who are going to graduate that are going to be proud alumni,"" he said.

""That's what makes up university football in Canada.""

In addition to the impact on each individual’s care, test data is critical to strategic planning and public policy.

As well as informing us, however, testing issues have also created a great deal of confusion and frustration. The terminology and specifics are new to most, and the criteria for and access to testing has fluctuated a great deal in a short period of time. After four months, here’s where we stand:

article continues below

Summary points

* Testing is now available to anyone with symptoms of COVID-19, however mild;

* Those needing COVID-19 assessment are encouraged to call their family doctor or nurse practitioner's office, call 811, or attend the hospital emergency department (ER);

* Powell River and qathet Region District have had very few confirmed cases of COVID-19 to date, but remain at risk for future outbreaks. Ongoing attention to public health measures is still critically important.

Criteria for testing

Most COVID-19 patients have cold or flu-like symptoms, though onset may be gradual over days. Those with severe symptoms should attend the ER without delay. Common symptoms include fever, fatigue, cough, shortness of breath, muscle aches, sore throat, lack of appetite, and loss of taste or smell. Headaches, confusion, runny nose, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and rashes are less typical, but may occur.

People without any symptoms (asymptomatic) are not generally tested in BC, except in special circumstances such as a public health investigation of an outbreak. In addition to using limited resources, testing asymptomatic individuals can lead to high rates of false positives (test is positive, but the person doesn’t actually have the virus). An online symptom checker is available at https://bc.thrive.health/covid19/en, or through 811.

Where to get tested

People are encouraged to call their nurse practitioner or family doctor if they feel they may have COVID-19. In addition to reviewing criteria for testing, a primary care provider knows their patient's medical history and can direct them accordingly. Some clinics offer testing on site, including drive-through testing, while others will refer to another office or to the hospital.

Assessment and testing for COVID-19 at Powell River General Hospital is located in the ambulance bay of the ER. There is a separated space for one patient at a time, and it is cleaned after each use. Efforts are being made to reduce wait times, but these do vary.

Those coming to the ER for respiratory symptoms or COVID-19 assessment are encouraged to call ahead (604.485.3211), and will be directed outside to the ambulance entrance where there is a buzzer to advise staff on arrival. Testing is available 24/7, if needed.

People being assessed and tested for COVID-19 will only be brought into the main ER department if they need further investigations or treatment. Dedicated areas are used for this purpose.

Procedure for outpatient testing

Testing for COVID-19 involves essentially a small cotton swab on a plastic stick that is inserted into one’s nose, turned a few times, then removed and placed in a tube. Nasal swabs may make one’s eyes water, but are generally described as uncomfortable rather than painful.

Locally, all COVID-19 swabs are packaged at the hospital and flown to Vancouver once or twice daily for processing. Results are typically by 8 am the day after they are received in Vancouver.

Powell River Hospital has secured a small supply of rapid tests that can identify a COVID-19 result within an hour. Owing to the very limited supply, these are generally reserved for critical situations.

Most people with COVID-19 (over 80 per cent) will be well enough to stay at home during their illness.

After being tested, patients are given instructions and an information sheet on how to self-isolate until test results are available. Staying home when sick is considered by many experts as the single most effective strategy to limit COVID-19 in a community.

Results

To confirm a negative test people may wish to speak with their primary care provider, use myehealth.ca, or call the BCCDC negative results line between 8:30 am and 4:30 pm, seven days per week, at 1.833.707.2792.

Those with positive test results will be notified rapidly by Public Health. In BC thus far, over 98 per cent of positive cases were reached in under 24 hours. The family doctor or nurse practitioner will also receive the result.

If someone tests positive for COVID-19, a public health staff member will call them daily until they are cleared (usually 10 days if minimal symptoms). They will offer direction on self-isolation and help advise how to manage symptoms, including when to seek further care.

The public health team will also take a detailed history to identify who has had close contact with a positive case, including up to 48 hours before that person's symptoms first developed.

Those people identified by public health as having a significant risk of exposure (e.g. sustained close contact, household members, no physical distancing or protective equipment) will be notified as soon as possible, and will be advised to self-isolate (and to test if they develop symptoms). Contact tracing is not generally done for very brief, distanced, or other low risk encounters.

Future plans

Blood testing for immunity (i.e. past infection) is not yet available for routine use. It is still unclear how accurate these tests are, and how long immunity from natural infection can be detected.

As we move into the fall, we expect an increase in respiratory viruses of all types. Detailed plans for additional testing sites have been developed and will be implemented based on capacity and need.

Powell River data

Local medical officer of health Dr. Geoff McKee reported last week that the lower Sunshine Coast has had a total of six cases thus far in the pandemic, and that Powell River region has had fewer than five cases to date (because of the low number and the potential privacy risk for so few cases, the exact number was not given).

Dr. McKee also noted that there were no active cases being followed on the Sunshine Coast. Unfortunately, there could be cases that simply aren’t identified yet, or new cases that may arise at any time. For this reason, regardless of the exact number of confirmed cases, we all need to follow public health recommendations if we hope to protect our community from this virus.

A recent survey completed by the Powell River Division of Family Practice identified that roughly three per cent of people surveyed in our region have been tested for COVID-19. Several barriers to testing were identified by community members, which we are working to address.

Conclusion

While our region has had relatively little COVID-19 activity thus far, global cases continue to rise rapidly. Until there is widespread immunity or a universally effective treatment, we are all vulnerable.

Local physicians will continue to prepare and behave as if there are active cases in the community. Staying home when sick, washing hands, physical distancing with most people, and wearing masks or protective equipment when needed, continue to be the cornerstones of defence for all of us.

In addition public health measures, testing (and contact tracing) is an extremely powerful tool to limit the spread of COVID-19. Anyone who thinks they may have symptoms should call their family doctor or nurse practitioner, call 811, or attend our local emergency department.

Be smart, be safe, and be kind. We are in this together.

Seniors, in particular, are a focus of the report from the Senate's social affairs committee, from those in long-term care homes to those with low incomes.

article continues below

Just this week, the Liberals rolled out one-time special payments of $300 to the more than six million people who receive old-age security, and $200 more for the 2.2 million who also receive the guaranteed income supplement.

The income supports are meant to help seniors facing increased costs as a result of the pandemic, such as more frequent prescription fees and delivery charges for groceries.

Senators on the committee wrote of evidence of ""financial insecurity and increased vulnerability"" for low-income seniors as a result of the first wave of the novel coronavirus.

A potential second wave, which could coincide with the annual flu season that starts in the fall, would make the situation even worse for these seniors ""without concrete and timely government action,"" the report says.

Senators say the Liberals should deliver a plan to help low-income seniors, among other populations vulnerable to economic shocks like new immigrants, no later than the end of August, and contain short- and long-term options.

The report also says the federal government needs to pay urgent attention to seniors in long-term care homes where outbreaks and deaths in the pandemic have been concentrated.

The document made public Thursday morning is the committee's first set of observations on the government's response to the pandemic, with a final report expected later this year.

Before then, the Liberals are planning to provide another economic update like the one delivered Wednesday, or possibly a full budget. The government shelved plans to deliver one at the end of March when the House of Commons went on extended hiatus due to the pandemic.

The long-awaited economic ""snapshot,"" as the Liberals styled it, said federal spending is closing in on $600 billion this fiscal year. That means a deficit of $343 billion, fuelled by emergency pandemic aid that the government budgets at over $230 billion.

The Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada said the spending figures demand a ""full and transparent assessment"" to see what worked, what didn't and what needs to change for an economic recovery.

Hassan Yussuff, president of the Canadian Labour Congress, said the Liberals should take back up their promise to create a national pharmacare system as the government considers its next steps.

A federal advisory council last year calculated the cost of a program at over $15 billion annually, depending on its design.

""The last thing we want to have is Canadians in frail health as we're dealing with this pandemic and I think the government really needs to think of that,"" Yussuff said in an interview Wednesday.

""Had it not been for the health care system we have right now,"" he added later, ""think of how this country would have fared in this pandemic.""

The Senate committee's report also notes the national emergency stockpile of personal protective gear like masks, gowns and gloves wasn't managed well over the years, nor sufficiently stocked when the pandemic struck.

Committee members added concerns that military members could be deployed without sufficient personal protective equipment because of ""inconsistencies from international procurement.""

The stock market crash in March and the plunge in interest rates left many investors feeling uncertain and vulnerable, while still more have been left without work.

Tina Cheung, a wealth adviser at Vancity, says it is always important to review your financial plan on a regular basis, but a review can be especially important during times like these.

""During these times of uncertainty it is important to have peace of mind, and to have that peace of mind, to achieve it, is to get a financial check up,"" she said.

Investors who were shocked at the state of their investment portfolios at the end of the first quarter might breathe a sigh of relief when checking their statements for the second quarter as stock markets have rallied off their lows seen near the end of March.

However, Canada's main stock index is still down from where it was a year ago and well off the highs it hit in February before the pandemic struck the markets.

""The effects of the pandemic on the market will eventually pass, like the global financial crisis did, but if these few months created any stress or loss of sleep, we need to go back and talk about your risk appetite,"" Cheung says.

But she says if your risk appetite has not changed and your goal hasn't changed, then it is critical to think long term and stick to your plan.

Before heading into a meeting with your adviser, it is important to have a firm grip of your budget and what your goals are for the meeting.

Cheung says you need to be prepared to have an open discussion and be ready with information like your monthly income and expenses.

For some, reviewing their financial plan may mean difficult decisions, facing depleted emergency funds due to the loss of a job and little prospect for a return to work at a level seen before the pandemic.

A poll done for TD Bank found that 38 per cent of those surveyed identified as financially vulnerable in April 2020 compared with 15 per cent in November last year. The poll also found that 13 per cent of those asked in April felt confident in their financial future compared with 20 per cent in November 2019.

If you have taken advantage of the payment deferrals offered by many lenders, you need to have a clear plan for when those deferral periods come to an end and you need to resume making payments.

Gio Bazile, a district vice-president at TD Bank, says some borrowers may start to struggle once the deferrals come to an end if their income hasn't picked back up again.

""Part of what is going to be really critical is understanding what your future cash flow is going to look like and how do you work with your financial adviser with an impending financial hardship, how do you best balance your wants and needs,"" he said.

Bazile says everyone is going to face their own situation, but it's key to have a candid conversation with your partner or family to understand where you are financially.

""If your cash flow is low or if you are kind of over-leveraged from a debt perspective, then that's probably a time to actually spend some time with your financial adviser,"" he said.

""If you're looking at your savings account and realizing, wait a minute, I may not be able to get through this next two, three months and beyond, that's probably another really big trigger.""

That is, if they can survive long enough to see daylight again.

Those were two of the conclusions in the most recent Restaurants Canada survey of its member businesses.

article continues below

The survey, which heard from nearly 1,000 restaurant owners representing more than 11,500 restaurants, found 56 per cent of restaurant owners believed it would require a year or more to recover from the pandemic, and that at least 50 per cent of them are currently operating at a loss. “Restaurateurs are eager to help rebuild the economy and revive neighbourhoods, but they’re going to need continued assistance from government to remain operational under ongoing restrictions,” said the organization’s vice-president, David Lefebvre.

The results of the survey come as no surprise to Ian Tostenson, president of the B.C. Restaurant and Foodservices Association.

While Tostenson said the provincial situation is a bit of a “mixed bag” of results as B.C. continues to open up its economy, he made it clear there is trouble in the industry.

“Of the nearly 15,000 restaurants in B.C. maybe 60 per cent are actually up and running,” he said, noting many have decided to remain closed temporarily as there’s no business for them and others have closed for good. “Some may never come back. We expect to lose between 20 and 30 per cent of the industry … it’s just too much to expect some of these small businesses to hold on.”

That is especially true in the major markets.

“Downtown Victoria and downtown Vancouver are just disasters,” he said. Downtown restaurants rely heavily on tourism and office workers to stay afloat. “Volumes in those two big markets are tracking 20-30 per cent of where they were at this point last year.”

On the upside, Tostenson said suburban operators and restaurants in small cities and towns around B.C. have reported doing alright.

Overall, he said, they are still dealing with the fact people aren’t yet feeling safe about going out to eat despite the myriad safety precautions the industry has taken.

The survey results have spurred Restaurants Canada to call for the federal government to extend and strengthen support for food-service businesses by maintaining the federal wage subsidy, extending and expanding rent-relief programs and expanding loans for small business.

The first time, he showed up an hour before the public testing site was set to close and was told they had reached capacity. He was turned away from a second centre when rain shut it down, and voluntarily left a third after someone ahead of him said they had been waiting in line for more than three hours.

article continues below

""If you have symptoms and you are just driving around the city trying to figure out how you can get a test, for people who are positive, it is not ideal,"" said Lee, who finally got a test on June 29 after he showed up at a site before dawn and waited for more than two hours. Another five days passed before he was able to view the results online, and he didn't receive a text with the results until seven days after being tested.

Four months, 3 million confirmed infections and over 130,000 deaths into the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S., Americans confronted with a resurgence of the scourge are facing long lines at testing sites in the summer heat or are getting turned away. Others are going a week or more without receiving a diagnosis.

Some sites are running out of kits, while labs are reporting shortages of materials and workers to process the swabs.

Some frustrated Americans are left to wonder why the U.S. can't seem to get its act together, especially after it was given fair warning as the virus wreaked havoc in China and then Italy, Spain and New York.

""It’s a hot mess,"" said 47-year-old Jennifer Hudson of Tucson, Arizona. ""The fact that we’re relying on companies and we don’t have a national response to this, it’s ridiculous. … It’s keeping people who need tests from getting tests.""

It took Hudson five days to make an appointment through a CVS pharmacy near her home. She booked a drive-up test over the weekend, more than a week after her symptoms — fatigue, shortness of breath, headache and sore throat — first emerged. The clinic informed her that her results would probably be delayed.

Testing has been ramped up nationwide, reaching about 640,000 tests per day on average, up from around 518,000 two weeks ago, according to an Associated Press analysis. Newly confirmed infections per day in the U.S. are running at over 50,000, breaking records at practically every turn.

More testing tends to lead to more cases found. But in an alarming indicator, the percentage of tests coming back positive for the virus is on the rise across nearly the entire country, hitting almost 27% in Arizona, 19% in Florida and 17% in South Carolina.

While the U.S. has conducted more tests than any other nation, it ranks in the middle of the pack in testing per capita, behind Russia, Spain and Australia, according to Johns Hopkins University.

""I am stunned that as a nation, six months into this pandemic, we still can’t figure out how to deliver testing to the American people when they need it,"" said Dr. Ashish Jha, director of Harvard’s Global Health Institute. ""It is an abject failure of leadership and shows that the federal government has not prioritized testing in a way that will allow us to get through this pandemic.""

Testing alone without adequate contact tracing and quarantine measures won't control the spread of the scourge, according to health experts. But they say delays in testing can lead to more infections by leaving people in the dark as to whether they need to isolate themselves.

In other developments:

— While the number of confirmed cases in the U.S. hit 3 million Wednesday by Johns Hopkins' count, health officials have said that because of inadequate testing and the many mild infections that have gone unreported, the real number is about 10 times higher, or almost 10% of the U.S. population.

— A crowd of thousands attending President Donald Trump’s campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in late June, along with large groups of people who showed up to protest, ""likely contributed"" to a dramatic surge in new coronavirus cases in the area, Tulsa City-County Health Department Director Dr. Bruce Dart said Wednesday. Tulsa County reported 261 confirmed cases on Monday, a new record one-day high, and another 206 confirmed cases on Tuesday. A spokesman for the Trump campaign didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

— Most New York City students will return to school in the fall two or three days a week and learn online the rest of the time under a plan announced by Mayor Bill de Blasio. He said schools can’t accommodate all their students at any one time and maintain social distancing. The school system in New York is the biggest in the nation, with 1.1 million students. It has been closed since March.

In New York City, the most lethal hot spot in the nation during the spring, testing was scarce early on but is now widely available. As many as 35,000 tests are conducted daily through a combination of private health organizations and city agencies, according to the city Health Department.

""Widespread testing holds the key to reopening our city safely,"" de Blasio said.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services this week said it will open free ""surge testing"" sites in three hard-hit cities: Jacksonville, Florida; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; and Edinburg, Texas. The sites will be able to conduct as many as 5,000 tests a day in each city, with results in three to five days, officials said.

In Georgia, one of the states where cases are surging, officials are rushing to expand testing capacity as demand threatens to overwhelm six major sites around Atlanta, said DeKalb County CEO Michael Thurmond.

""If you project this out over the next three weeks, we can’t handle it,"" he said.

In New Orleans, people were turned away from a free testing site for a third consecutive day after it reached its daily allotment of tests. Health care providers are running low on trays and chemicals needed to run machines used in the tests.

Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego called the situation there ""desperate"" as residents have sat in sun-baked cars for up to 13 hours to get drive-thru testing. Robert Fenton, head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said FEMA is doubling the testing supplies it plans to ship to Arizona.

Patrick Friday, a United Methodist minister in Alabama, went to several hospitals and clinics in Birmingham this week to get checked after his school-age son tested positive. But he was told that unless he had a preexisting condition, he didn’t qualify.

Finally, he ended up at a site offering rapid-result tests and his negative result came back quickly.

""We are several months into this,"" he said. ""How can it be that we can’t go in and get a test?""

""Unfortunately, as we don't anticipate ridership to be back to pre-COVID-19 levels in the foreseeable future, we had to make difficult decisions to deal with the situation as we gain a better understanding of the impacts of the pandemic on our operations,"" Cynthia Garneau, Via's president and CEO, said in a statement Wednesday.

The layoffs take effect on July 24. Affected employees will receive a temporary written layoff notice that respects their collective agreement's terms, the Montreal-based company said. It will maintain access to different programs for the employees.

The company is working to advance its service resumption plan and has seen some recent positive developments, though many routes remain interrupted.

Winnipeg to Churchill is the sole route in service, according to Via Rail's website, which was last updated June 26.

Several routes have partially resumed, while Toronto to Niagara Falls, Toronto to Vancouver, and Montreal to Halifax remain interrupted with all trains cancelled. Some of those routes are slated to resume service Nov. 1.

Via Rail said it plans to bring back employees ""as soon as the customer demand allows it.""

The passenger rail service has faced a rough year with rail blockades impacting service earlier in 2020.

""The current year has been filled with unprecedented challenges,"" said Garneau.

The company temporarily laid off roughly the same number of employees in B.C. and Ontario during rail blockades in the winter. The company said in March that most of those employees would be brought back early that month.

Some routes in those provinces were halted when protests in solidarity with the Wet’suwet’en First Nation blocked railways across Canada.

Morneau delivered a ""snapshot"" of the federal finances Wednesday, for the first time since the pandemic brought much of Canada's economy to its knees.

article continues below

In the update, he said the government is well aware some segments of the population are hurting more than others.

""This crisis has exposed and amplified many inequalities in Canada,"" Morneau said.

The same people have in many cases also been affected more by the virus itself, in part because women, new immigrants, racialized Canadians and Indigenous people are more likely to work in the jobs where contagion is a risk, such as health care, retail and warehouse work.

The documents are careful to note that while racialized Canadians are more likely to work in economic sectors hit hard by the virus — including health care, accommodation and food services — little data has been collected to truly understand the impact on visible minorities and other marginalized communities.

So for example, there is no racial breakdown of who applied for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.

Nor has much data been collected on the ethnicities of people diagnosed with COVID-19. One recent report from Ottawa Public Health said two-thirds of cases over the previous six weeks in its territory were racialized Canadians or new immigrants, but that report was limited in scope and for just one city.

The fiscal snapshot shows women, youth, low-wage workers, racialized Canadians, Indigenous people and new immigrants all saw higher rates of job loss or reduced working hours, and are also seeing slow, and in some cases no, benefits as the economy begins to recover.

Jobs in sectors dominated by men, such as construction and manufacturing, were faster to come back than those in service industries, tourism, and accommodation, where women and immigrants tend to be employed in bigger proportion.

New Canadians in particular have seen very little job recovery thus far, the report says.

Businesses owned by women and racialized Canadians were more likely to report declines in orders and clients, and a higher need for rent relief.

Women were also hit harder by the closing of schools and daycares, with women who have kids under the age of six reporting significantly larger declines in hours worked than women with no children or older ones.

""Going forward, anything we do must be about growth, resilience, and creating opportunity for those who were most impacted by this crisis,"" said Morneau.

""This pandemic has identified clear gaps and it’s giving us a chance to reset.""

Exactly how he plans to do that is not clear. The government has said some of the $14-billion aid package offered to provinces to help them safely reopen their economies needs to include child care investments.

""We've been very clear that having access to child care is going to be critically important for us to get back to work,"" Morneau said in a news conference with reporters. ""Women have been harder hit through the course of this pandemic and our measures therefore need to consider that challenge.""

But a month after Ottawa put the $14 billion on the table, the provinces have not yet accepted Ottawa's requirements for getting access to that money.

There is also little information about how the government intends to try to level the economic playing field so the gaps that led to inequalities going into the pandemic are closed.

Morneau said for now the government is focused on the safe restart of the economy and the longer-term recovery plan is still in development.

Green MP Elizabeth May said governments have to make child care and safe school reopenings a bigger priority because without those things, parents — and most often mothers — are not going to be able to return to work.

""We know that's an economic blow we can't risk and we know that's a step back for women's rights we can't accept,"" she said.

May said the snapshot was ""exception"" for the depth of its gender-based analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on women. She said the answer to stopping the damage is three things: ""Child care, child care, child care.""

“The court has gradually resumed some regular operations, including trials, chambers applications and other hearings and conferences, many of which proceed remotely,” B.C. Supreme Court Chief Justice Christopher Hinkson said in a July 7 directive.

article continues below

“While the court has expanded the scope of its in-person operations, counsel, parties, litigants and members of the public are discouraged from attending courthouses unless their personal attendance is necessary or the court so directs,” he said.

B.C. Court of Appeal

In B.C.’s high court, the suspension of service and filing deadlines for existing appeals and chambers applications started March 18 and has been extended to July 27. As of July 14, parties may now request that appeal hearings proceed in a courtroom or by Zoom videoconference.

The court registry is accepting filings in all matters. In civil appeals, electronic filing remains mandatory for lawyers and optional for self-represented litigants.

The time periods for filing cases remains suspended.

“You can wait without concern that the limitation period to start civil or family proceedings will expire,” a July 7 directive from Chief Justice Robert Bauman said.

“Persons in the courtroom are not required to wear masks, but everyone may of course do so, except when addressing the Court at the hearing,” Bauman said. “Counsel/litigants must bring their own water supply and present their arguments from their own table (individual lecterns will be provided). Furniture will be cleaned and disinfected between hearings.”



B.C. Supreme Court

Effective July 13, in-person registry services will resume at all Supreme Court registries and the interim process for requesting a hearing of an urgent or essential matter will no longer be available, Hinkson said.

In criminal matters, bail and bail review hearings, detention review hearings, regular fix-date appearances and regular pre-trial conferences, COVID pre-trial conferences and case management conferences will continue by phone, a directive from Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes said.

Those using registries are recommended to continue using electronic, mail or fax filings where possible.

For family law matters, parties are no longer automatically relieved of the requirement to attend a judicial case conference before making an application by written submissions but that can still be done via phone.

Judicial case conferences already scheduled to occur on or after June 1 will resume by phone.

Civil and family trials scheduled to begin on or after June 8 have resumed unless otherwise directed.

“The resumption of civil and family trials may be subject to change as a result of limitations on available facilities or public health recommendations,” Hinkson said.

Jury selections remain cancelled until September. In civil cases where a jury notice has been filed and served, if all parties consent to proceeding by judge alone, they may seek such an order at a trial management conference.

Effective April 15, a ministerial order suspended limitation periods and mandatory time periods for the commencement of a civil or family proceedings from March 18, 2020 to the date on which the last extension of the declaration of the state of emergency.

“Once this suspension is lifted, more directions will be provided by the court,” Hinkson said.



B.C. Provincial Court

Chief Judge Melissa Gillespie announced July 8, provincial court would return to receiving all filings at the applicable court registry either in-person or remotely.

The provincial court had already begun re-opening June 15 courtrooms on a limited basis outside hub centres of Surrey, Vancouver Victoria, Prince George, and Kelowna where limited in-person hearings began a week earlier.

As of July 8, 2020, registries will accept all family cases filings. Small claims filings will be accepted July 13 while urgent small claims matters will only be heard by telephone.

Among the student-volunteer positions advertised as available on the I Want to Help website are 1,500 spots with YMCA Canada to help create online exercise regimes for kids and seniors in their communities.

article continues below

Yet the YMCA says those positions were actually the brainchild of WE Charity, the organization originally tapped by the Liberal government to administer the Canada Student Services Grant, and that the YMCA never agreed to them.

Both the YMCA and WE blame a miscommunication as WE scrambled to get the grant program — through which students can get up to $5,000 toward their schooling if they volunteer the maximum 500 hours — up and running as quickly as possible.

WE has since withdrawn from running the program.

In an interview, YMCA Canada president Peter Dinsdale said his organization proposed hosting 391 volunteers through dozens of YMCA locations. They would focus on three areas: helping local branches with marketing and website design; data analysis; and assisting seniors with tech questions.

The YMCA arrived at the number after reaching out to branches across the country, Dinsdale said, after which the national office drew up a draft memorandum of understanding with WE to formalize the arrangement.

""We sent a draft in and they sent a draft back and that's when we saw these other positions and we asked to separate them,"" he said of the 1,500 positions for online exercise regimes. ""And they said great. And we haven't heard from them since all this has gone down.""

""These discussions (with the YMCA) took place quickly, given our short timeline for delivery, and some confusion arose around the two separate agreements,"" WE said in a statement to The Canadian Press.

""That confusion contributed to a misunderstanding on our part which led to one group of service positions being posted, rather than the other group of service positions.""

It nonetheless means those advertised positions are not actually available.

The status of thousands of other positions apparently created by WE to meet the requirements of the volunteer program remains uncertain.

Youth Minister Bardish Chagger's spokeswoman Danielle Keenan stood by the Canada Student Services Grant program on Wednesday, saying that while there will be delays in its rollout following WE's departure, the government remains committed to it.

""The Canada Student Service Grants program provides opportunities for students who want to help with their communities COVID-19 response,"" Keenan said in an email to The Canadian Press.

""Although the delivery of the program will change, our objective has not changed which is to ensure students, not-for-profits, and communities are supported throughout the pandemic.""

WE and the Liberal government announced last week that they were ending a sole-sourced contract to have the charity manage the grant program after questions were raised about a potential conflict of interest between Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the organization.

Dinsdale said the YMCA did not know the 1,500 positions had been posted, noting the agreement with WE was never signed. At the same time, the 391 positions that the YMCA does want to fill have yet to be advertised. Dinsdale said the YMCA is waiting to hear from the government on those.

""The 391 that we're actually putting forward, our Ys are ready and willing to engage in it and there are some really interesting opportunities that could exist for youth and our YMCAs and communities,"" he said. ""So we're certainly hopeful those go ahead.""

Thousands of other positions posted on the federal website involve the creation of online content or the mentoring of other students on such topics as COVID-19's impact on the environment, nutrition and cyberbullying.

Some of those are posted in huge batches, such as a call for 1,000 volunteers to be trained to hold one-to-one sessions with people on ""the impact of COVID-19 on food security in your community.""

Another seeks 1,250 volunteers to devise ""social-media assets"" such as captions, memes and videos, for local and regional awareness campaigns to help stop the spread of COVID-19.

None of those postings includes the name of a hosting organization: they're listed as ""supporting local non-profits in your community"" rather than with a specific agency.

WE did indicate that it was behind many of them as it sought to meet the government's requirement that in order to be eligible for the student grant, positions must be linked to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""The purpose of the CSSG was to engage tens of thousands of post-secondary students in service programs to assist with the impact of COVID-19,"" WE said in its statement.

""COVID-19 has been in Canada for a relatively short period of time and there are limited new service opportunities related to addressing (it). This is partly why WE was brought in (to) develop and co-ordinate service roles that fulfil the program guidelines and deliver a meaningful impact.""

Employment and Social Development Canada, which will now administer the grant program instead of WE, did not respond to repeated questions about the positions, including whether they would move ahead or not.

Conservative employment critic Dan Albas said the questions about the federal website underscore the need for answers when it comes to the student grant program, including how positions have been chosen or created and what benefit they are expected to have.

""To find out that perhaps hundreds of positions have been put forward and in good faith maybe people have applied for those positions without having a correction from the government?"" he said.

""This is public money. They need to come clean and clean up this program so that any dollar that is spent gets the maximum opportunities for young people and value for money for taxpayer dollars.""

The service industry — which includes businesses such as hair salons, schools, hospitals, gyms, hotels and restaurants — have racked up 104 orders out of 334 issued to up to July 3.

article continues below

The next most common industry to receive an order as of July 3, is the manufacturing sector, which includes meat processing plants, which have been hard hit by COVID-19, including a poultry plant in Coquitlam, as well as breweries, sawmills and pharmaceuticals.

In mid-May, an outbreak at Superior Poultry was declared over, and the plant allowed to re-open after instituting safety protocols.

Still, WorkSafeBC reports that most employers are doing their due diligence when it comes to meeting industry-specific guidelines.

However, when employers aren’t taking measures to protect workers from COVID-19 exposure, they could be issued an order for health or safety violations.

For the most part, though, employers have been taking the proper steps to re-open their businesses safely during the provincial re-start plan.

“Overall, the vast majority of employers are taking health and safety very seriously during the re-opening. Our inspections are finding that businesses want to be in compliance, and our prevention officers are providing support to help them have an effective COVID-19 Safety Plan,” stated Ivy Yuen, media relations representative in an email to The Tri-City News.

Data is not broken down regionally, so it is difficult to ascertain how many Tri-City businesses were given an order to beef up health and safety protocols.

Since, June 26, WorkSafeBC has conducted more than 12,000 worksite inspections in B.C. related to COVID-19.

The focus of these inspections has been to ensure employers have a COVID-19 Safety Plan in place, according to Yuen, who noted: “This plan needs to assess the risks to workers, and implement measures to prevent the transmission of COVID-19 in the workplace.”

Orders are usually issued as a result of an inspection or can be part of a follow-up activity.

Data posted by WorkPlace BC online shows that employers have a lot of questions about how to manage in the new pandemic reality. In recent weeks, it has has fielded 9,823 questions, 1,728 reports of potential violations and 21 workplace incidents.

There have also been 12,646 inspections, with the large service sector receiving the most at 4,615, followed by 2,988 for trade-related businesses, which includes supermarkets, retail stores and gas stations, 1,256 for the manufacturing sector, 886 for primary resource companies, such as oil and gas, 234 for transportation and warehousing, and 180 for the public sector, including government and law enforcement.

Other industries are being ordered to improve their safety protocols, according to the data.

Inspectors have issues 65 orders for the trade sector, 60 for construction, 18 for primary resources, three for public sector and two for transportation and warehousing, which includes taxis and ride hailing.",[]

Golf Canada reports that there were 17 per cent more scores registered with the national sport body this June compared to the same month last year. A total of 1,483,506 rounds were submitted to Golf Canada's handicap calculator last month compared to 1,271,782 in June 2019.

""It was a pretty big jump from last year, comparing 2019 numbers to this year,"" said Adam Helmer, senior director of golf services for Golf Canada, on Wednesday. ""We were expecting that as golf has emerged as one of the safest activities, where people can be physically distant and we've reduced touchpoints.""

The surge in June ended a streak of three months when recreational rounds played in Canada dropped precipitously due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

As restrictions were lifted across the country in May, the number of scores registered increased.

In May, 165,026 rounds were registered between the 1st and the 15th but 265,480 scores were submitted in the final two weeks of that month. The May 1-15 numbers are a nearly 40 per cent drop from the same period in 2019 (211,809) but the May 16-30 numbers are just five per cent lower than last year (269,266).

Helmer said he expects the number of rounds submitted to Golf Canada to continue to climb through July and into August.

""We've heard anecdotally that a lot of newcomers have joined the sport, especially now that school is done we're going to see an increase in juniors too. We think the trend is going to continue,"" said Helmer. ""Golf has seen a pretty big lift and it's emerged as the sport of the summer.""

The upward trend comes even as Golf Canada had to cancel all of its amateur and professional championships due to travel restrictions put in place to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.

A shift in how scores are registered has also been seen, with most recreational players entering their scores online instead of in the course's clubhouse or pro shop, which have largely been closed this summer because of physical distancing protocols.

Golf Canada plans to launch an updated version of its scoring app later this month, helping to keep players physically distant and improve their game.

He cautioned Wednesday (July 8) some “hotspots” still remain in long-term care and some agricultural setting.

article continues below

The prime minister made the comments in a media briefing ahead of a scheduled fiscal update — or “snapshot” — from Finance Minister Bill Morneau later in the day.

Trudeau said he would leave the details of the snapshot to his finance minister, but added it was imperative for the federal government to have acted right from the outset of the COVID-19 crisis.

“The cost of doing nothing would have been far more,” he said, adding the pandemic has not been a time for “belt-tightening.”

He said the country has been able to slow down progression of the novel coronavirus significantly and parts of the economy have since been able to reopen.

Trudeau repeatedly touted the nation’s historically low interest rates, which he said would help pay off the accumulated debt.

“If the federal government hadn’t taken on significant debt in order to send money to Canadians to support businesses and households, what would Canadians have done?” he asked.

“They would have loaded up their credit cards, they would have scrambled to try and find ways to pay their bills, pay their groceries and figure out how to care for their loved ones.”

The prime minister said he’s confident about the federal government’s response to the pandemic, which has included hundreds of billions in spending, because of the reduced spread of COVID-19 over the past four months.

“This recession is very different from the last recession,” Trudeau said, adding the 2020 economic problems are related to a health crisis.

“There are going to be really important discussions and political debates about what our economy looks like in the coming years.”

He stated earlier in the briefing that his government was also at work at addressing racial injustices that have been brought to the forefront of conversation following the death of unarmed Black man George Floyd in Minneapolis in May.

Trudeau said fighting discrimination is a top priority and mentioned the need for more capital to help fund racialized entrepreneurs.

The prime minister also faced questions on his involvement in the government’s decision to award the handling of $900-million student grant program to the WE Charity, which has longstanding ties to Trudeau and his family.

“The recommendation to use WE to get opportunities out for young people was made by the public service, but as a cabinet we ratify those decisions,” Trudeau said, adding he did not recuse himself from any cabinet decisions related to the charity.

“I love long worked on youth issues both before I got into politics and since I’ve been in politics.”

Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump and Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador are meeting in Washington, D.C., Wednesday to recognize the ratification of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which replaces NAFTA.

Trudeau had earlier declined the invite from Trump but he was quick to reiterate his concerns over the potential for the Americans to reintroduce aluminum tariffs on Canada.

He once again said the U.S. does not produce enough aluminum to fulfill domestic manufacturing needs and any tariffs against Canada imposed by the Americans would hurt the U.S. economy by adding additional costs to customers.

Trump originally hit Canada with aluminum tariffs in 2018, citing national security concerns.

Most recently, she worked full time as a server at the Chateau Victoria Hotel’s Vista 18 restaurant for two years before being laid off due to the COVID-19 pandemic on March 17.

article continues below

“Growing up in Victoria where the hospitality sector is such an important part of our economy, I always thought that this would be a safe industry to work in,” she said Tuesday during a rally for hotel workers at the legislature. “As long as I worked hard and provided good service, I never worried about the insecurity of losing my job, until now.

“Since being laid off I constantly teeter on what tomorrow’s going to look like with financial burdens and obviously emotionally it’s impacted me heavily, as well.”

Only a few people have been called back to work at Chateau Victoria since the pandemic started, Spiteri said.

“And there’s no word on when the rest of us are going to be brought back to the hotel.”

Spiteri was among about 60 people demonstrating for a legal right to return to their jobs as the recovery from COVID continues. Participants were from Victoria, Vancouver and other parts of the Lower Mainland.

Spiteri said the level of insecurity she is feeling is “overwhelming.”

“I’ve been on [Employment Insurance] for a really, really long time and at this point I’m barely scraping by.”

The industry will eventually improve, she said. “Why won’t the industry promise to bring us back? Why won’t the government make that guarantee for us?”

Spiteri said she and other hotel workers at the rally have built careers in the hospitality industry.

“These aren’t just jobs, they’re a vital part of B.C.’s economy.”

Unite Here Local 40 organized the rally. The union has 6,000 members in B.C., including 500 in the capital region working at establishments such as the Chateau Victoria Hotel and Coast Victoria Hotel and Marina, said Stephanie Fung, union spokesperson. They are among more than 50,000 hotel workers in B.C.

The B.C. Hotel Association is seeking support from all levels of government to keep its businesses — and its jobs — alive, at a time when hotels are not profitable, even if many are open.

Ingrid Jarrett, hotel association chief executive, said it is critical that province extend the temporary layoff provision past the Aug. 30 end date and for the federal government to extend the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit in tandem. It proposes that those supports last until the sector regains 70 per cent of its historic revenues.

The association wants B.C. to allow municipalities to grant property tax relief for hotels.

Without this kind of help, Jarrett predicts a third of B.C.’s hotels could shut down.

“It is a very, very dire time and we have very limited confidence that the summer is actually going to allow many of the businesses to survive.”

B.C. has 83,000 hotel rooms in 1,252 hotels. Of those hotels, 25 per cent remain closed, she said. Those that are open are running at about 30 per cent capacity.

More than 80 per cent of hotels in B.C. are small and medium-sized businesses, she said.

Jarrett would like to see B.C. opened to travellers from elsewhere in Canada this summer.

The association is proposing that B.C. allow meetings and conferences, possibility by fall. They would follow health and safety protocols, and allow attendees from elsewhere in Canada and from international locations where the infection rate is low.

Frank Bourree, tourism consultant and vice-chair of the South Island Prosperity Partnership, pointed to the relationship between jobs and a healthy industry.

“The problem is that very few tourism businesses are going to be up to full capacity in order to bring everybody back, even through the fall. So is there even a job for them to come back to?

“I think it is great that they [workers] are bringing profile to the loss of tourism jobs here but there has to be an employer there to employ them. And the industry is really precarious right now.”

Employees need to be supported until their jobs come back, Bourree said.

Another key factor is that when the temporary layoff period winds up, employers have to pay severance. “For the employers, if they’ve got a huge severance hit, that might push them right over the edge into bankruptcy,” Bourree said.

Tourism represents 10 per cent of the employment base in the capital region, Bourree said.

Greater Victoria hotels are running at about 25 per cent occupancy, down from 80 per cent a year ago, he said.

“Nobody believes that we are going to see international travel into B.C. for the balance of this year.”

Even when a hotel is open, it is unlikely to be profitable, Bourree said. Most open hotels are operating on a “shoestring,” he said.

The challenge locally and within the rest of the province, is that B.C. visitors stay on the weekends and not during the week, meaning the industry is not filling enough rooms. Travellers from elsewhere in Canada and internationally typically stay long and stay during the week, Bourree said.

It’s easy for Canadians to look southward and shake their heads in bemused smugness at the daily penchant of Americans to indulge in conspiracy theories and demonizing of disfavoured segments of society.



But I’m getting a whiff of that attitude here in Canada now. It serves as a reminder how easily irrationality and fear can spark reactions leading to full-blown witch hunts and targeting of the “others.”

The past few days I’ve seen multiple news reports of people reporting cars with U.S. plates. For some, the immediate reaction was to assume the owners of those cars have no right to be where they are, and then make the irrational link that anyone who comes from the U.S. must be dripping with coronavirus that will spread to anything they touch.

article continues below

These fears were stoked by some unfortunate remarks by the premier, which were fortunately walked back by more measured remarks by Dr. Bonnie Henry.

This jump to conclusions affects me personally. Last month, my wife and I moved to Victoria from California. It is a move we have planned for five years and was irretrievably set in motion a year before anyone ever heard of the novel coronavirus.

But now that we are here — thoroughly inspected and interrogated by both CBSA and provincial health officials at the border and after completing our 14-day isolation (which confirmed our symptom-free condition during the three months of lockdown in California) — we are now faced with a very un-Canadian attitude of guilt-by-association for anyone whose car (as does ours) bears U.S. plates.

Leave aside the fact that COVID-19 spreads generally by transmission of fluids during close (usually confined, indoor) contact with someone else; leave aside the fact that wearing a mask and keeping distance are the two most effective ways to avoid transmission, wherever the suspected carrier hails from; leave aside the fact that the incidence of mask-wearing in B.C. seems far below what my wife and I expected and practise ourselves.

The mere fact someone belongs to a “suspect group” (owners of cars with U.S. plates) does not make them public-health pariahs; that is the heart of the conspiracy-driven, fear-mongering in the U.S. we Canadians rightfully disparage.

The news reports invariably actually talk with the car owners and discover that they are here legitimately.

But they fear reprisal from the unthinking, who are quick to grab their pitchfork and call for a witch-burning.

I know my wife and I are concerned about that as well, wondering if our car will be keyed by some anonymous COVID-19 vigilante; that’s why I ask my name not be reproduced with this letter.

While we all need to remain vigilant and compliant in fighting the pandemic, turning on superficial scapegoats without knowing their full story is no solution and just imports northward a different epidemic we should work equally hard to keep out.

The CFL is reportedly looking at playing in a single hub or two hub cities to limit teams' exposure to the virus. But Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases expert at Toronto General Hospital and associate professor of medicine at the University of Toronto, said positive tests remain possible and could threaten play — just like in other leagues.

article continues below

""The short answer is nothing in this era is going to be without risk,"" Bogoch said during a telephone interview. ""There are certain things we can do to minimize the risk but as with anything, there's going to be some element of risk of acquiring this infection.

""The league and players can work with medical professionals to make this as safe as possible but at the end of the day they'll have to sit down collectively and decide, 'Is this worthwhile.' As individuals they'll have to ask themselves, based on the protocols in place and individual risk perception, risk tolerance and risk threshold, 'Am I willing to play?'""

The CFL and CFL Players' Association continue to discuss amendments to their current collective bargaining agreement that would allow for a partial '20 season. The earliest action would begin is September, but commissioner Randy Ambrosie has said a cancelled campaign also remains possible.

In March, the COVID-19 pandemic forced a global shutdown of sports. In Europe, pro soccer has resumed while domestically Major League Soccer, Major League Baseball, the NHL and NBA are all attempting to either restart or open their seasons.

But it hasn't been easy as all four North American circuits have had players or team officials contract the virus. FC Dallas was forced to withdraw from the MLS is Back Tournament in Orlando after 10 players and one coach tested positive.

The NHL hopes to open training camps Monday and resume play in Edmonton and Toronto on Aug. 1. Players would stay in tightly controlled bubbles and play games without fans.

Teams can bring 52 personnel, with no more than 31 players, to their hub. Everyone in the bubble will be tested daily — including players, staff, hotel workers, food service employees and bus drivers.

Players and team officials will remain inside the bubble except in specific extenuating circumstances. That includes medical attention, the birth of a child or death in the family.

Anyone returning to the bubble will be subject to a minimum four-day quarantine with daily nasal swab tests for COVID-19.

The NHL and NHLPA have the ability to delay, postpone, move or cancel games due to a ""risk to player health and safety"" and/or chance that ""the integrity of the competition"" is in jeopardy, including ""an uncontrolled outbreak of COVID-19.""

However, perhaps the biggest challenge the CFL faces is a financial hurdle. Unlike other major sports entities, it doesn't have a billion-dollar TV deal and thus isn't flush with money.

Ambrosie has stated often the nine-team CFL collectively lost $20 million last year. That hardly puts it in an ideal position to cover food and lodging costs for its teams as well as daily testing.

Bogoch said regardless of the measures taken in a hub or bubble, positive test results are inevitable.

""Oh, 100 per cent and there already have been,"" he said. ""If they do proceed, I think the leagues and fans should be aware that anything can happen.

""The leagues could come to a halt should there be an outbreak or safety concern, individuals or teams might be pulled out. Quite frankly, as much as we want to have high expectations we should really lower them. We're in the COVID-19 era, anything can happen.""

No league has said a specific number of positive tests will result in the cancellation of games.

Bogoch said hubs and bubbles are beneficial. With the exception of baseball, the other three North American leagues are going with hub plans.

""First, they reduce the probability of introducing infection within the bubble,"" he said. ""If (infection) is introduced, it really reduces the probability that it can be transmitted.

""If there's infection it will hopefully be rapidly identified because of the high frequency of diagnostic testing and symptom checks. Now, the best-laid plans can still have holes in them but what we've seen with basketball and soccer is these plans work in that they've identified positive cases and players have been isolated. That tells me the safety mechanisms are working and that's fantastic.""

But the mounting positive tests have prompted many to question sport's return before the discovery of a suitable vaccine.

""The key is ensuring if you're going to play pro sports, you're doing it in a safe and ethical manner,"" he said. ""Safety really means player safety, safety of the auxiliary personnel but also public safety as well.

""Ethical manner means you're not drawing resources away from the community in which you're playing. Can that occur while there's still an ongoing push to ensure safety across the country and develop a vaccine and develop programs? I personally think if it's carefully planned out, they can both be done very well.""

Bogoch, a Calgary native, is a recreational hockey player in his spare time. But he also watches at least two CFL games each year: The Labour Day Classic between the Calgary Stampeders and arch-rival Edmonton Eskimos; and Grey Cup.

""That (Labour Day game) is just ingrained in my DNA,"" he said with a chuckle. ""The Labour Day Classic is so quintessential Alberta, it's wonderful.

""There's something so Canadian about (the Grey Cup), it's 40 below in a blizzard and the guys are out on the field. It's just wild.""

While Bogoch appreciates sport isn't a priority for some, he said it can definitely provide a boost for others during a pandemic.

""When we step back and think about what's been happening the last six months and especially since our lockdown in March and throughout our gradual reopening, people have taken a tremendous hit,"" he said. ""We've taken financial hits . . . we've taken emotional and psychological hits by staying at home.

""While some people might say (sport) isn't an essential service and they're correct, I think we can also say professional and amateur sports and other forms of entertainment like the arts are extremely important to the psychological and emotional well-being of our society. This may help provide some intangible benefits as well.""

Mercifully, Bogoch sees light at the end of the COVID-19 pandemic tunnel.

""I think we'll gradually see this start to wind down as vaccines are developed and rolled out globally,"" he said. ""In the best-case scenario it could be as early as late 2020 . . . but more realistically needles will start going into arms in 2021.

""I think the key word there is globally because if there's an infection in one part of the world, there's a problem in all parts of the world. This thing is pretty contagious and people are mobile so we need this vaccine deployed on a global level.""

The economic and fiscal ""snapshot"" from the government today lays out the Liberals' belief that there will be a slow return to a new normal, with unemployment high and economic growth low through to at least the end of 2021.

article continues below

Even though the government believes the worst of the economic harm from the pandemic is behind the country, the document says a recovery can't begin in earnest until an effective vaccine or treatment becomes widely available.

Things could, however, get worse under two alternative scenarios the Finance Department lays out.

Should prolonged shutdowns stay in place, or restrictions not fully roll back, a return to normal activity for households and businesses will be uneven and slower than hoped for, leading to a more pronounced drop in economic output than is already expected.

And should the country be hit with a second wave of the novel coronavirus during the annual flu season, the ensuing lockdowns would cause what the Finance Department describes as a ""deeper and longer-lasting negative impact on the economy.""

The Liberals have repeatedly promised to use the federal treasury as a financial shield between Canadians and irreparable harm, and the cost of that promise is now at $231.9 billion in direct spending and a deficit comparable only to those seen in the Second World War.

Whatever the costs, they're worth it, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a news conference Wednesday morning, before the snapshot was released.

""As we measure the cost of helping Canadians, we shouldn't forget that the cost of doing nothing would have been far more,"" Trudeau said, insisting that this is not the time for belt-tightening or austerity.

The document tries to make that case, saying that the $80-billion Canada Emergency Response Benefit, which had paid out $53.5 billion in benefits as of late June, has covered Canadians' estimated $44.6 billion in lost labour income through the first half of the year.

The $2,000-a-month benefit is estimated to have covered the monthly housing, food, phone and internet costs for the bottom and middle thirds of households, according to Finance Department calculations.

Historically low interest rates mean all the hundreds of billions in borrowing comes with ""manageable"" costs, Trudeau said, and the alternative would be for individuals and households to load up with debt themselves to cope with months of no or little work.

Adding to the deficit is a $37.3 billion boost to the federal wage subsidy program to bring its budget to $82.3 billion, signalling an expansion and coming changes to the benefit that covers up to 75 per cent of wages to a maximum of $847 a week for eligible companies.

The Liberals expect more workers to move onto the wage subsidy and off the Canada Emergency Response Benefit as that $80-billion program winds down.

Those who fall through the COVID-19 financial safety net are expected to be caught by the employment insurance system that has been largely dormant since the CERB replaced it in late March.

Government officials admit there will still need to be policy changes to the EI system to help some self-employed workers qualify, and capture EI-eligible workers who, due to the pandemic, haven't been able to work the necessary qualifying hours.

For this calendar year, the government expects the unemployment rate to hit 9.8 per cent, dropping to 7.8 per cent next year based on forecasts by 13 private sector economists.

Although that's a bump from the record-high unemployment rate of 13.7 per cent in May for a labour force of just over 19 million, it is still almost double the record low of 5.5 per cent pre-pandemic.

The document doesn't contain the five-year forecast traditionally part of federal budgets owing to the uncertain path the pandemic will take and the state of the economy beyond that.

""Even when the pandemic is over, lasting consequences may cast a long-term shadow over economic developments, for example via more indebted businesses and households, persistent unemployment and substantial structural changes in the economy that have been accelerated through the crisis,"" the government's update says.

""In the coming months and as needed the government will announce measures to support the recovery.""

Opposition parties had wanted Morneau to provide a road map for reshaping emergency aid measures that are set to expire in the fall and keeping spending and deficits under control.

In his own morning news conference, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said the Liberals mishandled the COVID-19 pandemic by being slow to close borders and by instituting too-rigid emergency aid programs.

Canada can't afford for the Liberals to mishandle the economy as well, he said, by keeping benefits in place that remove incentives to go back to work while the novel coronavirus remains a risk.

""Liberals put all their faith in government, Conservatives put our faith in people,"" Scheer said.

He said the Liberals should take up a Conservative proposal to offer a ""back to work bonus"" and send more money to the federal auditor general so her office can study the government's spending more closely.

Next week, the Bank of Canada is to again update its forecasts when it releases a monetary policy report along with a scheduled interest-rate announcement.

Last month, the central bank said it expected a decline between 10 and 20 per cent in the second quarter compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. That is an improvement from the 15-to-30-per-cent drop in the quarter highlighted in the bank's worst-case scenario in April.

There were no new deaths and there remain 16 people in hospital, with four of those in intensive care units.

That makes 2,990 people who have tested positive for the virus that has caused a global pandemic since COVID-19 first appeared in B.C. in late January.

Of those, 183 people have died, 2,645 people have recovered and 162 people are still battling the disease. Most infected patients are self-isolating at home.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,013 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,576 in Fraser Health;

• 133 in Island Health;

• 203 in Interior Health; and

• 65 in Northern Health.

""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks and the outbreak at Tabor Home has now been declared over,"" B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix and provincial health officer Bonnie Henry said in a joint statement on July 7.

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreaks at Tabor and at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred to those homes from the hospital.

""While there are no active community outbreaks in B.C., new cases and community exposure events continue to occur in the community,"" Dix and Henry said.

""There has been a new community exposure event at Hotel Belmont bar and nightclub in the Vancouver Coastal Health region. Public health teams have issued an alert for anyone who may have been at the premises on June 27 and June 29.""

B.C. is estimated to have a population of about 5,190,000 people so it has so far had about one case of COVID-19 for every 1,735 residents, or 0.576 people per 1,000 residents. That compares with Washington State's estimated population of 7,615,000 people and 36,970 cases, for about one case of COVID-19 for every 206 people, or 4.85 people per 1,000 residents.

B.C.'s death rate, however, at more than 6.1%, is slightly higher than other jurisdictions.

Washington State, with 1,384 deaths, has a 3.7% death rate for COVID-19 patients.

Johns Hopkins University's Centre for Systems Science and Engineering has recorded 11,712,663 COVID-19 cases and 540,582 deaths globally, for a death rate of slightly more than 4.6%.

The record high of 10,028 new cases in Texas served as another alarming new measure of the swift resurgence of COVID-19 nationwide and the failures of the country’s response. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas aggressively began one of America’s fastest reopenings in May but has begun reversing course in recent weeks, ordering bars closed and mandating face coverings.

article continues below

New York and Florida are the only other states to record more than 10,000 new cases in a single day. New York hit that grim total back in April, when New York City hospitals were overwhelmed and hundreds of people were dying every day. Florida topped 10,000 confirmed cases last week.

The record mark in Texas partly reflects a lag in testing results from the Fourth of July weekend, when newly reported cases were far below what Texas has seen in recent weeks. But Abbott said the numbers should still be ""an alarm bell for everybody"" who is skeptical about whether the virus is a threat.

""We have rapid spread of COVID-19 in the state of Texas right now,"" Abbott told San Antonio television station KENS.

Later in the interview, Abbott was noncommittal about whether he would attend his own party's convention next week in Houston, which the Texas GOP has remained bent on holding even as the mayor, doctors and businesses pressure the party to cancel. Houston has emerged as one of the nation's hot zones in the pandemic. However, Republican activists, some of whom have called the fears overblown, have resolved to press forward with the indoor three-day convention.

Texas surged past 8,000 statewide hospitalizations for the first time over the long holiday weekend — a more than quadruple increase on the past month. On Tuesday, the number of hospitalizations soared past 9,000. Texas also set a new high for deaths in a single day with 60.

Mayors in some of the biggest cities in the state and U.S. — including Austin, San Antonio and Houston — have warned that hospitals could soon become overwhelmed with coronavirus patients. Along the Texas-Mexico border, some cities imposed curfew orders in hopes of cutting down on large parties or social gatherings as cases have skyrocketed.

""Many of us are running at capacity and have created new wards,"" said Todd Mann, the chief executive officer at McAllen Medical Center, which on Tuesday had more than 130 coronavirus patients taking up more than half of the facility's beds. ""The physical space is obviously limited, and most of the hospitals are running out of that pretty quickly.""

The record count was reported on a day that also saw the State Fair of Texas cancelled for the the first time since World War II. Fair organizers said the event, which draws more than a million visitors to Dallas each fall, was not feasible during the pandemic.

It also came as President Donald Trump leaned on governors to reopen schools this fall, arguing that some are keeping schools closed not because of the risks from the coronavirus pandemic but for political reasons. Texas education officials announced Tuesday that face coverings will be mandatory for students older than 10 years old and that school districts must offer on-campus learning to any family that wants their child in a classroom.

Deaths remain lower in Texas compared to other big states. As of Tuesday, Texas has confirmed that at least 2,715 people have died due to COVID-19. But fatalities have climbed in recent days, and in addition to an alarming acceleration in new cases in Texas, the seven-day infection rate has climbed to 13.5%.

The number of infections is likely far higher because many people haven't been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected without feeling sick.

Two separate photos of the bare-faced party leader sitting comfortably in a waiting area circulated online but his office says he was wearing a mask for his trip.

A spokesperson said the photos must have been taken after he doffed the covering to take a call but before he put it back on.

Toronto's Pearson airport currently has a policy that masks must be worn at all times to curb the spread of COVID-19, with limited exceptions that include being at a food or beverage service location.

The photos shows Scheer in the lounge with several others, and while they are seated spaced apart, none is wearing a mask.

In April, Scheer was criticized for bringing his family on a government flight back to Ottawa for a House of Commons sitting, reducing the ability for the other two MPs on board to keep a distance from the Scheers.

He and other party leaders have been wearing masks around Parliament Hill. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also wears them during photo ops.

Scheer is the waning days of his leadership. The ballots to select his replacement go in the mail in the coming days and a new leader will be elected in late August.

Up to 90 centres across the country will gradually reopen in July, starting with 14 on Wednesday. Further openings are to be guided by public health advice as well as how many Canadians each centre serves.

The government has spent the past few weeks upgrading the centres to put up clear barriers at counters, signs to encourage physical distancing and reduce seating in waiting areas.

Personal protective equipment will also be provided to staff at centres that reopen.

Face masks will be offered to people visiting centres in provinces or municipalities that have mandated their use in indoor public spaces.

Anyone going to a centre that doesn't fall under any such provincial or municipal requirement will be encouraged to wear a masks and use hand-sanitizer.

While the newly reopened centres will handle queries for social insurance numbers, employment insurance and the Canada Pension Plan among others, the government says passport and biometrics services won't be available at first.

Days after public health authorities closed businesses and ordered workers to stay home to slow the spread of COVID-19, the Liberals closed the sprawling network of Service Canada centres.

Some of the offices, such as one tucked inside Ottawa's city hall, had already started to close before the official announcement in March as confirmed cases of COVID-19 increased and workers were needed elsewhere, or resisted going in.

The government says an online Service Canada portal opened in response to the closures has seen more than 700,000 requests. That's about half the number of in-person visits Service Canada locations would see in the same period in normal times.

In a release, the government is still urging Canadians to use online services wherever possible, including to book appointments online for in-person help.

The network of 318 Service Canada centres, along with almost 250 more outreach centres, received about 8.4 million visits during the 12-month period between April 2018 and March 2019. The figure, noted in a recently posted evaluation of federal services, included over 1.9 million people walking in to use a self-service kiosk.

Central 1 says it expects home sales to recover marginally in 2020 and 2021 after tumbling by 55 per cent between mid-March and April.

article continues below

Deputy chief economist Brian Yu says despite values plunging to levels not seen since the early 1980s, home prices have stayed firm because fewer properties were available for sale.

He predicts median prices could rebound to about $710,000 before slipping to around $540,000 late this year or early in 2021.

Yu says unemployment, business and health concerns will further weaken the market, while population growth, which has traditionally propped up the sector in B.C., will slow to a trickle next year, dampening sales.

He says a second wave of COVID-19 has the potential to shave home prices by 15 per cent as more owners already hit by the pandemic's first wave are forced to sell during a second downturn.

The report released Tuesday notes positive developments as B.C. enters the third phase of its recovery plan including restarts in the accommodation, spa, film and television industries.

Vacancy rates could also climb as high as three per cent over the next year, writes Yu, ""providing an opportune time for renters to negotiate rental rates before the market tightens up again.""

Housing starts are forecast to slump 33 per cent in 2020 and remain flat in 2021, which ""set the stage for a housing supply shortage in coming years,"" the report says.

The timing of a second wave and its impact on the economy would draw out the effect on the housing market, potentially carrying into 2022, it says.

Summer is officially here, with sunny weather, full ferries, and a few statutory holidays thrown in for good measure. As much as it feels like the perfect time to relax and have fun, please continue taking every measure to prevent a COVID-19 outbreak on the Coast. We don’t have to look very far south to see what can happen if we are not careful, and we need to keep working together to keep our community safe.

While there have been some welcome changes with Phase 3 of our provincial Restart Plan, it is important to remember that all of the other personal and business recommendations from Phase 2 remain in place. Phase 3 is not a return to normal and we should all continue to act as though COVID-19 is still here.

This means that businesses should be following Public Health and Worksafe BC guidelines to ensure the safety of employees and customers. This includes limiting the number of people on premises at any one time, ensuring adequate spacing, and the use of masks and barriers when physical spacing is not possible. Please respect our businesses who are doing their very best to ensure the safety of everyone who enters.

In our local health-care facilities, visitors are allowed, but are restricted to essential visits only. For the hospital, each patient may have one visitor at a time for a maximum of two hours per visitor. For our long-term care facilities, residents may have one designated person who is able to visit. Virtual visits are allowed at all facilities, and tablets are available for residents and patients who do not have access otherwise.

For individuals, our recommendations remain the same:

• Maintain physical distancing with people outside of your household (or your very limited family/friend bubble), and wear a mask whenever you can’t maintain a distance of at least two metres.

• Wash your hands frequently, especially after touching high contact surfaces.

Do not touch your face unless you have just washed your hands, and make sure you wash your hands after touching your face.

• Avoid large groups if you can, especially indoors. If you do meet up with others, please meet up outside whenever possible and maintain physical distancing.

• Exercise extra caution if you are older and have high blood pressure, obesity, diabetes, heart disease, lung disease or other significant health issues.

If you do develop new cold or flu symptoms (no matter how mild), please stay home and self-isolate until you have been assessed. Do not go to work. Do not go shopping. Do not meet up with others. Do call your family doctor or the Respiratory Assessment Clinic (Monday to Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.) to arrange for further assessment and testing, if indicated. The Respiratory Assessment Clinic can be reached by phone or text at 604-740-1252 or by email at coastrespclinic@gmail.com.

We continue to test everyone with possible COVID-19 symptoms, so please do not hesitate to call if you become ill. If you have more severe symptoms and believe you may need to be admitted to hospital, please go to the Sechelt Hospital Emergency Department. If you need an ambulance, please call 911. The Emergency Department is open and safe for anyone with a medical emergency.

With respect to non-emergent non-COVID-19 health issues, our local medical clinics remain open Monday to Friday, with virtual and in-person walk-in services available through the Gibsons Medical Clinic from Monday to Saturday. Please note that all of our family medicine clinics are currently booking people without a local family doctor.

In order to provide as safe an environment as possible for both patients and staff, the majority of medical care will continue to be provided virtually. This is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. If you have a medical issue that requires a physical assessment, an in-person appointment will be arranged.

Please check the Coast Reporter and The Local Weekly for periodic updates on COVID-19 in our community. As local parks, programs and facilities open up, please visit the SCRD, the Town of Gibsons, and the District of Sechelt websites for updates.

But just three weeks before Green and her family were set to fly from Edmonton to Sydney, N.S., on July 17, WestJet announced it was ending its policy of leaving the middle seats on its flights empty.

article continues below

""I was devastated,"" Green said, noting her family spends every summer in Nova Scotia with her 93-year-old grandmother who is suffering from severe dementia and another family member with an incurable form of cancer.

""We all knew it could very well be the last summer we would spend with them.""

When Green called WestJet to see if any accommodations could be made, she told the company she has a heart condition that puts her in the high-risk category for COVID-19.

Despite her pleas, Green said the airline told her it was unable to make any special accommodations, nor would it allow her to change the date of the flight to before July 1, when the rules were relaxed, without paying a fee.

And Green's not alone: as provinces begin to relax domestic travel restrictions, the cessation of physical distancing rules by two of Canada's biggest airlines — WestJet and Air Canada — is causing frustration and grief among some passengers.

Gabor Lukacs, head of the advocacy group Air Passenger Rights Canada, said he has fielded countless complaints from passengers during the COVID-19 pandemic, many of which are related to the same issues: airlines refusing to offer refunds or accommodations amid the abolition of physical distancing rules.

While he acknowledges the effort to fill seats is due to airlines attempting to recoup billions in lost revenue, Lukacs argues the companies risk deterring customers from flying at all.

""The question is: do we allow economic considerations to override public health? We don't allow supermarkets to sell spoiled meat because it's cheaper. Are we going to allow doctors to skip disinfecting their tools to save the cost?""

There's some evidence he's right: a new poll conducted by Leger and the Association of Canadian Studies found 72 per cent of respondents say they are not comfortable flying now that Air Canada and WestJet have culled their seat distancing policies.

Only 22 per cent said they would be OK with flying under the newly relaxed rules.

In response to criticisms, WestJet forwarded The Canadian Press a statement from a July 3 blog post regarding changes to its seat distancing policy.

""The blocked middle seat was introduced at the beginning of the pandemic before the myriad of safety measures were put in place and mandated on board,"" the statement reads.

""Seat distancing was never intended to be in place permanently or throughout the pandemic.""

The post notes a number of measures WestJet has taken to help stop the spread of COVID-19 on its flights, including mandatory masking, pre-boarding questionnaires for all passengers, temperature screening, thorough cleaning of aircraft between flights, and the restriction of in-flight dining services.

However, the company has also denied it's putting passengers and staff at risk by filling flights up, pointing to other safety measures as mitigating the risk of spreading COVID-19.

Air Canada provided a similar statement, acknowledging the inconvenience the change may have caused to customers.

""While we would all like a single measure that reduces risk, we are left to use a combination of approaches to mitigate risk as far as practical,"" the airline said.

Yet some passengers report first-hand experiences in which masking protocols were not followed.

Maureen Isabel Green, 31, flew from Vancouver to Fredericton three weeks ago with Air Canada to visit her family, and said she was shocked by the lax use of masks by both airport employees and the passengers on her two connecting flights.

""I just think of all the people who are getting on a flight and risking their life, or risking the life of the people they're going to visit, because some people don't want to wear a mask for a few hours,"" she said.

Green, who is a health-care worker, said there were numerous instances on her flight from Vancouver to Montreal where a group of young, male passengers took off their masks when flight attendants were not present.

While at the Montreal airport, Green said a man was able to board a flight without wearing a mask, simply by telling attendants he had a medical condition that prevented him from doing so.

Air travel has been at the centre of several headline-grabbing incidents throughout the pandemic — particularly since travel restrictions have been eased in some regions.

On July 2, health authorities in B.C. warned the passengers of four separate flights that they may have been exposed to COVID-19.

Just a day before — on the exact day the airlines ended their social distancing policies — the Nova Scotia Health Authority warned passengers of a Toronto-to-Halifax WestJet flight from the previous week that they may have been exposed to COVID-19.

And on Sunday, a Halifax man reportedly walked off of a St. John's-bound flight after learning he was the only passenger travelling within the so-called ""Atlantic bubble,"" sparking discussion about the effectiveness of airlines' COVID-prevention policies.

The YMCA Canada, the Boys and Girls Clubs of Canada and the Royal Canadian Legion are among those that say they are facing severe financial difficulties and been forced to permanently close some locations even as demand for their services has increased.

article continues below

A YMCA facility permanently closed its doors in Yarmouth, N.S., because of the pandemic while the Boys and Girls Clubs shuttered its operations in Edson, Alta. The legion has seen three halls close for good in Ontario and one in New Brunswick.

While the fear is those are just the beginning, the government is also being warned that failing to help now could cost more in the long run as organizations that provide child care, emergency food support and other social services disappear.

""The problem is the bill will come due later,"" said Boys and Girls Clubs of Canada president Owen Charters. ""Because as these organizations disappear, the social safety net becomes a tax burden where the government needs to step in and provide those services directly.""

The sector began to bang the drums with alarm at the end of March as Canadians started to realize the pandemic would last longer than a couple of weeks and donations and other sources of income such as the provision of child care started to dry up.

Dozens of charities signed a letter on March 25 asking Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his government for financial aid to prevent ""irreparable damage,"" particularly at a time when more people needed their services.

Ottawa has since included the sector in some of its COVID-19 supports such as wage-subsidy and rent-deferral programs. It also created a $350-million fund for organizations to provide emergency assistance to Canadians during the pandemic.

While welcome, those interviewed say the already-announced federal programs and funding fall far short.

""What we need is direct supports to make sure Ys can survive the crisis,"" YMCA Canada president Peter Dinsdale said. ""There is a real need for sector stabilization. It's not just YMCAs in this country. It is Boys and Girls Clubs, the United Way. So many entities out there require support.""

The government has been told as much numerous times, with letters written and phone calls made. Yet those interviewed say there has yet to be a real response. That silence has sparked concern and frustration.

""We sent off two letters,"" said Royal Canadian Legion dominion president Tom Irvine. ""There was no acknowledgment of receiving the letters or nothing. So I'm pretty discouraged at this time, but still hopeful. This is a Canadian institution and if we don't do something, we could lose it.""

Social Development Minister Ahmed Hussen's spokeswoman Jessica Eritou on Tuesday praised the work of the charitable and non-profit sector and touted the $350-million emergency fund, which organizations say does not address the core of their concerns.

""We are continuing to look at ways to work with charities and non-profits supporting Canadians during the crisis,"" she added.

""We continue discussions with organizations to help support the important work they're doing in communities across the country and we will keep looking for the most effective ways to help Canadians during this unprecedented crisis.""

Cardus, a charity that does research on the non-profit sector, released a paper on Tuesday urging the federal government to start matching donations from Canadians to different organizations using money set aside to cover the costs of a tax credit for Canadians who donate.

But Dinsdale and Charters said matching programs will still leave many organizations struggling, and that the only real solution is direct federal support to help the sector weather the pandemic and continue providing essential services.

A lack of safe places for children to be while their parents work is an obstacle to economic recovery, economists have warned, particularly for women.

""While the federal government's been focused on macro-economic approaches like the wage subsidy, like CERB and other initiatives, they have ignored this sector,"" said Dinsdale, whose organization runs child-care centres across the country.

""And they've ignored this sector at the risk of not having the most critical social services available to Canadians as the economy reopens.""

The figure is the upper range of the scenarios the budget watchdog was asked to research as part of a report released Tuesday morning as policy-makers consider how to shape emergency supports set to expire in the fall.

article continues below

Planned federal spending to date on pandemic-related aid now tops about $174 billion, in a range of programs meant to provide a financial floor for individuals and businesses.

The idea of giving a government-guaranteed basic income to Canadians has gained steam as millions have watched their jobs or earnings evaporate in the COVID-19 pandemic.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau and other senior cabinet ministers have repeatedly been asked by senators and MPs about the concept. Advocates argue that it would be an expansion of the $80-billion Canada Emergency Response Benefit for workers who saw their incomes crash.

The CERB and a $45-billion wage-subsidy program are set to expire in October.

Providing six months of a basic income starting that month could cost between $47.5 billion and $98.1 billion, depending on how much of the benefit is clawed back from people whose other incomes increase.

Budget officer Yves Giroux's report says the average benefit to Canadians aged 18 to 64 would range between $4,500 and $4,800, with the number of recipients depending on the phase-out rate.

Sen. Yuen Pau Woo, who asked for the costing, said a basic-income program could fill in the gaps in Canada's social safety nets, a patchwork largely run by provinces, that have been exposed by the pandemic.

""It's a huge undertaking to launch a basic income for the whole country on a permanent basis. The costs are extremely high and the political resistance is likely to be fierce, but we are in a period where it is likely we will have to spend large sums of money on income support going into the balance of 2020 and into 2021,"" Woo said in a telephone interview.

""The question to my mind is how we spend it, and in what form.""

A basic income means different things to different people, but it is usually viewed as a no-strings-attached benefit that governments provide to citizens instead of various targeted social benefits.

Also known as a guaranteed minimum income, it can be delivered as a universal payment, or as a means-tested benefit that declines as a recipient's other income rises.

Giroux's report says the government could repeal $15 billion in tax measures to offset the overall cost of a basic-income program, which Woo added would likely have to wrap in existing measures to avoid duplication.

The overall cost of the program might be higher than the budget office estimates. The PBO's estimates rely on some Statistics Canada income data that doesn't include people living in the northern territories or in First Nations, or some military members.

Nor can the figures simply be doubled to determine a full year's cost because that might overstate the financial impact. The economy appears to be bouncing back slowly from a bottoming-out in April, and the cost of the program would depend on how many employees are rehired or find new jobs.

The Canadian Federation of Independent Business, which represents small businesses nationwide, said Tuesday that about one-third of members responding to a survey reported being back at full staffing levels, but suggested many believe it will take six months to get back to normal profitability.

Statistics Canada is to release June's jobs report on Friday.

Projections released Tuesday by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimate Canada's unemployment rate at 11 per cent for the second quarter of the year.

The 37-member international body predicted the national unemployment rate would decline to 7.7 per cent by the end of the year, or to 8.4 per cent should a second wave of the novel coronavirus force renewed lockdowns.

NDP finance critic Peter Julian said Tuesday that the uncertain economic path ahead requires the Liberals to say how the government plans to reshape emergency aid in Wednesday's fiscal update.

He said a more universal benefit, which the NDP has pushed, would have helped more people and cost less had the Liberals used it from the start.

""It makes more sense to make sure that everybody who needs the benefit can actually get it than the government's approach,"" Julian said.

The Liberals have said the update on Wednesday will provide an economic outlook, an accounting of spending to date and projections for the remainder of the fiscal year, including the expected deficit. The PBO and others estimate that to be at least $250 billion.

Seventy-two per cent of Canadians surveyed by Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies say they're not comfortable flying since a decision by some airlines to relax their own in-flight physical distancing requirements.

article continues below

As of July 1, Air Canada and WestJet both ended policies blocking the sale of adjacent seats.

The measure was seen to align with a guidance document for the aviation industry issued by Transport Canada in April to help curb the spread of COVID-19.

Among other things, the department had suggested passengers should be widely spaced when possible, though they did not make it mandatory.

Airlines, however, are required to make passengers and air crews wear masks.

Only 22 per cent of those surveyed said they're comfortable getting aboard with no in-flight physical distancing and a requirement to wear masks.

There's more to it to keep flights safe, WestJet said in a statement last week after critics attacked its plan.

""What makes an airplane, and the entire journey, safe is the layers of enhanced cleaning, the wearing of masks and the hospital-grade HEPA filters that remove 99.999 per cent of all airborne particles,"" the airline said.

""The hygiene standards we have now are world-class and backed by industry experts.""

Critics have also previously pounced on the airlines for another move: refusing to fully refund tickets for flights cancelled due to the pandemic.

Thousands of people have beseeched Transport Minister Marc Garneau to compel airlines to issue refunds, but he has refused, arguing that mandating reimbursements from a sector that's lost more than 90 per cent of its revenue would cripple the industry.

But 72 per cent of those polled say they totally oppose his decision.

In lieu of refunds, the airlines have offered vouchers but the poll suggests that it may take a while before people will rebook previously cancelled trips: 85 per cent of those surveyed told pollsters they have no plans to travel outside the country by the end of the year.

The survey polled 1,517 people and can't be assigned a margin of error because online polls are not considered truly random.

Pollsters were in the field between July 3 and 5, a historically popular few days for Canadians and Americans to be on the move between the two countries, given the July 1 Canada Day holiday and the U.S.'s July 4 Independence Day.

But the border remains closed to non-essential traffic, and the majority of Canadians surveyed said they feel it needs to stay that way. The current mutual closure agreement is due to expire July 21.

Of Canadians polled, 86 per cent said they totally disagreed with re-opening the border at the end of July, allowing Americans back into the country.

Americans seem more eager both to head north and to welcome Canadians south; 50 per cent agreed the border should re-open and 36 per cent disagreed.

The potential for cross-border transmission of the virus has been a key factor in the decision to keep the border closed. Currently, rates of COVID-19 infection in the U.S. continue to climb, while in Canada the curve appears to be on a downward trajectory nearly everywhere.

Still, the survey suggests Canadians don't feel they are out of the woods. Thirty-nine per cent believe the worst is yet to come, while 35 per cent believe the worst of the crisis has passed.

In the U.S., 42 per cent of those surveyed felt the darkest days are ahead, 25 per cent believe the U.S. is in the middle of the worst part now while 21 per cent think that's already passed.

Responding to a spike in cases in Seattle, and the question of whether public demonstrations may have contributed to the uptick, Henry was asked whether any cases in B.C. have been traced to large anti-racism public protests that took place in Vancouver in June. She said it appears those large gatherings did not result in any spread of the virus.

""Currently, we do not have any cases that have been associated with the protests that took place,"" Henry said. ""In talking with my colleagues in the U.S., they also have not seen surges related to those activities.""

The fact the protests were held outside may be one of the factors that limited the potential spread of the virus.

Henry, health authorities and long term care operators have been working together to relax the restrictions on visitations in long term care homes. Given the recent spike in deaths, Henry was asked if that did not raise concerns about reintroducing the virus into care homes.

She conceded that, once the virus is in a care home, the potential for it to kill elderly people is high.

""The good news is that we have reduced the amount of transmission in our community so much so that we have very people in hospital,"" she said. ""We have very few people who are transmitting in our community, and that's why we feel we're at that balance where we need to allow more people to go into long-term care.""

The league and its union announced Monday the two sides have hammered out a tentative deal on the return-to-play protocol as well as a memorandum of understanding on a four-year extension of the current collective bargaining agreement.

article continues below

The NHL board of governors, the NHLPA's executive board and full membership must now ratify the documents, which are tied together, in three separate votes. If the proposals get the green light, training camps would begin July 13, with the 24 teams set to resume heading to the two Canadian hub cities on July 26. Competitive game action would then commence Aug. 1.

The league has yet to announce the two hubs for its return-to-play plan this summer, but Toronto and Edmonton are the destinations, a person with direct knowledge of the decision told The Associated Press.

The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because the league and the NHLPA have not released this information. The person said the league is in part being cautious and allowing itself flexibility in the event of potential spikes in COVID-19 infections in not yet determining which cities will host the conference finals and Stanley Cup final.

Hashed out in the shadow of unprecedented economic conditions brought on by COVID-19 — and viewed as crucial for a resumption of play — the proposed CBA would bring at least 14 consecutive years of NHL-NHLPA harmony after lockouts wiped out the 2004-05 season, and cut the 1994-95 and 2012-13 campaigns to 48 games.

While details of the CBA, which would last through the 2025-26 season, weren't made public Monday, it's believed the salary cap, escrow payments from players to owners, and Olympic participation all figure prominently. Escrow, which guarantees a 50-50 split of hockey-related revenues, was a thorny issue for players before the pandemic significantly impacted the league's bottom line when the schedule was suspended March 12.

Getting back to the Olympics has also been a priority for players. The NHL, which would still have to negotiate with the International Olympic Committee, skipped the 2018 Winter Games after participating in five straight between 1998 and 2014.

The league and players unveiled the 24-team format for a resumption of play in late May.

The plan to resuscitate the season calls for players to be segregated from the general population in tightly-controlled ""bubbles"" — games will be played without fans — in hopes of keeping the coronavirus at bay. The NHL, which will test everyone inside the bubble daily, has consistently maintained one or more positive results wouldn't necessarily derail the restart.

The NHL and the NHLPA outlined extensive health and safety measures for training camps and resumption of play Monday — referred to as Phase 3 and Phase 4, respectively, of its return-to-play plan — in two documents totalling 47 pages.

Teams will be allowed to bring 52 personnel, with no more than 31 players, to its hub. Every person in the bubble will be subject to daily testing, including players, staff, hotel workers, food service employees and bus drivers. Every team member/player inside the bubble will be expected to remain there except in specific extenuating circumstances, including medical attention, the birth of a child or a death in the family.

Anyone returning to the bubble will be subject to a minimum four-day quarantine with daily nasal swab tests for COVID-19.

While the league is encouraging physical distancing at all times, players won't be required to wear masks when exercising or on the ice. The same goes for coaches behind the bench and off-ice officials. Masks are required to be worn inside the bubble by any individual not in their hotel room.

The NHL and NHLPA have the ability to delay, postpone, move or cancel games in the event there's a ""risk to player health and safety"" and/or a chance that ""the integrity of the competition"" is in jeopardy, including ""an uncontrolled outbreak of COVID-19.""

There is not, however, any specifics as to what would constitute ""an uncontrolled outbreak.""

Individuals leaving the bubble without permission may be subject to consequences up to and including removal from Phase 4. Teams could also be hit with steep punishments, including fines and/or loss of draft choices.

Players are allowed to opt out of Phase 3 and Phase 4 without penalty, but have to notify their team this week.

Vancouver, Las Vegas, Chicago, Columbus, Dallas, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh and Minneapolis/St. Paul were the other cities originally in the running to be hubs.

The NHL is looking to restart its season with a blueprint that includes eight best-of-five qualifying round series before pivoting to the typical 16-team playoffs. It's hoped the Stanley Cup, which has been awarded all but twice since 1893, will be handed out sometime in the fall.

Las Vegas was viewed as a hub front-runner because its massive hotel complexes could be more-easily secured in a bubble scenario until a recent surge in COVID-19 cases across large swaths of the United States — the death toll there currently stands at more than 130,000 people — likely made the destination far less appealing.

But despite Monday's good news, there remain difficult waters to navigate.

The league and NHLPA will not quarantine players during training camp, but instead ask they stay home when not at the rink in hopes isolation and testing will be enough to avoid any outbreaks.

Of the 396 NHLers tested at team facilities between June 8 and July 6 during voluntary workouts as part of Phase 2 protocols, 23 results — in the neighbourhood of six per cent — came back positive. The league said it's also aware of 12 other positive tests for players not taking part in Phase 2.

The Tampa Bay Lightning closed their practice facility last month after three players and additional staff members tested positive for COVID-19. Of the 24 teams poised to resume play, 18 are located in the U.S., including current virus hot spots like Florida, Texas and Arizona.

Four clubs previously confirmed 10 positive tests in the spring, with five coming from the Ottawa Senators, three from the Colorado Avalanche, and one each from the Pittsburgh Penguins and Boston Bruins.

The ferry company announced July 3 that starting on July 10 two round trips would be added to the schedule on Fridays and Sundays – a 4:20 and 6:40 p.m. departure from Langdale and a 3:15 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. departure from Horseshoe Bay.

article continues below

BC Ferries is also adding more trips on other busy routes, including Horseshoe Bay-Nanaimo.

The addition of more sailings comes as local governments are calling for a return to a full summer schedule and travellers continue to voice frustration online.

In a lengthy post on her Facebook page July 3, Sechelt Mayor Darnleda Siegers asked residents upset with the current level of service, short-notice schedule changes, and problems rebooking reservations to “cut [BC Ferries] some slack.”

“Behind the glitches and the mistakes are humans just like you and I and they are trying as best they can,” she wrote.

But Siegers is also urging Coasters to lobby the province and the federal government for more financial support for BC Ferries.

“BC Ferries needs financial assistance from the provincial and federal government as they are using their capital funds, previously earmarked for the Langdale ferry upgrade and our second ship and other capital expenditures, to cover off their operating costs,” said Siegers.

Siegers also called the $180,000 the provincial government has already committed to keep sailings from being cut on minor routes, including Earls Cove-Saltery Bay, “a drop in the bucket.”

“There is some money earmarked for B.C. from the federal government that will be provided within the next while,” she said. “I’d like to see some of it go to BC Ferries.”

The money Siegers is referring to is part of a $14-billion “safe restart agreement” between Ottawa and the provinces.

West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast-Sea to Sky Country MP Patrick Weiler has also suggested that agreement could be the source of funding to backstop BC Ferries against the financial losses caused by the sudden drop in ridership in the early phase of the pandemic.

“I believe that one of the areas that they want to make sure that funding is going to go towards is transit, which has been very much hit hard by the pandemic similar to BC Ferries, which could also be an option for that funding,” Weiler said during a June 23 update for the Sechelt and District Chamber of Commerce.

In response to Coast Reporter’s inquiry to the premier’s office about the status of the discussions on the safe restart agreement and whether some of the money would be used to support a return to normal service levels on BC Ferries, officials with the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure replied that the government is “pleased to see the federal government agreeing to provide much-needed support for a variety of important provincial issues.”

“However, the number and size of programs that have been included in this list is substantial,” the email from the ministry continued. “So we look forward to seeing the details to make sure it can adequately support our recovery efforts.”

On the specific issue of BC Ferries the ministry said, “We know ferries are vital for maintaining the critical supply chain for food, goods and medicine, and for people who live and work on our coast, and continue to work with the federal government on solutions.”",[]

“We’re looking forward to it,” said library director Heather Evans-Cullen an hour before Monday’s official 10 a.m. opening. “If I could have a ribbon cutting or slab cake, I would.”

article continues below

At least five people had already arrived before opening hours, she said. Hours of operation are now Monday to Saturday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.

Doors may finally be open again but operations are far from normal. For the first two weeks, a maximum of 20 patrons will be allowed inside at any given time, “to make sure we can maintain distancing,” said Evans-Cullen.

The layout has been modified and Plexiglas installed to maintain physical barriers, returned books are quarantined for 72 hours and staff wear face shields.

The library has been closed to the public since March, when public health restrictions due to COVID-19 took effect. In late May it began offering curbside pickup and drop-off services on site, but patrons weren’t able to enter the building.

The curbside “takeout” book service is still being offered and access to digital media “contactless services” such as audiobooks, ebooks and databases, remains available.

About 65 per cent of the Town of Gibsons residents are patrons of the library, far higher than the provincial average, said Evans-Cullen. “I think it’s a special relationship this community has with this library.” With the opening, “they’re coming back home a little bit.”

And with the opening, two other important services will now be available to the public: computers and washroom facilities. “Our washrooms will be open. That’s been a huge limitation for people who may be homeless or not have sustainable housing,” said Evans-Cullen, adding that washroom access was something B.C. provincial health officer Bonnie Henry had asked libraries to provide, if possible.

Takeout delivery remains in place at the Sechelt Public Library. Interim library director Leianne Emery anticipates opening the doors to the public to browse shelves by the start of August, but an exact date will depend on a potential building envelope project, “which will affect the library interior,” she said in an email.

In the meantime, three major interior construction projects are underway and protective glass is being installed. Those projects should be completed by July 20, at which point the library will begin adding limited public computer access and in-person tech help to the other services it is already providing, including offering materials for “takeout,” providing online and phone tech help, exam invigilation, photocopying and faxing services and reciprocal borrowing between Sechelt and Gibsons libraries.

The Sechelt library is aiming to have outdoor “under the tent programming” up and running for small groups within the next couple of weeks. And children can pick up their reading logs at either the Gibsons or Sechelt library for the Summer Reading Club.

The Roberts Creek Community Library has been open to the public since June 19 but with modified hours.

In July, the library is open Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., Sundays from noon to 2 p.m., Tuesdays from 2 p.m. to 8 p.m. and Wednesdays from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. Safety conditions apply and instructions are available at the library’s entrance. Only one patron and child are allowed inside the building at a time.

A return to in-person services kicked off quietly at the Pender Harbour Reading Centre on July 2, according to board chair Karen Dyck. It is now open Tuesdays through Saturdays from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. and will be fully staffed with volunteers until the end of August. As with the Roberts Creek library, only one person is allowed inside at a time with some exceptions for children. Masks are required for borrowers and volunteers. And because people have been dropping off materials throughout the COVID-19 epidemic, “we have lots of books on the shelf,” said Dyck.

Over the course of the pandemic, no orders have been issued by the provincial health officer requiring libraries to close.

A May 7 letter from Vancouver Coastal Health’s (VCH) deputy chief medical health officer Mark Lysyshyn stated that VCH “believes that the risk of COVID-19 transmission in these environments can be mitigated and consistent with B.C.’s Restart Plan, that it is possible to safely operate these facilities at this time.”

Representatives from Teamsters Canada, the United Food and Commercial Workers Union Canada and Unifor point to the dozens of retail and warehouse workers who remain sickened with COVID-19 and a report Monday from CTV News in Windsor, Ont. that two workers had just tested positive in the border city.

article continues below

Some of those previously sickened have returned to work. A few workers have died from the novel coronavirus disease.

Speaking to a House of Commons committee Monday, the union leaders recommended stricter labour standards and oversight for the sector, beyond getting to the bottom of why the pay premium was abruptly rolled back by some of the largest grocery chains.

Unifor national president Jerry Dias said the fact two more workers now have COVID-19 ""is probably proof positive"" that the pandemic premium for hourly workers shouldn't have disappeared.

When the pandemic struck Canada in March, major grocery chains said they would boost front-line workers' wages on average about $2 per hour.

But late last month, one after another, the chains announced they were ending the pandemic pay bump because the pace of business had eased, giving the unions short notice about the decision.

MPs on the industry committee agreed to look into the matter and will have a chance to question retail executives at the end of the week.

""Look, the argument is nonsense and every one of us on this panel understands that and I will argue they understand that as well,"" Dias said, referring to grocery-chain executives.

""So this had nothing to do with somehow the pandemic, 'Oh we're seeing a pot at the end of the rainbow,' this was a decision made about money.""

Paul Meinema, national president of the food workers' union, said the federal government should play a more active role in boosting wages for workers in the sector.

Grocery stores were among the businesses governments deemed essential services that didn't have to close as public health restrictions forced companies to cut operations to slow the spread of COVID-19.

The pandemic pay was supposed to recognize that workers were being asked to come in to help feed a population ordered to stay home. Conservative MP Michelle Rempel Garner said she wanted to determine how to properly compensate workers who are being put in that situation.

Spending on things like gasoline and travel fell but spending on groceries has gone up — one of the few areas of the economy where things appeared positive during the lockdowns of April and May.

NDP MP Brian Masse, who represents a riding in Windsor, Ont., said the industry needs more oversight, calling the committee probe ""the first dive at this.""

The byelection is expected to fill the seat of Nick Volkow, an eight-term councillor who recently died of brain cancer. According to provincial laws, a byelection is required to fill a vacancy that opens up prior to an election year.

To kick off the byelection, the city is supposed to appoint a chief election officer, but city staff is recommending that be put off for now, citing concerns around COVID-19. For instance, strict rules on large congregations of people could put a chill on voter turnout, while lifting those rules would create a potential hazard for voters.

According to a staff report to council, the Ministry of Municipal Affairs has deferred byelections in Victoria, Rossland and Lytton, as well as a referendum in Kamloops, to protect residents from COVID-19.

The staff report noted city clerk Kate O’Connell reached out to the ministry to ask about guidelines for votes held during the pandemic. In response, the ministry indicated it was in the process of developing those guidelines and recommended the byelection be deferred.

Staff passed that recommendation on to council ahead of Monday evening’s regular meeting, saying it is “not practicable” to hold a byelection without the guidelines.

The election guidelines are being developed by Elections BC, the Ministry of Municipal Affairs, the Local Government Management Association and the Union of B.C. Municipalities, according to the staff report, and development is still in early stages. Staff noted there is still no clear timeline for when those guidelines are expected to be completed.

Options to do so are now on the table as members of Parliament and hundreds of behind-the-scenes staff begin to plan for what their headquarters could look like come fall, to the extent they can.

article continues below

""Is it better to meet in person or virtually come September?"" House of Commons Speaker Anthony Rota said to the procedure and house affairs committee Monday.

""COVID has been changing so drastically along the way it's very difficult to predict what will happen in a month and a half or two months from now.""

But in the meantime, a mobile app could be deployed to allow MPs to vote whether they're on Parliament Hill or off, Rota said.

The app is fully bilingual, meets accessibility standards, and is secure, including providing administrators the ability to know where MPs are when they vote and authenticate their identities.

""The proposed approach for an electronic voting system respects several key principles,"" Rota said.

Finding a way for MPs to vote while limiting the risk of COVID-19 transmission has been a sticking point for the Liberal government as it has faced pressure from the Opposition Conservatives to allow for the full resumption of Parliament.

MPs have grappled with how they can do their jobs ever since Parliament, like much of the rest of the country, shut down in mid-March to slow the spread of COVID-19.

Several compromises have been reached along the way, including a hybrid model that allows MPs to participate in person or virtually in debates or committee meetings.

Those debates and meetings have been limited in scope and the Opposition Conservatives have pressed for a full return to business that would expand the powers MPs have available to press the government and get more information.

Right now, Parliament is expected to resume sitting full-time on Sept. 21, though there is a single sitting day scheduled for this week.

Summer sitting days were among the concessions opposition parties won as they've fought for greater accountability.

The virtual voting plan is best to be rolled out come fall, Rota said, citing the time needed to get the right system in place.

In addition to an app, he's presented MPs with the option of a video-conferencing approach that would piggyback on the hybrid arrangement in place now.

Rota's report, however, raised several concerns with that, including unstable internet connections, the amount of time it would take, and the sensitive issue of MPs not being present to vote.

A video-conferencing approach would need to name each MP in turn to double-check an MP isn't on mute or having trouble with the connection.

""The absence of members would be highlighted to the public, to the media and to other members of the House, contrary to current practice,"" the report said.

Conservative MPs have come under scrutiny in recent weeks for their absence from the current special COVID-19 committee of MPs that replaced the normal House of Commons sitting.

Unlike in regular sittings, for the committee it is possible to see exactly who attended, and tallies have suggested many Tories haven't shown up regularly.

When it comes to virtual voting, the Conservatives have largely opposed the approach, citing a resistance to anything that keeps MPs off the Hill.

They argue it is possible to adjust regular procedures to allow for physical distancing, and had asked for a look at how voting could take place in person.

Pandemic-safe options could include lining up outside the Commons chamber to vote, voting in shifts or voting by proxy, Rota's analysis suggested.

Among the issues in-person voting raises is the question of time and resources needed to keep the chamber clean as well as how long the votes themselves would take.

The MPs are aiming to have their recommendations in place later this month.

The league says 23 of 396 players checked for COVID-19 at team facilities have tested positive since voluntary Phase 2 workouts began June 8 — a rate of just under six per cent. In that same time period, the NHL added it is aware of 12 additional positive test results.

article continues below

That's an increase of eight players in Phase 2, and one from outside the NHL's testing system, over the last week.

The NHL says it has administered more than 2,900 tests at team facilities.

Ten additional players were confirmed to have tested positive in the spring — five from the Ottawa Senators, three from the Colorado Avalanche and one each from the Pittsburgh Penguins and Boston Bruins. That brings the total number of NHLers with confirmed positive tests to 45 since the schedule was suspended in mid-March.

The league is no longer providing details on the players or clubs with positive tests. There was no word on the health status of the 35 players in question, including whether or not they experienced symptoms or have recovered.

""All players who have tested positive have been self-isolated and are following (government) protocols,"" the NHL said in a statement released on Twitter.

The league and NHL Players' Association on Sunday night agreed on protocols to start training camps and resume the season. That includes daily testing once games get under way for players, coaches and staff.

Resuming is contingent on each side approving an extension of the collective bargaining agreement and the return-to-play protocol.

The central bank's business outlook survey suggested about half of firms foresee a rebound in their sales within the next year as COVID-19's effects recede, but the expectations of a return to pre-pandemic levels often depend on lifting government-mandated restrictions.

article continues below

The survey report published Monday suggests many service-sector and energy companies don't expect a return to pre-pandemic employment levels.

The worry among workers about losing their jobs rose to the highest level seen in the bank's regular survey of consumer expectations, released alongside the business outlook report.

Workers' expectations of how easily they could find new work dropped to the lowest level in the survey since the 2015 oil-price shock as the country faces a different and far deeper economic crisis.

Lockdowns and stay-at-home requests from governments put the economy in a deep freeze in mid-March, with the thaw beginning in recent weeks as restrictions began to be rolled back.

Nearly half of all businesses reported an outright decline of their sales in the past 12 months because of COVID-19, low energy prices and the uncertainty both wrought.

More than half of businesses expect their total sales over the next 12 months to be lower than they were in the last year, with future sales indicators at record lows.

About half of firms expect their sales will ""mostly recover"" within the next year as COVID-19's effects recede, but the expectations of a return to pre-pandemic levels often depend on lifting government-mandated restrictions. Some companies said they could get back to normal operations within a month of public health restrictions being lifted.

""Overall, while the economy is on the mend, it's still early days and both businesses and consumers will continue to grapple with uncertainty over the foreseeable future,"" TD economist Ksenia Bushmeneva said in a note.

""This will manifest in lower spending by households and weak investment plans by businesses, both of which will weigh on the pace of economic recovery.""

Consumers' expectations for wage growth were below what they anticipated for inflation, while the outlook for growth in household income dropped to its lowest level in the survey's history.

The consumer survey said spending expectations have tumbled, which the bank says suggests consumers have become more cautious due to the economic impact and health risks related to the pandemic.

The bank said consumers expect to spend mostly on essentials and less on durable goods like cars and furniture, as well services that involve face-to-face interactions like eating out, travel or going to the movies.

A Royal Bank report Monday estimated the drop in economic output and sharp rise in spending could put the federal deficit at $265 billion this fiscal year.

The report said deficits could be close to double those the Liberals predicted just over six months ago as revenues drop — not including an expected need to spend more to help the economy recover.

""If they needed to extend some of the (aid) programs to ensure that the economy wasn't going to be ... more meaningfully impacted, they're in the fiscal position to do so,"" said RBC economist Colin Guldimann, who co-wrote the report.

""Of course, there is a position when some spending becomes too much spending and it's really hard to know where that is.""

Federal spending on fighting the pandemic and its effects, by the government's most recent figures, amounts to about $174 billion.

About one-third of service and energy companies told the Bank of Canada they have tapped a federal wage subsidy to reduce or avoid layoffs. Other firms looking to rehire or hire new staff cited an emergency federal benefit for workers as a hurdle to their plans.

The latest figures from the federal government show the $45-billion wage subsidy program has paid nearly $17.1 billion to 245,160 companies as of June 29. Meanwhile, the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, or CERB, has paid $53.53 billion in benefits to 8.16 million people as of June 28, since it was introduced in late March.

David Macdonald, senior economist at the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, argued in a research note Monday that the Liberals shouldn't make deep cuts to their aid measures.

He calculated that households will have a surplus in their budgets by $202.9 billion due to Ottawa's deficit spending, while corporations would see a surplus to the tune of $37.1 billion.

""As federal deficits can create surpluses in other areas, the opposite is also true,"" Macdonald wrote. ""Federal surpluses, through cutbacks and austerity, must force another sector into deficit by the same amount.""

We have seen countless televised messages from elected politicians, as well as heated discussions about the proper use of masks. As we enter a very different summer, Research Co. and Glacier Media tracked the views of Canadians on political and behavioural matters.

The one consistent finding throughout the pandemic has been the high level of satisfaction that Canadians express toward the federal government. In our latest survey, 70% of Canadians are happy with how Ottawa has dealt with the COVID-19 outbreak, practically unchanged since we last asked in May (69%).

The rating for provincial governments and municipal governments improved as more Canadians were able to leave the isolation pod. Three in four Canadians (75%, up 11 points since May) are satisfied with their provincial administration, and seven in 10 (70%) feel the same way about their local government.

The big jump for provincial governments was not uniform across the country. In Atlantic Canada and British Columbia, satisfaction reaches 86% and 83%, with positive perceptions increasing by 19 points and 14 points, respectively.

Two other areas experienced double digit rises in satisfaction: Saskatchewan and Manitoba (78%, up 19 points) and Ontario (76%, up 23 points). The lowest ratings are observed in Quebec (69%, up three points) and Alberta (62%, up six points). Quebec had the highest level of satisfaction when we started asking this question in March; Alberta has consistently been at the bottom.

On the behavioural side of things, there are some remarkable changes in the way Canadians are approaching the pandemic. Time and reassurance have made many residents feel safer about take-out and delivery. In April, 40% of Canadians said they were not ordering food because they feared infection. The proportion has dropped to 23%, in what will surely be welcome news to an industry that has been greatly affected by the pandemic.

Three in 10 Canadians admit to overeating, unchanged since April. There is an increase in consumption of alcohol at home (18%, up five points) and a steadier curve on losing our tempers more often (16%, down two points).

Throughout the pandemic, the gender gap on some questions related to safe practices has been staggering. This time, it is evident on two questions. Fewer Canadians (40%, down seven points) are cleaning the groceries they buy to prevent infection. While only 36% of men are sanitizing the provisions they buy, the proportion jumps to 44% among women.

Still, the biggest behavioural change is on our faces. Back in April, only 14% of Canadians said they wore a protective mask every time they went out. This time, practically half of Canadians (48%) are not leaving home without them. Regionally, Ontarians are leading the way in wearing masks (63%), followed by Albertans at 51%. The proportion is slightly lower in Quebec and British Columbia (each at 48%).

Again, women are being more meticulous. Most female respondents (57%) say they are wearing masks outside, while only 39% of male respondents report the same behaviour. There is also a generational gap, with more than half of Canadians aged 18 to 34 (55%) always bringing their masks, compared with 46% for those aged 35 to 54 and 44% among those aged 55 and over.

Mask or no mask, Canadians appear resigned to staying close to home and avoiding big crowds. Only 11% of Canadians expect to be able to travel abroad before the end of September, while a similar proportion (12%) believe they will be able to go to a live sporting event. There is slightly more hope about attending or hosting a large social gathering at some point before Labour Day (21%).

More than a third of Canadians think the calendar will hit December before they take a trip abroad (39%), witness a live sporting event (35%) or go to a large party (also 35%). In a sign of the difficulty of issuing any kind of forecast during the pandemic, the proportion of undecided respondents is high on all three options.

Even the seemingly simple task of shaking the hand of a person who is not at our home appears distant, with 20% of Canadians expecting to do this before September, and 29% foreseeing it perhaps as a Christmas miracle. In addition, three in four Canadians (75%) say they will “definitely” or “probably” take a vaccine against COVID-19 is one ultimately becomes available, up two points since April.

Even if the future seems bleak, Canadians are more optimistic now. In March, only 22% were willing to say that the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic was “behind us.” The proportion barely moved to 24% in May, but reached 49% at the end of June. Oddly enough, Quebecers (57%) and Ontarians (49%) are more enthusiastic about the corner being turned than those in two large provinces that have fewer COVID-19 cases: Alberta (44%) and British Columbia (39%). •

Think you might have symptoms? Take a self-assessment

On this page

Symptoms of COVID-19

Symptoms of COVID-19 can vary from person to person. Symptoms may also vary in different age groups. Some of the more commonly reported symptoms include:

new or worsening cough

shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

temperature equal to or over 38°C

feeling feverish

chills

fatigue or weakness

muscle or body aches

new loss of smell or taste

headache

gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting)

feeling very unwell



Children have been more commonly reported to have abdominal symptoms, and skin changes or rashes.

In severe cases, infection can lead to death.

Symptoms may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to COVID-19.

Recent evidence indicates that the virus can be transmitted to others from someone who is infected but not showing symptoms. This includes people who:

have not yet developed symptoms (pre-symptomatic)

never develop symptoms (asymptomatic)

While experts know that these kinds of transmissions are happening among those in close contact or in close physical settings, it is not known to what extent. This means it is extremely important to follow the proven preventative measures.

If you or your child become ill

If you are showing symptoms of COVID-19, reduce your contact with others:

isolate yourself at home for 14 days to avoid spreading it to others if you live with others, stay in a separate room or keep a 2-metre distance

visit a health care professional or call your local public health authority call ahead to tell them your symptoms and follow their instructions



Children who have mild COVID-19 symptoms are able to stay at home with a caregiver throughout their recovery without needing hospitalization. If you are caring for a child who has suspected or probable COVID-19, it is important to follow the advice for caregivers. This advice will help you protect yourself, others in your home, as well as others in the community.

If you become sick while travelling back to Canada:

inform the flight attendant or a Canadian border services officer

advise a Canada border services agent on arrival in Canada if you believe you were exposed to someone who was sick with COVID-19, even if you do not have symptoms this is required under the Quarantine Act the Canada border services agent will provide instructions for you to follow



Check if you have been exposed

Have you been on a recent flight, cruise, train, or at a public gathering? Check the listed exposure locations to see if you may have been exposed to COVID-19.

Take care of your mental health

The COVID-19 pandemic is new and unexpected. This situation can be unsettling and can cause a sense of loss of control. It is normal to feel sad, stressed, confused, scared or worried in a crisis. Make sure to care for your mental and physical wellbeing and to ask for help if you feel overwhelmed.

Diagnosing coronavirus

Coronavirus infections are diagnosed by a health care provider based on symptoms and are confirmed through laboratory tests.

Treating coronavirus

Most people with mild coronavirus illness will recover on their own.

If you are concerned about your symptoms, you should self-monitor and consult your health care provider. They may recommend steps you can take to relieve symptoms.

Vaccine, therapeutics and medical devices

At this time, a vaccine and therapies to treat or prevent this disease have not yet been identified. But research and development are underway. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a global review of therapies that may be used to treat or prevent the disease.

Health Canada is fast tracking the importation and sale of medical devices for use in relation to COVID-19.

Flu vaccine

If you have received a flu vaccine, it will not protect against coronaviruses, but will help prevent the flu. Getting the flu could make you more vulnerable to other infections.

Getting the flu vaccine will not increase your risk of illness from coronavirus. For more information, please refer to this recently published Canadian research study.

About coronaviruses

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people and others cause illness in animals. Human coronaviruses are common and are typically associated with mild illnesses, similar to the common cold.

COVID-19 is a new disease that has not been previously identified in humans. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people, and more rarely, these can then spread from person to person through close contact.

There have been 2 other specific coronaviruses that have spread from animals to humans and which have caused severe illness in humans. These are the:",[]

Limit contact

Only one healthy person should provide care.

Do not share personal items with the ill person, such as toothbrushes, towels, bed linen, utensils or electronic devices.

Use a separate bathroom from the ill person, if possible. If not possible, the ill person should put the toilet lid down before flushing.

Some people may transmit COVID-19 even though they do not show any symptoms. Wearing a mask, including a non-medical mask or face covering (i.e. made with at least two layers of tightly woven fabric, constructed to completely cover the nose and mouth without gaping, and secured to the head by ties or ear loops) can help protect others around you.

Prevent contact with animals, as there have been several reports of people transmitting COVID-19 to their pets.

Protect yourself

If possible, people who are at higher risk of serious illness from COVID-19 should not care for someone with COVID-19. These people include elderly persons, those with chronic medical conditions (e.g. heart disease, diabetes) or compromised immune systems.

If you need to be within 2 metres of the ill person, wear personal protective equipment: a medical mask disposable gloves eye protection

Wear disposable gloves when touching the ill person, their environment and soiled items or surfaces.

Avoid re-using medical masks or gloves.

Clean your hands often for at least 20 seconds, especially after contact with the ill person and after removing gloves, face masks and eye protection.

Dry your hands with disposable paper towels. If not available, use a reusable towel and replace it when it becomes wet.

You can also remove dirt with a wet wipe and then use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.

Wearing masks Medical masks are recommended for COVID-19 patients in the home and for protection for those providing direct care to COVID-19 patients at home.

N95 respirators must be reserved for healthcare workers and should not be used for caregiving at home.

If medical masks are not available, non-medical masks or face coverings (i.e. constructed to completely cover the nose and mouth without gaping, and secured to the head by ties or ear loops) can be worn by the ill person, if tolerable. This will cover their mouth and nose, and may prevent respiratory droplets from contaminating others or landing on surfaces.

A non-medical mask or face covering may also be worn by those providing direct care to COVID-19 patients at home. However, wearing a non-medical mask or facial covering in the community has not been proven to protect the person wearing it.

Strict hygiene and public health measures, including frequent hand washing and maintaining a physical distance of at least 2 metres from the ill person, will reduce the chance of being exposed to the virus.

Non-medical cloth masks should be carefully removed when soiled or damp, laundered in hot water and then dried thoroughly.

Hands must be cleaned before and after putting on and removing a mask.

Keep your environment clean

Place used medical masks, gloves and other contaminated items in a lined container, secure the contents and dispose of them with other household waste.

Place possibly contaminated laundry, including non-medical cloth masks and facial coverings, into a container with a plastic liner and do not shake. Wash with regular laundry soap and hot water (60-90°C), and dry well. Clothing, linens and non-medical cloth masks and facial coverings belonging to the ill person can be washed with other laundry.

At least once daily, clean and disinfect surfaces that people touch often, such as toilets, laundry containers, bedside tables, doorknobs, phones and television remotes.

Use only approved hard-surface disinfectants that have a Drug Identification Number (DIN). A DIN is an 8-digit number given by Health Canada that confirms the disinfectant product is approved and safe for use in Canada.

When approved hard surface disinfectants are not available, for household disinfection, a diluted bleach solution can be prepared in accordance with the instructions on the label, or in a ratio of 5 millilitres (mL) of bleach per 250 mL of water OR 20 mL of bleach per litre of water. This ratio is based on bleach containing 5% sodium hypochlorite, to give a 0.1% sodium hypochlorite solution. Follow instructions for proper handling of household (chlorine) bleach.

If they can withstand the use of liquids for disinfection, high-touch electronic devices (e.g. keyboards, tablets, smartboards) may be disinfected with 70% alcohol (e.g. alcohol prep wipes) at least daily.

Monitor yourself for symptoms

If you have always used the recommended precautions, then monitor yourself for symptoms for 14 days following your last close contact with the ill person.

Quarantine (self-isolate) at home for 14 days from your last exposure and contact your local public health authority if you have no symptoms but: cared for a person who has COVID-19 without the recommended personal protective equipment live with or had close physical contact (e.g. intimate partner) without using the recommended personal protective equipment live with or have had regular close contact (within 2 metres) with a person who has COVID-19 up to 48 hours prior to symptom onset or while they were symptomatic and not isolating had direct contact with the body fluids of a person who has COVID-19 (e.g. were coughed or sneezed on) without the recommended personal protective equipment



If you start to develop symptoms, isolate yourself as quickly as possible and contact your local public health authority for further instructions.

Maintain these supplies

Medical masks if available, or non-medical mask or face covering

Eye protection (face shield or goggles) for use by caregiver

Disposable gloves (do not re-use) for use by caregiver

Disposable paper towels

Tissues

Waste container with plastic liner

Thermometer

Over the counter medication to reduce fever (e.g. ibuprofen or acetaminophen)

Running water

On Tuesday July 14, 2020, Dr. Bonnie Henry, Provincial Health Officer and Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, announced 13 new cases of COVID-19 in the province for a total of 3,128 cases in British Columbia. Of the total COVID-19 cases, 14 individuals are hospitalized, five of whom are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation. Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 1,015 cases of COVID-19 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region. There are no new community outbreaks, but there have been several exposure events particularly in the Kelowna area. These occurred when a group of people from different areas including the Okanagan, lower mainland and Alberta got together. To date, 17 of these individuals have tested positive for COVID-19. Dr. Henry says as people become more active and travel, we will see more cases. Public health teams are actively working to manage cases and clusters as they emerge and keep new cases low and slow. Of note, the first incubation period since Canada Day is now complete.



Economic and fiscal update for 2020-21

The British Columbia government is forecasting a $12.5 billion deficit due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The provincial budget for 2020, tabled just months before the global pandemic, predicted a budget surplus of $227 million for 2020-21. Carole James, Minister of Finance, says the pandemic has exposed underlying gaps in our economy and society, and reminded us of the need for strong public services and supports. Government has supported people and businesses with $6.26 billion in COVID-19 supports to date. That includes the $5 billion in supplementary spending for B.C.’s COVID-19 Action Plan supports, such as workers benefits, rent supplements, income and disability assistance supports and economic recovery funding. These are in addition to $1.26 billion in other tax and relief measures for people and businesses, including the one-time increase to the climate action tax credit and property tax reductions for businesses.

Warning about calls appearing to come from Squamish General Hospital



Vancouver Coastal Health is warning the public not to provide personal information over the phone if they receive an unexpected call that appears to come from Squamish General Hospital. Someone claiming to be a hospital employee is calling people and asking for their full names, social insurance number and date of birth. This is in no way associated with Vancouver Coastal Health, and appears to be a phishing scam, where people are tricked into providing personal information that can be used fraudulently. RCMP have been advised.



Testing

Anyone in the VCH region with cold, influenza or COVID-19-like symptoms, however mild, can now be assessed for and get a COVID-19 test. Contact your physician or nurse practitioner's office, or a local community collection centre to arrange for a test. Phone numbers and locations of collection centre can be found by visiting: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/testing or by calling 8-1-1. In Vancouver, the City Centre and REACH urgent and primary care centres can provide testing as well as the St. Vincent's drive-up location at 4875 Heather Street. The Richmond Assessment Centre is located at 6820 Gilbert Road, in the parking lot of the Richmond Tennis Club. On the North Shore, testing is available at the North Vancouver Urgent and Primary Care Centre. If you think you need testing, please call ahead before visiting your doctor, urgent and primary care center or health clinic.



VCH Medical Health Officers, our provincial partners and the Public Health Agency of Canada continue to actively monitor the COVID-19 pandemic. To protect yourself while out in public, wash your hands frequently and maintain social distance. For more information on COVID-19, please visit www.vch.ca/COVID19.

Thankfully, Vancouver Phoenix Gymnastics gives kids with special needs and disabilities the perfect place to learn and play.

The Therapeutic Gymnastics Program offers two types of programming for children with special needs - one-on-one coaching within the recreational program classes, and private lessons.

article continues below

“We always have an assessment process before any kids come into the program” says Alyssa Quattrociocchi, the Special Needs Lead Coach. “And that gives me a good idea of whether one-on-one support within a class, or private lessons would be optimal.”

The placement depends not only on the abilities of the child but also what the goals for the child are, Quattrociocchi explains – whether the focus is socialization and interaction with other children, or developing gross motor skills, improving physical literacy, etc. Students can also combine the two options – join a class with a one-on-one coach one day, and have a private lesson later in the week.

The program, which started more than a decade ago, provides opportunities for children ages three to 18 with a range of diagnoses, including ADD/ADHD, Autism Spectrum Disorder, developmental delay, Cerebral Palsy, paralysis and more. Some have been with the program for more than 10 years, according to Quattrociocchi.

Highlighted by Quattrociocchi is the transition from private lessons to supported participation in a group class. There are many challenges to joining a class, she says, and for those with a goal of improvements in socialization, this is an exciting accomplishment.

“The progressions that we have seen,” Quattrociocchi says, “in children who were initially too overloaded with sensory information to even enter the gym, to being able to participate in a class with other children is a truly rewarding transition to be a part of.”

The gym itself can be challenging for some children, and it can take awhile to adjust, she adds. “Our gym is very big, bright, and there can be lots of children, staff and coaches around,” she explains. “This is an overwhelming environment for anyone, particularly children with diagnoses that make this challenging.”

Vancouver Phoenix Gymnastics prides itself on how safe and welcomed the children feel by the coaches, Quattrociocchi says.

“We had one [student in our program] who said Vancouver Phoenix Gymnastics is the one place where he feels comfortable to be himself,” she says.

357,vancourier,https://www.vancourier.com/standout/why-lab-grown-diamonds-are-changing-tradition-1.23984854,Why lab-grown diamonds are changing tradition,[],,"Ask Suman Bakshi, a diamond expert and founder of Vancouver’s Lux Jewels, what business she is in, and you might be surprised at her answer.

“I’m in the business of people; my product just happens to be jewelry,” Bakshi says. “I guide my clients in making the best choice for them by learning their needs and wants, and building lasting relationships.”

article continues below

It’s that commitment to developing trust, combined with her integrity and transparency in an industry that is inherently not, which sets Bakshi apart from others.

She has more than 13 years experience sourcing and selling mined diamonds and she’s been selling lab-grown diamonds for more than three years. This year, nine out of 10 engagement rings Bakshi sold have been lab-grown diamonds.

Unlike mined diamonds, which were formed around 150-200km below the earth’s crust billions of years ago, lab-grown diamonds are created by man. Typically, they’re created in the lab using high-pressure and high-temperature to form a diamond crystal, but they can also be “grown” from a seed of a diamond crystal by adding layers through chemical vapour deposition. Lab-created diamonds are real diamonds, not synthetic.

“The Canadian jewelry industry has been slow to accept and embrace lab-grown diamonds,” Bakshi says. “I am an early adopter because my focus is the customer. I’ve always wanted to give people a choice that aligns with their values.”

Bakshi says that she educates her clients because she knows “buying diamonds can be a stressful experience” and that people are worried about being deceived and paying an inflated price.

While lab-grown diamonds have created a disruption to the industry, the 4Cs—cut, colour, clarity and carat—are still the main criteria to keep in mind when shopping.

Not all lab-grown diamonds are the same and not all jewelers will know or disclose information, even if they do know it. Plus, it is not a requirement to list all information on lab-created diamond certification.

“Lab-grown diamonds cost 30-50 per cent less than mined diamonds and they are definitely a better value, but if it seems too good to be true, then it probably is,” Bakshi says.

“I educate my clients on what to look for when shopping for a diamond, man-made or otherwise,” Bakshi adds. “I don’t keep an inventory, as everyone has their own needs and wants. Everything is custom-made specifically for the customer.”

The demand for lab-grown diamonds is driven by millennials as they tend to be responsible shoppers who generally prefer environmentally sustainable options.

“Because of these reasons, interest in man-made diamonds has grown organically without much advertising or marketing from any major player in the industry,” Bakshi says.

Created diamonds are also less expensive than mined diamonds, and that gives millennials the chance to buy bigger diamonds for less.

“Let’s face it, sometimes size matters,” Bakshi says with a laugh.

As for whether she would choose a mined or lab-grown diamond for her own engagement ring, that’s an easy answer: “I’m a big fan of lab-grown diamonds and when the right guy comes along, I’ll let him know.”

“Most women simply don’t talk about it. It is a taboo topic and I am on a mission to change that,” says Vopni, owner of Pelvienne Wellness, an online business that offers pelvic health programs for women in pregnancy, motherhood and menopause.

article continues below

“So many women suffer in silence and accept pelvic floor challenges as ‘normal’ after childbirth or as they age,” she says. “Incontinence is very treatable and I want women to know they can live a leak-free life.”

Vopni first realized how many women were struggling with incontinence when she became pregnant 15 years ago. As she researched how to avoid it, she realized there was a lack of education and awareness about proactive and restorative strategies for the pelvic floor.

“Pads, drugs and surgery seem to be the most known options but they are not solutions; they simply address the symptoms and don’t address the cause,” she says, adding one of her recent participants has finally ditched the pads after using them for 10 years.

Evidence suggests that about 30 per cent of women suffer from incontinence and approximately 50 per cent have some degree of organ prolapse.

“Organ prolapse occurs when the bladder, uterus, or rectum move out of their optimal position and bulge or descend into the vagina,” Vopni says. “This can create discomfort, painful sex, difficulty voiding and is a huge blow to a woman’s confidence. It affects so many aspects of a woman’s life yet most have never heard of the condition until they find out they have it.”

Vopni uses exercise, lifestyle coaching and education to improve women’s lives by giving them the knowledge and the power to take back control of their pelvic health.

Her 28-day pelvic floor fitness challenge—Kegel Mojo—is delivered via a specially-designed app that reminds women to do their pelvic floor exercises, gives them the daily workout and involves gamification that has users collecting points as they complete each step. Points are redeemed for bonus education, giveaways and coaching.

The program runs bi-monthly and is designed for women looking to prevent, reduce or eliminate symptoms such as back pain, incontinence and prolapse. By day 15, she says many of her clients report a reduction or elimination of their symptoms.

“Exercises to strengthen the pelvic floor are so important in pregnancy, postpartum and as we age,” Vopni says. “Typically women are told ‘go home and do your kegels’ but they do not receive any instruction on how to do them properly.”

In order for kegels to work, they need to be done correctly, they must be done consistently and they need to be co-ordinated with movement, which Vopni says is the biggest missing link.



Using her experience as a physical trainer, her training as a doula and her work with a uro-gynecologist, Vopni brings a well-rounded approach to her work and has many tools in her toolbox.

“My clients get personalized treatment, through online coaching and video-conferencing and daily coaching in the app. They’re blown away by how life-changing it truly is,” she says.

The Memorial Society is a non-profit organization registered under the Societies Act of B.C. and is the only member-based, volunteer-driven memorial society in B.C.

""Everybody should be a member of the Society,"" Nicole says. ""Everybody alive will pass away at some point and for a $40 one-time membership fee, we can take the burden off your loved ones by referring them to a designated funeral service provider for the disposition of your remains and related issues.""

Upon joining the Society, members are asked to complete an arrangement form stating their wishes for their remains and detailing any pre-paid arrangements they may have.

""People need to have this conversation with their children,"" Nicole says, ""It's not a pleasant topic for most people and you don't need to dwell on it, but it's a conversation that must be had.""

Community Day presented by RBC Royal Bank is going to be held at the main campus on West 49th Avenue and is the perfect event to kick off a beautiful Vancouver summer. Starting at 11 am on June 15th and wrapping up at 5 pm, the day promises to be packed full of community members and happy Langarans of past, present, and future. Everyone is encouraged to visit the website and RSVP to the event and get the chance to win a holiday weekend in Victoria, including hotel, transportation, and more.

This year marks the 49th year that the college has been offering courses at its campus on 49th avenue. To mark this special occasion, Moira Gookstetter, the Executive Director of the Langara College Foundation, says that Langara College is inviting the entire community to take part in the special day of celebrations.

Local Canadian rock legends 54-40 will headline the free all-ages concert, supported by a range of musical acts including Desirée Dawson, The Big Coast, and Zulu Panda. A second, intercultural stage, will feature family-friendly programming, including Rockin’ Robin, a bhangra dance troupe, and a mariachi band. Attendees are encouraged to bring water, sunscreen, and picnic blankets for the festivities. Food trucks bearing all manner of enticing treats will be on hand, and there will be events for kids, a speaker series, alumni homecoming reunions, and over 70 activities – from carnival games to wood carving demos to free yoga - throughout the day.

The unique relationship between the Musqueam, on whose unceded territory the campus sits, and Langara College will be showcased with a variety of activities. In 2016, the Musqueam gifted the college a traditional name meaning ‘House of Learning’. Attendees can enjoy a traditional welcome, visit the College’s Indigenous Gathering Space, watch a wood carving demonstration, or try their hand at cedar bracelet making.

""I think in today's world, we're so busy going from one thing to the next, we can forget to celebrate landmarks,"" says Gookstetter. ""Langara has been such a cornerstone for 49 years, we are a hidden jewel. To be able to showcase that, and to reconnect with those who have passed through our doors, is just so meaningful for us.""

Too many missed social opportunities.

Too many missed conversations.

It’s time to get your hearing tested. You want to fully embrace what these next years of life have to offer, not hide from them.

Now you need to decide where to do the test. You could go to Walmart or Costco, which offer over-the-counter hearing aids that cost a little less.

But do you want an over-the-counter hearing experience afterwards? Would you want an over-the-counter approach to any other important health concern?

“This is not supposed to be a quick fix; it’s a long-lasting solution to put your life back on track,” says Raphael Tayou of HearingLife Canada. “You should never compromise on your health.”

When you make a free appointment to get your hearing tested with one of HearingLife’s fully trained audiologists, this is what you can expect:

• A 20-minute discussion about your hearing concerns, medical history and lifestyle factors

• A physical ear exam to help the audiologist understand if there are any medical reasons for your hearing loss

• A comprehensive hearing exam, including tone, speech and word recognition tests to provide a thorough understanding of the condition of your hearing

• Same-day results and a counselling session on what to do next

If the need for a hearing aid is detected, the audiologist will then walk you through the various options that are available for your specific type of hearing loss. It won’t be a one-hearing-aid-suits-all option. It will be a hearing aid that’s tailored exactly to your needs and preferences. You’ll be amazed at how advanced the new hearing aid technology is, it can help you make hands-free calls from your smartphone, stream audio from your phone, stereo, TV, or other Bluetooth® enabled devices. And unlike your parents’ hearing aids, the modern iterations are incredibly discrete and sleek (unless you want to bling them up, of course.)

Afterwards, the audiologist will be there for you if you have any follow-up questions or adjustments.

“You need the right experts to give you the right treatment and after-care you deserve,” Tayou says. “We pride ourselves in being able to accompany you on your journey to better hearing. We want you to feel cared for and that you know we’re going to work towards making your life better.”

At Shylo Home Healthcare, each employee is thoroughly screened before hiring and they are fully covered by insurance.

Top homecare providers like Shylo employ a broad selection of professionals and offer customizable options for a wide variety of daily, weekly, or monthly needs. They also have numerous connections throughout the health industry, an important quality for those requiring in-home care.

“We advocate on behalf of our clients and can arrange any healthcare equipment required in a client’s home,” Ware says. “We also regularly consult with physicians and other community healthcare professionals in regards to a client’s nursing care. We are small enough to be familiar with all of our staff and clients, but large enough to meet any healthcare need!”

Let’s talk about Egypt—the land of pharaohs and ancient monuments stretching along the Nile River.

article continues below

Egypt has been a beloved tourist destination for many years because of its rich culture and long history, including the magnificent Giza Pyramids, mysterious Great Sphinx, and numerous pharaohs’ temples covered with ancient inscriptions.

But first things first. If you are a Canadian citizen, you should apply for a visa in advance of your trip in order to enter the country. This link can help you understand the whole visa application process and what documents you need to submit.

In 2015, Egypt’s travel authorities launched online visa applications (e-Visas) to simplify the application process. So, Canadian passport holders no longer have to queue at the embassy in Canada or the port of entry in Egypt to get their visa.

Once you have that visa, there are just a few more things to be aware of as you start planning your tour:

Vaccinations

Prior to your trip, ensure you’re up to date with your polio and tetanus shots. It is also advised to get vaccinated for Hepatitis A and B, typhoid, and rabies, which is a common problem across the country. Visitors should avoid interactions with stray animals such as dogs, cats, bats and monkeys.

For more information, consult with your general practitioner before travelling.

Food and water safety

Upon your arrival, you will notice that tap water in Egypt is densely chlorinated and has an unpleasant taste. While you can use it to brush your teeth, it’s not safe for drinking. Purchase bottled water instead; it’s very affordable in Egypt.

In regard to food safety, avoid raw vegetables, salads and unpeeled fruit. If you eat meat, make sure it’s thoroughly cooked. Never purchase food from street vendors where there is no running water.

Heat

Since Egypt lies in a desert, the temperatures can quickly get very hot. Pack loose-fitting clothes made of organic fiber and increase your daily water intake to avoid sunburn, dehydration and heat exhaustion.

You can also include salt in your food to recover electrolytes, in case you lose them through sweat. If you require medical help, go to any Egyptian pharmacy and seek medical advice. Pharmacists can also help you find a doctor if necessary. English is generally used in Egypt, so you shouldn’t have any communication issues.",[]

The paddles have yet to hit the water, but already excitement is swelling for the annual Concord Pacific Vancouver Dragon Boat Festival.

And this year is all about changing perceptions, says general manager Ann Phelps.

Although the three-day festival, which runs June 23-25, is typically thought of as a sporting affair, that’s just touching the surface of this cultural and artistic event, according to Phelps.

Inspired by the artistry of the paddlers and beautiful False Creek, artists Katie and Paul Morris, whose vibrant artwork was discovered by Phelps on Granville Island, designed this year’s promotional poster.

Likewise, festival participants will be urged to not pick up an oar, but a pencil, paintbrush and paper to recreate enlarged images of Vancouver artwork. The winning submission will later be showcased on a billboard.

For those more inclined to create ‘artwork’ with a knife, local chefs will be putting judges’ taste buds to the test in the Taste of the Festival competition. But fret not, you too can taste-test the delicious creations yourself at the array of food trucks attending the festivities.

If you beat to a different drum, there’s also something for you: the “heartbeat of the festival” — the drumming contest.

The combination of athletics and artistry can also be experienced through live music performances on the World Beat Stage, a Circus West POP-up, a Portobello West marketplace and so much more.

Similar to how it takes a co-ordinated team to row for the finish line, Phelps says this year’s organizers have worked together to prove “they can accomplish anything” while delivering world-class entertainment for all.

While that was once the case, clinics such as Coastal Sleep, which has six locations in the Lower Mainland, now offer an in-home testing alternative with far fewer monitors—and a much shorter wait time.

article continues below

""We provide the equipment for you to be tested for sleep apnea in the comfort of your own home,"" says Paul Sweeney, a Registered Respiratory Therapist and President of Coastal Sleep. ""There's a small monitor, a nasal devise to measure airflow, and a chest band to measure chest movements. That’s it.""

A common indicator of sleep apnea is the interruption of breathing during the deep sleep state.

""Should this happen,"" Paul says, ""the monitor senses that the chest is moving, but there's no airflow. This indicates that there is likely an obstruction to the airway.""

Known as Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), this type of sleep apnea is the most common.

""Approximately one in fifteen people suffer from a mild form of OSA, but around 75 percent of them are undiagnosed,"" Paul notes.

If you have diabetes or heart issues, the likelihood of you suffering apnea rises up to 50 percent, says Paul. Drug resistant hypertension – a condition where hypertension is still a health factor, regardless of the medication prescribed– results in an 83 percent chance of sleep apnea.

""At Coastal Sleep, we also deal with people with pacemakers, congestive heart failure, and an addiction to narcotics,"" Paul says. “After obtaining the results from the monitor, we can sit down with the patient and discuss the diagnosis. We will also keep your family doctor informed.""

Coastal Sleep is also a preferred vendor for both Vancouver Coastal Health and Fraser Valley Health.

""We were chosen because the health authorities felt that we offered the best in service and support for our patients,"" Paul says.

Recalling the old adage about first impressions, it’s important then that this railing adds to rather than detracts from the beauty of your new home.

“There are a number of materials and designs that can be chosen for railings,” says Ali Mozzafari, part of the family-owned business, Iron Age Manufacturing Ltd., “but a custom-made iron railing can add a uniqueness and practicality to any deck.”

article continues below

Iron Age Manufacturing is a local company that designs, fabricates, and installs hand-forged iron railings, either in the home or the garden.

But how do you create that perfect design for your new home’s railing? Where do you start?

“The first step,” says Ali, “is to do some research by keeping an eye open for attractive designs that you like and which would be a beautiful and functional addition to your new home. These designs could come from magazines, a railing you see that has a pattern you like, or from your own imagination.”

With your ideas in mind, the next step is to contact the designers at Iron Age Manufacturing, who will use computer aided software (CAD) to create a pattern from a photo or your sketch.

But what if you’re not sure of what would look good in your setting?

“We encourage people to contact us,” Ali says. “We will come to your house, look around the area where you want the railing, and we can come up with some ideas for a structure that is both beautiful and unique to your home.”

Once the design has been settled, Iron Age Manufacturing will provide clients with an estimate of the cost and time involved. The iron railings are custom-made, not prefabricated.

“We hand forge the iron,” explains Ali, “forming the design by heating and hammering. We have employees who have been with us since the beginning of the company and they are experts at welding, forming, and forging.”

After fabrication, the finishers take over.

“The beauty of Iron Age,” says Ali, “is that we can take care of everything from design, to fabrication, polishing, painting, and finally, installation. This means that we have control of every step. We can save time and we can save the client money.”

The slow fashion movement is making, well, a slow debut in North America. Small, owner-operated businesses and labels are creating garments made out of quality fabrics, that are built to last. It is a stark contrast to the typical shift of seasonal mall fashion, where 2 for $5 sales guarantee that it will be cheaper to throw out a worn-in item than to replace it in a few months.

article continues below

Pavel Lalev is Development Manager for Green Inspiration BC, a company that owns and operates large green textile recycling bins in the Lower Mainland. Their bins, recently retrofitted to make sure that they are 100% user friendly and entirely safe, serve to fill a textile-recycling gap that doesn't exist in other countries.

Lalev points to Paris as a city the rest of the world could use as an example.

""France is the only country with a mandatory extended producer responsibility for textiles,"" he says. ""Textiles literally cannot be deposited into the waste stream."" Paris had noticed that a large percentage of waste was coming from fast fashion, and decided to take steps to make their waste stream more sustainable. The city now has increased the number and density of street bins for textiles, where individuals can go deposit unwanted garments. There are also trucks that go around the city on different routes -- similar to garbage trucks,"" Lalev adds.

Lalev also notes that the textiles acquired by the Parisian trucks and bins go through a very similar set of channels as do those acquired by his own company's bins. The textiles are passed over to graders, who see what is fit for resale locally or in other markets. What isn't fit for resale is then either recycled or repurposed.

Lalev is quick to point out that he thinks Canada could benefit from a textile collection on a larger scale. Municipal advocacy for these types of changes could make a real difference in the amount of textile waste our nation creates. Until then, however, Green Inspiration is happy to provide a stop-gap measure, with tens of safety-guaranteed bins ready to collect your unwanted items all around the Lower Mainland.

And the wrong cleaning practices can lead to serious health risks.

article continues below

“Cleaning your dentures is very important,” says Kerrisdale Denture Clinic denturist Giao Le. “Not only will it help maintain the overall health of your mouth, it will prolong the life of your dentures. But there are a number of cleaning methods you should avoid.”

Like toothpaste and tooth brushes, for example.

“The toothpaste and brush will leave scratches on the dentures where bacteria can grow,” says Le. “You should never use them to clean your dentures.”

Here are a few more cleaning tips from Giao that will help prolong the life of your dentures and keep your mouth safe:

1. Dish soap is good for more than dishes:Unlike a lot of household cleaners, liquid dish soap is a safe and effective product to use to clean your dentures.

“You should always consult your denturist before using a particular soak or cleaning solution,” Le advises. “It’s important to make sure that whatever you’re using isn’t harmful to your type of denture.”

2. Don’t use bleach with metal:Bleach will corrode the metal components on your partial dentures and should never be used to clean them.

3. Relines: Denture relines may be of weaker material than the original used to make your dentures. Always consult with your denturist after each reline for the best cleaning methods.

4. No Harsh Scrubbers:Dentures are prone to scratches and abrasion. Toothpaste can also be too abrasive for the dentures. Use a denture brush and cleaning material instead.

5. Mouthwash: It might help freshen your breath, but it’s useless for soaking your dentures in.

“Mouthwash seems like it would be useful, but it really does nothing,” says Le. “Save it for your mouth. And always remember to thoroughly brush with a denture brush and rinse your dentures before and after a soak.”

Denture cleaning products are available in most stores. Always remember to check with your denturist before using any cleaning product on your dentures.

But one of the challenges I’ve come across with non-toxic products is that what I gain in natural ingredients, I often lose in effectiveness. (It took much trial and error to finally find a natural deodorant that works, and now I’m hooked on Sola). I’m a huge fan of SPF for its melanoma- and wrinkle-preventing properties (I wear at least SPF 15 on my face year-round), but up until now I haven’t come across a non-toxic sunscreen line that is free of harsh chemicals.

When it comes to evaluating whether a product is safe to put on my skin and hair, I use the Environmental Working Group’s Skin Deep database. I simply type in the name of the product and the database provides a rating from 1 to 10 (1 being the least toxic and 10 being the most).

article continues below

Dr. Mark Lupin of Cosmedica in Victoria says when shopping for a non-toxic sunscreen or sunblock you should look for a formula that uses mineral active ingredients such as zinc oxide and/or titanium dioxide, instead of the chemical filters oxybenzone, avobenzone, octisalate, octocrylene, homosalate and octinoxate included in most sunscreens on the market. Also, look for the words ""Broad Spectrum” on the sunscreen label as this indicates that, in addition to UVB protection represented by the SPF rating, the product also protects from UVA rays which can contribute to skin cancer and premature aging.

Here are four non-toxic suncare brands I recommend trying this summer:

1) Beautycounter, the skincare and makeup line known for its commitment to using non-toxic ingredients, has just launched a line of non-toxic suncare products for body and face formulated with non-nano zinc oxide and antioxidant-rich California Poppy. Most of the products boast EWG ratings of 1 and are available in mist, lotion and stick formulas, perfect for the whole family to use.

2) Vancouver-based natural product brand A Healthy Beginning makes a zinc oxide-based SPF 25 Whipped Mineral Sun Butter which contains raspberry seed oil to boost sun protection and hydrate the skin. All ingredients have a low EWG rating, the product packaging uses minimal plastic, and the butter can be used on the face and body (and is perfect for kids, too).

3) Josie Maran loves her argan oil and she makes a beautifully scented, chemical-free facial oil that protects with an SPF of 47, and is available at Sephora.

4) Also available at Sephora with EWG ratings between 1 and 3 is Coola's range of non-toxic SPF products which includes a White Tea Face Sport SPF 50 and an SPF 30 Sunscreen Spray Pina Colada.

Whichever sunscreen you choose, be sure to apply 30 minutes before sun exposure, reapplying every two hours, and after swimming.

India’s many provinces have drastically different food styles, many of which are the focus of the Lower Mainland’s eateries. There are South Indian Dosa houses, restaurants featuring North Indian curries and vegetarian Indian restaurants.

While many of these establishments serve traditional recipes in decidedly traditional settings, others have added contemporary West Coast flair to their offerings. Here, the recipes include fusion ingredients and the décor has a more modern aesthetic.

Those not familiar with Indian cuisine, or those wanting to learn more about it, can brush up on their knowledge on the Vancouver Courier’s IndoFlavours website. Here you can find a vlog that shares the history of butter chicken and an article that lists the best Indian dishes from each region.

The website also includes a directory of the top Indian restaurants in the area—because with all of the choices available, it can be challenging to decide where to go for a meal!

With over 15 years’ experience in the Vanvouver, Wizard Industries has extensive experience dealing with strata councils when installing their premium screen doors and awnings. Wizard’s Darrell Bedford offered these tips for anyone thinking of installing a screen door, awning or other outdoor accessories to your strata-governed home.

article continues below

1. Build a relationship with your strata president. He or she will likely play a critical role in getting your home improvements approved.

2. Share as much detail as possible. Maintaining an open and honest communication stream with the council is the key to avoiding surprises when it’s time to install your product.

3. Get the colours and the theme right. Screen doors are typically among the easiest items to get approved by strata governing bodies—providing they match the colour scheme of the building and/or complex. Awnings are more challenging because they effect the look of the building’s exterior.

4. Choose products that don’t diminish security. Not all screens are created equal, for example. Wizard Industries screen doors are made with steel mesh, which helps prevent people from entering the home.

5. Consider the environment. Part of the reasons screen doors are often easy to get approved is because they increase airflow without harmful emissions and potentially reduce the need for air conditioners in your building or complex.

Wizard Industries has a wealth of experience in dealing with strata councils in Vancouver and has seen just about every kind of scenario. But according to Bedford, the most important advice is also the simplest.

“Start by being a good neighbor,” he says. “In our experience, the vast majority of people are actually pretty reasonable.”

Whether you’re looking for a more exciting workout, a new sport, or a place to celebrate, this indoor trampoline park has it all. And it’s just a hop, skip and a really high jump from downtown, making it the perfect daytrip destination.

“We offer a ‘wow’ experience,” says Morey Chaplick, owner of Sky Zone Trampoline Park in Surrey. “Nowadays, there are so few places where you can go and have an amazing time with literally no skill or training.”

The 30,000-square-foot facility offers a variety of activities and events for all ages and abilities. But where to start?

Here are the top 6 most popular activities that regularly take place at the park, according to Chaplick:

1. Ultimate Dodgeball. Surviving on the dodgeball court would be much easier if you could hop right out of the danger zone! Trampoline dodgeball is a whole new way to play, and Sky Zone has daily pick-up games. If you’re up for the challenge, form a team with friends and take part in Sky Zone’s Ultimate Dodgeball Tournament.

2. Sky Slam.Always dreamed about being a basketball pro? Try dunking from trampoline launch pads that send you 10 feet in the air.

3. Foam Zone. Leaping from a trampoline runway into a pit filled with 10,000 foam cubes makes for a mighty soft landing, and Sky Zone’s Foam Zone is the perfect place to improve tricks and jumping skills in a safe way.

4. Open Jump. Why pick one activity when you can try them all? Open Jump includes access to the main free jump court, with jump times starting ever 15 to 30 minutes, as well as all of the other activities listed above.

5. SkyRobics. Looking for a low-impact workout that is gentle on your joints? SkyRobics combines calisthenics, core exercises and strength-building aerobics. And trampoline workouts burn up to 1,000 calories per hour, making for some highly effective fitness.

6. Birthday parties. Better than a bouncy castle, by leaps and bounds. Sky Zone offers a range of birthday party options, so kids can celebrate their special day in a unique, fun and safe facility. Parents, you just bring the kids and the cake – the staff at Sky does the rest!

The following tips from Margot Ware, Director and Owner of Shylo Home Healthcare, will help you make the right choice.

1. Better Business Bureau Rating – For any business that deals in healthcare and other home services, your first visit should be to the BBB. While you’re at it, check out the rating criteria to see what it takes to achieve the A+ Rating that Shylo boasts.

article continues below

2. Transparency–Make sure you get a thorough rundown of costs and billing before enlisting a homecare business. If you’re having difficulty getting the information you need, look elsewhere. You should be able to find out whatever you need to know without having to wonder if you’re getting the whole story.

3. Staff Credentials & Background Check– Don’t take chances with the well-being of your loved ones or with their home. Each member of a homecare company’s staff should be thoroughly screened before being hired. Never be afraid to ask for proof of credentials.

4. Liability & WCB Insurance– This detail is often overlooked, but it’s equally as important. “Do not leave yourself open to risk,” warns Ware. “Uninsured private caregivers can hold a client responsible for a work-related injury. While Shylo covers all their caregivers, some franchise agencies and most private caregivers do not adequately cover their employees.”

5. Community Involvement– By and large, a business looking to avoid scrutiny does not get heavily involved in their community. Home care services such as Shylo are involved with the community at every level. A quick glance at their Facebook page tells clients just how involved they are in the local area and the many local charities they support.

6. Age of Business– How long has the business been operating? A home care business that’s withstood the test of time is likely a much safer bet than a business that’s just opened. Shylo is a great example of proof by longevity. Launched in in 1980 by Betty Brown, an inspired West Vancouver nurse, Shylo has been providing quality home care services in the Lower Mainland for over 35 years.

As an independent, locally run grocery store, the Famous Foods Meat Department offers quality Canadian meat and poultry with grass fed, organic, and non-medicated options. “Summer barbecues with family and friends are a great way to catch up with each other, enjoy the outdoors, and eat delicious healthy food,” says Gil, head butcher.

article continues below

When determining the type of meat, first consider how lean the meat will be. Marbling refers to the streaks of clear or white fat deposits in a cut, especially visible on red meat. The finer the grain, the leaner the meat; the more connective tissue, the more robust a meat’s flavour will be. Flavourful and tender cuts of beef are prime rib, ribeye, and strip loin, and T-bone steaks. For the tenderest meat, you will find fresh, hormone-free Angus beef weekly at Famous Foods.

Lean meat, such as grass fed, is often more tender when grilled. Being so easy to overcook, it’s best to grill grass-fed meat over low heat with an alternative oil, such as coconut or avocado oil. When grilling lean meat, aim for medium or medium-rare.

Even the most experienced grill masters know the ultimate barbecue hack: your local grocer. The butcher will know each meats flavour components and grilling style. Make a locally-run grocer like Famous Foods your go-to meat provider for the best advice. Visit their website at www.famousfoods.ca or find them on Facebook.",[]

Meghan Conyers started Strongbody Apparel in 2012 and has grown it to be known for sleek, fitted and flattering designs that are all made locally.

“I was really into fitness but didn’t see anything unique. Everyone seemed to be wearing the same tank top and pants to spin classes,” said Conyers, Strongbody’s CEO. “I thought, 'this is so boring'.”

So, she started developing her own line, despite having no previous experience in activewear design and production. “When I first started, I didn’t even know how a t-shirt was made,” Conyers said. But she did have a clear idea of what the market needed:

“I thought that there had to be something fashionable that could transition from the gym to the street; something with a sleek and refined look.” That meant a more euro-inspired design with a fitted, contemporary look. “I compare what we do to with having a guy in a nicely fitted suit,” Conyers said, “It's tailored, yet understated and effortless.”

Strongbody Apparel also incorporates a technologically advanced fabric treatment, called Nanoelite+, in their products. This treatment, which remains for the entire lifetime of the garment, uses the properties of recycled crustacean shells to make their products incredibly moisture wicking and resistant to odor, wrinkling and pilling.",[]

But when it comes to Phoenix’s Gymnastics For All Programs for children, the focus is based on the Fun, Fitness and Fundamentals philosophy, according to Maree Hall, the Gymnastics For All Program Manager.

“With the Gymnastics For All Program, our focus is on teaching the fundamentals of gymnastics.” Hall explains. The club does keep an eye on students who excel, but that isn’t the focus of the recreational program, she says.

“The coaches are aware of, and make note of children who might be particularly talented, and follow a process of recommendation,” Hall adds. “Our aim is that the children will learn sound basic skills while having fun, possibly developing a passion for the sport and potentially continuing for some years to come.”

Participating in physical activity is particularly important these days for children, especially considering the amount of time children spend in front of a screen and on their devices, she says.

The Gymnastics For All Program takes a multi-movement approach to teaching students, which involves exploring and repeating skills in a variety of movement patterns. Gymnastics helps children build a range of motor and coordination skills, and assists in developing a good sense of body awareness which gives children a sound foundation for all sports.

Phoenix Gymnastic soffers Parent & Tot classes from six months to three years old, independent classes for preschoolers, and classes for school-aged children, teens and adults. Phoenix also has camps for winter, spring and summer breaks, as well as Pro-D Days.

There are Drop Ins for children who have mastered walking to those in their early teens. And for those nights when parents would like a little time to themselves, there are Parents’ Night Out evenings for kids ages five to 10.

The Gymnastics For All Program offers a variety of activities for children at every level, and Hall recommends parents start them early.

“It is so important to introduce children to physical activity from a very young age,” she says.

“We want to bring a distinctly Mediterranean atmosphere to our Vancouver community,” Lorenzo says. “This is the first cultural market of its kind in Vancouver and it features great organic produce, handmade products from local artisans, fabulous entertainment, and our new pizza oven.”

The new community pizza oven, an initiative of the Italian Cultural Centre, will be on display at Il Mercato and there will be pizza-making demonstrations.

“I would buy meat and seafood and fresh produce,” she remembers, “then I would cook it, puree it and serve it to her. She loved it—and that's when I discovered that I could cook.”

Fast-forward twenty-five years to the birth of Chi’s newest creation: the Chi Modern Vietnamese Kitchen. Opening in early August 2016 the Kitchen promises authentic Vietnamese food made with fresh, organic, locally sourced ingredients and crafted with Chi’s own creative flair.

Chi, famous in her native country as a runner-up in the Masterchef Vietnam reality television competition, wants Vancouver to experience the unique flavours of Vietnamese dishes. And each visit to the Kitchen promises to be a different experience.

“I want to introduce the experience of an authentic, shared Vietnamese family meal to those people who want to know about Vietnamese cuisine,” she says, “and bring the freshness of each season to that experience.”

Chef Chi has two cookbooks and a dessert recipe book in the works and plans to hold Vietnamese cooking classes once the restaurant is established.

That’s a question that always deserves an enthusiastic “Yes!”

But what if you stop yourself from enjoying a restaurant dinner because you find it too hard to follow a conversation in a noisy environment?

There have been tremendous advances in hearing aid technology since your grandparents’ day. Hearing aids can be highly customized to adapt to specific types of hearing loss and they are so discreet, they are barely noticeable.

Here are five reasons why getting your hearing tested will lead to a happier, more fulfilling life.

You’ll say yes more often: Two people feel badly when you have to say “no” to an invitation. You, and the person doing the asking. Think of how much better you’ll feel when you can embrace new opportunities — and try out that new restaurant everyone’s raving about.

No more excuses: It can be difficult to explain why you are isolating yourself. Sometimes you make up reasons not to join friends or family at events. It’s hard for them to understand why, especially since all they want is to spend time with you.

You’ll feel more in control of your life: We waste a lot of energy finding ways to cope with awkward situations. It’s better to turn the awkward situation into a positive one. You’ll be glad you’re doing something about your hearing loss — and others will be, too.

Only actors get applause for pretending to be someone they’re not: Stop nodding your head to make people think you understand what they’re saying. Chances are they haven’t been fooled.

You can live in the moment: You have the right to feel fully involved in life. Your life. It wears you down to keep saying, “Pardon? Can you repeat that?” The only thing that needs repeating is time spent enjoying the company of others.

At the same time, you admit to feeling tired in the morning and occasionally wake up with a headache.

Before packing up your favourite pillow and moving to a new bed, consider being tested for sleep apnea.

""Sleep apnea causes you to stop breathing for a short period during sleep,"" says Paul Sweeney, a Registered Respiratory Therapist (RRT) and President of Coastal Sleep. ""This could happen several times during the night. There may be a blockage to your airway caused by Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), which is a loss of muscle tone that keeps the airway open. This results in the tongue and tissue falling back to block the airway.""

With OSA, you are woken from a deep-sleep state.

""You feel tired the next day,"" Paul explains. ""But you may not think much of it because many others suffer from the same symptoms. OSA is a very prevalent condition. Unfortunately, around 75 percent of sufferers don't even know that they have it.""

Sleep apnea could be the result of a variety of causes, though obesity is the cause most people associate with the condition.

""Certainly if you're obese you're at a higher risk of sleep apnea,"" Paul says. ""But it's by no means the only cause. We treat slim patients who happen to have a really short jaw and therefore a crowded throat. Sleep apnea can also be caused by overly large tonsils or redundant tissue in the throat.""

Symptoms of sleep apnea include snoring, interrupted breathing patterns, and even frequent trips to the bathroom at night.

""Considering the symptoms is our starting point,"" Paul says. ""From there, we look at other related issues such as headaches in the morning or a feeling of heartburn. But symptoms are just one part of the puzzle. We also look at existing medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or other heart issues.""

Another type of sleep apnea, central sleep apnea, can occur alone or as a result of other medical issues such as stroke, heart failure and narcotic use.

""Central sleep apnea requires a different approach and treatment,"" says Paul. ""Fortunately, it's not very prevalent.""

If you think you might be suffering from sleep apnea, talk to your doctor or phone Coastal Sleep.

For more information about the causes and symptoms of sleep apnea call Coastal Sleep at 1.877.241.9066, visit their website or send them an email. There is a Coastal Sleep facility in Vancouver located at 103-511 West 7th Avenue. Coastal Sleep can also be found on Facebook and Twitter.",[]

Denture gums are made from acrylic, a delicate plastic, and the teeth themselves are either made out of acrylic or porcelain, both of which are liable to shatter if dropped onto a hard surface.

When dentures need repairing, the best option is always to see a qualified denturist. Those who try to fix their dentures themselves usually end up making the situation considerably worse.

“The public perception is that you can just glue your dentures back together,” says Kerrisdale Denture Clinic denturist Giao Le. “But that’s completely false. You should never, ever, use superglue on dentures. First off, superglue is poisonous. If it is on your dentures, it will get into your body. And secondly, if you use superglue, the dentures become irreparable. Your denturist will not be able to fix them.”

Cracks are repaired with acrylic, Le explains, and if the crack is already filled with superglue, the acrylic will not meld with the denture.

Unrepaired or improperly repaired fissures and cracks on broken dentures leave room for harmful bacteria to grow. And nobody wants that in their mouth.

“Repairing dentures for our patients is a particularly straightforward process,” says Giao, “because we know the patient and the dentures already. If the dentures were made elsewhere, it takes a little longer but the end result is still the same. The difference is that the owner of the dentures needs to be present.”

Denture can be repaired while you wait in modern facilities such as Kerrisdale Denture Clinic. The process only takes between 45 and 90 minutes, assuming the dentures are repairable.

“One of the few limitations to repairs is the age of the denture,” says Giao. “At a certain point, old dentures just cannot be fixed. The materials have simply been worn down too much.”

Denture repair products are available for consumers, but that leaves room for error. What’s in the product? Will your repair job prevent the growth of bacteria in the break? In the end, dentures are far too expensive to trust to a $5 repair kit.

So next time your dentures are in need of repair, see a professional. And rest assured that your dentures are in good hands.

“We have a beautiful park on our north side,” says Mauro Vescera, Executive Director of the Italian Cultural Centre. “About three years ago we applied for funds to create a community garden. In 2015, we opened our 40 plot garden with an orchard and beehives.”

With the community garden, the Italian Cultural Centre established a composting program in collaboration with the Recycling Alternative organization and transforms food scraps from the Centre’s kitchen to provide compost for the community garden while reducing the amount of waste that needs to be hauled away.

In the course of researching the location of the community garden, the Centre discovered that a drainage ditch crossing the park was, in fact, part of an urban watershed that used to be home to beavers and salmon.

“It became part of a landfill,” Mauro explains, “We applied for a grant from the Pacific Salmon Foundation and received funds to restore the creek. We involved the students from our resident Montessori school and our Italian-Canadian youth group and rehabilitated and revitalized this urban creek.”

The East Van Green initiative is also focused on education and raising awareness about food literacy.

“We’ve made the connection to Il Mercato – our farmers’ market – and raised awareness of local, fresh organic food, which connects back to being Italian, because that’s how the Italians do it: composting and using genuine produce in their cuisine.”

With the introduction of the East Van Green initiative, the Centre runs summer workshops on pasta and bread making, mushroom foraging, and pastry classes as well as an after school program where children experience a hands on approach to food and nutritional literacy.

“With our East Van CAN (East Vancouver Culinary Arts Network) program,” Mauro explains, “kids come and make value-added products using locally grown produce and herbs. They become Food Safe certified and gain educational credits because it’s part of the school curriculum.”

“Customers will try a cookie or buy a bun and be shocked at how good it tastes,” she says proudly. “They really expect gluten-free to taste awful.”

Kadonoff knows the positive impact her delicious breads, cookies, cakes and squares have on her gluten-intolerant customers. She sees it every day.

“The best part is when customers come in and see all the different things we offer,” she says. “They can’t believe they have this many choices available in gluten-free.”

Families and friends of those who are gluten intolerant are just as surprised by the amazing assortment and fantastic taste. Many are reluctant to try gluten-free baking at all, according to Kadonoff , but they’re eventually convinced by those who rave about Lemonade Gluten Free Bakery’s menu.

“Having people spread the word about how good it tastes has the most impact,” says Kadonoff. “Once they try it and realize this stuff really can taste amazing, they want to tell everyone they know.”

One of the most satisfying things for Kadonoff is to bake a party cake for a special occasion that she knows the gluten-intolerant can eat without fear- and the rest of the guests can enjoy, too.

“It’s particularly fun to give cupcakes and other treats to kids because they feel so bad when they’re left out,” she says. “We want to make everything delicious for everyone to enjoy, so no one gets excluded.”

Planning a big dinner party or a kid’s birthday party? You can order a cake from Lemonade Gluten Free Bakery and rest assured that all anyone will talk about afterward is the amazing taste, whether they’re gluten-intolerant or not!

“We have lots of customers that aren’t gluten intolerant but love our gluten-free products,” Kadonoff says.

However, because so few of us are familiar with denture manufacturing processes, particularly the first time buying prosthetic teeth, it can be hard to tell how well a set of dentures were made.

“If the dentures are made in 5 days, it’s a pretty bad sign,” says Kerrisdale Denture Clinic denturist Giao Le. “With low-cost dentures, the price is always reflected in the poor form and function of the product.”

article continues below

Complete dentures should last 5 years, says Le, but cheaply made dentures will wear out faster and be less comfortable along the way. How the dentures are prepared before insertion is also an important factor, according to Le. Denture teeth are melded to the acrylic gum framework and have no chance of coming loose, for example. And the increase in quality adds to the cost.

“One patient has a habit of chewing ice,” says Le. “He was used to seeing a denturist every 18 months because by then, he had dull, flat, teeth. We gave him higher-end teeth and now we see him every 3 years.”

Lower cost dentures, or economy dentures, also make use of materials that become stained more easily. And they don’t look as natural because they aren’t available in as many shades as higher quality dentures are.

Ask your denturist where the material for the dentures comes from, says Le. If it originates in Germany, that’s a sign of higher quality. Conversely, materials originating in China is typically used in low-cost dentures.

“Our dentures provide superior form and function,” says Le, “because we want you to have a better smile and an enjoyable eating experience.”

Listening is one of the greatest gifts we can offer the people we love. What if the heart is willing but our ears aren’t up to the task?

Here are five reasons why getting your hearing tested will strengthen and enhance the important relationships in your life.

1) Improved intimacy. Sharing stories about both the ups and the downs of our lives creates a special bond in our closest relationships. It establishes trust and a sense of security. We need to be able to hear those stories.

2) Creating shared memories. If you remove yourself from family or social gatherings because you are apprehensive about being able to follow conversations, you’re missing out on all the little things that bind us together.

3) Being happy in the moment. When you can’t hear properly, you feel frustrated. And frustration turns to anger. Anger pushes people away from us and that’s not what we want, is it?

4) Making those moments count. We can waste a lot of time asking people to repeat themselves. Spend that time fully engaged with the person you’re talking with.

5) Listening is a show of love. We hate to break it to you but you’re probably not the only one who has noticed you’re having problems hearing. By being willing to do something about it, you are demonstrating that you understand the concerns of people who only want what’s best for you.

Langara College is often referred to by its instructors and alumni as ""one of Vancouver's best-kept secrets."" So says Moira Gookstetter, the Executive Director of the Langara College Foundation. In fact, Langara services students from Vancouver, Richmond, Burnaby, and all over the Lower Mainland.

article continues below

The public degree-granting college sees over 22,000 students walk through its doors each year, and is proud to offer degrees in fields as diverse as arts, health, sciences, business, and the humanities. Langara also offers upgrades and continuing studies in accounting, finance, arts, business, and computer technology. Students from Langara have gone on to be doctors, lawyers, actors, business owners, teachers, artists, and more.

But this list of offerings and student accomplishment wasn't always the case. In fact, according to Gookstetter, the Langara we know and love came to be the way it is because of two very special occasions, both celebrating milestone anniversaries in 2019.

The first of these two anniversaries is their Beyond 49 celebration, honouring the 49 years that the college has had a campus existing on 49th Avenue. In 1970, Gookstetter says, ""we had been part of Vancouver Community College, but there was a movement to create the current campus... And ever since then, we've been offering university transfer courses, here on 49th Avenue."" The college is celebrating its 49th anniversary on Saturday, June 15, with their largest ever event, Community Day, presented by RBC Royal Bank.

The second anniversary, says Gookstetter, is the 25th anniversary of Vancouver Community College and Langara separating into two distinct entities.

""In 1994,"" she says, ""there was a need to create specialized institutions. VCC had more trades and things like that whereas we were offering university transfer and credit courses.""

While Gookstetter says that government changes were the initial drivers behind the two institutions separating, she says that Langara has been proud and happy to create a set of values and practice that is uniquely their own.

Gookstetter and the rest of her colleagues are hoping that anyone who has ever been a Langaran reaches out to join in on celebrating these anniversaries. ""By Langaran, we mean anyone who has ever walked through our doors or taken a class,"" she adds. ""We just really want to celebrate our community. We are a hidden jewel in this city. To be able to showcase that and reconnect with those who have passed through our doors is really important.""

“The Urban Farming Society has always been involved in our community garden and farmers’ market,” Mauro Vescera, the Executive Director of the Italian Cultural Centre, explains. “Then they operated a little kiosk each Wednesday in our Centre to sell their salad boxes. The community loved them.”

Out of that little kiosk evolved the “Il Centro to Go” service, where delicious, high quality Italian food products made daily by the Centre’s chefs and ordered by the community members, could be picked up at the Italian Cultural Centre’s convenient location in East Vancouver.

“There was a lot of interest generated,” says Mauro, “so we approached VanCity and they invested in the initiative. We’ve linked it in to our young people’s East Van CAN (East Vancouver Culinary Arts Network) program and we’re starting to look at the Centre as a distribution point for fresh, organic, artisan food.”

It’s not a fully-fledged ecommerce business at the moment, Mauro notes, but people can phone the Italian Cultural Centre with an order for dishes on offer on Monday and pick them up on Friday. The Centre plans to operate as a distribution centre, rather than a food delivery service.

“We’re looking to partner with other farmers’ markets that are doing similar things,” explains Mauro, “and we want to develop this ecommerce initiative in partnership with the community. It creates an opportunity for us to take our industrial kitchens and culinary tradition and inculcate that into the local organic and artisan food community.”

The initiative is currently evolving, but, as Mauro points out, it will create benefits to produce vendors from out of town as well as local organic growers.

“We’re a member of the BC Farmers’ Market Association and we’re very cognizant of the opportunity to connect with and benefit the sector as well as offering the community fresh, organic, and artisan food made with Italian culinary flair and expertise.”

The BC Highland Games and Scottish Festival takes place on Saturday, June 17, 2017 at Percy Perry Stadium in Coquitlam, the BC Highland Games is an action-packed 10-hours of fun for the whole family, competition, dancing, food, and, of course, bagpipes.

“There’s a competitive aspect to the Games,” says Mike Chisholm, Chair of the BC Highland Games Committee, “so we work with a number of organizations – such as the BC Highland Dancing Association, the BC Pipers’ Association, and the Pacific Northwest Scottish Heavy Events Association – to make sure all our officially sanctioned events adhere to competitive rules.”

article continues below

As a celebration of Scottish culture, the Scottish Heavy Events are a popular attraction.

“The BC Provincial Heavy Events Championships are held at the BC Highland Games every year,” Mike says, “and they feature a series of nine feats of strength events, including the Stone Putt, Distance Throws, the Hammer Toss, and everyone’s favourite, the Caber Toss.”

The Caber Toss has been described as “men in skirts throwing power poles,” and involves throwing a pole weighing from 70 to 130lbs.

“But it’s not just for men,” Mike explains. “Women are also welcome to participate. In fact our athletic director is heavy events competitor Karyn Dallimore. Karyn and some of her athletes are happy to have people come and practice with them, to learn the technique of throwing and tossing.”

Bagpipes are a natural draw and not just for the Scots. The Highland Games feature solo piping, drumming, and pipe band events.

“We have two types of bands,” Mike says, “the performance bands and the competition bands. The latter includes Burnaby’s Simon Fraser University Pipe Band, who have won the World Pipe Band Championships six times and placed 2nd or 3rd more than a dozen times.”

The highest level of piping competition takes place the night before the BC Highland Games officially open. At 5p.m. in the Highland Village at Percy Perry Stadium, you can catch the Piobaireachd (pronounced pea-brock) competition featuring the classical music of the Great Highland Bagpipe.

“It’s an amazing evening of Ceol Mor, or “the big music,” says Mike.

If you enjoy watching Scottish dancing, the Highland Dance Competitions combine energetic and complex dance moves with bagpipe music. Dancers are judged on timing, technique and general deportment.

Whatever your interest – strength, grace, or acoustic competitions – there’s an event for everyone and the whole family.

“Everyone is welcome,” Mike notes. “There’s no need to be Scottish or have Scottish ancestry. Just hop on the SkyTrain and join us for the fun.”

In Taiwan, just a short 95-minute flight away, food is an obvious priority. Walk three steps, according to an old saying, and you'll find a small bistro. Walk five steps and you'll come to a restaurant. With a diverse range of indigenous and other cultures, Taiwan offers its own twist on Chinese food in addition to its the local dishes.

""Taiwan is a culinary paradise,"" says Linda Lin, Director – San Francisco Office of the Taiwan Tourism Bureau. ""It's a melting pot of fine food from all across the globe, from traditional Chinese cuisine to exotic delights.""

Taiwan's unique dining trends also embrace a mixture of health and nature. There are many restaurants that serve a creative, menuless cuisine in the countryside or by creeks in the mountains.

""While you can experience different taste sensations in Hong Kong and Taiwan,"" Michael says, ""our food is complementary. And both destinations can cater to different dietary considerations that are based on religion or lifestyle choices, such as halal or vegetarian dishes.""

A popular place for dining in Hong Kong is the Hong Kong-style teahouse, or cha chaan teng, which offers a unique fusion of western fast food and Chinese delicacies along with the rich, creamy Stocking Milk Tea. Or visit some of the walled-villages to sample local poon-choi (big bowled feast). These villages were originally walled to keep out tigers and bandits. Happily these are no longer an issue, but the walled-villages and the tasty cooking styles of their residents still remain to add a touch of cultural history to a meal.

Because the two destinations are so close and easily reached, it's easy to have lunch in Hong Kong and pop over to Taiwan for dinner. Night food markets are a fixture in Taiwan, offering fresh Taiwanese delicacies alongside clothing and fun accessories.

""CNNGO rated Taiwan's 300 plus night markets as a top attraction,"" notes Linda. ""Here you can try different types of food in smaller portions.""

Both cities offer exquisite gourmet dining and, for the less adventurous, western food is readily available, albeit with a distinct Chinese twist. It's safe to say that whatever your take on food – East, West, or a fusion of the two – there's a restaurant, bistro, or food cart for you.

Josh has been involved in woodworking since a young age. He learned carpentry from his father and both of his grandfathers, all traditionally trained craftsmen. At the J&S workshop he keeps the craft alive, building furniture and teaching new apprentices.

Steve studied woodworking throughout high school where he discovered a latent talent for the craft. Studying Business Marketing post-secondary enabled him to open up J&S Reclaimed Wood Custom Furniture in 2012 with Josh.

The J&S team locally salvages wood by assisting in heritage building demolitions, deconstructing barns, salvaging fallen logs, and collecting discarded pallets, turning unwanted material into quality handcrafted furniture.

“We want to preserve heirloom old-growth lumber and turn it into beautiful, lasting pieces of furniture that will be around for generations to come,” says Josh.

Clients can feel good about their purchases because not only do they get to have the furniture of their dreams, they also get to help the J&S team to keep hundreds of tonnes of wood out of the landfill, that would otherwise be burned for electricity.

“People are getting pretty conscious about sustainability,” says Steve. “Everyone wants to do their part in making a difference in the world.”

Among the different types of products J&S Reclaimed Wood offers are:

- Dining tables

- Hutches

- Coffee tables

- TV consoles

- Side tables

- Chandeliers and lighting (CSA certified)

- Wall paneling

- Barn doors

- Fireplace mantles

- Storage solutions

- Commercial and residential millwork

The J&S team custom builds almost anything a client wants from wood and metal, working with the client to create the perfect piece to suit their design needs.

Every step of the process is done in-house from salvaging the wood, designing, cutting, shaping, and assembling the pieces, sanding and finishing, and all the custom metalwork. They also do delivery and installation and ship worldwide.

When it comes to how robots may interact with us, expect it to include a little emotion.

That’s what Rosalind Picard, a pioneer in the field of robotic emotional intelligence, will discuss during her talk on November 5, 2018 at the Vogue Theatre as part of the Fall 2018 Wall Exchange, a free, community forum that brings experts from diverse fields to Vancouver twice a year (spring and fall) to discuss a wide range of societal issues.

“It’s one of our main vehicles of public engagement by bringing in really top minds from around the world and many different fields,” said Philippe Tortell, director of the Peter Wall Institute for Advanced Studies, a research institute based out of UBC that organizes the Wall Exchange series.

“Most of them are university-based, some are not. And they provide a publicly accessible lecture on their work and engage the audience in conversation around their topic of expertise,” added Tortell.

For Picard, professor of Media Arts and Sciences at MIT, that means describing how computers are now able to measure and respond to our emotions and feelings, and how that can provide benefits for human wellbeing by means of affective computing.

“It is a way to introduce some emotional intelligence into robotic systems,” Tortell explained, “both in terms of detecting emotions from humans who they are interacting with, and also displaying more emotional attributes themselves.”

Tortell added that this is an important area of research in today’s society, which is increasingly robotic and computerized.

“She (Picard) will come in and give the audience an update on the field, explain the challenges that remain to be tackled and what are the exciting breakthroughs.” There will also be ample time for the audience to ask questions.

“We typically have almost an equal length of time for the talk and the discussions,” Tortell said, adding the evening will be moderated by Nora Young, host of the CBC's Spark, a program that guides Canadians through the current dynamic era of technology-led change.

""Joy to the World!"" is a traditional performance featuring the music people love to hear at this time of year. A special treat this year is the appearance of organist and founding member of musica intima, Michael Murray. There'll also be an audience sing-along.

The second performance, ""Ding Dong,"" will give an entirely different perspective on the vocal ensemble.

""It's completely different,"" Joanna laughs, ""and it's in a different type of venue at the Anza Club. It came from the group talking about programming and how there are all these songs that we love, but which wouldn't fit into our regular Christmas programme.""

With musicians that are well versed in a number of styles, including jazz, musical theatre, and pop, musica intima decided to create a fun and edgy show featuring music by Tom Waits, Boney M, and other contemporary artists.

""We wanted to do something different for people who perhaps are not attracted to the traditional Christmas music,"" Joanna says.

Every time you turn it on it sounds like a plane is landing. And when it comes to getting rid of the steam on your bathroom mirror after a shower, the fan is all noise, no power.

Shawn Willis and Darren Martin aren’t surprised. The owners of AJ’s Electrical know that when a lot of homes in the Lower Mainland were built, contractors installed cheap vents that are not only noisy, but inefficient as well.

With 65 years of experience between them, their company has been helping homeowners find solutions since 2003.

“When it comes to fans that are quiet and can move a lot of air, Panasonic is cream of the crop,” says Martin. “As well as helping with mold issues, it moves the air a lot faster so the mirror’s pretty much clear after a shower. You don’t have to wipe it and leave a streak. We also like Broan fans if homeowners are looking for a less expensive option.”

Another way to modernize your house is by installing potlights; add a dimmer switch and you also reduce your hydro bill. “We use all LED products with proper LED dimmers,” Martin says, cautioning homeowners to make sure that their dimmer switches are formatted for the correct type of lighting.

The company uses certain tricks that minimize damage to ceilings and walls. Technicians also bring in blankets and vacuums to cause as little disruption as possible. “It’s like they’ve never been to your house once they’re finished,” Willis says.

When it comes to upgrading older systems, AJ’s Electrical thinks outside the box. “We recently replaced outdoor lights going up concrete stairs. We pulled all the inner workings out and took them back to our shop to rebuild. When we installed the new lighting, we redid the paint so it was seamless.”

“We’re not just going out there to replace everything,” Willis adds. “We’ll try to fix what clients have before we buy new if that’s what the client wants.”

One challenge they’ve learned to overcome is how to install class two electric car charging stations for people who live in townhouses. “You can’t just up the service from 100 amps to 200 amps if you’re coming off a central service,” Martin says. “There’s a lot of detail involved but we can come up with solutions to make it work and pass inspections, which are required for the rebates.”

This equation best describes a novel way to progressively improve math skills for students from Grades 2 to 12 using the Mathnasium Method.

article continues below

It’s one Manju Ranamuka, Centre Director of Mathnasium of Kerrisdale, and her staff of instructors have offered since opening this past spring.

“Math was my favourite subject when I was a child - I enjoyed the challenges it offered,” Ranamuka said. “But we understand there are students who don’t share that view and even think math is evil.

“It’s our goal to help change that and cater to any math needs a student has.”

Often, that negative approach stems from a student’s lack of confidence when they struggle to understand the concepts.

But once they grasp what is being taught, they can move forward with greater assurance and take on the next challenge.

Ranamuka explained that Mathnasium’s specially trained instructors teach youngsters how to understand math in an individual setting where tutors foster a caring, encouraging environment that helps kids thrive and learn.

And that begins with a unique assessment process.

“If you are a doctor you can reach a diagnosis based on the patient’s symptoms,” Ranamuka said. “Here, we have instructors who are trained to diagnose those areas where students struggle with math.

“That’s why when a child comes to our centre, the first thing we do is talk to them and their parents to find out what their situation is,” she explained. “Sometimes, it’s a child’s lack of confidence, even if they master the concepts.”

When a clear picture of the student’s situation is established, an individualized learning plan is created.

But it doesn’t stop there – Mathnasium’s instructors monitor their students’ progress to ensure they understand and retain the concepts taught.

The results are transformative as students display measurable changes in attitude, confidence, and school progress.

“When a child gains confidence in their math skills, they see that expand to other subjects in school,” Ranamuka said.

“Teaching was always an occupation that I wanted to pursue,” Ranamuka said, adding what drew her to Mathnasium was its teaching model that is successfully employed at more than 900 Mathnasium centres across the globe.

Initially, a group brainstormed around a creative event that would catch people’s imagination, support a local industry, and bring in much-needed money.

“People’s charitable calendars tend to be filled with gala dinners or lunches,” Barinder says, “and we wanted something different, something a little more creative. We’ve partnered with the Hastings Race Track and on June 25, 2016, from 12:30pm to 5pm we’ll be holding a day at the races event.”

Women are encouraged to wear their finest summer dresses and hats or fascinators and men will be wearing their summer suits. Tickets cost $100 and include hors d’oeuvres, a buffet lunch, and two tickets for the alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverage of your choice.

“It’s going to be a fun day,” Barinder laughs. “Plus, the horse racing industry has a long history in B.C. and, like many other sectors, it has taken a hit with the advent and popularity of technology. People can watch horse racing at home or on any mobile device, or watch bigger tracks in other cities. We want to support the industry as it creates a lot of jobs and is important to our community.”

All the money raised is invested into the Resource Works Society to help fund research and create fact-based information for the public and community leaders on the contribution of responsible resource development and extraction.

Nicole Renwick, Executive Director of the Memorial Society of British Columbia, uses the analogy of the pilgrims crossing America to describe a green burial.

article continues below

""Imagine the pilgrims making their way across America,"" she says. ""When someone died, they simply wrapped the person in a blanket and buried them. There was no embalming fluid, no burial liner, zero affect on the environment. The body was left to decompose in the ground.""

With today's interest in the environment, the green burial is enjoying a resurgence in popularity. Nicole outlines four things you should know about a green burial:

1. It's completely natural

A green burial is a process that allows for the natural decomposition of human remains without the inclusion of chemicals.

""As a minimum,"" Nicole explains, ""for a burial to be considered green, the Memorial Society of B.C. requirements include a biodegradable coffin, no embalming, and no grave liner.""

Preferably, there should be plants or shrubs planted on the grave. The highest form of a green burial would include interment in a natural setting.

2. Green burials are gaining in popularity

""It's a very popular option,"" says Nicole. ""With today's interest in conserving the environment, people are thinking more and more about avoiding the use of chemicals and chemical liners in their burial.""

3. There are various levels of ""greenness""

""At the Memorial Society of B.C.,"" explains Nicole, ""we recognize that people have different interpretations of what constitutes a ""green"" burial. We're actively working throughout British Columbia to ensure that all levels of green burials are available around the province.""

4. Recyclable plots

A major benefit of a green burial in this time of land scarcity on the Lower Mainland is the fact that the plot is reusable.

""With a green burial,"" Nicole explains, ""you don't purchase the plot. You lease a small piece of land. In 25 years, that plot can be reused for another burial because your remains have decomposed into the earth as part of the natural life cycle of the planet.""

The Memorial Society of British Columbia is a non-profit, member-based, volunteer-driven organization that has been helping British Columbians with end of life planning decisions for more than 60 years. For a nominal one-time membership fee, the Society will record your wishes for the disposal of your remains as well as assist your loved ones secure a discount on funeral services with an approved funeral homes throughout the province.

There are extensive studies about the effects of exposure to harmful chemicals, and with the increased exposure to chemicals and toxins in our daily lives, there is also an increased risk of health concerns. When eco-friendly products are as effective as those containing chemicals, and bear no health risks, sustain local economies, and are purchasable at a similar price point, why pollute your home and body with anything else?

Barcelona– Rich, welcoming, Spanish culture right on the beach. If architecture is your interest, the Sagrada Familia church will excite you. If sun and surf is your style, the Balearic Sea will meet your needs. Expect an average temperature of 17˚C between March and November.

Madrid– Continuing with the Spanish theme comes one of the most LGBT welcoming cities in the world. This city is so inclusive that the Gay Pride Parade is the world’s largest, attracting 300,000 foreigners to visit during the festival.

“Through Aeroplan, my partner and I used open-jaw, or stopovers, to visit Barcelona and London before returning to Vancouver,” said Minish. “Spain, Madrid and Barcelona especially, have wonderfully accepting LGBT communities and vibrant Spanish culture.”

Mykonos – Named the Ultimate Gay Destination by The Huffington Post, its LGBT culture thrives throughout the year. Every two years the island hosts the Mykonos Biennale, a world-renowned arts celebration. And if you miss this cultural event, the sun-bleached homes and warm blue sea will make up for it.

London – One of the oldest cities in the world, London is also a prime LGBT destination because the culture reaches back to the 1700’s. In fact, there were more gay pubs in the 1720s London than there were in the 1950s.

Paris– A regular competitor for the title of “LGBT Capital of Europe” (rivals with Berlin) and “LGBT Capital of the World” (second only to New York), Paris is necessary to visit if only to stroll through their fantastic 'gayborhoods.'

“The experience of different cultures is great, especially when you belong to one larger subculture like LGBT,” said Minish. “Everywhere we are the same, but it’s the little cultural differences that make the experience special.”

People can lose their teeth when they’re relatively young for a variety of unforeseen reasons, or keep them until the final stages of life.

“My friend’s grandfather just lost his teeth in 2015,” says Kerrisdale Denture Clinic denturist Giao Le. “He was 90 years old. It’s completely different for everyone.”

article continues below

Regardless of how you lose your teeth, however, you’re probably going to need dentures.

With that in mind, we put together the top 5 reasons to visit the denturist:

Accidents: If you just went face-first over the handlebars of your mountain bike and you lost one or more teeth, partial dentures are the easiest and most economical solution.

Your job depends on it:Harry Potter star, Emma Watson, literally grew up on film. Unfortunately, during the filming for one of the movies, her baby teeth fell out. The solution? Replace them with dentures. Hockey players have long since popularized dentures, particularly when transitioning from player to commentator. The iconic gap-toothed Canadian grin just doesn’t work as well behind a microphone.

You don’t want to wait- and you don’t want it to hurt a lot:Scheduling an appointment with a dental surgeon and then having dental implants prepared takes months longer than simply going to a denturist such as Giao Le at Kerrisdale Denture Clinic. Not only are dentures much quicker to make, they’re far less painful to implement.

Cost: Partial dentures are far more affordable than a bridge or crown.

Your teeth are decaying: The single biggest determining factor in losing one’s teeth is improper dental hygiene. Plaque leads to tooth loss, and it builds up when you don’t brush and floss regularly. When that happens, dentures are often the most viable option.

""Hong Kong and Taiwan are just a short hop, skip and a jump away from each other,"" Michael notes. ""Many people use Hong Kong as a jumping off point for other Asian destinations, such as Thailand or Mainland China, but what they may not realize is that Taiwan is only a 95-minute flight away. People can experience both cultures and destinations easily thanks to frequent and easy connections between Hong Kong and Taiwan.""

The best time to travel to Hong Kong and Taiwan is in the spring or fall. With a subtropical monsoon climate, both destinations experience humid summers and short, relatively mild winters. Springtime offers cool evenings and the fall months have pleasant breezes and perfect temperatures.

“Our exercises target areas in the brain that cause specific academic or social weaknesses and seek to strengthen those areas so they can do their jobs properly,"" says Luciana Holmes, EA’s head cognitive teacher.

EA uses the Arrowsmith Program , which was developed by Canadian educator, Barbara Arrowsmith-Young. It’s a program for children with learning disabilities, but it doesn’t involve cognitive crutches or work-arounds like technology or extra time on tests. Instead, EA focuses on addressing the neurological causes of learning disabilities.

""We all understand that if you don't use something, you lose it,"" Holmes says. ""It's the same with the brain. Arrowsmith Program exercises are designed to challenge weaker parts of the brain. They work to strengthen those areas and prevent other, stronger areas, from jumping in to compensate.""

Holmes and her colleagues create motivations and reward systems for students as they progress through their programs. These include both individual and team incentives and emphasize success.

""We also practice mindfulness so students become more self-aware and analytical in their thoughts,” Holmes says. “It’s amazing to watch because they start to motivate themselves.""

EA offers hope to children who struggle in school and who have experienced ridicule, bullying, and negative feedback in the mainstream education system.

""This is a safe place,"" Holmes says. ""We provide a supportive environment to help children open up and work hard to build better lives for themselves.""

EA also supports students as they transition back into the mainstream school system.

“We work closely with receiving schools to make sure students get the help they need during the transition. Mainstream schools are very cooperative and understanding,"" Holmes says.

According to her, most children find the transition smooth and are very excited when they start to see their new strengths in action at school.

418,vancourier,https://www.vancourier.com/standout/air-conditioning-no-longer-a-nice-to-have-1.2292073,Air conditioning: no longer a “nice-to-have”,[],,"Do you remember when central air conditioning was considered an extravagance?

We recently caught up with Michael Hoang, marketing coordinator for Milani Plumbing, Drainage & Heating, to get his thoughts on the change in the way Vancouver home owners consider air conditioning in the home.

article continues below

“It used to be that an air conditioner was a luxury purchase,” he says. “Unlike a furnace, a boiler, or a hot water heater, which people have always seen as essential items, air conditioners were always a ‘nice-to-have’. However, with summers getting hotter, customers are noticing that cool air in the home can make their lives a lot more comfortable.”

Michael suggests that there are a number of things you should consider if you’re planning to purchase an air conditioning unit in the future:

· Consider the size of the area you’d like to cool

“Many people just want the benefit of cool air in the bedroom,” he says. “But you can also have a central air conditioning unit that will cool your whole house. Obviously that’s a little more expensive, but if you have a large house, it could be worth the investment.”

· Air Conditioner or Heat Pump?

“A heat pump can be a little more expensive,” Michael notes, “but it’s dual purpose: it will heat your home in the winter and cool you down in the summer.”

· Do you already have ducts in your home?

If you have a boiler, you likely don’t have any air ducts around your home. “If you don’t have ducts, you could consider a ductless-split, or mini-split, system,” says Michael. “But if you do have ducts, then we’d recommend a standard cooling system.”

· Do you live in a strata unit?

“Strata units are special situations,” says Michael. “To install an air conditioning unit, we typically need to cut a hole in the wall. This generally needs the approval of the property manager and/or the strata council. We recommend you seek this approval before arranging for us to come out and give you an estimate on installation.”

“The trend is definitely changing,” Michael adds. “We now see many people installing an air conditioning unit in their homes at the time of construction, whereas it used to be considered a luxury item people usually only thought about after the home was built.”

1. It’s been around since the mid-’90s

article continues below

Early versions of online casinos weren’t great: They couldn’t guarantee to protect your data and offered fewer opportunities than traditional gaming spaces. However, developers quickly caught on to the need for higher security, better graphics and more gaming features so that players had a better experience.

2. It’s a truly multi-platform experience

In the early years of online casinos, users needed to download software in order to play. This wasn’t compatible with all operating systems, took a while to download the first time, and occupied hard disk space. Smartphones improved things, though users still had to download an app to access games. Then more recently, HTML5 software was introduced, which allows you to play from your browser, whether you’re on mobile or computer, making it an easily accessible, multi-platform experience.

3. It’s growing faster than gambling in general

More people are gambling overall – from 2009 to 2015, there was an increase of around 30 per cent – but the market value of online casino playing doubled in the same time period, according to market-research agency Statista. By 2020, it is expected that the market will grow another 30% at least. New users can get more variety and gaming benefits like promotions, plus sophisticated graphics.

4. Technology is going to improve things even further

It’s hard to predict what will happen next since technology develops so quickly. What’s guaranteed is that things are going to get better. Virtual reality offers a major opportunity, and developers like NetEnt and Microgaming are working on introducing elements to create a ‘virtual world’ for slots, live-dealer games and other forms of gambling too. There could also be new gaming styles that are only possible with the advent of virtual-reality technology.

5. Security, reliability and trustworthiness are still paramount

User experience, whizzy graphics and futuristic functionality are important, but feeling confident that your data is secure and you’ll always be able to play, without crashes, is the top concern. The companies that will be best poised to garner new audiences are the ones they can rely on.",[]

The notion of establishing a framework to commercialize cannabis began as a promise by the Liberal Party in the 2015 federal election campaign that led to Justin Trudeau becoming prime minister. The implementation of the policy was not as smooth as first envisioned, and the provincial governments were put in charge of setting guidelines for the sale and consumption of marijuana.

article continues below

Research Co. and Glacier Media have been tracking perceptions about legalization every six months in British Columbia. Our latest survey shows that agreement with the new rules remains high across the entire province, that some residents are starting to ponder a future when other drugs could be treated in the same fashion as cannabis, and that – in stark contrast with what we found last year – marijuana users in British Columbia are starting to acquire all of their product through licensed retailers.

As more time passes, British Columbians appear happier with the decision to end prohibition. Seven in 10 of the province’s residents (70%) agree with marijuana being legal in Canada, while 26% disagree and 3% are undecided.

These findings represent a seven-point increase since a similar survey conducted in October 2019, as legal cannabis approached its first anniversary. The groups that are more likely to voice satisfaction with the new status quo are men (75%), British Columbians aged 35 to 54 (76%) and residents of northern B.C. (80%).

In recent weeks, we have seen more talk about creating a safe supply for drugs that are currently available only through illegal means. The impact of these discussions has led to a shift in the views of British Columbians about legalizing all drugs. It must be completely acknowledged that sizable majorities of the province’s residents continue to oppose a move to place any controlled substance inside a store, but the proponents of this option have grown since late last year.

At least two-thirds of British Columbians are opposed to legalizing ecstasy (66%), powder cocaine (70%), heroin (72%), crack cocaine (73%), methamphetamine or “crystal meth” (74%) and fentanyl (75%).

Support for making some of these drugs available in a fashion that would conceivably meet the same guidelines that govern cannabis has risen over the past six months, to 25% for cocaine (up from 18%) and to 24% for heroin (up from 19%). While these are still low proportions, the fluctuation could signal the start of a trend.

Just 10% of British Columbians say they only consumed marijuana after it became legal. Identical proportions of residents tried it before October 2018 (45%) or have never consumed it in Canada (also 45%). The incidence of “legal-only” marijuana users is highest among residents aged 18 to 34 (18%) and those who live in southern B.C. (19%).

But perhaps the biggest surprise, and a source of satisfaction for policy makers, is the way in which cannabis is being sought by users. Just over half of British Columbians who have consumed marijuana since legalization (51%) say that all of their product was acquired at a licensed retailer. In October 2019, only 31% of cannabis consumers in the province were getting all of their product at a licensed retailer.

We still see 16% of British Columbians who say none of their marijuana has been bought at a licensed retailer – a proportion that climbs to 25% among those aged 55 and over. Two-thirds of cannabis consumers aged 35 to 54 (68%) are buying all of their product at a licensed retailer.

Even though the delivery of cannabis products has improved over the past six months, there are significant regional differences that are indubitably related to the presence of stores in specific areas of the province. Cannabis consumers who reside in southern B.C. and Metro Vancouver are the most likely to be getting all of their product from licensed retailers (63% and 62%). The numbers are significantly lower in Vancouver Island (29%), northern B.C. (24%) and the Fraser Valley (19%).

Finally, the issue of “drug testing” remains a priority for British Columbians, with 61% saying that companies in the province should “definitely” or “probably” be able to administer these examinations to any employee now that marijuana is legal.

After a bumpy start that featured slow store openings and hitches with delivery options, there are signs that cannabis legalization is starting to work in a better fashion. More consumers are getting all of their product through licensed retailers, and the number of “new users” has not increased dramatically. Still, the significant regional disparities suggest that more marijuana outlets will need to be authorized in order to effectively eliminate the black market.

The ban could be in place next Tuesday after council reviews a staff report that also recommends a $1,000 fine be levied against anyone who sets off or sells a bear banger.

article continues below

Further penalties could include prosecution and loss of a business licence.

Residents, however, who require bangers for their intended purpose — wilderness encounters with animals, primarily bears — can continue to purchase them online or in stores outside Vancouver that carry the devices.

Earlier this month, council requested staff prepare amendments to the fire and ticket offences bylaws to ban the devices. In May, complaints began to pour in to the city’s 3-1-1 phone service of loud, explosive sounds heard throughout downtown and surrounding areas.

As of July 8, the city received 180 complaints and Vancouver police fielded reports of 327 over the same time period related to the devices. The report said some of the 507 calls could have been from the same caller about one incident.

Police say they don’t know what sparked the sudden use in bangers.

“I’m actually not too sure,” said Const. Tania Visintin, a VPD media relations officer, in an email Thursday.

Bangers, which are about the size of a roll of dimes, are usually fired from various types of launchers and can travel between 20 and 100 metres before letting out an explosive bang.

In some cases, police investigations discovered bangers were modified with ball bearings and a fuse for use as an improvised explosive device, or IED.

In one case, such a device was set off against the wall of a downtown building, shaking the walls and causing “significant distress to residents and people in the vicinity,” the staff report said.

In another case, police found a stuffed animal toy in a downtown park with an IED strapped to the underside. The report doesn’t indicate whether anyone has been injured from the devices.

The bangers can be purchased at outdoor supply stores in Vancouver and other parts of the region. A package of six typically sells for $20. Retailers are not required to maintain records of purchasers, or limit the number sold.

The sale of bear spray, however, requires the purchaser to be at least 18 years old and provide their name and address to a retailer, who records the amount purchased.

A signed “notice to purchaser agreement” is also part of the transaction, which outlines the legal uses of the spray and contains a liability warning.

The report said buyers of bear bangers tend to be people who work in forestry and mineral exploration, and people who spend time in the outdoors for recreation such as hiking, camping and mountain biking.

In preparing the report, staff consulted nine retailers and three suppliers of bangers. Others consulted included outdoor recreation clubs and associations, conservationist groups, conservation officers, industries that use the devices in the field to protect workers and the B.C. Society for the Prevention of Cruelty towards Animals (BCSPCA).

“Most of the groups consulted were supportive of a ban on the discharge and retail sale of exploding animal deterrents in Vancouver, with the exception of some retailers and a few outdoor recreation and industry groups that do not support a ban on sale,” said the report, noting gun stores were among those opposed to the ban on sales of bangers.

One supplier, the report added, thought prohibition of bangers would be an “extreme reaction” to take by council. Meanwhile, the BCSPCA told staff it was unaware of any documented cases of pets in distress, or gone missing because of noise made by bangers.

But, the report added, that may be because cases attributed to fireworks were actually due to bear bangers, with pet owners likely unable to distinguish between the two sounds.

This Halloween will be the last one for Vancouver residents who like to set off fireworks, with council deciding in November 2019 to ban the sale and use of fireworks to and by the general public after Oct. 31, 2020.

If council passes the staff recommendations Tuesday, Vancouver will join Delta, Pitt Meadows, Township of Langley, Rossland, Vernon and Dawson Creek as cities that have either regulated or banned the use of bangers.

Provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix announced July 15 that there were 21 new cases in the past 24 hours, including two cases that they call ""epi-linked,"" or presumed cases that have not been proven through testing but are being treated as official cases.

article continues below

The province has now recorded 3,149 cases since the novel coronavirus first appeared in B.C. in late January.

More than 87.4% of those infected, or 2,753 people, have recovered. Of those who haven't, 189 people have died and 207 people are actively fighting the virus. Only 14 people are hospitalized, with five of those in intensive care units. The rest are self-isolating at home. There were no new deaths recorded in the past 24 hours.

Recording at least 20 new COVID-19 cases in a 24-hour period has become common in B.C., and Henry said yesterday that she found that number ""distressing,"" even though, she added, the good news is that the province knows where the clusters of infection are, many of the infections are linked and the number is not really that large given the province's population of more than five million residents.

The numbers in the past week were:

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12;

• 21 new cases on July 13;

• 13 new cases on July 14; and now

• 21 new cases on July 15.

In June, the number of daily new cases many times was in the single digits.

""There is one active community outbreak, in addition to several community exposure events,"" Henry and Dix said. ""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks.""

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,023 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,659 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 216 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 51 people who reside outside Canada.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons is expected to take Sidoo into custody on September 23 and release him from a Pacific Northwest area facility just before Christmas.

article continues below

Sidoo, 61, appeared online via Zoom in front of United States District Judge Nathaniel Gorton of the United States District Court for District of Massachusetts, as well as his lawyers and prosecutors. He wore a plaid suit while sitting in an office space inside his $31.7 million home in Vancouver’s Point Grey neighbourhood.

Sidoo, now a convicted felon, initially pled innocent to fraud and money laundering charges; he teared up before being sentenced and read a prepared statement:

“The last several months have been the hardest in my entire life and today I accept the court’s decision without reservation. No words can express how sorry I am for my decisions and actions that led to this day. I make no excuses, your honour. I broke the law and pled guilty and I now must pay for my actions.

“To my wife and boys, all I ever wanted was your love and respect and to be a good role model. And I know I have made a terrible mistake that has deeply affected our family. To my friends and colleagues and former teammates over the years, I am deeply ashamed today. To the young men and women who looked up to me as a role model, you deserve better. To the court and all of you, I wish to apologize for my actions.

“I will serve my sentence and am committed to returning to the community and doing everything possible to make a positive impact. I hope in time people will not judge me for the worst mistake in my life but for the work in the days, weeks and years ahead in which I am committed to being a better man.”

Gorton told Sidoo he was “impressed” by the businessman’s “obvious remorse.”

But Gorton pointed out two omissions in Sidoo’s statement.

“You expect to put this behind you and go forward and make up for what you called mistakes. I would call it a crime, not a mistake, but nevertheless, it is important that you acknowledge it and realize how many constituencies you have disappointed,” said the judge.

Sidoo also did not explicitly acknowledge that his crimes resulted in two students missing an opportunity to attend the universities his sons, Dylan Sidoo and Jordan Sidoo, were admitted to.

“What you accomplished, along with getting them into college, is to deprive two other deserving students of admittance into those universities — an act that is the very antithesis of one you want to be known for,” said Gorton.

Likewise, United States Attorney Andrew Lelling submitted to Gorton: “Sidoo engaged in serious criminal conduct involving fraud and deception that stretched over multiple years.

“His crimes warrant significant punishment. By engaging in the scheme, with [scheme mastermind Rick Singer] and others, Sidoo was able to steal two college admissions slots for his sons, including one from the University of California at Berkeley, one of the top public universities in the nation.”

Sidoo, said Gorton, “committed a crime that displayed an unbelievable lack of integrity, morality and common sense.

“You have let your selfish desire, your pride and your enormous wealth overcome all of what you apparently want to stand for with your works of charity,” Gorton told Sidoo.

Sidoo’s philanthropy, derived from his earnings in the capital markets, was central to his sentencing defense. According to Sidoo he has donated several million dollars to charitable causes, such as the University of B.C. football program.

In pleading guilty to fraud, Sidoo avoided a maximum prison term of 20 years and prosecutors subsequently agreed to 90 days behind bars, plus a $250,000 fine and one-year of supervised release, which will not be enforced in Canada by the U.S. Probation Department. Prosecutors also agreed to drop the money laundering charge.

The prison Sidoo goes to is expected to have harsher conditions since his options are limited due to his foreign citizenship. His attorney Martin Weinberg said he is expected to spend 14 days in isolation in a “maximum security setting,” due to COVID-19.

Sidoo will get four days credit for time already served. If he serves the full 90 days he will be released December 17 but will have to spend 14 days in isolation at home should B.C. public health rules for international travellers and COVID-19 continue into the fall.

Gorton said Sidoo’s crime would normally warrant more time in jail but there are mitigating circumstances, such as his remorse, lack of criminal record, philanthropy and “collateral consequences,” such as not being able to enter the U.S. as a felon and being stripped last month of his Order of B.C. medal for community service. Sidoo’s attorneys also previously noted he did not directly pay the universities but that his fraud was limited to cheating on the tests.

The former B.C. Lions football player worked as a stock broker in the 1990s and an investment banker between 2000 and 2010. Since 2010 he has made millions of dollars directing a handful of public companies that have failed to generate wealth for retail investors.

Sidoo was arrested March 8, 2019, in San Jose, California, on charges by the U.S. Department of Justice of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering related to the high-profile U.S. college admissions and bribery scandal, brought to light by a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe dubbed Operation Varsity Blues.

One of dozens of parents to be charged, Sidoo initially pled innocent to paying $200,000 total to scheme mastermind William ‘Rick’ Singer, who hired corrupt exam expert Mark Riddell to take Dylan and Jordan’s SAT exams, in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Sidoo also helped falsify one of his son Jordan’s university applications in October 2013 with an essay that originally included a fake claim of Jordan being held up at gunpoint by gangsters, while he was purported to be an intern for an anti-gang organization.

Co-conspirators Singer and Riddell pled guilty last year in exchange for cooperating with the government’s investigation.

The guilty parties in the case, who used Singer’s criminal services, were generally well-off individuals. Celebrities such as actress Lori Loughlin and her clothing designer husband Mossimo Gianulli and actress Felicity Huffman also pled guilty for related crimes and brought much media attention to the investigation.

Sidoo’s sons had no involvement in their father’s crime.

Jordan is now a 2018 history graduate from University of California Berkeley. Dylan graduated in cinematic arts in 2016 from the University of Southern California (USC). The two previously attended Vancouver’s prestigious St. George’s School.

Neither university has announced whether or not their degrees will remain valid. Dylan, according to the sentencing documents, had scored a 1,460/2,400 SAT score until Riddell, using a fake ID in December 2011, bumped up the score to 1,700, which was high enough for Dylan to enter Chapman University (and later transfer to USC). Riddell then scored 2,280/2,400 for Jordan in December 2012, paving the way to Berkley.

Riddell also took a high school test for Dylan. The B.C. Ministry of Education has issued no statement on how its testing process was so vulnerable to fraud.

Both sons have since entered into penny stock promotion with their father.

But for those who refuse to leave, like the dozens of people camped out since last month in Strathcona Park, the new version of the “parks control bylaw” will test how far the board is willing to go to clear an encampment.

article continues below

So far, it appears the tent city will remain, at least as far as Shauna Wilton, acting park board general manager, indicated on the first of two nights of meetings to consider the bylaw revisions.

“This [revised bylaw] was not targeted at Strathcona specifically, but is something that we need to do broadly, knowing the impact to all of the park system from homelessness and sheltering,” Wilton told commissioners Monday.

“I think what this bylaw will do is to give our staff a tool for ongoing discussion with those in the encampment, in terms of trying to manage that space.”

More than 200 tents are pitched in the far end of Strathcona Park. The encampment borders a parking area on Raymur Avenue, where people also live in recreational vehicles, vans and cars.

The changes to the bylaw were made to put the park board in line with a B.C. Supreme Court ruling that gave homeless people the constitutional right to sleep overnight in a park.

But the park board also made a series of significant additions to the bylaw, including setting criteria that limits homeless people to sleep in 26 per cent, or 867 acres of a possible 3,320 acres of park and green space.

The board hasn’t identified specific parks that would fall under the 26 per cent, but the criteria prevents temporary shelters to be erected near schools, playgrounds, sports fields, beaches, community centres, golf courses, the seawall, environmentally sensitive areas, gardens, horticultural displays and picnic areas.

The bylaw also requires homeless people to only occupy a three-metre by three-metre space and not to leave a tent, or structure, unattended. People also must pack up in the morning and leave a park or green space.

Whether that will be enforced by park rangers, who work closely with police, was not made clear during debate, with many speakers suggesting it was an impossible task.

What was made clear by commissioners, including board chairperson Camil Dumont and many of the dozens of people who spoke at the meetings, was that addressing homelessness was not the park board’s mandate.

“We need help — we need help from the city, we need help from the province, we need help from the federal government to provide wraparound services to build into the system solutions for these problems,” Dumont said.

“We can’t do it alone, as the park board. We can be willing partners in the conversation and I understand us to be that.”

Dumont joined commissioners Stuart Mackinnon, Dave Demers and Gwen Giesbrecht in supporting the revised bylaw. All had different reasons for their support, but emphasized the need to have the bylaw upgraded to adhere to the B.C. Supreme court ruling.

“We are here not because any of us want to be, but because of a court ruling we need to be,” Mackinnon said.

“Our current bylaws have been deemed an infringement of individual rights under our Charter by the courts, and as such, need to be changed. For some, change is unacceptable. But as an elected official of government, I have no choice but to ensure our bylaws are in compliance with the courts, the laws and the constitution.”

Added Mackinnon: “We are also here because of the failure of senior governments to recognize for too long the epidemic of homelessness. Many people who wrote said this is not park board’s responsibility, and I agree — the park board should not have to deal with this social problem.”

Demers: “We’re not pretending to be solving the root causes of homelessness here. That does not belong at park board. It’s not our mandate. This bylaw is simply a tool to help us deal with the situation the best way we can.”

Giesbrecht said the revised bylaw in no way addresses “how the people in this city — way, way too many of them — are displaced and experience homelessness.”

She said she made her vote with a heavy heart, knowing the bylaw gives the park board legal authority to dismantle communities of homeless people.

But Giesbrecht said she will never grant an injunction to remove homeless people.

“On those conditions, I will vote in support of these bylaw amendments, but not if they’re used as a tool to throw people out of their communities that they’ve established,” she said.

“We call them parks, but really they are the land of Vancouver.”

Commissioners Tricia Barker and John Coupar, who voted against the staff recommendation to upgrade the bylaw, said they worried such a move would encourage more people to sleep in parks.

“I feel strongly that our mandate is to look after parks, and make sure we have clean and safe parks for everybody,” Coupar said.

“I think it’s the wrong thing for the Vancouver park board to do, and I’m hearing a lot in the community that people are concerned about it, and what it will lead to across our city.”

Barker: “I believe the bylaw doesn’t solve problems that we’re having in our parks today. Listening to all the people speak and reading all the emails, talking to people on the street, people aren’t feeling safe in our parks right now.”

Comm. John Irwin also voted against the revised bylaw after failed attempts to defer the decision to another meeting in September so more consultation could be done with homeless people and Indigenous groups.

“We have left the bylaw renewal because of COVID, and because not quite getting on it when we could have, and so I don’t see that a few months delay will matter that much,” Irwin said.

The city conducted a homeless count in March but has yet to release the findings. In March 2019, volunteers counted a record-breaking 2,223 homeless people. Coun. Jean Swanson suggested to commissioners Monday that number had increased by another 200 people.

What are the legal obligations for employers toward employees in the pandemic? Lindsie Thomson, managing partner at the Harris and Co. law firm, discusses the challenges of remote work and returning to work as part of a week-long video podcast series on human resources.

Exactly one week ago, on July 7, the province recorded 12 new cases. What followed was an uptick in recorded cases:

• 18 new cases on July 8;

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12; and

• 21 new cases on July 13.

article continues below

""I know it was distressing to me to see 20, especially 25 [new cases] one day,"" Henry said. ""That's way above my comfort zone.""

She added, however, that the slight rise in cases was not unexpected, given that the province has been allowing restaurants and other indoor businesses to reopen.

""We do know where those cases are,"" she said. ""We're testing the people who need to be tested.""

It would be more concerning, she said, if the cases were spread out across the province in an unlinked way. The most recent cluster of cases is linked to the Krazy Cherry Fruit Company in Oliver, she announced yesterday (July 13).

Given B.C.'s population, 20 cases in one day is also better than some other jurisdictions, she said.

The province has identified 3,128 infections since the virus first appeared in the province in late January.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,015 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1649 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 212 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 52 people who reside outside Canada.

Of the 209 people currently fighting COVID-19 in B.C., 14 people are in hospital with five of those in intensive care units. That leaves 2,730 people who have recovered from the virus.

No new deaths from the virus were identified in the past 24 hours, leaving the death toll at 189 people.

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

So far 399 residents and 252 staff at seniors' care facilities have been infected by COVID-19 in B.C.

Health Minister Adrian Dix said that it is his understanding that the federal government and the U.S. government have agreed to extend the closure of the two countries' border for one additional month, until August 21.

""This is obviously positive and necessary news,"" he said. ""Everybody who lives in B.C. knows how inconvenient and how difficult that is for many businesses and many individuals for a variety of circumstances.""

Harry Bains said injured workers have complained for too long that the system lacks fairness and support in times of injury and recovery.

article continues below

Changes Bains proposes include raising the maximum annual salary on which compensation benefits are based; authorizing WorkSafeBC to provide preventative medical treatment before claim acceptance; giving powers to the court to issue WorkSafeBC search and seizure warrants appropriate for investigating workplace safety infractions; and giving people a voice in serious workplace prosecutions and trials by using victim impact statements.

Victoria is also fast-tracking legislation to handle situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic so workers can access benefits more easily.

During the pandemic, the regulator is allowing businesses to defer paying their premiums for six months without penalty or interest. It is also waiving premiums on wages paid to workers of employers receiving the Canadian Emergency Wage Subsidy.

The amendments to the Workers Compensation Act comes after three expert reviews were completed in 2018 and 2019.

The ministry said of the more than 44,000 injured workers currently receiving permanent disability benefits because of a work-related injury, about 35% are in the Lower Mainland, while the rest are spread throughout all regions of B.C.

There are more than 100,000 workplace injury or fatality claims annually.

In 2019, there were 140 workplace fatalities in B.C. Of that number, 84 were due to occupational disease, 40 to traumatic injury and 16 the result of a motor vehicle incident.

In a fiscal update Tuesday, B.C. Finance Minister Carole James said the COVID-19 pandemic will result in ""the worst downturn experienced in our province in recent history.""

article continues below

""The projected numbers are staggering, but they're not without hope,"" James said, in summing up B.C.'s fiscal position.

She said B.C. had entered the pandemic perhaps better situated than other provinces, as it had a balanced budget, a triple AAA credit rating and one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country.

B.C. also managed to contain the pandemic and flatten its growth curve better than some other provinces, and it has been able to move earlier on a phased economic restart plan.

""Because of that strength, we were able to take immediate action to help people, to help businesses, to help communities with our $5 billion COVID action plan,"" James said.

She said the province is expecting a loss of $4.2 billion in tax revenue, including $1 billion less in personal income tax revenue, $973 million less in corporate taxes, $1.3 billion in provincial sales tax revenue, $300 million in natural resource revenues and $882 million less in Crown Corporation income.

The province is also spending $5 billion in emergency spending, and has approved $1.3 billion in tax credits and deferrals. In total, the increased spending, lost tax revenue and foregone revenue will bring the deficit to $12.5 billion.

In February, James brought down, but never passed, a balanced budget and modest surplus of $227 million and provincial GDP growth projections of 2% in 2020.

""Mere weeks after the budget 2020 was tabled, our entire world changed,"" James said.

James said the B.C. economy is now expected to contract 6.8% in 2020, according to some forecasters.

Since February, B.C. lost 235,000 jobs, and saw retail sales declined by 23.6% in April compared to February. Overall, home prices dropped 4%.

Home sales declined 45.4% in May, compared to February, and B.C. merchandise exports are down 14.7% year-to-date, compared to January to May 2019.

""While the job losses in March and April were record-breaking, figures for May and June in fact have seen some recovery of the losses that we experienced in the previous two months,"" James said.

Asked if her government planned to resort to spending cuts to address the deficit, James said ""now is not the time to be able to cut back on services and support for people and business in British Columbia.""

As for any long-range plans for dealing with debt and deficits, James said: ""I do not believe that it's going to be a quick fix.""

Asked if the $5 billion that her government has already approved could be added to later this year, James said ""I believe the $5 billion is enough now.""

However, she added no one can predict what might happen should there be a second wave of COVID-19.

As for the $22 billion in capital spending allocated in the 2020 budget over three years for big capital works projects, like new schools, hospitals, bridges and roads, that will continue to be spent.

""This is going to serve us very well because it translates into huge investments,"" James said.

438,vancourier,http://www.vancourier.com/gun-violence-imported-from-u-s-is-a-key-concern-for-canadians-1.24169958,Gun violence imported from U.S. is a key concern for Canadians,['Mario Canseco'],,"National governments have a tendency to overreact immediately after they are forced to face an unexpected challenge. No example is better than the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks in the United States, which gave us the “Patriot Act” after just 45 days of deliberation to expand government surveillance of Americans to previously unimagined levels.

In mid-April, the actions of Gabriel Wortman led to the deaths of 22 people in Nova Scotia after multiple shootings and fires. Most Canadians, at the time still under lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, were horrified at Wortman’s actions, which included impersonating a police officer.

article continues below

It took the federal government only 13 days after Wortman’s criminal activity was evident for the entire country to announce a nationwide ban on 1,500 types of military-grade “assault-style” weapons in Canada. Any Canadian who possesses these firearms will have two years to get rid of them. The prohibition led to many new discussions about the role that firearms play in Canada’s urban and rural areas.

We know now that the perpetrator of the 22 murders in Nova Scotia had obtained his weapons illegally from Canadian and American sources. This was not a surprise for Canadian authorities, who have consistently reported that more than 70% of the weapons used in gun-related crimes in our country come from the United States.

On the issue of firearms, Canada is decidedly different from the United States. In Canada, it is not legal for a person to own or carry a firearm for the purpose of self defence against human beings. When Research Co. and Glacier Media asked Canadians about this key precept of Canadian law, more than three in four (77%) agreed with it, while 18% disagreed and 5% were undecided.

Atlantic Canada (31%), Saskatchewan and Manitoba (29%) and Alberta (24%) boast the highest number of residents who openly question Canada’s long-standing regulations for firearms. While higher than what is observed in Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia, these are not proportions of voters that would sway an election, certainly not in the way American statewide and congressional races can be tilted if your candidate can adequately hold a shotgun and recite the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution in a manner that panders to the base.

Fewer than one in five Canadians welcome the notion of citizens carrying firearms for something other than hunting or scaring wildlife away. Any survey measuring opinions on banning “assault-style” weapons would be met with near unanimity. The opposition reacted to the announced ban as it always has under its outgoing leader, by claiming the regulations would affect law-abiding Canadians. Lost in this unfortunate combination of inadequate polling and incapable opposition are the solutions that matter to Canadians.

In our survey, more than three in five Canadians (63%) told us that gun violence in Canada is a “very serious” or “moderately serious” problem – a proportion that climbs to 69% among women and 68% among those aged 55 and over.

Sizable majorities of Ontarians and British Columbians, who have experienced gang wars in urban areas, are more likely to look at gun violence as particularly problematic (76% and 67%, respectively). The COVID-19 pandemic did little to curb gun violence in Toronto, where 61 people were shot in the first four months of the year.

We asked Canadians about the effectiveness of four possible measures, and their responses outline a public that is ready for bold action. More than three in five Canadians (62%) think enacting a complete ban on handguns would be “very effective” or “moderately effective” in reducing gun violence in Canada. Most crimes, after all, are not being committed with the military-grade “assault-style” weapons that the federal government was quick to ban.

A higher proportion of Canadians deem two other measures as effective: imposing mandatory jail terms for crimes committed with firearms (74%) and introducing new outreach programs to steer youth away from gangs (also 74%).

Canadians place dealing with firearms smuggled from the United States as the most important issue that needs to be addressed. Many of the country’s residents also want to make sure gangs are not attractive to our country’s youth and believe mandatory minimum jail sentences would act as a deterrent.

Banning military-grade “assault-style” weapons is low-hanging fruit in a challenge that definitely has Canadians preoccupied and wishing for a type of government intervention that goes beyond a photo-op celebrated by poorly executed survey charity work.

True sociologists know that we learn nothing from posing the wrong questions to Canadians, and capable politicians should go beyond voicing displeasure with plans and proposals just because that is what they are expected to do. Meanwhile, Canadians are still worried about gun violence and expecting their elected officials to do better. •

439,vancourier,http://www.vancourier.com/news/moving-strathcona-park-tent-city-doesn-t-solve-problem-of-homelessness-1.24169951,Moving Strathcona Park tent city ‘doesn’t solve problem’ of homelessness,['Mike Howell'],,"A new version of a bylaw that aims to limit the number of Vancouver parks and public green space where homeless people can legally sleep overnight is not designed to dismantle the city’s newest and biggest homeless encampment at Strathcona Park.

That was made clear by Shauna Wilton, the acting-general manager of the park board, at a meeting Monday in which several disappointed Strathcona residents outlined their concerns over the state of the growing tent city.

article continues below

“This [revised bylaw] was not targeted at Strathcona specifically, but is something that we need to do broadly, knowing the impact to all of the park system from homelessness and sheltering,” Wilton told park board commissioners.

“I think what this bylaw will do is to give our staff a tool for ongoing discussion with those in the encampment, in terms of trying to manage that space.”

She noted the long-running Oppenheimer Park encampment was cleared after an emergency order from the provincial government related to COVID-19. The subsequent CRAB Park tent city was shut down after the Port Authority was granted a court injunction that was enforced by police.

“The reality we’ve seen now is there is a homeless population in Vancouver that requires a place to be,” Wilton said.

“Now that we’ve had encampments in Oppenheimer, on the Port lands [at CRAB Park], and certainly now in Strathcona, moving them again doesn’t necessarily solve the problem.”

The present version of the parks control bylaw does not permit people to remain in parks overnight, or to erect temporary structures. That bylaw, however, has not been enforced because of a B.C. Supreme Court ruling that gives homeless people the constitutional right to sleep in a park overnight.

The changes to the bylaw seek to strike a balance between honouring those rights and the needs of people who regularly use the city’s parks, including the Strathcona residents who spoke Monday to park board commissioners.

Commissioners are expected to vote on the revised bylaw Tuesday night, after running out of time Monday night to hear from all 88 people who registered to speak.

Many who spoke Monday identified as Strathcona residents and a majority said they supported updating the bylaw, but were disappointed nothing will immediately be done to address the encampment in their neighbourhood park.

Collectively, residents told commissioners the encampment, which has grown to more than 200 tents, has been the scene of assaults, drug use and fires.

It’s also served as a centre for bicycle “chop shops” and stolen property, making the park unsafe for residents and young families who depend on the green space for outings, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.

At the same time, residents such as Katie Lewis said she understood the plight of homeless people and that addressing homelessness is not the mandate of the resource-stretched park board.

“I just don’t feel that this should all fall onto your laps,” said Lewis, vice-president of the Strathcona Residents’ Association, who urged commissioners to seek help from senior governments.

The mother of young twins said she’s heard from many neighbours representing a wide spectrum of views on the encampment, which started in the park last month after people were forced to leave CRAB Park’s tent city on the waterfront.

“The one thing I am really hearing loud and clear is that Strathcona Park is not set up for a large, long-term encampment,” she said, noting it represents 80 per cent of Strathcona’s green space and has shut out residents.

Ted Bairstow lives across the street from Strathcona Park and said he was more concerned about the tent city Monday than when he put his name on the list a few days ago to speak to the revised bylaw.

“Last night, someone broke into my car, took the door opener to my garage, opened the garage and stole two bicycles from it,” Bairstow said.

“I have no idea whether there’s a direct link to the encampment in the park, but it’s hard to believe that there isn’t.”

The proposed changes don’t identify which parks or green space would be open to overnight camping, but park board staff estimated it would amount to 26 per cent, or 867 acres of a possible 3,320 acres.

That 26 per cent is based on a long list of criteria that would prevent temporary shelters to be erected near schools, playgrounds, sports fields, beaches, community centres, golf courses, the seawall, environmentally sensitive areas, gardens, horticultural displays and picnic areas.

Enforcing the bylaw will be challenging, with commissioners hearing Monday that 85 per cent of park rangers’ workload already involves monitoring and managing homeless shelters in parks.

In October 2019, rangers did an audit of all parks to assess and identify temporary homeless shelter activity in parks. In addition to 107 counted at the time in Oppenheimer Park, they counted a total of 405 occurrences within 116 parks.

Housing advocate Fiona York urged commissioners to pause further discussion of the proposed changes to the bylaw until the pandemic is declared over. She said homeless people were not consulted about the changes, which call for people to have to pack up their gear after each night they sleep in a public space.

“During COVID, the recommendation [from Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry] is to shelter in place, and that’s what is being provided right now by not having a bylaw in place that allows for daily displacement,” York said.

“We know about the health effects of daily displacement. It’s talked about by many public health officials in terms of COVID, but also there’s the mental, emotional, psychological trauma and impacts of being displaced on a daily basis.”

City councillors Jean Swanson and Pete Fry also spoke to commissioners, with Swanson echoing York’s concerns about daily displacement, saying “it’s cruel to make people pack up and move every day.”

Fry, a longtime Strathcona resident, said he supported changes to the bylaw but believed commissioners were unfairly forced to bear the burden of failures of other orders of government, despite Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s proclamation two years ago that housing is a human right in Canada.

“We still haven’t seen any real meaningful delivery on that promise,” Fry said.

“And despite the investments from the provincial government — at a level of commitment that we haven’t seen in years — we’re still barely making a dent on delivering mental health and addictions supports, or the housing needed to deal with the crisis that’s unfolding here on our streets in Vancouver, but also across our province.”

Fry, though, said the tent city at Strathcona Park has become dangerous for residents, particularly those who have visited the encampment in an attempt to retrieve their stolen property.

“Which is obviously a risky proposition for all parties involved,” he said.

“There have been trip-line booby traps, bear bangers shot at park users, threats with weapons, swarmings, verbal accosting and physical assaults directly as a result of the encampment.”

Commissioners meet again Tuesday night at 6 p.m. to hear from the remainder of registered speakers. If commissioners approve the revised bylaw, it will go before them again at a future meeting for enactment.

That brings the total confirmed cases to 3,115. Of that number, 51 are non-residents who live outside of Canada but are currently in B.C.

There have been two deaths since Friday attributed to COVID-19. While there have been no new community outbreaks in long-term care or acute care facilities, there have been a number of community exposure events in the Okanagan.

Public health has issued an isolation order for the Krazy Cherry Fruit Co. in Oliver, where two cases have been identified at the farm. Interior Health has also issued alerts for possible community exposure events in Kelowna.

The authorization would have expired July 15.

Prior to the measure, restaurants and bars were in general only allowed to sell liquor for consumption at their establishments. The sale of alcohol for off-site consumption has provided businesses with an additional source of revenue during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Now with some destinations looking to slowly reopen and, in an effort to catch a glimpse of future travel trends, I’m continuing to reach out to travel experts and tourism bureaus across Canada and the globe for answers to five similar questions.

And while no one can predict the future, all are hopeful travel will soon resume. But, how exactly that will look is anyone’s guess.

Five questions with Peter Mayers, Canadian director for Barbados Tourism Marketing Inc.

How has Barbados been coping amid COVID?

As a Caribbean destination, Barbados’ economy is reliant on the tourism industry and the pandemic has greatly impacted the country.

However, the small but mighty island is persevering. We have demonstrated resiliency and ingenuity, taking the downtime as an opportunity to refurbish hotel properties, train hospitality staff, rethink health and safety measures and provide respite for nature.

Many of Barbados’ top hotels have used this time to deep clean properties and rethink health and safety protocols, including Bougainvillea Beach Resort, The Crane Resort, Dover Beach Hotel and Ocean Hotels Barbados.

The public spaces within most hotels have been reimagined to encourage social distancing and the guest experience is being reworked to offer as many contactless capabilities as possible.

Barbadian rum distilleries, such as the West Indies Rum Distillery, have been taking this downtime to help in any way they can amid the pandemic by producing both surgical alcohol and hand sanitizer.

These materials have been donated to public health officials and local communities to help ensure that health and safety is uppermost in our thoughts, which is a testament to the warmth of Bajan people.

Barbados has been making the most of the downtime posed by COVID, well-positioning the island to confidently welcome visitors once again with travellers’ peace of mind at heart.

What can visitors anticipate upon reopening?

When Canadians begin to visit Barbados once again, they can expect to feel at ease and confident that their best interest is at heart.

All entities will be observing social distancing and sanitization practices to ensure that guest experiences are seamless from the moment they land in destination, to the moment they are revisiting the airport to return home.

While new levels of sanitization will be in place, guests can still expect the same Bajan warm welcome throughout their trip!

As of June 15, 2020, all businesses have reopened and parks and beaches no longer have restricted hours.

As of July 1, 2020, curfew restrictions were lifted and physical distancing reduced to one metre, offering a sense of normalization across the island.

What are some of the things that you personally love about Barbados?

Bajan cuisine and sailing quickly come to mind, especially when combined, but it is wonderful spirit of our people that make Barbados such a unique and special destination.

Our hospitality is unmatched, which showcases the safety of the island. Visitors can go for walks along the beach, head to a local party or hop on a public bus and be greeted with a warm smile and energizing conversation.

We love to share stories of our home and are eager to give the same memorable experience to our Canadian visitors.

Why will Barbados be an attractive destination to Canadians in a post-COVID?

Canadians love exploring and being enveloped in nature, and Barbados is a destination that is abundant in pristine wildlife and natural playgrounds.

What makes Barbados such a great post-COVID travel destination is that visitors can take refuge in nature and spend their days hiking open trails, sailing the open seas or soaking up the sun on one of the many sprawling coastlines.

My recommendation is visiting Coco Hill for some green therapy in the beautiful and hilly rainforest, followed by seaside brunch consisting of healthy and delicious food.

Barbados is also a naturally remote destination, further from its Caribbean island counterparts, providing both the tranquil and pristine Caribbean Sea on the West Coast and the sleepy East Coast villages along the Atlantic shore.

The East Coast lends itself nicely to social distancing and allows for a sense of privacy that many Canadians have been vying for during quarantine, plus you get to be in Barbados!

When can Canadians expect to find regular flights to Barbados once again?

With the Grantley Adams International Airport aiming to reopen at the end of the month, individual air carriers have shared plans to resume regular flights in tandem with the airport reopening.

Air Canada has resumed flights from Toronto to Bridgetown with two weekly flights and the international airport officially opened July 12.

I recommend visiting visitbarbados.org for updates and more inspiring stories of our Bajan culture.

444,vancourier,http://www.vancourier.com/opinion/call-for-decriminalization-of-drugs-an-old-story-in-vancouver-1.24169505,Call for decriminalization of drugs an old story in Vancouver,['Mike Howell'],,"So the country’s top cops want to decriminalize drug use now.

Maybe you heard the news last Thursday that the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police called for the decriminalization of people found with illicit drugs for personal use.

article continues below

Kind of a big deal.

That is, of course, if you live in a Canadian city other than Vancouver.

As I was reminded by a retired high-ranking Vancouver police officer a few hours after news broke of the chiefs’ support for decriminalization, the addiction-is-not-a-crime-and-should-be-treated-as-a-health-care-issue position is not revolutionary in these parts.

In fact, Kash Heed joked that he should sue the chiefs for plagiarism.

That joke was based on a serious presentation he made Nov. 7, 2001 to the Senate Special Committee on Illegal Drugs. At the time, Heed was an inspector with the Vancouver Police Department in charge of the drug and vice sections.

The focus of his presentation concerned marijuana, but he made clear what the VPD’s approach was on people caught with all types of drugs for personal use, including heroin and cocaine.

“The Vancouver Police Department’s policies focus drug enforcement resources on people who are making a profit from the sale of drugs,” Heed said almost two decades ago.

“Generally, simple possession charges are not pursued, regardless of the type of drug unless there are extenuating circumstances. We recognize that many of the people who use, or are addicted to drugs must be dealt with outside of the law enforcement system.”

In practical terms, he continued, Vancouver has “de facto decriminalization or de facto legalization” based on the wide margin of discretion afforded to the police. For marijuana specifically, Heed said he wasn’t alone in going on record in support of removal of criminal penalties for possession of the now-legal drug for personal use.

Nineteen years later, one of Heed’s former colleagues, Adam Palmer, spoke to reporters last Thursday as president of the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police (CACP). Palmer is, of course, Vancouver’s police chief.

See if you notice any similarities in what Palmer said in 2020 to what Heed said in 2001.

“Being addicted to a controlled substance is not a crime and should not be treated as such,” he said from the VPD’s Cambie Street precinct.

“We are calling for the decriminalization of illicit drugs for personal possession of illegal substances. The CACP endorses alternatives to criminal sanctions for simple possession of illicit drugs for personal consumption. In other words, we recommend that Canada’s enforcement-based approach for possession be replaced with a health care approach that diverts people towards social and healthcare services and away from the criminal justice system.”

He continued: “Instead of police agencies recommending or laying criminal charges, we are suggesting that partnerships be formed and strengthened between healthcare, government, police and social service providers to ensure drug users have timely access to appropriate health, social and treatment services.”

As president of the chiefs’ organization, Palmer was reiterating what he’s already said numerous times in his tenure as Vancouver chief — that drug addiction is not a crime, more treatment is needed and such treatment should include a safe supply of prescription alternatives to deadly street drugs.

That’s all on the record, and has been for some time.

So has the VPD’s support of injection sites, with Vancouver being the first city in North America to allow a legal site — Insite on East Hastings — which opened in September 2003.

But, as reporters heard Thursday, Canadian police forces continue to arrest people for simple possession of drugs.

Waterloo Police Service Chief Bryan Larkin, who joined the news conference via telephone, said Ontario typically has the highest charge rate across Canada for simple possession. But those charges are beginning to drop off, he said, although he didn’t provide statistics.

“What we’ve seen in the last two years is a decline in simple possession charges,” Larkin said.

“We started to see a trend, not only in Waterloo, but across Ontario where officers are looking at more diversion — individuals who are chronic drug users now actually being diverted and, or, put towards acute care intervention.”

At the same time, seeking an alternative to a charge heavily depends on what type of treatment facilities and programs are available in the cities in which police work. As we’ve seen in Vancouver, there aren’t enough.

Canada, however, has made some significant gains in harm reduction since Heed’s presentation in 2001 to the Senate committee, with 49 injection sites now operating in the country. Another 14 applications are under review from Health Canada.

Safe supply is also available in B.C., including prescription heroin for a select group of less than 200 people. The last time I spoke to Judy Darcy, B.C.’s Minister of Mental Health and Addictions, she told me 3,500 more people in B.C. receive medication-assisted treatment than when the NDP took office in July 2017.

Three forms of methadone, hydromorphone, morphine and Suboxone were among the medications she mentioned.

Regardless of those gains, decriminalization — whether defacto, or not — doesn’t legally exist in this country and now we have another organization calling for it to be written or edited in law.

Palmer and his fellow chiefs want a national task force created to research drug policy reform, and they want government to amend the section of the federal Controlled Drugs and Substances Act related to simple possession.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who often talks about evidence-based approaches to policy, has repeatedly said his government doesn’t support decriminalization. That position does not appear to have shifted with pressure from police chiefs.

Health Minister Patty Hajdu and Attorney-General David Lametti did not respond directly to the chiefs’ request for decriminalization in their joint response emailed to Glacier Media following the chiefs’ news conference.

But the ministers said they “welcome their endorsement of a holistic approach including harm reduction and diversion, and thank them for their recommendations.”

“Working with other orders of government, substance use experts, service providers, first responders, law enforcement and people with lived and living experience, our Government remains committed to advancing evidence-based responses to help reverse the trend of opioid overdose deaths and other substance-related harms in Canada,” their statement said.

As many British Columbians know, the call for decriminalization has not just been made by harm reduction advocates — and now police chiefs — but by the very people the Trudeau government and Canadians now rely on for expertise in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic: public health doctors.

In B.C., Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and Vancouver Coastal Health Chief Medical Officer Dr. Patricia Daly, have gone on record in their support of decriminalization — Henry in a report last year, and Daly along with other public health doctors in a report in 2001.

Both doctors have pointed to the mounting death toll of people dying in B.C. of a drug overdose, with an all-time high of 170 deaths in the province in May — a statistic that brought Henry to tears.

More than 5,000 people died in B.C. of a drug overdose between the start of 2016 and end of 2019. In the first five months of this year, 554 people lost their lives in B.C. to drug use, most of them using alone inside a private residence.

As of Friday, 187 people in B.C. had died of COVID-19.

For Heed, who went on to become police chief in West Vancouver and then attorney general of B.C., he said he’s disappointed that 19 years after he spoke to senators about the need to decriminalize drugs that politicians continue to be politicians.

“They’re the ones that are going to be able to change the policy,” he said.

“The chiefs can say whatever they want. They have an amount of discretion that their officers can use, they have an amount of discretion that their organization can use in setting policy. But the overall policy has to come from our elected officials. And when we get this same rhetoric from our politicians, you can see even after almost 20 years, there’s been no real movement on this issue.”

Note: After I posted this piece, I came across some comments on Facebook from former Downtown Eastside cop, Dave Dickson. So here’s a take from another veteran of the streets on decriminalization:

“OK, I’m a little confused. The chiefs of police have now [announced] it’s time to decriminalize drugs. I remember 15 years ago as a police officer reading a memo from the federal Crown saying there will be no more charges for possession of marijuana, cocaine or heroin because it wasn’t in the public interest. I have spoken personally to most of the drug dealers out there in the Hastings corridor [and asked] if they are bothered by the police, and they just laughed. So can anyone explain to me why they think this is worth even discussing, as I think it’s pretty much already decriminalized, and it hasn’t made a difference whatsoever to the streets.”

Why it matters: The program brings cost relief to businesses hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, and is intended to support employment.

article continues below

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologized on Monday for not recusing himself from discussions about the administration of Ottawa's $900 million student volunteer program.

WE Charity was initially selected to deliver the initiative under a nearly $20 million contract. Trudeau said he was aware of his family's ties to the organization, but unaware of the honorariums his mother and brother received for their involvement.

""It is not a surprise to me that they got paid by WE, but I did not know that they got paid by WE,"" Trudeau said.

""In this situation, I should have recused myself,"" he added, acknowledging that his involvement in Ottawa's student volunteer program has created controversy. Members of the Conservative Party of Canada have called on Trudeau to address his involvement before Ottawa's ethics committee.

""I get that. I made a mistake in not recusing myself immediately from the discussion.""

Trudeau said he will evaluate any requests to address the issue before parliament. He also said that, because of his involvement, the rollout of the student volunteer program has been a bit delayed – an outcome he deeply regrets.

In addition to addressing the issue, Trudeau said on Monday that the federal government will extend its wage subsidy program until the end of the year. More information on the extension is expected this week.

The prime minister also said he spoke with U.S. president Donald Trump earlier in the day about the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement – which took effect July 1, – Black Lives Matter, China, the two Canadians who remain detained in China and U.S. aluminum tariffs.

""I highlighted to the president that the pandemic has disrupted usual manufacturing processes and supply chains,"" said Trudeau. ""It would be a shame to see tariffs come in between our two countries at a time when we're celebrating the new NAFTA.""

Trudeau briefly told reporters to expect a joint announcement regarding the closure of the Canada-U.S. border.

Non-essential travel across the border is banned until late July.

There are what the government calls ""exposure events,"" at places such as the No. 5 Orange strip club, where people who were in attendance on July 1, 3, 4 and 7 are being told to monitor symptoms and to self-isolate if they believe that they have symptoms, such as a dry cough and fever.

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreaks at Tabor and at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred to those homes from the hospital. The outbreak at the Tabor long-term care home was declared over on July 7.

B.C.'s provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix said in a July 10 joint statement that the province recorded 25 new cases in the past 24 hours, for a total of 3,053 cases since the virus that has caused a global pandemic first appeared in B.C. in late January.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 990 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 202 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 51 people who reside outside Canada.

There was one new COVID-19-related death recorded in the past day, for a total of 187.

Of the 187 people actively fighting off the disease, 16 are in hospital, with five of those in intensive care. The rest are self-isolating at home.

The recovery rate has dipped below 87%, as 2,679 people have recovered.

""As we continue through summer, simple steps will help us to keep COVID-19 low and slow in British Columbia,"" Henry and Dix said in their statement.

""When spending more time with friends and family, whether that is close to home or on vacation elsewhere in the province, we remind all British Columbians to avoid closed spaces, crowds and close contact with others. We know that the more layers of protection we use, the safer we will be. Let's all 'layer up' by washing our hands regularly, using barriers, staying a safe distance from others and using a mask when that is challenging.""

Stephen Without pleaded guilty to assaults involving directly massaging patients’ breasts or touching or rubbing their vaginal areas.

article continues below

The court said the activity had no therapeutic or valid reason during treatment in 2015 and 2016 at Witvoet’s Thrive Physiotherapy business.

He was charged with 16 offenses in total.

“The victims went to see Mr. Witvoet for pain relief. They trusted him. He abused that trust,” Vernon Provincial Court Judge Jeremy Guild said.

The first complaint came in July 2015 when a woman told police Witvoet had massaged both of her breasts under her sports bra with his hand. She did not want to proceed with charges unless someone else came forward.

Three months later, another woman complained of similar behaviour. Police contacted the first woman and Witvoet was charged.

Two more complaints led to charges in June 2019.

After that, RCMP appealed to the public for assistance and a further 12 charges resulted.

The victims ranged in age from 18 to 57.

They had sought Witvoet’s services for issues such as flat feet, shoulder injuries, lockjaw and other injuries.

The October 2019 guilty plea came after a joint submission from Crown and defence.

“The guilty pleas were also important for him as an acceptance of his responsibility, and an acknowledgment that he did wrong and that the victims were right,” Guild said in the July 8 sentencing ruling. The guilty pleas help make sure justice is done from the victims’ perspectives.”

Witvoet is now separated from his wife, with whom he has two children.

“He now takes full responsibility for his offending, is remorseful and recognizes that he abused his position of trust. The publicity has left him feeling like a pariah,” Guild said. “He may have to find a new career. He has been working in construction to make ends meet and support his family.”

Guild said he initially had concerns about the sentence “because there seemed to be very little punitive aspect to it.”

But, he said, the guilty plea spared the victims having to testify. Despite their names being barred from publication, their need to be in court would leak out and people would know the details of what had happened to them, Guild said.

“Being spared the necessity of testifying helped protect their privacy and save them from embarrassment. That was one of the main goals in the Crown arriving at the joint submission,” Guild said.

The 18-month sentence is broken into six months’ house arrest and a year with a 10 p.m.-6 a.m. curfew.

He also received two years’ probation also include a ban on treating female patients while on probation.

“Given the notoriety of his offending, his neighbours and the community will know of his restrictions,” Guild said.

The College of Physiotherapists of British Columbia in June 2019 prohibited Witvoet from treating female patients pending the completion of its regulatory investigation. With sentencing complete, the college will conclude its regulatory process with results to be published on its website.

Crazy talk, you might say.

article continues below

Well, a decision to hold off for one, maybe two years on hiring a new person to replace Fire Chief Darrell Reid, who leaves next week to take a management job in Alberta, almost happened Wednesday.

Why is a reporter writing about what almost happened?

Fair question.

Answer: Because that reporter can’t recall a time in his almost two decades of covering city hall when four councillors didn’t want to immediately replace what is arguably one of the most important positions in the city.

But yes, you might say in defence of the councillors’ push, we’re in strange and fiscally challenging times, with the city at one point losing up to $5 million per week in revenues and is now looking at an estimated $124 million total loss this year.

That loss, which could climb in the months ahead, is related to pandemic-influenced cuts, temporarily halting parking enforcement, a reduction in development fees and the shutdown of community centres, theatres and programs.

With that financial picture in mind, NPA Coun. Lisa Dominato proposed Wednesday a hiring freeze at the city for the remainder of this year and into next, and possibly beyond; her amendment to a motion read “until such time as the city’s revenues have returned to 2019 pre-COVID levels.”

Her NPA colleagues — Sarah Kirby-Yung, Melissa De Genova and Colleen Hardwick — all supported the move, even after city manager Sadhu Johnston outlined the consequences for the organization.

“We’re trying to really limit our hiring at this point, however there are some critical positions that we do need to hire,” he said.

“So it’s my sense that this amendment [from Dominato], if moved forward, would cripple us at this point.”

Those critical positions include finding someone to replace Reid and someone to replace Malcolm Bromley, who recently retired as general manager of the park board.

A “chief diversity officer” to lead the new equity and diversity office is also being sought, as are positions related to Indigenous issues, engineering and anti-racism.

Johnston’s concern was shared by Mayor Kennedy Stewart and other councillors, who all piled on in their criticism of the NPA’s push to place a moratorium on new hires and — of equal importance — not to fill vacancies left open from retirements, promotions, illness and those who quit.

Stewart: “To have a whole bunch of senior manager vacancies in the middle of a pandemic, and having an order not to fill them, would be a huge mistake. That means no hiring new firefighters, no hiring new police. Those are all the debates we have through the budget [sessions in December]. So I‘m kind of disappointed that there’s so much support for this.”

COPE Coun. Jean Swanson said council has spent months setting priorities related to affordable housing, the economy, social issues, equity and climate change. To advance those priorities, people need to be hired, she said.

“I just think it would be gross to say we can’t hire the people that are needed to do this work,” she said.

Green Party Coun. Pete Fry questioned Dominato wanting to freeze hiring until city revenues return to 2019 pre-COVID levels.

“That could be years from now, that could be months from now,” he said.

“It’s far too risky. We need to stay nimble, we need to be able to pivot, we need to be able to respond to the needs of our city in a timely and appropriate manner.”

From under the pile of criticism, Dominato emerged to propose an amendment to her original amendment, pointing directly to Johnston’s concerns about hiring people for “critical positions.”

“I heard that,” she said, “and I think that’s reasonable.”

Dominato, however, never identified the “critical positions,” although it could be assumed she was referring to the vacant jobs of fire chief and park board general manager. In the end, that amendment was defeated, too.

The debate featured all the trappings of the budget back-and-forth that normally goes down in December. But the positioning here by the NPA came as council got an update from the city’s finance crew on what the rest of the year and 2021 may look like for city finances.

As the estimated $124 million loss in revenue makes mind-bogglingly clear, it’s not promising.

The debate occurred on the same day the federal government announced it expected a $343 billion deficit this year, which Hardwick mentioned in her argument for supporting her colleague’s move for a hiring freeze at the city.

“The federal deficit is going to have a massive effect, and all of this is going to land on the city and our residents, which I’m always reminded are the people who elect us and pay our salaries,” she said.

“No one wants a hiring freeze, no one wants to cut back, but at some point — when the rubber hits the road — we’re going to be forced into positions to be doing these things.”

For now, the search begins for a new fire chief.

Since B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix announced on June 30 that his government would start accepting these plans, 61 of the 681 homes in the province have submitted them, he said July 9. He did not elaborate on how many of the plans would be approved.

article continues below

Homes that have approved plans could start allowing visitors into the facilities as early as next week.

The breakdown of seniors' homes with plans submitted to the government, by health region, is:

• 3 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 18 in Fraser Health;

• 18 in Island Health;

• 4 in Interior Health; and

• 18 in Northern Health.

Initial provincial restrictions on visits include that they will happen with each resident having a single designated visitor, that each visitor and resident would go to a designated place within the care home and that both vistor and resident would wear protective equipment.

""Keeping people safe in those communal-living environments is incredibly important,"" provincial health officer Bonnie Henry said July 9.

""Visiting is an important part of what we need to do to keep the mental health as well as the physical health of our seniors in care, however it needs to be done in a measured fashion so that we're not introducing this virus into a care home again.""

Dix on June 30 announced $165 million in new funding for up to three new full-time staff per home to oversee the visits and train visitors on how to wear protective equipment. He also announced that the government would provide a total of $26.5 million to care home operators to subsidize them for extra costs endured during the pandemic, including such items as hand sanitizer and masks.

The plan to allow visitors in B.C. care homes is contingent on the province continuing to record a relatively low number of new COVID-19 cases.

Henry said July 9 that the province had identified 20 new infections in the past 24 hours, for a total of 3,028 cases since infections were first recorded in the province in late January.

The province tweaked its system of reporting where in the province cases have been recorded to separate cases of people whose residence is outside Canada.

The new breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 982 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1596 in Fraser Health;

• 133 in Island Health;

• 201 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 51 people who reside outside Canada.

There were no new deaths in the past day, meaning that B.C.'s death toll from the virus that has caused a global pandemic remains at 186. Of the 175 people actively fighting off the disease, 17 are in hospital, with four of those in intensive care. The rest are self-isolating at home.

More than 88% of those infected in the province, or 2,667, have recovered.

Bacon pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to murder Corey Lal in the so-called Surrey Six case.

article continues below

He also pleaded guilty to one count of counselling to commit murder in a separate case involving the shooting of a man who survived an attack on Dec. 31, 2008.

Sentencing has been tentatively scheduled for July 23 when victim impact statements will be heard by the court.

Court heard a joint sentencing submission that includes 18 years for conspiracy to murder and 10 years for counselling to commit murder to be served concurrently.

Outside court, defence lawyer Kevin Westell said if the sentencing submission is accepted, Bacon is looking at an additional five to six years in prison after time served is taken into account.

""This has been a long, deliberative process of coming to the right agreement with the Crown,"" he said. ""We've come to a resolution that's principled and that's appropriate from all sides.""

Bacon was also charged with one count of first-degree murder in the Surrey Six case, but only pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge as part of a plea deal. Court heard the murder charge will be stayed at the sentencing hearing.

Police have said four of the victims were targeted but Chris Mohan, who lived on the floor where the killings occurred, and Ed Schellenberg, a maintenance worker, were in the wrong place at the wrong time.

Eileen Mohan said outside court that she would like to see Bacon serve at least 12 years for his part in the Surrey Six case.

""It breaks my heart,"" she said when asked about the possibility Bacon could be free in five or six years.

""This crime came to my doorstep. We didn't go to it, and this crime dictated my son's life that he's buried and dead now, and it's dictating our lives for the last 13 years. That has to be considered.""

Mohan said she will deliver a victim impact statement in person at the sentencing hearing.

""I will have my day in court with him,"" she said.

""Six people's lives meant something to this country and to the laws of Canada.""

It's yet to be determined whether Bacon will appear at the sentencing in person or via video link due to restrictions aimed at stopping the spread of COVID-19.

In court documents, the Crown alleges that at the time of the murders Bacon was a leader of the Red Scorpions gang.

The officer in charge of the investigation previously told the court it was one of the largest and most complex investigations that police have undertaken in the province. By November 2016, about 1,300 officers had been involved in the investigation.

In 2014, two men were convicted of six counts of first-degree murder in the Surrey Six case.

As with COVID-19, if management is to manage climate change risk, it needs direction and resources from the board level, she said.

“If the board accepts the fact that climate change is a real and imminent risk, they need to say to management, ‘we need some information on how climate change is a real and imminent risk to this business,’” Hansell said.

Her comments in a July 9 webinar coming after her release of her ‘Putting Climate Risk on the Boardroom Table’ opinion released in June.

Hansell said there is now broad consensus among scientists, politicians and policy makers that climate change is real.

“Climate change has been so broadly acknowledged that boards of directors need to onboard that consensus and assess how climate change is affecting their business,” Hansell said. “A reasonably prudent person would be taking climate change risk into account as part of their risk register.”

What it comes down to, she said, is a simple test where duty of care requires each director to exercise care, diligence and skill.

“But to what standard?” she asked in the opinion. “That question is answered by the next phrase in the test – a director must exercise the care, diligence and skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise.”

And, she said, Canadian courts have taken judicial notice of that climate change consensus on “and the existential risks it poses or business.”

“They essentially said, ‘You don’t need to bother proving this to us,’” Hansell said.

Moreover, Hansell said, if a board of directors is not seen as reasonable in its decision making, a court would not defer to it.

And, Hansell said, directors need to be clear their first duty is to the organization rather than its stakeholders.

“We have yet to have case law on whether stakeholders like creditors or communities or environmental groups can say they are stakeholders that directors must take into account,” Hansell said.

Hansell said tools exist to assist boards in deliberations.

Hansell was clear that boards do not need a director brought specifically as an expert on climate change issues.

She said that became the case in 1999 when companies were worried about the Y2K issue, where havoc was expected in computer systems which only dealt with years in two digits rather than four – ie ‘99’ instead of ‘1999’ which would have dated things to the start of the last century – 1900 instead of 2000 - as the millennium changed.

“That created a board position with a single-subject matter person boards would defer to,” Hansell said.

“It was otherwise an empty chair at board meetings,” she said.

“Many, many boards in Canada are already doing a spectacular job.”

Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada director of corporate oversight and governance Gigi Dawe said the issue is one of many new areas directors have to wrangle with, including digitization, cybercrime and geopolitical considerations.

She said directors know banks, investors, regulators and other stakeholders are demanding boards consider climate change as part of their operational oversight.

“Boards are being given an unambiguous message that they need to step up to the plate,” Dawe said.

York University Osgoode Hall law school Prof Cynthia Williams said Hansell’s opinion builds on work done by Australian Noel Huntley who said climate related risks “represent foreseeable risks of harm to Australian businesses.”

Williams said many Canadian law firms have no issues with memos to boards saying climate change is real and an issue needing to be addressed.

The webinar was put on by Canada Climate Law Initiative, which examines the legal basis for corporations’ directors, officers and pension fiduciaries to consider, manage, and report on climate-related financial risks and opportunities. It also looks at advancing effective climate governance practice knowledge and exploring the scope and limits of fiduciary obligation limits around climate change.

Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond said Thursday the allegations involving emergency room staff playing a game to guess patients' blood-alcohol level are disturbing but health professionals who provide information will be protected.

The professional bodies for doctors and nurses are supporting her investigation and they should not fear losing their jobs, despite the fact that British Columbia's whistle-blower legislation does not apply to health authorities, she said.

Turpel-Lafond said compelling physicians to give evidence can be difficult so she is hoping for voluntary compliance and disclosure from those who won't be ""shamed"" as Indigenous people themselves have been through racism.

""I can say, though, if I do find that there have been violations of the Criminal Code or the standards of health professional bodies as I look into these investigations, I will report that to the appropriate authorities,"" Turpel-Lafond said.

She said an investigation, not an inquiry as some Indigenous groups have suggested, is the quickest route to addressing ongoing racism that has not been dealt with because of a broken complaint system.

Racism exists across the health-care system with Indigenous people seeking care often asked irrelevant questions about whether they are intoxicated or addicted to substances, Turpel-Lafond said.

Her investigative team includes former provincial health officer Dr. Perry Kendall as well as Indigenous professionals with clinical experience and those who will analyze data about the number of Indigenous people using the health-care system.

Turpel-Lafond expects to provide an initial report in a few months to Health Minister Adrian Dix, who appointed her to conduct an investigation on June 18.

However, Turpel-Lafond said CEOs of health authorities should immediately address allegations of racism and she'll ask those who didn't to explain themselves.

She is urging Indigenous people to complete a confidential survey of their experiences and says anyone with experience or knowledge of racism could provide information through email or a 1-800 number.

Daniel Fontaine, CEO of Metis Nation British Columbia, one of the groups assisting with the investigation, said he learned last month about a ""Price is Right"" game played in an emergency room by staff guessing the blood-alcohol level of Indigenous patients.

He said the allegations were outlined in a report by the Provincial Health Services Authority and a second report included ""story after story of racism"" reported by health-care workers around the province.

Both reports were brought to him by his staff, who work in the Health Ministry, and were stamped March 2019, Fontaine said, adding he contacted the deputy health minister the night before Dix made the allegations public.

""I said we were going to have to speak out because these reports had been produced 15 months ago,"" he said.

Fontaine said the organization planned a news conference the following morning but backed off when Dix announced Turpel-Lafond's appointment.

Fontaine said he's hoping she will recommend all health-care workers be provided with standardized cultural training that has been endorsed by Indigenous groups.

""Are people being held accountable for participating in racist activities? Those are the kinds of things we're hoping this investigation will look into as well.""

This year’s presidential campaign in the United States will be very different from the ones of elections past, with the COVID-19 pandemic affecting public gatherings, events and conventions.

article continues below

Research Co. has been tracking this democratic process, and some themes are starting to emerge. The last presidential contest that saw an incumbent seek a new term took place in 2012, when Democrat Barack Obama ultimately defeated Republican Mitt Romney. I had the privilege of following that election from start to finish, and there are many differences between what we saw eight years ago and the mood of Americans in 2020.

In July 2012, there was no clear frontrunner in the race for the White House. Obama and Romney were supported by 47% of decided voters across the United States, with Independents barely breaking in favour of the incumbent president. Obama could count on the votes of most women and young voters, while Romney connected well with men and older voters.

This year, the situation is dissimilar. Trump, the Republican incumbent, sits 10 points behind prospective Democratic Party nominee Joe Biden at the national level. Across the country, in a survey that was completed before the Independence Day celebrations, 53% of decided voters said they would cast a ballot for Biden, while 43% would support Trump.

Independents, who backed Trump over Hillary Clinton in 2016, are no longer happy with the president. In this crucial group, Biden is ahead of Trump by 15 points (54% to 39%). Unless the numbers tighten among American voters who do not align themselves with the Democrats or the Republicans, Trump’s chances will fade.

In our tracking, Trump’s approval rating dropped to 40% this month, down six points since we checked in early June, well into the COVID-19 pandemic but before the protests about racial equality dominated media coverage. An approval rating hovering around 50% is usually an indicator of a lost election for an incumbent president. Trump is significantly below this threshold right now.

Trump’s approval rating is particularly bad with African Americans (21%) and Latino and Hispanic Americans (32%). These two groups are usually supportive of Democrats, so the results are not earth-shattering. Still, his numbers also fell to 46% among White Americans.

When we asked Americans to select six words out of a list of 18 to describe Trump, almost three in five selected “arrogant” (57%). Of the six words chosen, the only one that is remotely positive is “strong” (36%). More than a third of Americans perceive their current head of state as “dishonest” (40%), “uncaring” (39%), “foolish” (also 39%) and “out of touch” (34%).

This does not mean that Americans are enthralled by Biden. When we pose the same question about the prospective Democratic Party nominee, about three in 10 Americans describe him as “intelligent” (32%), “compassionate” (also 32%), “down to earth” (30%), “honest” (28%), “weak” (28%) and “out of touch” (28%).

We could look at Biden’s results as superior to Trump’s, since only one of the six words is overly negative (“weak.”) These numbers are very different from what Barack Obama and Mitt Romney posted in July 2012.

At that time, 50% of Americans regarded Obama as “intelligent” and 46% felt the same way about Romney. In an exceedingly polarized nation, the numbers on this indicator are significantly lower for both Biden (32%) and Trump (31%).

Right now, Biden is clearly favoured at the national level, but we still need to look into the way specific American states will behave. The Democrats hope to win the three jurisdictions that took Trump to the White House (Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin) and perhaps make inroads in Florida and Ohio.

No election is decided four months in advance. In any case, three indicators point to Biden enjoying unique advantages in 2020: Trump’s weak approval rating, reminiscent of what Jimmy Carter and George H. W. Bush posted in 1976 and 1992, his difficulties in reconnecting with Independents, and a lower proportion of voters willing to cast a ballot for a third-party candidate.

In 2016, almost 6% of all cast ballots in the American presidential election went to third-party candidates, most notably Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party and Jill Stein of the Green Party. This year, Americans are not looking at third parties as much as they were four years ago, with only 3% selecting Libertarian Jo Jorgensen or “some other candidate.” However, we collected our data before a man called Kanye Omari West flirted with becoming the Ross Perot of the 21st Century.

Given that B.C. has an estimated population of about 5,190,000 people, that translates into one case for every 1,735 residents, or 0.579 people per 1,000 residents. That compares with Washington State's estimated population of 7,615,000 people and 37,491 cases, for about one case of COVID-19 for every 203 people, or 4.92 people per 1,000 residents.

Three people in B.C. have died in the past day from the virus that spawned a global pandemic, making the death toll in the province now 186. Of the 162 people actively fighting off the disease, 17 are in hospital, with three of those in intensive care. The rest are self-isolating at home.

More than 88% of those infected in the province, or 2,660, have recovered.

""While there are no active community outbreaks in B.C., new cases and community exposure events continue to occur in the community,"" Health Minister Adrian Dix and provincial health officer Bonnie Henry said in a joint statement.

The two acknowledged that there has been a second case of exposure to the virus in a strip club – at the No. 5 Orange bar on Main Street. That is the second instance of exposure at a strip club, following one at Brandi's Exotic Show Lounge on Hornby Street in late June.

Public health teams have issued an alert for anyone who may have been at the No. 5 Orange on July 1.

""If you have been at a location with a community exposure event, monitor yourself for symptoms, limit your contact with others and contact 811 to arrange for testing if any symptoms develop,"" Dix and Henry said. ""Contact tracing to contain the spread of COVID-19 requires all of our involvement to be successful.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,018 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,589 in Fraser Health;

• 133 in Island Health;

• 203 in Interior Health; and

• 65 in Northern Health.

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreaks at Tabor and at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred to those homes from the hospital. The outbreak at the Tabor long-term care home was declared over on July 7.

""Fewer faces, bigger spaces is the safest approach, because we know crowded, closed spaces where people may be in close contact with each other are higher-risk environments for all of us and need to be avoided at this time,"" said Henry and Dix.

The Mounties say in a release that four people were taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, including a Calgary man who was driving the westbound semi.

Police say there were heavy brake marks at the scene, and they believe the semi crossed into the oncoming lane after the driver failed to safely make a turn on the highway.

The truck flipped onto its side and skidded down the highway before striking the five other vehicles travelling eastbound.

Police say the driver has been charged with crossing a double line under the B.C. Motor Vehicle Act.

The Mounties say speed may have been a factor in the crash but there's no evidence to suggest impaired driving was involved.

RCMP Sgt. Murray McNeil says it's lucky no one was killed considering the extensive damage to each vehicle and the length the semi travelled before coming to a stop.

The survey of 1,401 member businesses from groups including the BC Chamber of Commerce, Greater Vancouver Board of Trade and Business Council of B.C. indicates owners want a bold, long-term recovery plan.

Only 16 per cent of businesses were confident in B.C.'s restart plan and 47 per cent were not.

Two-thirds of those surveyed were relying on some form of government support and owners were braced for a ""second wave"" of shutdowns or other problems if programs expire too quickly.

Some 28 per cent believed they'll return to normal once programs end, 32 per cent expected to cut workers' hours, 27 per cent anticipated layoffs, and one business in every 10 forecast either temporary or permanent closure.

Owners say payroll and wage supports must remain key components of B.C.'s recovery plan, along with fee and tax cuts.

The survey also identified expectations that the province must create better investment conditions.

Bridgitte Anderson, president and CEO of the Greater Vancouver Board of Trade, says business viability hinges on those measures.

Val Litwin with the BC Chamber of Commerce urges policy-makers to ""stay sensitive"" to the vulnerability of the business sector.

""A bold economic recovery plan that helps small businesses compete is non-negotiable for a prosperous B.C., and when small businesses thrive so do communities and people,"" Litwin said in a statement.

""Governments must keep focused on delivering their recovery plans swiftly.""

The joint study by researchers at the B.C. Centre for Disease Control, University of B.C., LifeLabs and public health scientists is posted on the health research website medRxiv and a news conference on the findings is scheduled for Thursday morning.

article continues below

The authors say the findings indicate successful suppression of community transmission in B.C., with an estimated overall infection rate of less than one per cent.

The study looked at anonymous blood samples collected for reasons unrelated to COVID-19 by LifeLabs in March and May, before and after public health measures were introduced.

The first samples in March found two of 869 specimens were positive, for a prevalence of 0.28 per cent, while the May sample found a prevalence of 0.55 per cent.

Health Minister Adrian Dix described the estimated infection rate as ""very low"" and says it shows the effectiveness of British Columbia's public health measures and co-operation of the public.

""It reinforces the fact that we're on the right track,"" Dix says.

""Of course, this is as the study suggests a dual-edged question, a low level of transmission but also very few people with antibodies to deal with potential future spikes of COVID-19.""

If the study's prevalence rate is applied to the whole provincial population, it could mean about 28,000 people have had the novel coronavirus, while 3,149 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed to date, however Dix noted the results are specific to the Vancouver area.

Health officials have repeatedly said that more people have been infected with the virus than have tested positive and Dix calls the estimated prevalence rate in B.C. ""encouraging.""

""Overall the level of infection in B.C. was low and that's due to the actions of people in B.C. That said, there are more people who were infected with COVID-19 than tested positive and that's something we've said clearly, especially in the period of March and April when we were focusing our testing program particularly on specific groups including health-care workers,"" Dix says.

The study is the first of its kind in Canada, he says.

The study is also important because it involved people who did not self-select for COVID-19 testing, so they likely didn't believe they had the virus, Dix says.

The study was authorized by provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and approved by the clinical research ethics board of the university. It has not yet been peer reviewed.

British Columbia recorded 21 new cases Wednesday and no new deaths. There are 207 active cases while 2,753 people who tested positive have recovered, the government said in a news release.

Dylan Perceval-Maxwell was removed on July 8 from the race to succeed Elizabeth May as the party's leader.

article continues below

The party says ""several"" recent statements by Perceval-Maxwell are inappropriate and the party's leadership contest authority decided it would not stay silent and allow him to continue his campaign.

Perceval-Maxwell appealed the decision and lost.

The Montreal environmental activist says in a Facebook post shared Wednesday that he is apologetic for saying in a June 23 debate that police should be forced to pay $20 to every person of colour they stop, as compensation for the trauma and an incentive for police to think twice before stopping someone.

Montreal lawyer Meryam Haddad, who is also running for the leadership, told Perceval-Maxwell during the debate that the comment was ""super racist.""

Perceval-Maxwell said in his Facebook statement that putting the dollar figure out there was a mistake but also shared the Oxford dictionary definition of racism to defend himself.

""According to this definition, my idea was not 'racist' as was claimed during that debate,"" he said. The idea is not prejudiced or antagonistic against members of minority groups, he said.

He said he agrees that he should not have included a specific dollar figure on compensation, and said he has apologized many times for the comment. He also said that attacking people who are not ""actively"" engaged in oppression is how genocides happen.

Perceval-Maxwell added that his ""dear Jewish mother"" survived the Holocaust by hiding in a garbage can in Hungary and that he firmly believes ""standing up for the rights of all regardless of race and class is the thing we have to do.""

In its written statement, the Green party said it expects ""those who are called out for making discriminatory statements will reflect, learn and commit to doing better.""

""The party respects every individual’s right of free speech but we will not provide a platform to normalize racism and discrimination,"" the statement says. ""We are committed to creating a forum where contestants can debate the solutions that Canada needs to survive and thrive in the 21st century.""

Haddad told The Canadian Press she knows the party got many complaints about the comments and that she is happy to see the party take quick and decisive action.

""It shows that our organization will just not tolerate someone who makes racist comments,"" she said.

Haddad also said Perceval-Maxwell's attempts to apologize are not thorough enough.

""When people that live racism tell him that it's a racist comment, like he should apologize and he never apologized properly,"" she said. ""He apologized for me to feel that way.""

Perceval-Maxwell acknowledged many people do not think his apologies are full and sincere. He said he is relieved to not be in the race any more because he can now get more sleep and exercise.

There remain nine people in the contest to find a permanent successor for Elizabeth May. The race will be decided by online and mail-in ballots this fall. The winner is to be announced the first weekend of October.

The Canada-U.S. border has been closed to so-called ""discretionary"" travel like vacations and shopping trips since the COVID-19 pandemic took hold of the continent in mid-March, an agreement that had been set to expire July 21.

The extension comes with COVID-19 resurgent across the U.S. — cases are on the rise in all 50 states, and southern states like Florida, Arizona and California are facing a fresh crisis with overcrowded hospital wards, refrigerated truck trailers serving as makeshift morgues and another shortage of personal protective medical gear.

The escalating emergency has also exposed a deep divide between Canadians dead-set against reopening the border and U.S. lawmakers in northern border states who continue to press both countries for a blueprint for doing exactly that.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has called the extent of the pandemic in the U.S. a ""constantly evolving"" situation, but won't say whether officials have considered extending the border restrictions beyond the standard 30-day window.

""Based on the success of the existing restrictions and close collaboration with Mexico and Canada, (the Department of Homeland Security) will continue to limit non-essential travel at our land ports of entry with Canada and Mexico until Aug. 20,"" Wolf tweeted.

The commissioner released the information today along with a series of findings about two other entities that didn't comply with election financing rules in the last federal election.

The 8,000-kilogram, armour-plated truck — equipped with a rotating roof hatch, eight gun ports and a powered battering ram — looked like it was ready for the worst of war zones.

article continues below

However, when the purchase was scuttled by city council last month, Mayor Mike Savage made it clear the brawny vehicle had become a symbol of oppression, particularly for Halifax's Black community. The mayor said the money would be used instead for anti-Black racism programs.

""There has been in this province a history of systemic racism, and we have to do better,"" Savage said at the time.

The decision was seen as a step forward by those who have long complained that Canada's police forces are becoming paramilitary organizations that act more like occupying armies than community-based partners.

""This announcement sends a positive message,"" said Akwasi Owusu-Bempah, a sociology professor at the University of Toronto. ""I have no doubt that what we call defunding of police ... will take hold in Canada.""

Owusu-Bempah, whose work examines race, crime and policing, cited the July 6 decision by Edmonton city council to cut $11 million over two years from the Edmonton Police Service budget. That money will be spent on housing, social services and a safety task force.

The professor, who also works with the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, said there is a growing movement to ""de-task"" the police, which means reducing the scope of their responsibilities and reallocating the savings.

He said mental-health organizations should be given the resources to deal with people facing mental-health crises rather than poorly trained front-line officers.

In the same vein, police should not be expanding their duties to include what the military is trained to do, because it transforms peace officers into soldiers who see members of the public as enemy combatants, he said.

""Poor, Black and Indigenous people then become the enemies in the war on drugs. It further entrenches the problems of racial injustice,"" Owusu-Bempah said. ""(Police) feel like they're in battle, as opposed to serving a community.""

The Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police did not respond to a request for an interview.

Meanwhile, there are others who say the about-face in Halifax was just a distraction from a much larger problem.

Kevin Walby, an associate professor of criminal justice at the University of Winnipeg, said there's more to militarization than the purchase of armoured vehicles, automatic weapons and tactical gear.

""In terms of defunding, they're actually the smallest piece of the puzzle,"" he said. ""So I wouldn't say the decision (in Halifax) means that Halifax police are off the hook when it comes to militarization, because it could still be happening in other ways.""

As an example, Walby points to the increasing use of heavily armed emergency response team members in routine, everyday policing.

Using information gleaned through access to information laws, Walby has found that police forces across Canada are increasingly using SWAT members to serve low-risk warrants.

""It is happening all the time, but we don't see it,"" he said. ""And they even assign SWAT team members to do mental-health checks.""

As well, Walby said he has been tracking a more insidious form of militarization known as ""community policing.""

It involves teams of officers fanning out in neighbourhoods to ask residents questions about their safety concerns and problems with their neighbours. The information is later used to compile detailed community profiles.

Though it may sound like a tame, feel-good strategy, Walby said community policing is anything but.

""Community policing has morphed into this kind of intelligence-gathering activity,"" he said. ""The militaries in Afghanistan and Iraq used community policing models to ... collect intelligence and feed it back into military operations. Canadian police are now using the very same tactic.""

In the United States, where the militarization of police has been more overt, an academic paper in the journal Research and Politics found that the increasing use of military equipment has led to more violent police behaviour.

The article, published in June 2017, cites a U.S. Department of Defence program that has made excess military weapons and vehicles available to local law enforcement agencies since the late 1990s.

The study revealed a statistically significant relationship between military transfers to police in four states and fatalities from officer-involved shootings.

""As militarization seeps into their cultures, (law enforcement agencies) rely more on violence to solve problems,"" the paper says. ""The mechanism mirrors psychology's classic 'Law of the Instrument,' whereby access to a certain tool increases the probability that the tool is used for problems when other tools may be more appropriate.""

Owusu-Bempah said police in the United States routinely use armoured vehicles for low-level drug raids.

""In the United States, we saw police with armoured vehicles pulling down the front walls of houses with a battering ram to execute warrants,"" he said. ""When you have the militarized type of policing, it creates an environment in which the warrior cop is allowed to exist.""

In January 2015, U.S. President Barack Obama cited concerns over the militarization of police when he signed an executive order that prohibits law enforcement agencies from acquiring certain military equipment, including tracked armoured vehicles, bayonets, grenade launchers and large-calibre weapons.

Obama's order came a few months after the shooting by police of Michael Brown, an unarmed Black youth in Ferguson, Mo., whose death sparked protests across the country — not unlike the protests that followed the death of George Floyd, the Black man in Minneapolis who died May 25 as a police officer was kneeling on his neck.

The disturbing video showing Floyd's violent arrest gave rise to a global movement that, among other things, is calling for the defunding and demilitarization of police departments — and an end to police brutality and systemic racism.

Plenty of cities across Canada already have armoured vehicles like the one Halifax rejected, including Ottawa, Fredericton, Saskatoon, Winnipeg and Sault Ste. Marie, Ont.

The Department of National Defence confirmed in 2014 it had donated five armoured vehicles to police agencies since 2007: a Grizzly armoured personnel carrier to Edmonton police in 2007; two Cougar armoured vehicles to the B.C. RCMP in 2010; and one Cougar each to the police in New Glasgow, N.S., and Windsor, Ont., in 2013.

The Cougar sent to New Glasgow was given away in 2017 because it was never put to good use, the police chief said at the time.

Still, the police departments that have these vehicles argue they are necessary because they offer protection to officers and the public during mass public shootings, hostage takings and other high-risk scenarios.

Ottawa lawyer Michael Spratt doesn't buy that rationale.

""Our police forces look more like military organizations — with automatic rifles and riot shields and tanks,"" said Spratt who specializes in criminal law and policing. ""There's no need for any police force to have a tank.""

The Ottawa Police Service, for example, has an imposing armoured vehicle known as a Lenco Bearcat, which Spratt says has rarely seen service since it was purchased in 2010.

""When we're talking about defunding the police ... this is really low-hanging fruit,"" said Spratt. ""Even if there is some marginal benefit in some rare circumstances, the cost of having these vehicles — and inherent harm of having a militarized police force — vastly outweighs any potential benefit.""

Mohammed Shahed, a member of the governing party who regularly appeared on TV talk shows, was arrested Wednesday by the Rapid Action Battalion near the Indian border after a nine-day manhunt.

Shahed is chairman of the Regent Group and owner of two Regent hospitals in the capital, Dhaka.

Abdul Baten, a commissioner of the Detective Branch in Dhaka, said Shahed admitted after his arrest that his hospitals did not have proper equipment to conduct coronavirus tests.

A court in Dhaka on Thursday allowed investigators to keep Shahed in custody for 10 days for questioning.

Officials said the hospitals had issued more than 10,000 coronavirus test results and about 60% were fake even though patients were charged for them. The hospitals allegedly arranged for the remaining tests to be conducted by another hospital.

The two hospitals had not renewed their medical licenses for years, but the Ministry of Health nevertheless signed a deal with Shahed to dedicate the hospitals to coronavirus testing and treatment as the number of cases rose in Bangladesh.

Bangladesh on Thursday was nearing 200,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, including 2,496 deaths. Public health experts say the actual number is much higher because only about 70 testing facilities are available in the country of 160 million people.

Shahed belongs to the governing Awami League party headed by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and is a member of its foreign affairs subcommittee. He has more than 50 illegal cases pending against him across the country on various charges including forgery and cheating.

Another doctor and her husband were also arrested recently on similar charges of falsifying test results.

Local media reports say the scams could hurt Bangladesh’s earnings from overseas workers. Last week, Italy suspended all flights from Bangladesh to Rome after some Bangladeshis reportedly presented fake negative test reports for the coronavirus.

Bangladesh earns about $19 billion a year from about 10 million overseas workers. Authorities said about 15,000 Bangladeshi workers with jobs in Italy remain stranded in Bangladesh and it is unclear whether they will be able to travel to the European country.

Bangladesh has reopened businesses including its main export-earning garment sector after a monthslong closure.",[]

The Anti-Defamation league and some Jewish leaders had condemned what they called anti-Semitic theories expressed by Cannon and demanded the apology.

article continues below

""First and foremost I extend my deepest and most sincere apologies to my Jewish sisters and brothers for the hurtful and divisive words that came out of my mouth during my interview with Richard Griffin,"" Cannon said on his Twitter account.

""They reinforced the worst stereotypes of a proud and magnificent people and I feel ashamed of the uninformed and naïve place that these words came from. The video of this interview has since been removed.""

ViacomCBS cut ties with the TV host and producer Tuesday in response to his comments on a podcast where he discussed racial bias.

Rabbi Abraham Cooper, the Simon Wiesenthal Center’s associate dean, told The Associated Press that Cannon reached out to him Wednesday and during a 30-minute telephone conversation he apologized to the Jewish community and Cooper asked him to post it on social media.

""He started out the right way, he said the right things. Half an hour is a long time, and we'll probably meet tomorrow in the LA area,"" Cooper said.

""He understood that the words and references that he thought were based on fact, turned out to be hateful propaganda and stereotypical rhetoric.""

The TV host and producer wrote earlier a lengthy Facebook post defending himself and criticizing his firing for what the company deemed ""bigotry"" and ""anti-Semitism,"" prominent members of the U.S. Jewish community said the post fell well short and demanded an apology.

""It’s not enough to say, ‘I’m not a racist, I’m not a bigot,’"" Cooper had told the AP earlier. ""The statements he made are hurtful, and they’re false.""

Cooper said Cannon should read and heed the words of Martin Luther King Jr., who ""dedicated his life for civil rights for all and a colour-blind America."" Cooper also had advised him to seek out the guidance of basketball Hall of Famer-turned-writer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who has condemned several sports and entertainment celebrities for anti-Semitic posts.

In the hour-plus episode of ""Cannon's Class"" released last month that prompted his firing, Cannon and Richard ""Professor Griff"" Griffin, formerly of the rap group Public Enemy, contended that Black people are the true Hebrews and Jews have usurped that identity.

Cannon then argued that lighter-skinned people — ""Jewish people, white people, Europeans"" — ""are a little less"" and have a ""deficiency"" that historically caused them to act out of fear and commit acts of violence to survive.

""They had to be savages,"" he said.

""When I first heard about the comments Mr. Cannon made, it was very, very disappointing,"" said Oren Segal, director of the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism. ""We’re in a time where hatred of all kinds is very much apparent. It’s in the news every day.""

""Anti-Semitism in particular over the past several years has been something that we've seen in increase , as well as racism and other issues,"" Segal added. ""So when you hear an individual who has a public profile, who has influence over people, make statements that are highly offensive to the Jewish community, the first reaction is disappointment.""

Anti-Semitic violent attacks rose worldwide by 18% in 2019 compared with the previous year, according to a report published in April by Tel Aviv University’s Kantor Center for the Study of Contemporary Jewry.

Segal said some members of the Black Hebrew Israelite movement see themselves as the true ""chosen people,"" and believe that Blacks, Hispanics and Native Americans are the true descendants of the 12 Tribes of Israel. He noted that not all spew hateful rhetoric, although many adhere to an extreme set of anti-Semitic beliefs.

Bruce D. Haynes, a professor of sociology at the University of California, Davis, who has been studying Black Jews for more than two decades, agreed that the remarks echo the ideas of extreme Black Hebrew Israelites and of Minister Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam leader who last year referenced ""Satanic Jews"" in a speech denying allegations of anti-Semitism. But Haynes took a more nuanced view.

""The danger is that those groups get confused with other self-identified Israelites like (Rabbi) Capers Funnye, who has a congregation in Chicago, and who is very much involved with the Ashkenazim Jewish community. So I want to make clear that the term 'Israelites' is a tricky term,"" he said.

""Is it anti-Semitic to say Black people are the real Israelites or the real Jews? I’m not sure I’d call it anti-Semitism,"" Haynes said. ""It’s not a good reading of history, but I wouldn’t call it anti-Semitism. On the other hand, some of those groups that call Jews impostors certainly cross the line.""

Until his firing, Cannon produced ""Wild ’n Out,"" a comedy improv series for VH1, the ViacomCBS-owned cable channel.

In an earlier Facebook post, he had said that he welcomes being held accountable and takes responsibility for his words, while also accusing the company of trying to silence an ""outspoken black man"" and demanding full ownership of the ""Wild ’n Out"" brand.

""I do not condone hate speech nor the spread of hateful rhetoric. ... The Black and Jewish communities have both faced enormous hatred, oppression persecution and prejudice for thousands of years and in many ways have and will continue to work together to overcome these obstacles,"" he wrote.

Cooper had said that Cannon should reject Farrakhan’s hate speech and ""reduce the long statement to two sentences"" — a simple apology, which he did after their conversation.

""I just had the blessed opportunity to converse with Rabbi Abraham Cooper director of global social action @SimonWiesenthal. My first words to my brother was, I apologize for the hurt I caused the Jewish Community"" Cannon tweeted.

""On my podcast I used words & referenced literature I assumed to be factual to uplift my community instead turned out to be hateful propaganda and stereotypical rhetoric that pained another community For this I am deeply sorry but now together we can write a new chapter of healing.""

""My hope is that this series can be a place to explore meaningful topics together and sort through so many of the questions we’re all trying to answer in our own lives,"" Obama said in a statement.

The new podcast is the first title in the ongoing collaboration between Spotify and Higher Ground, a production company founded by Barack and Michelle Obama. Last year, the former president and first lady partnered with Spotify to produce exclusive podcasts for the platform.

Michelle Obama’s new podcast expects to hold candid and personal conversations with a focus on topics concerning relationships and health. She expects to have several guests on the series including talk-show host Conan O’Brien and Valerie Jarrett, business woman and former senior advisor to Barack Obama.

""Perhaps most of all, I hope this podcast will help listeners open up new conversations — and hard conversations —- with the people who matter most to them,"" she said. ""That’s how we can build more understanding and empathy for one another.""

Obama released her Netflix documentary ""Becoming"" in May. The project was an extension of her 2018 bestselling memoir of the same name and a kind of authorized filmic portrait of Obama.

The Census Bureau reported Thursday that retail sales are 1.1% higher than their levels from a year ago, after a brutal plunge in March and April was offset by a decent rebound in May and June. But any gains might be short-lived as infections began to rise toward the end of June.

""While today’s report gives the illusion of a fearless consumer spending lavishly, the reality is more sobering: consumers are increasingly fearful amid new spikes in COVID-19 cases and a looming fiscal cliff,"" said Lydia Boussour, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.

The report shows how shoppers and businesses are adjusting to life in a pandemic, changing their habits in hopes of halting an illness that can quickly flare-up and wreak financial havoc.

Bars in Texas shuttered again at the end of last month as infections surged in that state. Pennsylvania this week ordered that restaurants can only seat 25% of their potential customers. Gap, Kohl’s and other stores are withdrawing clothes worn in their changing rooms from sales floors for several days as a precautionary move. Adding to all this pressure are signs that the recovery in consumer spending began to stall at the end of last month, according to analysis of credit cards by the bank JPMorgan Chase.

""I suspect the modest pullback we have seen in our card spending data since late June is driven by concern about the resurgence of COVID-19,"" said Jesse Edgerton, an economist with the bank.

June's retail numbers showed the complicated nature of an uncertain recovery.

Non-store sales—which includes online shopping—slumped 2.4% over the past month but are 23.5% higher from a year ago. Spending at restaurants and bars jumped 20% last month, but it's still down 26.3% from last year. Sales at clothiers more than doubled between May and June, yet they've collapsed 23.2% from a year ago.

Shoppers have responded by shifting their spending, and not only to online retailers. Sales at building materials stores were up 17.3% annually. Stores in the sporting goods, musical instrument, books and hobbies categories have enjoyed yearly growth of 20.6%. Purchases at grocers have increased 11.7% over the past year.",[]

The bank's report says 1.5 million women lost their jobs in the first two months of the pandemic.

The report found that women tend to work in industries hardest hit by the crisis, their employment level has been slower to rebound as the economy reopens and they are more likely to fall out of the workforce in the long-term.

The study says one-third of women who lost jobs between February and June did not seek work, putting them at higher risk of long term job-separation and future wage penalties.

Employment among women with toddlers or school-aged children fell seven per cent between February and May, compared with a four-per cent decrease for fathers of children the same age.

Single mothers with a toddler or school-aged child saw their employment drop 12 per cent between February and June, compared with a seven per cent decrease for single fathers.

The Toronto-based miner says gold production in the three months ended June 30 fell by about eight per cent to 1.149 million ounces from 1.25 million in the previous quarter, mainly due to COVID-19 related disruptions at its Veladero mine in Argentina.

article continues below

It warns that second quarter gold all-in sustaining costs per ounce are expected to be seven to nine per cent higher than in the first quarter, while copper costs are to rise by four to six per cent.

Barrick says the average market price for gold in the second quarter was US$1,711 per ounce, up from its realized price of US$1,589 per ounce in the first quarter.

Copper production, meanwhile, rose to 120 million pounds from 115 million in the first quarter, and the average market price was US$2.43 per pound, up from a realized price of US$2.23 in the first quarter.

CEO Mark Bristow says Barrick is positioned well to achieve its guidance for the year.

In May, 2020 gold guidance was adjusted lower by about 200,000 ounces to between 4.6 and five million ounces to account for the suspension of its Porgera gold mine amid a dispute with the federal government in Papua New Guinea.

But closing those sales has been problematic, Rivera says, since the Alberta government ended a rebate program that had covered as much as 35 per cent of the initial cost of a typical system.

article continues below

""I've been in the solar business long enough to watch it slowly, slowly increase, then once the grant program was there, it increased quite sharply for the residential market,"" says the president and co-founder of Calgary's GreenLight Power, which was founded in 2008.

""But, once the grants disappeared (last fall), we saw that sharp increase drop drastically. We had 21 customers signed up — the day they cancelled the grant, all but one cancelled their contract with us.""

The financial argument for investing in a home solar power array in Canada depends, experts say, on how much sun your house receives, how much it costs for electricity from the public grid, the capital cost of installation and, of course, which way the political wind blows.

In Alberta's case, the United Conservative Party cancelled a program put in place by the New Democrats. Similarly, after a 2018 provincial election, Ontario's Progressive Conservatives put an end to the main solar rebates program, implemented by a previous Liberal-led government.

Shifting policy and power prices make it difficult to estimate how long it will take for energy savings to pay off the capital cost of a home system, said Nicholas Gall, director, distributed energy resource for CanREA, the Canadian Renewable Energy Association.

Abundant — and cheap — hydroelectric power in Quebec, for instance, makes it more difficult to justify home solar power on a cost-saving basis there, he said.

Still, the declining cost of solar panels makes them a much better deal today than they were a decade ago.

""Costs for solar panels have fallen by about 55 per cent between 2008 and 2018,"" he said, citing the most recently available numbers.

""Those costs will represent anywhere from 20 to 45 per cent of the total installed cost. There are fixed costs that haven't come down as much, for labour and permitting and design, but the hardware is continuing to decrease in price.""

Installations are long-lived, he said, noting some installed in the 1980s are still producing plenty of electricity and panels installed today are expected to last at least 30 years.

The systems work best if your roof faces south but east or west can work, too, he said. (Roofs that are shaded by neighbours or trees make poor solar power collectors.)

Most provinces have programs where excess power from residential systems is purchased for distribution on the grid, he added, but the compensation varies widely from one jurisdiction to another.

Asked which Canadian province is the best in which to buy a solar power system now, Gall was quick to identify Prince Edward Island, which has a ""generous"" rebate of $1 per watt.

""That's around 40 per cent of the total installed cost for a typical system, up to a maximum of $10,000,"" he said.

Nova Scotia has a slightly less generous rebate program that pays 60 cents per watt, up to 25 per cent of system costs, to a maximum of $6,000, he added.

There are a hodgepodge of other programs across the country. The Northwest Territories, for instance, will pay up to 50 per cent of the cost of a solar system but only for buildings that are off the grid.

Some municipal governments also offer solar rebates — Medicine Hat is an example in southern Alberta. In Calgary, residents can lease their solar power system.

Prospective homebuyers in Edmonton and Calgary, meanwhile, have the option to buy solar power as an included component of their new house — Jayman Built Homes has been putting six-panel, two-kilowatt solar systems on all of its homes since early 2019.

The Calgary-based company built 811 homes last year and expects to add more than 700 this year, said Jayman president and chief operating officer Dave Desormeaux.

The withdrawal of the provincial rebate program last year meant an additional cost to Jayman of about $1,500 per home, he said, but after much thought, the company kept its solar program going.

""We're not making the margins we used to but we don't want to change the brand unless we absolutely had to. And so far that strategy is working,"" said Desormeaux.

He estimates the panels result in annual utility bill savings of about $200 to $250 per home.

GreenLight's Rivera says a full-sized home system should generate eight to 12 kilowatts at a non-subsidized capital cost of between $2 and $3 per watt, or $16,000 to $36,000.

He said he's fielding plenty of calls these days asking about adding battery storage to improve system reliability, independence from the grid on cloudy days and power quality.

But, although battery costs are falling, storage adds thousands of dollars to the cost of the system.

""As soon as you add batteries, you're doubling if not tripling the cost of solar because the battery technology is so expensive,"" he said.

""It's a tonne of interest — but not a tonne of sales.""

“I wanted to do something creative that day (March 23) to fill the void that the (Gateway) show would have. So, I decided to do it to honour the fact that I was supposed to start rehearsal that day,” explained Jason Sakaki, a Steveston resident and McMath secondary grad.

Gateway Theatre’s production, From Alaska, was cancelled earlier this month due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Sakaki added, “(I didn’t) think it would pick up so much traction with many people being super invested in the show,” which was staged in every room in his house to give the impression of set changes.

Sakaki’s choice of Les Miserables was no coincidence.

Les Miserables is a story about people going through a difficult time, similar to what Richmond and the world is going through today, he explained.

“We’re in this time of ‘what’s happening next’ and no one really knows. Even though the musical takes place in the 1800s, it’s completely relevant to what we’re experiencing right now,” Sakaki added.

Like many residents, the pandemic is affecting Sakaki as a performing artist financially, but the fear of the community turning away from theatre frightens him even more.

“It’s a little bit unsettling for actors because we don’t know when it’s going to end. Since we will not be able to get back to work until it’s fully over. That’s the scary thing right now I think,” said Sakaki.

“What we’re a little scared about is when we come back, are people going to come back to theatres and so … we want to keep them interested in what we’re doing.”

Sakaki will be hosting another one-man production of Beauty and the Beast on April 3 at 7 p.m. on Instagram @jasonsakaki.

The Vancouver-area men’s choir will share the livestream on Facebook, YouTube and Instagram.

The Inside Chor Leoni Livestream will be hosted by artistic director Erick Lichte, from his home, and will include high-quality concert videos from the past seven years of filming at the choir’s shows.

The choir will also be creating new video content from its albums, pairing its music with artwork from local artists in an effort to reach out and help all artists as much as it can at a time that’s challenging the entire arts and cultural sector.

The livestream will also include a weekly guest – a locally or internationally recognized music luminary, with an interview and video.

Viewers will also be able to interact within the live comments section.

Lichte underscored the importance of choral music, especially at this time of global uncertainty.

“I believe that choral music has a unique healing quality,” he said in a press release. “It can offer serenity, beauty and can connect with people in ways I don’t even understand. We want to pair this music power with the fun wrapping of a show in a way that is very Chor Leoni.

“Choral music is, for me, the ultimate way in which people can come together. This show won’t replace the community we share as a choir and with our audience, but hopefully it will move us from our current reality to the day we can again bring our voices together and they can be heard.”

For the April 1 livestream, the guest is conductor Ethan Sperry, talking about Translations, his new recording of the works of Latvian composer Eriks Esenvalds on the Naxos label.

The show will also premiere the first video for the album’s recording of Esenvalds’ In Paradisum, paired in video with paintings by renowned Vancouver artist Tiko Kerr.

Over the last eight years, I’ve had the opportunity to meet and interview thousands of people who work in the local screen scene, first through my “Reel People” column in the Westender, and then through “The Showbiz” here in the pages (both print and online) of the Courier.

article continues below

These film artists — these Vancouverites — are at once distinct from each other and very much the same. They’re hardworking. They’re creative. They’ll film for days in mud and snow and sleet because that’s what needs to be done in order to get the story off the page and onto the screen. They’re dreamers. They contribute more than words can properly express to the cultural and economic landscape of this city and this province. They hold up a mirror to Vancouver and reflect back our beauty and our ugliness. They entertain us. They hold us accountable. They are essential.

They’re also largely self-employed. They were mainstays in the gig economy before the gig economy was even a thing. And for the moment at least, their industry — this industry that is a dream factory and an economic powerhouse — is all but shut down.

Which means my column “The Showbiz” is on hiatus, too, until such time as our beloved film and television industry ramps up again.

(You can read about the special challenges facing film and television workers, as well as filmmaker Joel Ashton McCarthy’s Vancouver Quarantine Performance Project, in last week’s column.)

There is a lot that is uncertain about this time, and I don’t have many answers for you. I don’t know when movie theatres will re-open their doors (and frankly I don’t know how long I can survive without the Cinematheque’s popcorn or the Rio’s grilled cheese sandwiches). I don’t know when festivals will return with groundbreaking and soul-churning programs of local, national and international narrative and documentary films. I don’t know when the CW and Netflix and all the other networks that shoot up here will call everyone back to set, or when it will be safe for indie film crews to gather on weekends to shoot their passion projects.

What I do know is that the entertainment industry will return, because human beings need art, and Vancouver’s artists are still artists — are still dreaming up new ways to tell their stories — while they self-isolate and practise social distancing. And when they do, I’ll be back in these pages to tell you the stories behind the screen stories.

In the meantime, I encourage you to enjoy the work that’s already out there. Peruse Storyhive’s online archive of locally produced short films (such as A Typical Fairytale) and web series (such as Coded). Binge Hospital Show or Inconceivable on YouTube. Watch The Order or Ghost Wars or Van Helsing or Freaks or Intelligence on Netflix. Rent Down River or Black Fly or The Body Remembers When the World Broke Open on iTunes.

If you make it through all of that, tweet at me @sabrinarmf and I’ll recommend something else.

I also encourage you to subscribe to the YVR Screen Scene Podcast on Apple Podcasts or wherever you listen to podcasts. For the last year, I’ve been doing my own version of Inside the Actors Studio: sitting down with our city’s finest actors, writers, directors, showrunners, stunt artists and other talented film workers for long-form interviews about why and how they do what they do. I’ve released more than 70 episodes, and I’ll continue this work in the days, weeks and months ahead.

Thank you for reading “The Showbiz.” Thank you for valuing Vancouver’s screen storytellers. See you on the other side of COVID-19.

Vancouver comedians weigh in,['Drew Clarke'],,"Full disclosure: The author of this article is involved in the comedy scene, employed by one of the venues and is friends with some of the people interviewed for this story.

It’s been said that “tragedy plus time equals comedy.” But what if tragedy is unfolding in real time? Can we afford to laugh? Do we need laughter more than ever? The Courier checked in with four local comedians to chat about comedy in times of crisis, joking about sensitive topics and how to make money in a gig-less economy.

‘The saltiness is so good’

Sophie Buddle. Photo supplied

Sophie Buddle recently returned from Halifax, where she writes for the CBC sketch and news satire show This Hour Has 22 Minutes.

“We’ve been covering the corona story and I wasn’t worried about it for the first couple of months, but it’s just taken this turn. It feels so sudden,” she said, from her home in Vancouver. “We just wrapped two weeks ago, so I’m in kind of a good position, because most of my income for the year comes from writing for the show,” she said.

Usually when Buddle is in Vancouver, she tries to perform as much stand-up as possible, but due to current social-distancing restrictions, every comedy show in Vancouver has been shut down. “My Facebook notifications are just about everything getting cancelled,” she said. “Things I didn’t even know I was invited to got cancelled.”

Even with the serious nature of the pandemic, Buddle is still finding humour in these dark times.

“All these companies are going bankrupt and millennials are tweeting at them, being like, ‘Well, if this company didn’t want to go bankrupt, it shouldn’t have been eating avocado toast every day,’” she said. “The saltiness is so good.”

Buddle is never one to back away from sensitive topics in her own stand-up.

“My comedy is very dirty and pretty political, so that’s kind of my bread and butter,” she said. “I find it great to talk about sensitive topics because comedy is all about building that tension up and then letting it go — it’s a very easy way to create tension in a room.”

For now, Buddle is holed-up with her boyfriend, recording episodes of her podcast, Obsessed, “We did a bonus episode of him and I, early on in the quarantine,” she said. “We’ll do another one in a few weeks and see if we still love each other so much.”

‘Joking about it takes a bit of the power away from it’

Graham Clark. File photo Dan Toulgoet

Graham Clark is a three-time Canadian Comedy Award winner, he hosts the weekly stand-up showcase The Laugh Gallery and regularly appears on CBC’s The Debaters. Despite the current climate of collective anxiety, Clark is trying to stay calm.

“If I’ve learned anything from any kind of disaster movie, it’s that panicking does not help,” he said. “It’s always the panicky idiot that gets eaten by the zombie.”

Like many gig-economy workers, he has plenty of reasons to panic, including no holiday or sick pay, no employment insurance and a sudden drop in income. “In one way or another, all my income is tied to comedy,” he said. “Yeah, it’s affecting me, but I would guess it’s affecting other people even more.”

Fortunately for Clark, he already has one foot in the digital realm, with his podcast Stop Podcasting Yourself.

“In a nice twist of fate, my podcast partner, Dave Shumka, was going to go away for a holiday, so we had banked some episodes already,” said Clark, who will try to keep recording the podcast. “As long as we can find a safe way to do it, we will continue to do it.”

Clark doesn’t avoid sensitive topics in his comedy, especially when it’s something that affects all levels of society.

“This is a thing that everyone is thinking about, so you can’t not mention it, because then you’ll look like you don’t know what’s going on,” he said. “You’ll be like Jared Leto.”

The Hollywood star recently emerged from a 12-day silent retreat in the desert — completely cut off from all forms of communication — only to emerge into our new pandemic reality.

“To me, that’s the most humour-rich story that’s come down the pipe in the last few days,” chuckled Clark. “I think we seek out humour because that’s the only way our brains can get comfortable with how insane things are. Joking about it takes a bit of the power away from it.”

‘You need to be able to laugh at the ridiculousness of certain things’

Rae Lynn Carson. Photo supplied

Rae Lynn Carson is a stand-up comedian and a professional improviser. She regularly performs at Vancouver TheatreSports and in the monthly sketch and improv show Nasty Women.

“At this moment, the gig economy provides 100 per cent of my income,” said Carson. “I have a decent paycheque on its way, but I don’t have any shows booked for the rest of the month, so I’m just going to be living on that.”

She added, “I’m also diabetic, so I have to buy diabetic supplies on top of bills and rent — it’s going to be tight.”

Even with challenging times ahead, Carson is trying to see things in a positive light.

“I’m grateful that I can still make people laugh, even if I’m not making money doing it,” she said. “But I do miss making a room full of people laugh — it’s like ecstasy for me.”

Carson believes that laughter is a great way for all of us to relieve stress and tension.

“I think you need to be able to laugh at the ridiculousness of certain things, like the whole T.P. situation,” she said. “Yeah, maybe last Tuesday, you and Susanne went to the friggin’ store and bought five packs of 24-roll toilet paper and now you’re thinking, ‘Oh God, what the hell was I doing?’ You know what — we all make mistakes and it’s easier to acknowledge those things by laughing about it and just letting it go.”

‘Art is important — and it’s an important thing to support’

Aaron Read. Photo Photo Ross Dauk

Aaron Read regularly performs stand-up at various shows around Vancouver, teaches improv at Blind Tiger Comedy and is also a member of the long-running weekly improv show The Sunday Service.

“I just got a cheque for some commercial work, right before this all happened, which is a godsend,” said Read. “I’m sure a lot of artists, especially in this city, don’t have savings. If I didn’t have this cheque, I wouldn’t have savings.”

Read is all-too-aware of the ground shifting beneath his feet.

“We’re in a weird time, because everyone is trying to pivot online,” he said. “Everyone’s scrambling to figure out how to still make a living from making art.”

His improv troupe, The Sunday Service, uploaded a pre-recorded show to YouTube last Sunday, and set up an Eventbrite page where viewers could donate if they wanted to.

“That allowed us to help out the Fox [Cabaret, which normally hosts the event] with the revenue that they’re losing, as well as paying the staff that would’ve been there and the [audio and lighting] tech person. We also paid ourselves a little bit,” said Read. “It was right at the beginning of social distancing, so I think people really appreciated it.”

Read emphasized that although people are on lock-down, they shouldn’t spend too much time on the internet.

“Don’t be online all the time. Even though it’s really cool and has lots of information, it’s still really toxic,” he said. “All those assholes in the real world, who weren’t online, are now online. So you’re going to get the equivalent of a Donnelly pub flooding the internet right now.”

Despite the negativity of our current zeitgeist, Read is trying to see through the smog.

“People who are hoarding stuff and reselling it, like, capitalizing off of a pandemic, at first I thought those people were disgusting,” he said. “But then I was reading some stuff that was saying, ‘Don’t get mad at those people, because they’re just evidence of how broken our system is.’”

Ultimately, Read believes comedy can help us rise above our present mess.

“I think it’s a good time to exercise comedy that’s about catharsis,” he said. “And for comedy that’s absurd, that’s silly, as a break — not to make you forget, but to take you to another world for a second.”

Referencing the millions of people at home on their couches, Read added: “All anybody is doing right now is self-soothing by watching stuff and listening to stuff. Art is important — and it’s an important thing to support.”

He's released a public service announcement on YouTube, which is a humourous take on a Canadian classic from the now-defunct Concerned Children's Advertisers.

The puppets in the original delivered a message about not putting things in your mouth — specifically medicine, ""bad food or some poison"" — because it would make you sick.

In an email, Brown writes: ""I decided to dust it off and give it a new message.""

In his version, the puppets are telling you to wash your hands, don't ""turn your stupid face,"" and ""stay in your f***ing house"" because you might get sick, or make others sick — with COVID-19, of course.

The director says he's ""been frustrated by people not taking the COVID-19 outbreak seriously and wanted to make something to help spread the word.”

“I was trying to think of something I could do quickly and without having to go out and film something. I remembered 'Don’t you put it your mouth,' figured it sounded close enough to 'Don’t you ever leave the house' and just went from there.""

Brown and his friend Jess Rivers wrote the lyrics and did the voice work for it, collaborating from their homes over FaceTime and recording their individual parts on their phones. Shawn Penner created the music track for it.

Virtual open mic nights, online readings and drag performances via social media are becoming the new normal as Vancouver waits out the COVID-19 pandemic.

article continues below

One local filmmaker decided to take it a step further with the Vancouver Quarantine Performance Project (VQPP), an online festival and competition aimed at bringing the city’s actors, writers and creators together (virtually) to create and share art.

“The film community and arts community in Vancouver have been a huge part of my life, and it kills me to see it suffer these days,” Joel McCarthy, who is also festival director at Run N Gun: Vancouver's 48 hour film festival and a directing teacher, said in an email.

Launched this week, VQPP includes four categories – original monologue (must be completely original and never performed before), quarantine short film (shot in your own home, isolated outside or animated), original song (must be a world premier and performed on a video) and stand-up comedy routine (created for the contest and submitted as a video file).

The project will culminate on April 18 and 19 with a live variety show on YouTube where awards will be given and the audience can vote for their favourites.

McCarthy said the idea for the project started percolating when the NBA suspended its season on March 11.

“The writing on the wall was clear, so I started obsessing over what could be done,” he said. “We had some local film festivals coming up that I was really excited about and they are all cancelled now. I wanted to create something that couldn't be cancelled.”

The project was announced March 16 and, McCarthy said, Vancouver’s arts community has jumped at the chance to keep creating while self-isolating.

“I know of a ton of people who are planning and creating now… [we] already have a number of submissions. We don't know how big this thing is going to get, but we are generating multiple plans based on how many submissions we get.”

McCarthy said it was a “mixed bag of events” that inspired the project.

“I was feeling very down seeing pretty much all of my friends lose their jobs over the matter of a few days,” he said, adding that at the same time he was watching viral videos of quarantined Italians singing from their balconies.

McCarthy also has some experience with broadcasting live events online – the last film competition he organized sold out quickly so the decision was made to take it online – and he already has the needed equipment and infrastructure in place.

“This is ultimately a way of me dealing with my depression, anxiety and despair as we go through these uncertain times.”

McCarthy said updates will be posted on the VQPP Facebook page and an official schedule will be released once all the submissions are in and organizers know how much content they have.

Entries can be submitted online at filmfreeway.com/vqpp.

Submissions are due April 3.

For the 2020-21 season, the cap was estimated to be $84 million to $88.2 million, depending on a few factors.

That has changed.

article continues below

The suspension caused by COVID-19 and the uncertain future of the 2019-20 season leaves next season’s salary cap in serious jeopardy.

That’s because the cap is tied to league revenues. There’s meant to be a 50/50 split in revenues between the owners and the players. If there’s a drop in revenue for the owners — from a loss of gate revenue for unplayed or unattended games, unplayed playoff games, or a crashing Canadian dollar — then the NHL’s Collective Bargaining Agreement leads to less money for the players the following season in the form of a reduced salary cap.

A significant increase in the salary cap would have been a major relief for a team close to the cap like the Vancouver Canucks. The Canucks were set to have a tough time navigating the cap next season, thanks to the combination of a few highly-paid veterans, performance bonuses for young stars rolling over from this current season, Roberto Luongo’s cap recapture penalty, and several restricted and unrestricted free agents they need to re-sign.

If the salary cap went up, it’s possible the Canucks wouldn’t have to choose between UFAs Jacob Markstrom, Tyler Toffoli and Chris Tanev, but could re-sign all three. A flat cap — one that stayed at $81.5 million — would force the Canucks to choose two and possibly lose another player like Troy Stecher or Josh Leivo.

If the cap goes down? Then the Canucks are in some serious trouble, with difficult decisions to make that will undoubtedly make the team worse for next season. And they’re not the only ones: plenty of other teams would feel the cap crunch from this unprecedented situation.

Potential solutions could include an artificially inflated cap, but one option that has come up in NHL circles is compliance buyouts, with Brian Burke discussing it recently on Oilers Now, a radio program with Global News.

“I’ve heard discussion of compliance buyouts to help teams get to this new cap, to solve some of their problems,” said Burke. “In the last CBA, each team got two cap-compliance buyouts which were exempt from the cap.”

A compliance buyout would differ from a regular buyout in that it wouldn’t cost money against the salary cap. For instance, the Canucks will still have a little over $1 million against next season’s cap from buying out Ryan Spooner, but the Canucks bought out Keith Ballard and David Booth in 2013 and 2014 at no cost to their cap as compliance buyouts after the 2012-13 lockout.

If teams do get a compliance buyout, it seems obvious who the Canucks would use it on. Loui Eriksson has a $6 million cap hit for two more seasons following this one and has found himself in an increasingly-diminished role, playing primarily as a shutdown, defensive forward, with little-to-no contributions offensively.

The Canucks do have other options, however. Brandon Sutter has lost several steps and has a $4.375 million cap hit next season. They could be proactive and buy out Tyler Myers’ $6 million contract for the next four seasons before his play starts to decline. Cutting their losses on Micheal Ferland’s $3.5 million cap hit for the next three seasons might be smart. They might even be tempted to buy out Sben Baertschi’s $3.37 million contract with him buried in the AHL.

Do any of those supersede Eriksson? Probably not. Where it gets interesting is if teams get two buyouts, as they did in 2013 and 2014. Buying out Eriksson would be a given, then, but who would be the second buyout? Sutter has just one year left on his contract, Ferland’s cap hit isn’t overly onerous, and Tyler Myers is still a good, useful player.

One compliance buyout would make it far easier for the Canucks to re-sign Markstrom and Tanev. Two might mean re-signing Toffoli as well.

Stick-taps and Glove-drops

A tap of the stick to Eddie Lackas he announced his retirement from professional hockey on Monday. The former Canuck said the “best time in my career” was in Vancouver and thanked the fans sincerely.

A big stick-tap to Bauer. The hockey equipment manufacturer has modified its production line to produce protective visors for healthcare workers, with Quebec already ordering 300,000 visors for their doctors, nurses, and first responders.

Big Numbers

89 In four seasons with the Canucks, Loui Eriksson has a total of 38 goals and 89 points. He had 30 goals and 63 points in just one season with the Boston Bruins prior to signing with the Canucks.

4 So far, four NHL players have tested positive for COVID-19: two from the Ottawa Senators and two from the Colorado Avalanche. The Senators’ radio colour commentator, Gord Wilson, has also tested positive, as has St. Louis Blues’ play-by-play announcer John Kelly.

With the season suspended because of the COVID-19 pandemic and a lot of fans confined to their homes for much of the day for the same reason, they’re jonesing for a little Canucks action to help get them through.

Because of that, fans were eager to watch a couple classic Canucks games on Saturday, with Sportsnet Pacific airing two games in lieu of Hockey Night in Canada. At 4pm, they showed 2004’s Game 7 between the Canucks and Calgary Flames, and at 7pm, it was 2011’s Game 7 between the Canucks and Chicago Blackhawks.

article continues below

The 2004 game, despite the way it ended for Canucks fans, was a treat. It was great to see the likes of Markus Naslund, Mattias Ohlund, and Sami Salo back in action. Seeing the Sedins on a line with Trevor Linden was a treat, though it was a little bizarre to see them on the ice at times with a number 14 that wasn’t Alex Burrows. Instead, it was Geoff Sanderson, who wore 14 after coming to the Canucks at the trade deadline for the second time in his career.

On the other hand, the 2011 game, despite being objectively one of the greatest moments in Canucks history, was strangely disappointing.

Both games include one of the greatest play-by-play calls in Canucks history. The game against the Flames featured Chris Cuthbert’s play-by-play masterclass on Matt Cooke’s game-tying goal in the dying seconds of regulation that had Ed Jovanovski jumping up and down like a madman in the penalty box.

Meanwhile, the game against the Blackhawks featured not one, but two classic calls of Alex Burrows’ overtime game-winner. One was from John Shorthouse’s play-by-play for radio, the well-known “They’ve slayed the dragon!” call, but the television call is just as great. Jim Hughson unexpectedly paraphrased a line from The Exorcist, declaring, “It’s a wonderful day for an exorcism!”

Canucks fans got neither call.

Instead of the Canadian feed from the CBC broadcast, Sportsnet used the American feed from Versus, now known as the NBC Sports Network.

Instead of Hughson, fans got the play-by-play of John Forslund, with Daryl Reaugh and Brian Engblom providing commentary. There was nothing particularly wrong with their commentary — well, apart from Forslund botching the call of Alex Burrows’ opening goal, saying it was scored by Mason Raymond — but it’s hard to compare with that of Hughson, particularly since his call is the one that Canucks fans remember.

Forslund also called Burrows’ goal an exorcism, but it didn’t quite have the impact, perhaps because he didn’t let the moment breathe. He rolled right through from the goal call to saying, “They exorcise their demons and eliminate the Stanley Cup Champions.”

To be fair, Forslund is a fine play-by-play commentator, legitimately one of the best in the business. It’s just exceedingly odd that Sportsnet Pacific, which is aimed primarily at Canucks fans, would use the American feed. The replay of the 2004 game used the CBC feed, so it isn’t a rights issue.

According to Andrew Garas, the Director of Communications at Sportsnet, the reason for the US feed was because of the complexities of the archiving systems from which they’re trying to find games.

“We're working to get a wide range of games from our various archiving systems,” said Garas. “At the time we were going to air this particular game, only the US feed was available, with some parts condensed.”

Evidently, no one anticipated needing to fill weeks of airtime with full replays of old games.

“You would think that they would all be labeled, you can just go in and say, I want this game from this year at this time,” said Garas, “but I don't think anyone's ever been in a situation like this where you're going back so far and getting games from years past. They're all somewhere in some capacity. It's just a matter of...being able to extract them from the archiving systems.”

Beyond the source of the broadcast, the replay of the 2011 game was plagued by problems. The first five minutes or so were nearly unwatchable due to a jittery frame rate that had the players looking like bad stop-motion animation. This was, again, an issue with the Versus feed that Sportsnet was able to extract from their archives.

Eventually, the broadcast smoothed out, but then Canucks fans just had a clearer view of the baffling editing decisions made to fit the game’s broadcast into a tighter timeframe. Garas was unable to specify whether these cuts were part of the Versus feed in the archive or if they were choices made by Sportsnet. Whoever made the edit removed two key moments from the game.

One was Alex Burrows’ penalty shot near the beginning of the third period. Burrows had a monumental performance in Game 7. He opened the scoring in the game off a great feed by Ryan Kesler, then had multiple chances to pad the team’s lead, finishing the game with seven shots on goal.

None of his chances were better than his penalty shot just seconds into the third. Burrows had been money on the breakaway and in the shootout all season, with his patented backhand deke that he once claimed was unstoppable if he did it correctly.

Asked Burrows if he thought goalies were wise to that shootout move 2 wks ago. He told me, ""If I do it right, it doesn't matter."" #Canucks — Daniel Wagner (@passittobulis) February 8, 2012

So, when Burrows was taken down from behind by Duncan Keith on the breakaway, it seemed certain that he would go to his, well, go-to move.

Instead, perhaps concerned that Corey Crawford would see it coming, Burrows stayed on the forehand and tried to go past Crawford’s blocker. He was shut down.

“It was probably the worst attempt of my career on a penalty shot,” said Burrows to The Athletic a few months ago. “I know where to shoot, but it was a total fail shot. It was an easy save for Crawford.”

That failed penalty shot is a key part of the narrative of that game and the role Burrows played. Removing it from the replay of the game just doesn’t make any sense.

Saturday’s broadcast also cut out another major moment from the game. Early in overtime, Burrows took a holding penalty, leaving him sitting in the box at a crucial time. In many ways, you could compare it to the 2004 Game 7 against the Flames, with another heart-and-soul player sitting in the box early in overtime, Jovanovski.

In many ways, that entire game was about Burrows. He scored both Canucks goals, had a game-high seven shots, got stopped on a penalty shot, and took a potentially-devastating penalty in overtime. The narrative of that game rises and falls with Burrows.

While killing Burrows’ penalty, Roberto Luongo made a fantastic save on Patrick Sharp on a backdoor play. Hearts stopped across BC in that moment, as Sharp looked to have the game on his stick, but Luongo made the stop.

“From the box, I was just so relieved that Lu made that push and got his blocker on it,” said Burrows to The Athletic.

“I saved his ass,” said Luongo.

That was one of the biggest moments of the game. Sportsnet cut it all out of the replay.

Fans didn’t get to see Burrows take the penalty. They didn’t see the Canucks’ penalty killers go to work to keep the Blackhawks from scoring the game-winning and series-ending goal. They didn’t get to see one of the most important saves of Luongo’s career.

Instead, the broadcast jumped ahead in overtime, skipping over the Blackhawks power play entirely.

In a way, the editing of the latter parts of the game echoed the jittery frame rate of the opening minutes: it was herky-jerky and hard to watch, leaving the feeling that fans were missing something.

Fortunately, Garas indicated that Sportsnet has big plans for the coming weeks that should erase the sour taste that Saturday's broadcast left in the mouths of Canucks fans.

“Right now what we're trying to do is we're trying to get the entirety of the 2011 series versus Chicago, to be able to air that in its entirety,” he said.

Hopefully Sportsnet will be able to grab the CBC broadcasts from the archives when they air the series in the near future.

For now, fans have other Canucks games from the past to look forward to. Sportsnet shared the Canucks game that are on their upcoming schedule:

Virtually.

article continues below

Thursday, the BCHL launched a simulation — created in the EA Sports video game NHL2020 — of the rest of the league’s playoff series that were cancelled March 13, just as the second round of the post-season was set to begin.

A player representative from each of the eight teams remaining in the playoff tourney is handling the game controls in a head-to-head match-up against their second-round opponent, with a two-minute highlight reel — complete with commentary by the teams’ broadcasters — posted to the league website.

“We were looking for a way to keep fans engaged during this unfortunate downtime,” BCHL commissioner Chris Hebb said in a press release. “We’ve tried to make it a fun and unique BCHL experience for everyone to enjoy.”

The initiative sprang from a project by the former director of communications for the Express, Jacob Lazare. Bored and restless after the team dispatched the Langley Rivermen from the playoffs’ first round in four straight games and were awaiting the start of the second round, he put together a simulation of a series between Coquitlam and the Surrey Eagles, who took seven games to defeat the Chilliwack Chiefs.

Lazare said he was able to use the video game’s various customization features to recreate the rosters of the two rivals, ranking each player’s attributes and tendencies, like their skating ability, speed, puck-handling skills and physicality, on a scale from zero to 99.

“You can go through and create a player that mimics the actual players realistically,” Lazare told The Tri-City News, adding he can set a dazzling skater like Massimo Rizzo to weave around defenders and a skilled stickman like defender Drew Cooper to repel onrushing forwards one-on-one.

While his own knowledge of the Express gleaned from running the team’s video camera during games helped him build Coquitlam’s digital doppelgänger, Lazare reached out to contacts at the Eagles to inform his recreations of Surrey’s players.

The effort was an amusing distraction that got some attention on social media.

But when the actual series, and the rest of the season, was scrubbed because of the pandemic, the league reached out to spin his effort into a virtual march to the Fred Page Cup championship.

Lazare said it takes him a couple of hours to handicap all the players for each team, and additional time to create facsimiles of the uniforms and match headshots with the game’s graphics.

“It’s just to make it so fans can recognize their teams’ players,” he said of the laborious attention to detail.

Lazare lamented, however, that limitations in the game don’t allow him to recreate the cozy confines of BCHL arenas, so the virtual players are battling in front of likely the biggest crowds they’ve ever experienced, even if they’re comprised entirely of pixels.

Lazare said having actual players contest the rest of the playoffs, albeit with the help of the game’s artificial intelligence, adds an extra wrinkle of unpredictability, which is part of the fun.

“Somebody is able to win it for their team,” he said. “There can be upsets involved.”

The first series, contested between Express goalie Joe Howe and Hassan Akl of the Surrey Eagles, is already decided, with the three remaining series to be posted in the coming days. The third round of the playoff simulation commences next week.",[]

Tuesday, Batchelor put out the call to fans and his followers for random videos to which he would apply his vocal talents.

“I'm bored,” he said, adding he’ll do three such play-by-play calls a day.

HIs first three calls were a golfer at the driving range, a cat losing its mind in a cardboard box and a couple of pillow fighters blinded by hoods pulled over their faces.

“Keep ’em coming,” Batchelor said afterward.

Batchelor has been the Canucks’ play-by-play man since 2017 after several years calling Vancouver Giants games.

The Dr. Charles Best secondary school grad said he honed his commentary chops calling goals and assists while playing road hockey in the driveway of his parents’ home on Harbour Drive, playing table hockey in the basement and video games.

“I was huge into hockey,” Batchelor told The Tri-City News.

To fulfill his dream of announcing the sport, Batchelor studied broadcasting at BCIT and volunteered doing public address announcements for the Burnaby Express of the BC Hockey League (BCHL), then followed the team when it returned to Coquitlam.

In 2012, Batchelor became the broadcaster for the BCHL’s Surrey Eagles, then graduated to the Giants and the Western Hockey League the next year.

His Twitter project follows the lead of another social media effort by Port Moody’s Al Murdoch, the Canucks’ public address announcer. He has been taking requests to call goals and assists for the team’s fans and minor hockey players, posting one a day for his followers.

Murdoch said he launched the initiative because he missed doing the announcements at Rogers Arena, especially as the Canucks were in the thick of the playoff race before the season was abruptly suspended March 12.

He said he also wanted to help lift spirits at a time when everyone is anxious about the pandemic and its mounting economic and societal consequences.

His idea has since been picked up by other announcers, including Mike Ross of the Toronto Maple Leafs and the New Jersey Devils' goal and assist caller, Kevin Clark.

Ryan entered the NHL/NHLPA Players' Assistance program on Nov. 20 to get help for alcohol addiction. After going public with his story in an effort to help others with addiction issues, an emotional Ryan returned to the ice Feb. 27 and scored three times in a 5-2 win over visiting Vancouver.

Lindblom was diagnosed in December with Ewing's sarcoma, a cancerous tumour that grows in the bones or in the tissue around bones. He completed radiation treatments on July 2.

The rising star had 11 goals and 18 points in 30 games this season. While he has recently skated at the Flyers' complex in Voorhees, New Jersey, he has been ruled out of playing when the NHL season resumes.

Johns missed all of last season and the first 47 games of this one with painful headaches due to post-concussion syndrome. He scored four games into his return on Feb. 3 against the Rangers, with his parents in attendance at Madison Square Garden.

The 18-year veteran quarterback headlines the Canadian Football Hall of Fame's 2020 class that was unveiled Thursday. Burris, 45, got the nod in his first year of eligibility, becoming just the 21st player ever to do so but second in as many years after Calgary running back Jon Cornish in 2019.

article continues below

Joining Burris in the player category are offensive linemen Clyde Brock and Freddie Childress and quarterback Greg Vavra. John Hufnagel, the Calgary Stampeders president/GM, and Larry Uteck (posthumously), the former head coach/athletic director at Saint Mary’s University, were both named as builders.

Burris's family — wife Nicole and sons Armand and Barron — had known of his induction since February but managed to keep quiet about it until about two and a half weeks ago when the Hall of Fame informed Burris. Even then, the Burris clan was very nonchalant in asking the former quarterback to take in what he thought was a run-of-the-mill video.

Instead, Burris watched Hall of Famer Damon Allen (2012) outline his pro football journey to Canada, which drew a rather bewildered look from Burris. Then Allen detailed Burris's stellar CFL career before Mark DeNobile, the Hall of Fame's executive director, delivered the big news.

And the player, affectionately dubbed Smilin' Hank because of his outgoing personality, was lost for words as tears streamed down his face.

""Yeah, they got me good,"" Burris said with a chuckle. ""What's funny is whenever I've told the boys to keep anything quiet, they've always gone back to their mother and yet they didn't say a peep about this.

""I was lost for words just because to hear it shows you that people appreciated the things you did throughout your career. This is the way for the league and all the organizations and the fans saying, 'Thank you,' and for me I'm humbled by it . . . there's so many guys in there (Hall of Fame) who I looked up to and now to be able to join them is a dream come true.""

The six-foot-one, 190-pound Burris, a native of Spiro, Okla., played 20 pro seasons, 18 in the CFL with the Calgary Stampeders (1997-99, 2005-11), Saskatchewan Roughriders (2000, 2003-04), Hamilton Tiger-Cats (2012-13) and Ottawa Redblacks (2014-16). Burris also spent time with the NFL's Green Bay Packers (2001) and Chicago Bears (2002).

Burris appeared in five Grey Cups, winning three (1998, '08, '16) and being named the MVP twice (2008, '16). The CFL's outstanding player on two occasions (2010, 2015), Burris amassed 63,639 passing yards and 373 TD passes — both third all-time.

Burris retired shortly after leading Ottawa to a thrilling 39-33 overtime Grey Cup upset win over Calgary. He threw for 461 yards and three TDs despite suffering a knee injury during warmups.

Burris said his Hall of Fame induction is as much a testament to his family's resilience and perseverance as it is his on-field accomplishments.

""I had to take my wife all over Canada, drag my kids all over Canada and force them to make new friends just for dad to be able to play this game called football,"" said Burris, whose family still calls Ottawa home. ""And for them to understand and see just the emotions that ran through me . . . it just shows how big that moment is, just kind of when your whole life flashes before you.""

Burris and the other inductees will have to wait for their day in the sun due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2020 class will be honoured alongside the 2021 inductees next August.

When Burris is formally honoured, he'll be joined by former teammate Childress and Hufnagel, who served as Calgary's head coach (2008-2015) before moving into the front office full-time. Burris won Grey Cups with both ('98 with Childress, '08 with Hufnagel).

""Calgary is a machine right now and it all started in 2008 when Huf came in and we got that Grey Cup in his first year,"" Burris said. ""Calgary has always had double-digit wins and been in the playoffs each and every year Huf has been there, they've always been a strong contender for the Grey Cup and there's one reason why.""

Hufnagel, a 68-year-old native of Coraopolis, Pa., spent 12 seasons as a CFL quarterback with Calgary (1976-79), Saskatchewan (1980-83, 1987) and Winnipeg (1984-86) before getting into coaching. A five-time Grey Cup champion, Hufnagel also earned a Super Bowl ring as an assistant with the New England Patriots (2003).

Hufnagel amassed a 102-42-1 record as Calgary's head coach, his .712 win percentage being the highest among coaches with more than 100 games. He's been named the CFL's coach of the year twice (2008, 2014).

Childress, a 53-year-old native of Little Rock, Ark., played 13 CFL seasons with Shreveport (1994), Birmingham (1995), Calgary (1996-03) and Saskatchewan (2004-06). A former second-round pick of the NFL's New England Patriots, Childress won two Grey Cups with the Stampeders (1998, 2001) and in 1998 was named the CFL's top offensive lineman.

Brock, 79, of Los Angeles, played 12 seasons with Saskatchewan (1964-75), helping the club win its first Grey Cup in 1966. The former Dallas Cowboy-San Francisco 49er appeared in 169 regular-season CFL games and four times was named a league all-star before being inducted into Saskatchewan's Plaza of Honour in 1995.

Vavra, 59, of Red Deer, Alta., helped the Calgary Dinos win the Vanier Cup in 1983, his final season at the school. That year, he also became the first player in the program's history to capture the Hec Crighton Trophy as Canadian university football's top player and still holds the U Sports record for most passing yards in a game (627).

Vavra was drafted by the Calgary Stampeders in 1984 and also spent time with the B.C. Lions (1986-87) and Edmonton Eskimos (1988).

After playing seven CFL seasons as a defensive back with Toronto (1974-76), B.C. (1977), Montreal (1978-80) and Ottawa (1980), Uteck became an assistant coach at Saint Mary’s University in 1982. He was promoted to head coach the following year, a position he held until 1997.

Over that span, Uteck was named the Atlantic University Athletic Association coach of the year five times and twice Canadian university football's top coach.

Uteck served as athletic director from 1995 to 2002 and the Huskies captured two Vanier Cups (2001-02). The native of Thornhill, Ont., passed away Dec. 25, 2002 of Lou Gehrig's disease at the age of 50.

The Atlantic Bowl was renamed the Uteck Bowl in 2003.

Columbus announced Thursday that it has named McMillan vice-president, soccer administration and operations.

McMillan stepped down as Toronto's senior director of administration and operations in March. So did husband Corey Wray, who was Toronto's assistant GM, team operations and strategy. Toronto did not announce the departures at the time.

The latest move reunites McMillan with Columbus president and GM Tim Bezbatchenko, who stepped down as Toronto's senior vice-president of soccer operations and GM in January 2019 to join his hometown club in Ohio.

""We are thrilled to welcome Jaime McMillan to the club,"" Bezbatchenko said in a statement. ""Jaime played a critical role in the front office, simultaneously managing and executing high-level projects during her time with Toronto FC as it became a perennial MLS Cup contender, and I know she will be a great asset to the Crew as we continue to grow our ambitions and elevate the club in this new era.""

McMillan will oversee Columbus' administration and management in non-technical areas, including soccer operations administration, facilities and budgeting.

The Crew said her role ""will also include a focus on player and staff administration, academy administration and other club support areas.""

Toronto enjoys a reputation as one of MLS' best teams at helping players settle off the field, with McMillan leading the way.

McMillan joined Toronto in 2010 as co-ordinator for business operations. She went on to become senior manager of team development (2013-15), director of team development (2015-16) and director of administrations and operations (2016-18) before taking on the role of senior director of administration and operations.

Toronto won one MLS Cup (2017), one Supporters' Shield (2017) and six Canadian Championships (2010, 2011, 2012, 2016, 2007, 2018) during McMillan's tenure.

""Absolutely one (of) the best in the business,"" tweeted Toronto striker Jozy Altidore.

""Columbus Crew SC has been making some great moves. Jaime will make the entire organization better. Congrats Jaime!!!""

The Super League announced its revamped schedule for the resumption of rugby league play, with Toronto playing its remaining games on the other side of the Atlantic.

article continues below

""Regrettably for the Wolfpack the challenges around travel, international border protocols and the hosting of public events in Toronto have proved too significant for the team to be able to host games at Lamport Stadium this season,"" Toronto CEO and chairman Bob Hunter said in an open letter to fans.

""This is not a decision that has been taken lightly, and we vow to return to Toronto bigger and better than ever before in 2021.""

Toronto has not played at home since Oct. 5, 2019, when it won promotion to the Super League with a 24-6 victory over Featherstone Rovers in the Million Pound Game before an announced sellout crowd of 9,974 – a Wolfpack record — at Lamport Stadium.

Rubbing salt in the wound, Toronto fans also woke up to the news Thursday that winger Liam Kay, the team's all-time leading scorer and first-ever player signing, had left to join Wakefield Trinity.

The Wolfpack, 0-6-0 in their first season in the top-tier Super League, have not played since March 11, when they blanked Huddersfield 18-0 in the fifth round of the Challenge Cup. Play was suspended five days later.

Super League features 12 teams — 10 in England, one in France and the Wolfpack.

Play resumes Aug. 2 in England with Toronto playing Hull Kingston Rovers as part of a tripleheader at Leeds Rhinos' Emerald Headingley Stadium. The rest of August sees weekend tripleheaders played over two days behind closed doors — initially at Headingley and St Helens' Totally Wicked Stadium.

""Today's fixtures announcement finally brings the 2020 season back to life,"" Super League executive chairman Robert Elstone said in a statement.

The schedule grows more crowded near the end of the season with Toronto playing its final six games over three weeks.

That's a concern given the physical nature of the sport. It's more of a worry for Toronto, which has a small squad and is facing a looming visa issue involving New Zealand star Sonny Bill Williams and six other imports.

Australia's Josh McCrone, Darcy Lussick and Blake Wallace, Australian-born Samoan international Ricky Leutele and New Zealand's Williams, Chase Stanley and Bodene Thompson have visas that allow for six months in England over a year.

That's not a problem when the Wolfpack are spending part of the season in Canada. But the global pandemic has kept the players in England and the visas are slated to expire at the end of the month.

Because the Wolfpack are Canadian-owned, they require different visas than overseas players employed by English clubs.

Super League said it will review dates and venues ""in the back end of the campaign ... in line with government advice and in discussion with our host broadcaster, Sky Sports.""

The hope is the teams can eventually host games with fans in their home market — with the exception of Toronto.

The playoffs, featuring the top four in the 12-team league, are scheduled for mid/late-November with the Grand Final scheduled for the end of November.

The championship game was originally slated for Oct. 10.

Super League said clubs will be back in training by the end of next week.

Under the original 2020 schedule, nine of Toronto's first 10 games were to be played in England with the other in France — with the late start due to the Canadian winter and the bubble over Lamport Stadium yet to come down. The Wolfpack were to play 11 of their last 19 games at home, with the season wrapping up Sept. 11.

Three other home games were to be played at neutral sites in England.

The newspaper explained the decision in a note by Bill Sternberg, editorial page editor, attached to the column online. Navarro's column originally moved online late Tuesday and was published in Wednesday's newspaper.

article continues below

Navarro wrote that Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, ""has been wrong about everything I interacted with him on.""

The newspaper on Wednesday evening also ran a fact-check story by Washington reporter Ledyard King examining five of Navarro's claims.

USA Today did not immediately return messages seeking comment on how Navarro's column escaped such scrutiny before being published. The incident is reminiscent of The New York Times saying last month that an opinion column by U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton hadn't been properly vetted, which led to the resignation of the paper's opinion editor.

Navarro also did not immediately return a message.

USA Today said it had sought Navarro's opinion to accompany an editorial that the newspaper ran calling Fauci ""a national treasure.""

That editorial said the fact that Navarro was writing the opposing viewpoint ""shows how hard it is to find an actual medical professional willing to undercut Fauci.""

It wasn't clear whether the newspaper sought those opinions.

Fauci has essentially been shelved by the White House as a prominent spokesperson on the coronavirus pandemic because he's publicly been more pessimistic than the president. But Trump distanced himself from Navarro's column, saying Wednesday that the column was Navarro's views and ""he shouldn't be doing that.""

Navarro claimed in the column that Fauci opposed travel restrictions from China that were imposed by Trump that ""might well have saved hundreds of thousands of American lives."" USA Today said there isn't enough data to conclude the restrictions made a significant difference, and that despite some initial skepticism, Fauci backed the president.

The fact-checker also gave more context to Navarro claims about masks, the drug hydroxychloroquine and Fauci's early statements of concern about the virus.",[]

He’s returned to the charts in 2020, working on songs for rising and established rap stars, including Lil Wayne, Juice WRLD, Saweetie and Doja Cat.

The songmaster, who has been entangled in a bitter lawsuit with former collaborator Kesha since 2014, has produced and co-written Saweetie’s new single ""Tap In,"" the follow-up to her double-platinum smash ""My Type."" Dr. Luke also co-wrote and co-produced Juice WRLD’s ""Wishing Well,"" taken from the rapper’s first posthumous album ""Legends Never Die,"" released last week.

article continues below

The recent successes mean all three major U.S. record label companies have worked with Dr. Luke this year, even if he hasn't always put his widely recognizable professional name to the new collaborations.

Dr. Luke marked a major comeback this year with the success of the Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hit ""Say So"" by rapper-singer Doja Cat, who is signed to Dr. Luke's Kemosabe Records. Dr. Luke, born Lukasz Sebastian Gottwald, produced several songs on Cat’s sophomore album ""Hot Pink,"" including single ""Like That,"" which is No. 5 on Billboard’s Hot R&B songs chart. He is the only producer with two songs in the Top 10 on the latter chart (""Say So"" sits at No. 2).

For his work with Cat, he used the alias Tyson Traxe. He used the same pseudonym for his production credit on Toronto rapper-singer Benny Mayne’s ""Hokey Pokey,"" released this year. For Lil Wayne’s ""Shimmy,"" a track featuring Cat on the deluxe edition of his latest album ""Funeral,"" Dr. Luke used the name Loctor Duke.

Label representatives for Saweetie, Juice WRLD, Lil Wayne and Cat didn’t immediately reply to emails seeking comment. Neither did a representative for Dr. Luke.

Luke has sprinkled his comeback among the major labels. Cat is signed to Sony Music’s RCA Records, while Saweetie is part of the Warner Music family. Lil Wayne releases music through his Young Money imprint and Republic Records, a division of Universal Music Group.

Before Dr. Luke topped the charts this year with ""Say So,"" he last had a No. 1 with Katy Perry's ""Dark Horse"" in 2014. Months later, Kesha accused him of sexual assault during their yearslong partnership (Dr. Luke has vigorously denied the allegations.)

A New York court dismissed Kesha’s sexual abuse-related claims in 2016 because of legal issues, without ruling on whether the allegations were true. Kesha lost another round in February, when a New York judge said she made a defamatory statement about Dr. Luke on a different occasion: a 2016 text message telling Gaga the producer had also raped Perry. Both he and Perry have denied it, and the judge said there was ""no evidence whatsoever"" to support the claim.

Kesha’s lawyers have said they plan to appeal the ruling, but it didn’t resolve other aspects of his defamation and breach-of-contract suit, including the crucial question of whether Kesha’s allegation that he raped her is true. The judge said that’s for a jury to decide at trial.

Outside of rap in 2020, Dr. Luke has produced music for pop singer Kim Petras, using the pseudonym MADE IN CHINA.",[]

Some critics online questioned whether the masked vigilante should be the primary focus after DC announced the sequel ""Rorschach"" on Wednesday. Others have slammed the decision to bring on Batman writer Tom King to write the 12-issue series, which will debut in October.

article continues below

King's approach to the Dark Knight's comic book story line he's written has been divisive. With ""Rorschach,"" he said the new series will take a compelling look at politics similar to that of HBO’s ""Watchmen"" and the original comic in 1986. The comic will also be worked on by artist Jorge Fornés, colorist Dave Stewart and letterer Clayton Cowles.

The HBO series earned acclaim for delivering a story about race relations in America. But some are concerned about whether the story about the anti-hero Rorschach, who wears a trenchcoat, fedora and white mask with morphing inkblots, will be as relevant today.

King believes it will be.

""This is a very political work."" he said in a statement. ""It’s an angry work. We’re so angry all the time now. We have to do something with that anger. It’s called ‘Rorschach’ not because of the character Rorschach, but because what you see in these characters tells you more about yourself than about them.""

The sequel is set 35 years after the ""Watchmen"" comic series when Dr. Manhattan turned Rorschach into dust.

A plot summary released on DC's website asks: ""So what does it mean when Rorschach reappears as part of a pair of assassins trying to kill the first candidate to oppose President Robert Redford in decades? Follow one determined detective as he walks backward in time, uncovering the identities and motives of the would-be killers, taking him deep into a dark conspiracy of alien invasions, disgraced do-gooders, mystical visions, and yes, comic books.""",[]

All day long, the streets of the city are starkly bare, with storefronts boarded up to ward off would-be criminal opportunists, and traffic mostly a trickle. Even the Nine o'clock gun is on a new schedule.

With COVID-19 measures restricting travel in and out of the country, and all gatherings off limits, Vancouver's hotels have gone dark. Inside, their restaurants and spas are closed, and there are no weddings, conferences, or meetings taking place.

But some Vancouver hotels have joined in the global movement to spread a little love from the inside out by displaying hearts in their windows. Specifically, they're turning the lights on in certain rooms to form massive lit-up heart shapes, easily seen in person or in photos.

The hotels we've tracked putting their heart on their massive sides are the Fairmont properties in downtown Vancouver – at the Hotel Vancouver on Georgia, the Waterfront across from Canada Place and the Pacific Rim in Coal Harbour.

Check them out, and feel the love:

P.S. the window hearts are brightening up city-scapes elsewhere, too, like in Las Vegas, where hotels and casinos are absolute icons.

Seven-year-old Kian and his sister Kiera, 6, took to YouTube with a three-and-a-half minute video, titled “COVID-19: What To Do When Staying At Home, For Kids And Family” that shows the adorable siblings partaking in activities like baking (and eating) cookies, having sumo wrestling and pillow fights, making care packages for others, and “climbing a mountain”—or, if mountains aren’t available, a small hill—all with a comedic twist.



“We came up with the idea together,” explained Kian and Kiera’s mom, Lydia Lee, in an email.

“It all started with a conversation about what's happening to the world, to our country and city and why we are social distancing right now. We also had some open discussion about how people might feel and what we can help our family and friends. Since we had to cancel all of our plans and playdates for spring break, they made a bucket list of all the things they would like to do at home and one of them was 'making a movie.’”

While Kiera’s hope for the video was that it might help “other kids not to be scared,” Kian said he hoped their video could give other kids ideas about how they could avoid being bored at home, Lee added.

Lee said her children are enjoying the extra family time at home, but are missing friends, playgrounds and their favourite restaurants, just “like everybody else.”



She added, “We also try our best to keep them busy, and do meaningful things for our community so they have a different perspective of not just focus on their needs but others.”



But the bright side of the self-isolation? “It actually pushes them to be more creative,” Lee explained.

Yes, some of our self-isolating nerves are fraying while our society has practically, and in some cases truly, ground to a halt. It’s surreal, isn’t it?

article continues below

As you’ve no doubt come to realize as quickly as have I, most everything we do has been impacted by the coronavirus, even this wee column: welcome to the last edition of my “Vancouver Shakedown” for the foreseeable future.

The pandemic has turned our world upside down, and that includes media. Freelancers are the first to go. It wasn’t my choice, but I will respect it. I’ve been around the block a few times. Nothing quite like COVID-19, but I get it.

I will say this: for the past several years, it’s been my great honour to share your stories along with my own opinions and adventures in this space. When you are required to deliver a column each and every week, it allows you, sometimes forces you, to explore areas of your own city that you’ve never been.

What’s it like inside the Tent City? What is he building in there, behind that garage door? Who is that lady collecting bottles in the back alley every night, anyway?

Following up on those curiosities, many times by hopping off my bike and asking a question, led me to dozens of incredible people with wonderful stories, like master Haida artist Clarence Mills, who I stumbled across while he carved a magnificent 20-foot totem pole in an anonymous East Vancouver car port. Or Gia Tran, “the angel of East Hastings,” who has faithfully donated to charity most of the money she has collected from 20 years of dumpster diving. Or Mary-Ann Liu, a sculptor who has shaped Canadian culture — everything from the Unknown Soldier in Ottawa to the dragon lamp fixtures in Chinatown — from an utterly unremarkable shed in Railtown.

And yes, I’ve pissed off plenty of people, too, not the least of which was my friend, Vancouver Is Awesome editor Bob Kronbauer, most especially when we butted heads over recreational chinook salmon fishing (I’m against it) to the normalizing of the Downtown Eastside (I’m for it). Thanks for putting up with me, Bob. And speaking of angering others, I suppose the one good thing to come out of our current ban on any sort of public gathering means that the 4/20 “protestival” will be finally snubbed out — for one year of relief, anyway.

In the meantime, much like you, I’ll be waiting out the pandemic at home with my family. Being the parents of two children, ages four and six, my wife and I are still grappling with the shocking fact there won’t be any school to return to at the end of spring break or perhaps even this school year.

My six-year-old son is aware of COVID-19 and its dangers, but my four-year-old daughter remains pretty aloof to the whole thing. The other night at dinner, we discussed our current situation softly and thoroughly. When we were done, our daughter said, “I have just one question.” We braced ourselves. “Which one of us has… a new pink umbrella?” (She does).

Despite my wife and me being generally freaked out by the rising tide of the virus, it could be honestly stated that we have already found silver linings in our unexpected quarantine: our family is bonding like never before. Games are played, books are read, laughs are shared, lessons are learned and there are plenty of hugs and kisses. And, yes, screen time for sanity, too.

Sure, the odd game of Go Fish can get a little tense, but for the most part, we’re hanging in, and we hope you are too. The most irritating hurdle so far? We’ve actually run out of f***ing toilet paper. Spare a square?

During my hopefully temporary sabbatical from this space, you can still find me over at the CBC, or on my West Coast wilderness adventure podcasts, or on various other pages in print.

I will see you on the other side of this. Stay safe, keep your distance, thanks for your stories, and thanks for reading.

As travel editor at the Vancouver Courier newspaper, vice-chair of the B.C. branch of the Travel Media Association of Canada, and a member of the Society of American Travel Writers, travel is a big part of my life, which meant I already had the contacts in place to get started.

Now with some destinations looking to slowly reopen, and, in an effort to catch a glimpse of future travel trends, I’m continuing to reach out to travel experts and tourism bureaus across Canada and the globe for answers to five similar questions.

And while no one can predict the future, all are hopeful travel will soon resume. But, how exactly that will look is anyone’s guess.

Five questions with Lessner Gomez, director, Cuba Tourist Board, Toronto office.

How did COVID-19 impact tourism in Cuba?

Like other tourist destinations around the world, Cuba closed to international travel because of the Corona Virus. Cuba is now ready to slowly open to visitors.

In order to control and isolate any possible infection, Cuba has reopened its doors in Cayo Largo, Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo, Cayo Santa María and Cayo Cruz effective July 1.

Cuba is beginning to reopen to tourism. Who are the first international visitors Cuba will be expecting?

Cuba is looking forward to welcoming travellers from Canada and Europe. We have enjoyed a special relationship with Canada for over forty years.

We look forward to welcoming Canada back to our beautiful beaches.

How important are Canadians to tourism in Cuba?

Historically Canada has always been the biggest international inbound market for Cuba.

What does the future hold for Cuba and are there any trends we can look forward to?

As with the rest of the world, the future is hard to predict, but we are very positive.

Cuba enjoys a world class health system with particular expertise in the treatment of diseases of the lungs. In fact, throughout this pandemic we have offered medical support to countries around the world.

We believe we can offer tourists from Canada the confidence to return to our wonderful destinations and we look forward to welcoming them.

We believe that by opening gradually, tourist will feel comfortable with our planning and slowly we can begin to open other parts of our country.

What enhanced safety measures have been put in place to ensure visitors to resorts, hotels and attractions will be safe?

Over the past few months, the Cuban government has focused its efforts on the battle against the pandemic.

During this time, government officials took steps to improve all hotels and tourism infrastructure. Hygiene and sanitary protocols were put in place in order to ensure the safety of the Cuban people and its international visitors, as tourism activities are reactivated.

Hygiene and sanitary protocols will be practiced from the first phase, for example:

In order to operate, tourist facilities must obtain government certification called: Most hygienic and safest tourism (T + HS).

Workers with respiratory symptoms will not be allowed on resort premises and anyone with symptoms will be immediately directed to a health center.

International tourist circulation will only take place at the cayos (islands) where tourists enjoy their holidays.

Excursions will be offered only at the cayos for the international market.

The nautical activities and operations at international marinas of tourist centers approved for international tourism are reactivated.

As approved by the Cuban Ministry of Public Health, in the second phase, foreign tourists will undergo the PCR test free of charge upon their arrival in the country.

Bonus question

Where do Americans fit into the scheme of things in Cuba right now?

There are no changes on the Cuba-US relations and related travel restrictions.

Five questions with Tourism Australia

Visitors to ustralia can take in a Jarramali Rock Art Tour. Photo Jarramali Rock Art Tours

How do you measure tourism numbers and how does Canada fit into that?

If we look at the most recent statistics from the government’s International and National Visitor Survey, which are for the year to December 2019 — just prior to the crises — it shows that our industry was in a very strong position and a major economic driver — highlighting the important role that tourism will play in Australia’s economic recovery when the coronavirus crisis passes.

The most recent figures for the 2019 year-end show that the Australian tourism industry contributes $126 billion ($80 billion domestic overnight visitor spend & $45.5 billion in international overnight visitor spend) to the Australian economy each year to one that has virtually been put on hold since restrictions were introduced due to COVID-19.

In terms of international travel, Australia welcomed 9.5 million visitors in 2019, including 190k visitors from Canada who spent $892 million on trips to Australia.

What does the future hold for your destination and are there any travel trends we can look forward to?

After spending more time at home and indoors, we’ll no doubt see a lot of the pent-up desire for travel with people wanting to get out and about more and reconnect by exploring nature through travel.

Domestically, we're already seeing a new appreciation for our natural beauty and wide-open spaces with which we expect to see a surge in Australians embracing road trips, and planning their own epic routes to discover their backyards, as some state borders have begun to reopen.

When the time is right for international travel to return to Australia, visitors will be able to indulge in the great food and wine, spectacular nature and wildlife experiences, and uniquely Australian arts and culture moments that Australia is well known for.

Australia is home to so many incredible and diverse landscapes, offering plenty of open-air experiences — from the Outback to the Great Barrier Reef as well as the many Great Walks of Australia and more — visitors are literally spoilt for choice.

Finally, wellness travel (i.e. spa holidays, yoga retreats) was growing in popularity as we closed out 2019 and the last six months have amplified the desire for this type of holiday.

When do you think your destination will be welcoming visitors once again?

International travel has effectively been at a standstill since Australia announced the closure of its borders on 20 March 2020, and it is not certain when international borders will re-open.

At this stage we are just starting to see borders reopen between some, but not all, states and territories in Australia.

From Tourism Australia’s perspective attracting international travellers will form a critical part of the tourism restart and recovery in Australia, but will likely be further down the track.

We just don’t know when international restrictions will start to be lifted, nor how the

process of restoring international travel will play out. But we will be ready to go back and go back at scale when the time is right.

Is Australia considering any ""travel bubbles"" with any other countries?

While we all want to see the return of international visitors, that’s still some way off and given domestic travel restrictions are being lifted before international ones, recovery will undoubtedly be domestic led.

However, Tourism Australia remains active in 15 international markets including Canada. For the moment we are also active in domestic marketing as we look to support our industry through these challenging times.

The process of rebuilding tourism is likely to be gradual, beginning first with visits to local cafes and restaurants, day trips, intrastate road trips and weekend breaks.

Then, as the state borders gradually re-open, interstate travel, when people have the opportunity to explore further afield. And eventually international travel, potentially starting with our near neighbours, New Zealand.

What are you doing now to keep travellers interested in Australia?

Tourism Australia has been committed to bringing Australia's unique and iconic experiences into the living rooms of grounded travellers around the world through Live from Aus, a jam-packed program of live entertainment delivered by Aussie experts in everything from koalas and kangaroos, to mountain biking, music, food and wine and much more.

The wide range of programming virtually transports viewers across the country, into every state and even underwater.

What started as a weekend of live events has continued with several recent videos, all available on-demand on Australia's YouTube channel.

We can't wait to welcome our mates from around the world Down Under when it is once again safe to travel, and in the meantime, we encourage travellers to take this time to daydream of their next trip and make it the most memorable holiday they've ever had.

We're constantly adding to the growing library of content and resources on Australia.com, including virtual tours of Australia's top sites and wildlife experiences, Australian entertainment to tune in from home and tips for planning your next Aussie trip from your living room.

We hope it inspires people to keep the wanderlust alive and to come visit us soon, because there's still nothing like Australia.

These are the cities they hear about the most and they might not be aware of the opportunities that await in other cities or provinces.

If they are young professionals with a bachelor’s or master’s degree they have a better chance of immediately attaining that goal. If they don’t, Canada is opening its doors to people who are willing to consider other options.

For those who have only a high school diploma, the best path to citizenship is by going to where the jobs are, says Rachel Gary, COO of Canada Direct. “Be flexible about where you’re willing to move to,” she advises.

Manitoba has the most lenient eligibility requirements because it needs people the most, she says. It’s also the only province that does not require applicants to pass an English language test. Saskatchewan is also making it easier for people to immigrate there.

People might think it’s too cold in these prairie provinces, or prefer more urban environments. Gary suggests that they start in Manitoba or Saskatchewan and, once they earn enough points to get resident status, apply for jobs in other provinces.

“We can submit their application to move to Vancouver right from the start but I can almost guarantee they won’t be in the pool,” she says. “We always tell them the truth because immigrating to Canada is not a cheap process. We don’t want to submit people’s applications and not get them here. If they only have a high school diploma and want this opportunity to come to Canada, they have to go to Manitoba.”

The same principle applies to the type of work people are willing to do. If they agree to work in the fields with the most demand, they can get their start in Canada and earn the points that lead to residency either on their job or by going to school.

article continues below

For many women, a miscarriage is a traumatic and isolating experience, one that is worsened by feelings of shame and guilt. These women feel that their miscarriages were their fault (even though miscarriages are very rarely caused by anything the mother has done). Despite the statistics, they often feel that no one could possibly understand their pain. They might even feel an intense societal pressure to be a mother, and that if they're unable to naturally birth a child, they're somehow less of a woman

Combined, such feelings can be absolutely crippling.

Amanda Tapping knows the burden of these feelings all too well. Tapping — the Vancouver-based actor-director who starred on Stargate SG-1 and Sanctuary — had two miscarriages before the birth of her daughter Olivia, and six miscarriages after.

Like so many other women in our midst, Tapping has wrestled with feelings of shame and isolation — and has done so largely without sharing her story with others.

""I just feel like it's one of those taboo subjects that women don't feel comfortable talking about, and there were times where I felt downright embarrassed. Truth be told, I still do,"" says Tapping in an interview with Westender in the courtyard of a North Vancouver café. ""You just don't know how to articulate it because you're struggling so much, and you feel guilty, like 'I must have done something wrong, and that's why I've lost this baby.'""

Tapping first told Westender about her miscarriages in an off-the-record conversation about motherhood back in January; it's a part of her life that she's never shared in a formal interview. But with Mother's Day approaching, we asked Tapping to consider speaking out about her journey through miscarriages and grief — and for the first time, she's doing just that.

""As hard as it is to talk about it, as scary as it is to talk about it, we have to talk about it, because how else are we going to support each other if we don't have those conversations? As soon as you give a voice to it, then it ceases to have as much power over you. I don't know if would I have the courage to do this if you hadn't asked, but I do realize how important the dialogue is.""

Tapping always knew that she wanted to be a parent, not that she and her husband of nearly 20 years, Alan Kovacs, explicitly expressed this desire to each other at the beginning of their marriage. ""I think this generation coming up maybe has that conversation more than my generation,"" she says. ""My generation, it was just expected that you would.""

The question then was not how or why but when. Once Tapping's career took off with her role on Stargate SG-1, her plans for motherhood were pushed to the backburner— until she realized she simply couldn't wait any longer. ""There was this sort of 'A-ha!' moment of, 'wait a second, this show could go on for a really long time, I don't want to finish the show and had that opportunity pass me by.'"" Spurred on by this moment of clarity, somewhere around the seventh season of Stargate SG-1, Tapping and Kovacs started trying to conceive.

Tapping had never entertained the possibility that she could suffer a miscarriage, so when she lost her first pregnancy two months in, she was completely bowled over. ""I just always assumed I would have three children so it was a bit of a shock, but I thought, 'okay, it happens, a lot of women have miscarriages.'"" The second miscarriage further rattled Tapping's confidence, and presented a startling question. ""I started to think, 'oh my God, what if I cant do this?'""

Compounding the panic was the fact that there was no apparent reason for these recurrent miscarriages. A multitude of tests showed everything was normal. ""I had absolutely no problem getting pregnant, unlike some women,"" says Tapping. ""There's a difference between the fertility struggle and the miscarriage struggle, but the pain is similar because at the end you are still childless.""

Besides the physical impact of pregnancy loss, Tapping also contended with grief and shame. ""Every time it's like your heart's ripped out of your body and then you beat yourself up and you try to stuff your heart back in and move forward,"" she says.

And move forward she did, into a third pregnancy — the one that resulted in her now eight-year-old daughter, Olivia. ""It felt different,"" says Tapping. ""It was a great pregnancy.""

Tapping relished every moment of new motherhood. She went back to work feeling not quite physically her best, but no matter: she'd always enjoyed portraying Sam Carter, and now there was there was the added bonus of a special little person waiting for milk and cuddles between takes. ""I would run around and fire my weapon pretending to save the planet, and then I would go to my trailer and strip off my vest and place my baby against my breast and I would be Zen,"" says Tapping. ""It's exhausting when you're working 14-hour days, but I loved it and I felt a sense of accomplishment. I was a mama.""

It wasn't long before Tapping felt compelled to add to her family. Despite her best efforts — and then the support of the team at the Recurrent Pregnancy Loss Clinic at BC Womens Hospital — Tapping suffered miscarriage after miscarriage. ""The first one after Olivia was frustrating because I was like, 'come on, I know how to do this, and I did it well,'"" she says.

She was pregnant on and off again throughout the remainder of Stargate SG-1, as well as on Stargate: Atlantis and during the early days of Sanctuary. Tapping rarely let those around her in on her private struggles. ""The producers on Stargate, I think I told them about one or two of the miscarriages, but I didn't feel like it was a place where I could talk about it,"" she says. Her work ethic was strong; she didnt want to let the team down.

Finally, after an eighth loss that culminated in a devastating scene in the clinic's examination room, the doctors advised Tapping to stop trying altogether. The traumas of pregnancy and miscarriage were taking too heavy a toll both physically and emotionally.

Through all of this, Tapping kept the grief of her lost pregnancies close to her bones (""You sort of go through the waves of guilt and then at one point, I felt like I had eight little baby spirits circling around me and I couldn't let them in""). She had her work; she had her spirited daughter and her husband; she barreled forward without giving herself the time and space to mourn her losses. ""It piles up; every miscarriage becomes harder because it's carrying the weight of the one before,"" she says. ""[If I could go back in time], I would have reached out to more of my women friends. I have a tendency to not want to bother people, so I go down the rabbit hole a little bit.""

Though Tapping tried to shove her feelings aside, they were always present just beneath the surface. When Sanctuary went off the air in early 2012, for the first time, those feelings had the time and space to burst through. ""I thought I had no ripples on my lake, the waves gently lapping on the shore, but then Sanctuary ended, and the full force of everything hit me,"" says Tapping. ""It was a tsunami of grief.""

Her journey to motherhood, and the healing of the last year, has given Tapping pause to consider the toxic emotions that women battle on an ongoing basis. According to Tapping, the guilt and shame that swirl around miscarriages and infertility are indicative of societal pressures on women that beginand don't cease with childbirth.

There is pressure everywhere, says Tapping: pressure to get married; pressure to be a mother within a certain age range; pressure to give birth naturally; pressure to have one child, and then another, and ideally children of both genders; pressure to breastfeed; pressure to stay at home and then pressure to go back to work. And every move is judged.

The judgment needs to stop, says Tapping. ""Who are we to judge anyone elses choice, ever? Unless they're doing something that's physically harming someone or the planet, then who the hell are we?"" she says. Once the judgment is pushed aside, says Tapping, the life-changing dialogue can begin.

For Tapping, this interview marks the beginning of a converstaion that she hopes will inspire women to give voice to their struggles and find the strength in each other that they simply won't find in isolation. ""The intention is to feel comfortable about something that has been traditionally shrouded in shame,"" she says. ""If it's not talked about, then it stays in the shadows. The more that we lift each other up and support each other, the better off we will be.""

The city-owned heritage building was damaged in a flood in 2013, but it’s being renovated and is expected to be ready for occupancy by the fall of 2018.

Other community programs had operated out of the building since the mid-1980s, prior to the flood.

article continues below

In late January, city council selected the Association of Neighbourhood Houses of B.C. (ANHBC) as the new operator of Marpole Place.

South Vancouver Neighbourhood House, one of the ANHBC’s oldest neighbourhood houses, will oversee the setup of the new centre.

Deb Bryant, ANHBC’s CEO, said the organization is currently working on the program mix, but Marpole Place will operate like a “classic neighbourhood house,” which includes some work with seniors, such as a drop-in program or formal adult daycare program, work with youth and work with young families.

Details are being ironed out.

“We’ve got a pretty strong connection with the Marpole Oakridge Community Centre. What we’d like to do is have Marpole Place be a gathering point for young people that live south of 70th — maybe to transport them up to the community centre for programs that are already operating or to do some kind of outpost programs for young people,” she said.

Other initiatives will likely involve food and food security.

“The core of our work is what we call community development or community building, so sort of a drop-in area for neighbours. We quite often do work to bring people together to look at local issues in the neighbourhood,” added Bryant.

For example, if residents see the need for a particular program such as a conversation group for English-as-a-second-language learners, a volunteer group could start one up.

“A lot of what we’ll be waiting to see is who comes forward out of the neighbourhood and what are their ideas and primary concerns, and we’ll try help accommodate that,” Bryant said.

It’s the first time the ANHBC has opened a new neighbourhood house in a decade. It currently runs six in Vancouver — Marpole Place will be its seventh. (It also has a neighbourhood house in Crescent Beach, and it operates an outdoor camp in Port Moody at Camp Sasamat.)

Bryant said studies by the City of Vancouver and Vancouver Coastal Health have revealed there’s a lack of social infrastructure in Marpole, especially at its south end.

Marpole’s population is also expected to grow by 50 per cent by 2041 and it’s considered a higher needs community because there are larger numbers of renters, single-parent families, children in low-income families and immigrants.

“There’s a real concentration of people who maybe don’t have a lot of space inside their homes, have less affluence [and therefore less] access to paid services,” she said. “There’s a little bit of a desert of social services there, especially since the flood because that building was a real cornerstone for that neighbourhood for quite a while.”

504,vancourier,http://www.vancourier.com/news/mining-the-truth-1.387540,Mining the truth,['Rob Howatson'],,"The tiny bungalow on East Kent Avenue is the most unassuming house on the block. Set well back from the road and partially obscured by trees, the simple, four-room abode seems lost among its newer, million-dollar neighbours that overlook the north arm of the Fraser River flowing past the foot of Elliott Street. A stroll down the dead-end lane behind the house, reveals even less, because a wall of wild blackberry bushes protects the back yard from prying eyes. The only notable feature in the alley is a discarded, aluminum balcony railing positioned to discourage vehicles from parking in a small clearing. The scrap metal glimmers in the sun like a grinning set of braces, as if the property savours a secret, which it most certainly does.

Few people know that country music singer Loretta Lynnshe of Coal Miners Daughter famewas discovered by record executives in that rustic backyard in 1959 when she attended a jam session held in a chicken coop that had been converted to a private party space. Lynn rarely mentions the story to journalists and the barn was demolished in the early 70s, but the truth endures. On Sept. 16, local history buffs will gather at nearby Riverfront Park to unveil a Vancouver Heritage Foundation Places That Matter plaque commemorating the Queen of Countrys inauspicious, hen-house meeting with representatives from Zero Records, the tiny Vancouver label that launched the superstars career.

article continues below

Vancouver music aficionado Mike Harling will be at the plaque party. He was the first writer to track down the former location of the Chicken Coop in 2002 after his friend, sports historian Fred Hume, told him that Kentucky-born Lynn had a connection to the city through local football pioneer and sawmill owner Norm Burley. Loretta lived in Washington State in the 1950s and she played any gig she could get, on both sides of the border, before she moved to Nashville and made it big, says the soft-spoken Harling. The First Lady of Country likes to say that Burley discovered her when he saw Loretta sing Whispering Sea on Buck Owens TV show out of Tacoma, but in fact it was two music producers from Thunder Bay, Ontario who spotted her at the Coop and signed her to Zero Records.

Don Grashey was the president of the tiny label when it began, and his longtime business partner Chuck Williams was the vice-president. They were stunned when Lynn published her first autobiography, Coal Miners Daughter in 1976 and it contained only a passing mention of Grashey and no word about The Coop. Harling interviewed the two veteran record men a few years before they passed away in 2005 and Grashey, a Canadian Country Music Association Hall of Famer, was still bitter. I would like her [Lynn] to tell the truth, instead of the bullshit that was in the movie and in her book. Norm Burley did nothing. He was just a shareholder who had some money. Thats all he was, yknow. I did all the god darned work. I signed her and I produced her and I published her songs and I promoted her god darned record [Im A Honky Tonk Girl] to number 14 on the Billboard and I got nothing out of it, but a bunch of bullshit.

Chuck Williams, who was the first of the duo to see Lynn in Vancouver, also felt that their contributions were crucial to her career. Loretta was in the Pacific Northwest singing for quite awhile before we signed her. No one had made any overtures to record her, so I believe if we hadnt discovered her, if we werent the professionals that we were and knew how to do things, I honestly dont think she would have made it.

As for The Chicken Coop, the only image of it known to exist is from a 1961 aerial photograph that hangs in the reception area of North Arm Transport, a tug and barge operation across the railway tracks from the property where the party barn once stood.

The black and white photo was hand tinted and shows an unpaved Elliott Street snaking down the South Van slope to the muddy river, the narrow road passing between the massive Fraserview subdivision that was built for Second World War veterans and the golf course of the same name that was built as a Depression-era work relief project.

Marine Drive appears as two lanes of lightly driven blacktop that cuts across the vista mid-frame. Beneath it, a loosely spaced cluster of neatly kept homes overlook the rough, industrial shoreline. Today, most of those houses have been replaced by a tight wall of detached residences and condominiums. Only the tiny 1949 bungalow, standing squat and isolated in the photos central foreground, remains. And clearly visible behind it is a long, low slung building with a patched roof and a line of small, square windows.

Gino and Leo Stradiotti, two of North Arms principals who grew up in the neighbourhood, both identify the structure as The Chicken Coop. They heard the noise from the parties, and saw ambulances and police cars attend whenever the revelers got out of hand. Neither cousin had any idea that Lynn had performed there, but they knew the property owners Ernest Clare Mac McGregor and his wife Irene. The childless couple were from the Prairies. Mac worked a short walk upriver at the giant Canadian White Pine sawmill, which has since been demolished and is being replaced by the River District condominium development. Irene was a stylish dresser who sewed her own outfits and could be seen catching the streetcar each morning enroute to her office job at an oil and coal company.

Mrs. McGregors brother was the longtime Province sports writer Clancy Lorangera cigar chomping, hard drinking, baseball statistic guru for whom the entrance street to Nat Bailey Stadium is named. Loranger passed away in 2010, but not before he gave an interview in which he recalled attending dances at The Coop. He said that his sister and brother-in-law were a pretty sharp couple, referring to their resourcefulness on limited incomes. The sports scribe had photos that showed the Fraser River squatter shacks that Mac built for his wife and mother-in-law while they struggled to save enough money to buy land. The shacks were attractive cottages on stilts with ample decks and container gardens. In one photo, Clancy and his wife Joy are horsing around on the patio beside a table draped in linen and set with fine dinner china. Mac often swam in the Fraser and if they wanted salmon for lunch, they just tied a line to the railing.

After a few years of living tax free on the river, the McGregors bought the property at 2541 East Kent and built a real house. The Chicken Coop may already have been there, the remnants of a sub-divided farm acreage. Mac either did not want to raise poultry in the hen house or city bylaws forbade it, or both, so he tried breeding Airedale terriers. When that business failed, he decided to use the barn for his main passion: music. He used every spare penny from his mill job to buy state of the art audio equipment. He dubbed songs from the radio on his reel-to-reel tape recorder. The McGregors cleaned out the coop and installed wooden tables and chairs, a small bar and a closet with a bucket that served as a washroom.

Reports vary on the cleanliness of the venue. Ernie Straiton of the 50s band Hobo Hank and the Sons of the Delta called it a rat hole. Chuck Mackenzie who grew up on Harrison Drive, up the hill from The Coop, recalls that it was freshly whitewashed inside and out. Guitarist Gord Lundy says it had a distinctive fowl odour. Whatever the spaces ambiance, it routinely shook as a weekend dance hall for the McGregors family and friends. The old floorboards bounced during waltzes, polkas and the odd Schottische (a slower, step-hop move that originated in Bohemia and made its way to B.C. via Scandinavia and the prairies). Parties were BYOB, but if a guest ran dry, Mac always had a bootleg bottle.

During IWA labour action, The Coop served as strike headquarters for local mill workers. Macs union brethren could drop in to the barn to get a free sandwich, play cards or get a haircut before heading out on the river in the union boat to patrol for scabs.

Live music was rare at The Coop, but in the late 50s, a Vancouver drummer-promoter named Johnny Zapp Zaplotynsky organized half a dozen jam sessions at the backyard venue.

The get togethers were primarily intended for local country musicians to socialize on Sunday afternoons when they had no gigs. The events were promoted on the radio, so Loretta Lynn may have heard about them that way, or Zapp may have invited her personally for he had met her during his regular visits to Blaines clubs. Either way, she showed up to sing at a couple of the jams.

Grashey and Williams knew about the hoe downs through one of their young discoveries, Sandi Shore Loranger, the McGregors niece. The stage was set for a momentous meeting of country music minds, or, as Mike Harling likes to say, Ground Zero of Lynns career. But more than 50 years later, there is no mention of the iconic singers Fraserview debut on her website. And no mention in her recent book, Honky Tonk Girl: My Life in Lyrics.

Sandi, who was only 15 years old at the time, has a hazy memory of the American singer performing to a packed barn. I was more into pop music than country, more interested in the beautiful dresses that Aunt Irene sewed for my singing career, but I do remember Loretta was well received by the pickers who were there that day.

I interviewed the Grand Ole Oprys grand dame in March, two months before Associated Press ran a story revealing that Lynn was married at age 15, and not 13 as she claimed in Coal Miners Daughter. She reminisced for half an hour about Zero Records in her gentle Kentucky twang and twice broke into song. Loretta recalled The Coop, but not who was present when she appeared there. She remembers Grashey and Williams, but not where she first met them, which seems odd given that they were likely the first music producers to approach her.

I told her that I could not find any evidence to show that Norm Burley had tracked her down after seeing her on TV, nor that he had started the label specifically to record her as she claimed in her first book. I suggested that Grashey and Williams delivered her to him. Lynn said, No, I think that Mr. Burley saw me sing Whispering Sea on the Buck Owens show and then when I went toIm sure this is kind of the way it wentand I went to the Chicken Coop and Don and them were there. Thats where [Don] probably come over and want to know if I want to record.

This is the most detail Lynn has ever provided about Don Grashey to a journalist. She was hazy about many facts, which is understandable given that the events took place more than 50 years ago, but the Queen of Countrys memory was crystal clear when she suddenly asked rhetorically, Don didnt own any of that Zero Records, did he?

He did own some shares, but Norm Burley was the money man, Grashey was merely the music man.

When the Coop was demolished in the early 70s to make room for a row of Vancouver Specials, the McGregors bungalow was inexplicably spared from the wreckers ball. Mac and Irene have since passed, as have most of the storys main players, but the homes current owners are aware of the propertys unique history. A few years back they discovered an electrical wire buried in the backyard, a line that may have carried Macs music from his living room DJ set-up to The Coop.

Today in the home there are no signs of the elaborate custom cabinetry that was said to have held Macs music collection and sound system. No one knows what became of his hobby. Harling hopes that someone has additional details about this story and will contact him through his website honkytonkgirl.ca.

The commemorative plaque being installed across the street from the bungalow is the beginning of a renewed interest in this lost chapter of Vancouvers music history. Local folk band Viper Central recently composed a song about the saga entitled Thump and Howl. And Lynn continues to tour, but no word yet on whether the upcoming Broadway musical adaptation of her life starring Zooey Deschanel will contain a massive song and dance number set in a chicken coop.

The Washington Post reported Jan. 21 that a man in his 30s is in stable condition at Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett, Wash. The man, who is not seriously ill, is said to have arrived last week from the central Chinese city of Wuhan, which is the epicentre of the outbreak.

article continues below

The virus so far has infected close to 300 individuals, mostly in China, and it is said to be contagious as it spreads from person to person.

The Vancouver Airport Authority told Business in Vancouver in an email that the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is directing the response to the crisis because it is the government agency responsible for decisions about health-related screening of passengers at Canada’s airports.

PHAC’s plans for Vancouver International Airport (YVR) include enhanced “messaging on arrivals screens and an additional health screening question to be added to electronic border kiosks,” the Vancouver Airport Authority said in its email. “They have indicated these measures will be implemented in the coming week.”

No one from PHAC immediately responded to a request from BIV to elaborate on planned measures and on whether there could be temperature screening.

Other airports are stepping up precautions.

At Changi Airport in Singapore, all inbound travellers arriving on flights from China will undergo temperature screening starting on Jan. 22 (today in that Southeast Asian island nation), according to that country’s Ministry of Health.

That precaution is necessary, it said, because the number of infected people is on the rise, the risk of the disease spreading is rising and the volume of passengers is expected to spike given upcoming Lunar New Year visiting.

Canada’s chief public health officer Theresa Tam said yesterday that no coronavirus cases have yet been discovered in Canada, although several people have been investigated.

Flights between China and YVR have been surging in recent years. While the airport has significantly more non-stop off-continent flights than does the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA), SEA has been catching up and is increasingly the largest competitor with YVR for new airlines and routes.

Nikolaos Dais, a retired teacher from the all-girls Catholic high school Little Flower Academy, and Ken Clement, who resigned last June for personal reasons as a Vancouver school trustee, were charged with communicating for the purpose of obtaining sexual services for consideration from a person under the age of 18.

article continues below

The offences are alleged to have occurred in June 2018 at or near Vancouver. So far, the Crown has approved charges against Dais, Clement and five other men: Mario Celo Amistad, Jim Malmros, Jun Jie He, Donald Schroeder and Mehran Arefi.

One of the men charged is a firefighter from a department in Metro Vancouver, another is connected to “an outlaw motorcycle gang.” Police declined to say where the firefighter works, or the name of the biker gang.

Diane Little, principal of Little Flower Academy, said she was “absolutely shocked and heartsick and sad” when news broke Wednesday. Little said Dais was a long-time employee, but she wouldn’t disclose how long he taught at the school or when he retired.

On Thursday, Little continued to talk with staff, students and parents about the charge but wanted to keep the nature of the conversations private. Little Flower, which is located in the 4000-block Alexandra Street, has 480 students in grades 8 to 12.

“These are conversations we’re having with our own school community, who is hurting right now, and I’m not prepared to talk about the private conversations we’re having with staff, parents and students,” she said. “We are providing support for any kids that need it, though.”

Little said she had not been contacted by police when she spoke to the Courier Thursday.

“All I can tell you is the school has never been contacted by the VPD, and so all of our information is 100 per cent coming from the media,” she said. “The VPD has not informed us of the investigation, or any charges.”

An online site called Rate My Teachers has several entries for Dais, who is listed as a multiple subjects teacher at Little Flower. The Courier was unable to verify whether comments from students and parents — including those posted today and yesterday after news broke — were credible since the authors were anonymous.

Patti Bacchus, who served with Clement for six years as Vision Vancouver school trustees, said she was devastated and heartbroken about the news that her former colleague was charged in connection with obtaining sexual services from a young person.

“Having been a school trustee, the safety and well-being of children and youth is the most important thing,” said Bacchus, who was clearly upset as she spoke to the Courier by telephone. “So to hear this news about someone who I trusted and I care about is really devastating.”

She described Clement as a good friend and was worried about him, noting she hadn’t heard from him — despite messages left with him over the Christmas holidays — since he resigned last June, citing health issues.

Bacchus said Clement, who is of Ktunaxa First Nation ancestry, told her he was returning to his community last June, possibly near Cranbrook, to participate in a healing program and a sweat lodge. Clement is a residential school survivor.

“There’s absolutely no excuse for what he’s being accused of and I would never, ever want to diminish the harm that that would be causing to young people, if he was actually engaging with them,” she said.

Various online biographies related to Clement’s work as a trustee note that he was a leader in organizations serving Aboriginal people in Metro Vancouver, including offering “executive guidance” to health organizations. He was involved with Aboriginal HIV/AIDS movement since 1998.

Bacchus said Clement, who is gay, wasn’t married.

“He worked so hard to build a life from a very difficult start,” she said.

Board chair Janet Fraser and superintendent Suzanne Hoffman both declined interview requests Wednesday and again on Thursday.

First elected in 1999, Allan Wong is the longest-serving board trustee and was the lone Vision candidate to win a seat in last year’s election.

He worked alongside Clement on the board for seven years, first as a COPE trustee and as a Vision member since 2013.

Wong hasn’t been in contact with Clement since July 2018.

“I had no idea that was coming out,” Wong said. “When it was said that a trustee was involved, I was thinking it was elsewhere in the province.”

Michael Haack, a spokesperson for Vision Vancouver, said in an email that “Vision Vancouver’s priority has always been ensuring that everyone in our communities is safe from abuse and harm.”

He continued: “In that respect, these charges are very troubling. Ken will be proceeding through the criminal justice system and we will monitor this situation very closely as the case unfolds. We appreciate the hard work and dedication of the VPD. We encourage anyone with any information or concerns to reach out to the police.”

The arrest of Clement, Dais and the other men came after Vancouver police ran a two-month operation that targeted people willing to purchase sexual services from young people. Vancouver detectives posted “decoy advertisements” on web escort listings and social media platforms for sexual services.

After prospective clients made contact via text message, they were told the girls were between 15 and 17 years old. Police then operated nine “arrest days” to capture the men who showed up to a hotel, as arranged, to pay for sex.

“I want to make it clear that these projects were not about sexual activity between two consenting adults,” said Vancouver Deputy Chief Laurence Rankin at Wednesday’s news conference at the VPD’s Cambie Street precinct. “Police will continue to focus their attention on those willing to prey on and exploit young boys and girls.”

Media relations officer Sgt. Jason Robillard said Thursday that investigators are still working through the 40 other cases.

“We anticipate that all 40 arrests will be considered for criminal charges at some point and so far seven have already been approved,” he said in an email. “Our investigators are working diligently on these matters and will continue to work closely with our partners at the B.C. prosecutions office.”

The Courier contacted several fire departments in Metro Vancouver to determine which department the firefighter charged in the sting belonged to. Vancouver, Burnaby, Richmond, West Vancouver and the District of North Vancouver all said none of their firefighters were among the charged.

Of the seven men charged, Amistad, Malmros, He and Dais have court dates Jan. 30. Arefi’s next court appearance is Jan. 28 and Schroeder’s is Jan. 31. Clement has a trial date scheduled for Oct. 29 of this year.

The party issued a news release Friday afternoon saying that it had not found a replacement for Ian Campbell, who was Vision’s mayoral candidate until he withdrew Monday from the race.

article continues below

“After considering all the options, and listening carefully to party members and progressive voters, Vision Vancouver has decided we will not field a mayoral candidate,” said Ange Valentini, the party’s executive director and campaign director. “This was a difficult decision because we believe our chances would have been very good, but we believe this decision is the right decision for our city.”

Added Valentini:“Vancouver residents are fortunate to have two other excellent candidates for mayor in Shauna Sylvester and Kennedy Stewart and running another mayoral candidate at this late date creates too much risk that the NPA or one of the other right-wing parties would win and take Vancouver backward.”

Longtime Vision councillor, Andrea Reimer, announced earlier this week that she was reconsidering her decision to retire and possibly replace Campbell as the candidate.

Campbell, a hereditary chief with the Squamish Nation, withdrew from the race after reflecting on the “political landscape and my complicated personal journey.”

Reimer posted a statement Friday to her Facebook page, saying in part that she didn’t want to weaken the so-called progressive vote.

“After very carefully weighing this decision, there is no question that it weighs towards running if taken simply on the merits of what’s best for the progressive policies I’ve championed for the better part of two decades,” she wrote. “At the same time, there are two candidates running who echo substantial parts of some of the policies I’ve championed, and while lacking a party backing makes it harder for them, another candidate won’t help.”

She didn’t name the two candidates, although the values and policies of independents Stewart and Sylvester are in line with many of those promoted by Vision Vancouver, as Valentini alluded to in the party’s news release.

When news broke Monday of Campbell’s departure, Stewart and Sylvester were coy about what the sudden loss of a candidate on the centre-left of the political spectrum would do for their chances to become Vancouver’s next mayor.

Stewart: “It does change the race significantly, but it really doesn’t change what I’ve been doing.”

Sylvester: “I don’t know what it does for my campaign.”

In its history, Vision has only run two people for mayor—the late Jim Green in 2005 (he lost to the NPA’s Sam Sullivan) and Gregor Robertson, who was elected in 2008 and re-elected in 2011 and 2014. Robertson announced in January that he was retiring after this term.

Vision, meanwhile, will run five candidates for the 11-member council. Longtime councillor, Heather Deal, is the party’s only council incumbent. Tim Stevenson and Kerry Jang are also retiring, and Geoff Meggs resigned last year to become Premier John Horgan’s chief of staff.

Stevenson and Jang announced this week they were supporting Stewart for mayor. Stevenson is a former NDP cabinet minister and Jang has been a staunch NDP supporter.

As of Friday, Stewart was still the NDP MP for Burnaby-South, a riding that federal NDP leader Jagmeet Singh hopes to win in either a byelection or the next general election.

Vision will run three candidates for school board and two for park board. In 2008, the party boasted almost 20,000 members. This year, it has about 2,000, according to a party official.

Twenty years ago a monument to Angelo Holmes' grandfather — celebrated Italian-Canadian jurist Angelo Branca — was dedicated with great pride near the SkyTrain line on Clark Drive. Now it sits forgotten and neglected.

article continues below

A small plaque, inscribed Oct. 11, 1986, affixed to a large, but bare pedestal, hints at the origin of a long-abandoned concrete plaza on the west side of Clark Drive at Grandview Highway North.

Little else offers passersby a clue to its significance. Bits of debris and used hypodermic needles litter the surrounding area and nearby bushes, stagnant water sits in a broken-down fountain and the monument's lights no longer function.

Overhead, SkyTrain cars roar by at regular intervals, while rush-hour traffic speeds along Clark — drivers oblivious to the plaza's existence, history and ultimate neglect.

Angelo Holmes darts across the busy six-lane truck route, arriving at the plaza with a frown on his face.

""It looks like it's used by drug users. I haven't been here in years. It's absolutely horrible. I'm just getting upset coming here,"" he says surveying the site, irritated by both its state and a location that's both absurd and difficult to reach.

Holmes, 46, was here 20 years earlier to attend the site's christening in honour of his grandfather, Angelo Branca — a former B.C. Supreme and Appeal Court justice who grew up on the East Side.

It was one of many small parks and plazas created along the B.C. Parkway, roughly following the SkyTrain line, as a beautification project in the mid-'80s when the system debuted during Grace McCarthy's term as B.C. minister of transportation. Others include the German-Canadian Heritage Plaza across from the 29th Avenue SkyTrain station.

The Confratellanza Italo-Canadese (Italian-Canadian Brotherhood), funded this endeavour, which once featured a three-foot-tall Christopher Columbus statue — a gift from the City of Genoa in memory of Branca.

Over the years vandals damaged the site, a plaque explaining its origin was stolen and the statue disappeared mysteriously, only to reappear later just as mysteriously at Hastings Park Italian Garden. Other than the occasional cleaning the plaza has been ignored.

That's until Laara Egan started making calls this spring. The Surrey resident, who lived on the East Side until property prices drove her to the suburbs, isn't Italian but the plaza's history piqued her interest when a friend pointed it out.

Over the past three months, she's talked to TransLink, the Greater Vancouver Regional District, B.C. Rapid Transit, the city and the parks board, as well as to Angelo Holmes, to uncover the details behind the plaza's creation, with hopes another memorial could be created in a more appropriate spot as a permanent tribute to Branca.

""It is heartbreaking that this once beautiful memorial plaza is not even a memory. All that money and energy for nothing,"" she says.

But Branca's grandson and other Branca family members are satisfied the Columbus statue is in the Italian Garden in an area named for Branca. With no sentimental attachment to the Clark Drive plaza site, largely because of its poor location, they also see no point in maintaining the memorial.

""I wouldn't put anything here anymore,"" says Holmes above the constant drone of traffic on this sunny Tuesday afternoon. ""This is true, as far as I'm concerned, they can level it and put grass in here.""

Angelo Branca was considered one of Vancouver's most influential Italian-Canadians of his time. Born near Duncan on Vancouver Island in 1903, the son of a coal miner, he grew up on the East Side, then moved to Dunbar in the 1940s before settling in West Vancouver's British properties in 1965.

He was the youngest prosecutor of his day, a park commissioner and an amateur boxer who won the middleweight championship of B.C. in the 1930s. From 1963 to 1966 he sat as a Supreme Court Justice, before being elevated to the B.C. Court of Appeal, a position he held between 1966 and 1978 when he retired at 75. Branca died in October of 1984 at age 81.

A devout Catholic, he was father to daughters Dolores Holmes — Angelo's mother and a retired provincial judge — and Patricia Battensby, a retired nurse.

Battensby wrote about her father for a 2004 tribute recalling, ""Christmas was legendary. It was always truly a United Nations as Angelo, during wartime, would drive down the street and pick up service men who lived out of town and no Christmas with family to be with. The table proudly boasted Christians, Jews, Muslims and people of various languages. He was never happier than when he presided over his great table at home.""

Admirers weren't limited to his immediate family. Yeshiva University in New York awarded him the ""Reverence of the Law"" honour, California State University bestowed on him the ""Lincoln Reverence of Law"" distinction, while the State of Israel granted him the Prime Minister honour in 1978, awarded by then Prime Minister Menachem Begin because of Branca's close association with the Jewish community.

That relationship was cited in a glowing article about Branca by writer Eve Rockett, which appeared in the Vancouver Sun in 1973. It noted he was co-chairman of the Canadian Council of Christians and Jews, Pacific region, and received its human relations award in 1972.

""This Roman Catholic was the second Canadian ever to receive the Yeshiva University Award, presented by the Jewish Community of Vancouver,"" she wrote. ""Each year an Angelo Branca scholarship fund sends a Canadian student to Yeshiva, the oldest and largest Jewish university in the United States.""

Rockett noted Branca defended 62 accused murderers during his career and lost only two cases: four charges were reduced to manslaughter and the rest of the accused were freed.

""Branca was indeed a performer, but underneath was a dagger-sharp mind with a magnetic affinity for law; a mind kept finely honed by one of the largest privately owned law libraries in Canada,"" Rockett wrote, noting many of his clients were on legal aid.

Branca was also the founder of the Confratellanza Italo-Canadese in 1966, which amalgamated four of the oldest Italian-Canadian societies in the City of Vancouver.

The club, still active today, donates to charities, hospitals, scholarships and medical research. It's one of several associations affiliated with the Italian Cultural Centre.

Holmes served as vice-president of the club when the memorial plaza to his grandfather's considerable legacy was erected. It sits on land owned by the neighbouring C. Martino Auto Centre, although it's on a TransLink right-of-way.

Norm Langerhorst, wayside manager for B.C. Rapid Transit, which operates and maintains SkyTrain, says staff drop by several times a year to clean up the site.

""We do graffiti every week, but when it comes to pavers that need to be replaced or weeds pulled we do that four times a year,"" he says, pointing out the German-Canadian plaza is maintained by that group but B.C. Rapid Transit takes care of all the other parks and plazas along the B.C. Parkway through its maintenance budget.

He agrees the location of the Italian Plaza is unfortunate, although Clark Drive wasn't as busy 20 years ago. Langerhorst isn't aware of any plans by TransLink to do anything with the site.

""There was some plans to extend what they call the greenway. There was going to be a bridge there that goes from the northwest corner of the Clark Street bridge over the Grandview Cut,"" he says. ""It was supposed to connect over to Terminal Street by the Home Depot, but that's been abandoned because of cost. I'm not sure what's going there now.""

TransLink spokesman Ken Hardie says about 20 different mini-parks sprung up in the '80s along the SkyTrain route, sponsored by different ethnic societies. Some, like the German-Canadian site, are well-maintained, while other societies disbanded, he says, and the plazas abandoned.

Aside from the Confratellanza, prominent private donors for the Italian Plaza project included the late ship builder Vito Trevisi, Frank Folino of McRae Electric, which did the electrical work, and Pat Baratta of P. Baratta Construction, which did the excavation. The total cost was $50,000--$25,000 from the Confratellanza, $15,000 from Trevisi and $10,000 from the province.

Holmes confesses he hadn't given the plaza much thought in years until Egan called. The former library technician used her researching skills to track information down, although few seemed clear on its history and some of the information was contradictory. Holmes, she says, proved the best source.

""This [plaza] is just where the homeless sleep. I think it's a shame because of all the energy and money that people put into it to honour Angelo Branca,"" she adds. ""He was great. He stood for the underdog. He fought for people's rights. He was a really outspoken judge and he stood for decency and justice and earned the respect of everybody.

Egan wishes the plaza had been maintained, but concedes another location is preferable. ""I'd love to see something done and people educated about Vancouver history and some of the great people in it.""

Sitting on the plaza's dirty steps, Holmes clearly regrets its location. He says the club was told two decades ago that the area was to become more residential. Instead it became solidly industrial and commercial, with Clark Drive used as a major through-way for trucks on their way to the port and commuters crossing Vancouver.

""How can anybody even come near it. I'm upset because we got conned into this whole thing. It's terrible, it's dangerous. I get upset coming here just thinking how stupid the whole thing was. It was supposed to be developed differently, more pedestrian-friendly. We would never have put this here if we knew it was going to stay the same. The Confratellanza would never have financed it if was going to stay the way it looked 20 years ago and it hasn't changed,"" he says.

""TransLink is supposed to maintain this — that was the deal in perpetuity if we built this and they were supposed to keep the lighting going. I remember that was part of the deal. They haven't kept up with it.""

He says the Confratellanza also didn't maintain it.

Perhaps doomed from the start, the Italian plaza's problems continued over 20 years. Just ask Carmen Martino, owner of the auto centre, which opened in 1989.

""If it was mine, I would have already levelled it. You won't believe what's going on over there night and day — between drugs, prostitution, garbage and the graffiti,"" he says. ""It's not a question of location, it's the way that thing is made — it provides a haven and hideout for people to go in and do whatever business they want to do.""

Martino, who is familiar with Branca's contributions to the city, maintains the site never did justice to the judge's memory, even with the Christopher Columbus statue.

""You wouldn't believe how many times we had to remove garbage from right on top of it,"" he explains. ""We used to leave tires in the back over there. In the morning, you would find two of three of them right on top of the statue — it was just ridiculous. I don't know why they didn't place the statue in the Italian community centre.""

It might have been safer. The plaque explaining its origin was pried off the pedestal in the early 1990s, around the 500th anniversary of Columbus' ""discovery"" of America.

Four remaining bolt holes are the only sign of its existence. Some speculated First Nations people destroyed it to protest the controversial celebration focused on Columbus, although many plaques around the city are also stolen for the value of the brass.

But it wasn't the only thing to go missing. Years later, in the spring of 2000, the Columbus statue was stolen in the dead of night during the period when the Italian Garden at Hastings Park was being designed and spearheaded by parks commissioner Allan De Genova, now a member of the Confratellanza.

Rumour has it that prominent members of the Italian community were involved in the caper, determined to find a better home for the sculpture. De Genova says he doesn't know who took it, but points out the Italian community and Confratellanza were divided over whether it should remain at the Clark Drive site or be moved.

He recalls what happened several months after the theft, before the Italian Garden's official opening.

""A number of [parks] staff were standing at the garden as it was just being finished and this white van pulls up and all of a sudden out comes this statue. They bring it over to a podium and start bolting it down,"" De Genova says. ""Everyone was a little surprised. All of a sudden this mysterious statue showed up. There was a police investigation, I even got called by the police wanting to know how it disappeared. It was quite the thing. All of a sudden it showed up and some guys got out of a van and they started bolting it down and then drove off.""

The Vancouver Police Department couldn't track down old reports about the incident for the Courier. Holmes suspects police simply dropped the matter.

""It was buried. I think it was just, 'Shut up and let it appear.' I think the police left it alone and let the Italian community figure it all out,"" he says. ""They have more pressing issues. Maybe they thought if nobody from the Branca family or the Confratellanza were really pursuing it, what are they going to do. So it all just came out right... The statue is now where it should be and let's just let it rest and leave it there.""

Holmes doesn't know who took Christopher Columbus, nor where it was stored for four months. He says he simply hoped at the time it would end up in the right place. ""It was just not appropriate to take it in the dead of night,"" he says.

The statue, called The Dreamer, now resides in ""Il Giardino,"" the main entrance of which is on Renfrew at Triumph Street. It's located midway down the block between Hastings and McGill streets, through the Angelo Branca Parterre.

Egan doesn't object to Columbus's location, but would like to see more done to recognize one of the city's most highly regarded citizens.

""Off the top of my head, I'd like to see a better place, a better location and some sort of monument to Angelo Branca. I think the family deserves that — his memory deserves that,"" she says. ""I think the Columbus statue has found a nice home in the Italian Garden and it seems to be at peace there. But it's not really related to Angelo Branca really. That was donated by the City of Genoa. It would be nice if there's just something for Angelo Branca.""

Holmes, while appreciating Egan's effort and sentiment, would rather leave well enough alone, satisfied with the statue's new location and certain the Clark Drive plaza site is a lost cause.

For 2020, however, Playland has announced that they will be delaying the seasonal amusement park's opening date by a month, due to COVID-19.

article continues below

Playland says they plan to open in early June.

""We are fully committed to our mission of building social connections and bringing people together in a safe way and therefore, in the best interest of our guests and employees, we are proceeding with a delayed opening. We look forward to welcoming everyone to Playland in June,"" reads the Playland website.

""We thank you for your support and will continue to communicate with you as we navigate through this ever changing time. In the meantime, we urge everyone to exercise the recommended preventative measures to keep your families safe, and we look forward to seeing you at the PNE soon.""

Currently, the City of Vancouver has ordered that there be no gatherings of 50 or more people, and is expecting all people city-wide to adhere to social distancing policies. Recreational facilities have been shut down for nearly two weeks now, and events have been cancelled or postponed – including many that were to take place on the PNE grounds, where Playland is also located.

There is no set date for the COVID-19 groups, events, and social distancing measures, so it is possible Playland might have to push their opening date further. We'll keep you posted.

In the meantime, you'll have to add a few weeks to your anticipated first ride on one of the world's best wooden roller coasters.

Plus, to keep kids busy while at home, Playland's website features a downloadable colouring sheet of last summer's debut ride, the Sea-to-Sky Swinger – the aerial swings featuring B.C.-inspired designs.

A group of volunteers and community members have also formed a Facebook group called ""COVID-19 Coming Together (Vancouver),"" which aims to collect food, supplies, and financial relief for their neighbours before government funding begins in April. As of March 23, the group has over 27,000 members.

article continues below

People and families in need can apply for financial aid (up to $100 per request) through an online form. From there, these applications are vetted by a team of volunteers who prioritize those deemed most vulnerable.

Organizers state that, ""funds will be distributed by eTransfer or in cash through neighbourhood houses, for those without banking access.""

""We have seen firsthand both how resilient this city can be – as well as how many need our help,” says Yolanda Clatworthy, one of the group’s organizers. “Our community cannot wait until April for government relief funding – people need to buy food and pay their bills today.""

The GoFundme campaign description highlights that the COVID-19 pandemic will disproportionately and unevenly impact different populations, such as migrants, racialized people, people with precarious work or insecure housing, poor people, disabled people and elders.

Clatworthy adds that, “Our goal is to fill the immediate gap and get people funds as quickly as possible. We hope that only those with real, urgent needs will apply to receive financial aid, while we are also relying on Vancouver’s generosity to help us meet our target of $100,000.”

“The pandemic is creating an unprecedented threat to many of the most vulnerable – including Indigenous People, people of colour, transgender and nonbinary people, and disabled people,” says Avery Shannon, another of the group’s core organizers.

Modelled on the efforts by the Seattle Mutual Aid Solidarity Network, both the Facebook group and GoFundMe campaign build off the Canadian “caremongering” movement that has gained global attention.

As of Tuesday morning, the GoFundMe campaign has raised just more than $29,000 of its $100,000 goal and has been shared 1,200 times.

With dine-in service at bars and restaurants in B.C. forbidden under orders from public health officials, there have been layoffs and hours cut for workers in the city's food and beverage industry.

Some hospitality industry insiders have come together to create the Vancouver Food and Beverage Community Relief Fund (VFBC Relief Fund), which aims to help those who are in critical need of short-term financial assistance.

article continues below

The fund is currently seeking donations from anyone who is able to offer financial support.

All money raised will be distributed to food and beverage workers impacted by COVID-19, who require urgent financial relief. Those applying will receive access to relief funds ranging from $25 to $150 to use towards basic necessities, such as groceries, covering a bill, going towards rent, and/or filling prescriptions.

The VFBC Relief Fund is being organized by Abdallah El Chami (known as Dallah) of Vancouver food truck Superbaba, along with Tacofino’s head of finance Puneet Kochar and Tacofino’s head of people and engagement Taylor Chobotiuk. Currently, the fund operators are looking to bring more people on board in order to ensure accountability in reviewing applications, its delivery, and operations.

According to WorkBC, the Food Services and Drinking Places industry accounted for 6.5 per cent of British Columbia’s workforce in 2019, which equals 163,282 jobs.



“There are so many incredible people in our industry; so many creative and talented individuals who help shape Metro Vancouver and Vancouver Island’s food and beverage scene,” says Dallah. “And now, so many of them are out of work and face a dire situation. Even with Employment Insurance, a large population is living near or under the poverty line, making it difficult to purchase basic essentials. This is our call for help so that we can help them a little bit to get by right now.”

The word has been spreading on social media that the applause is for doctors, nurses and other first responders and hospital personnel in the midst of this unprecedented health care crisis here in Vancouver — and around the world.

The hashtag #clapfordoctors on Twitter and Instagram shows that this is happening around the world at designated times.

In Vancouver, the new nightly ritual has been happening in the West End, though there have been rallying calls on community Facebook groups for a similar action to happen in communities across the Lower Mainland.

To some, it's a cheer of ""mutual support"" for neighbours in isolation.

515,vancourier,https://www.vancourier.com/community/meals-on-wheels-is-short-of-volunteers-due-to-covid-19-1.24102061,Meals on Wheels is short of volunteers due to COVID-19,['Sandra Thomas'],,"An organization dedicated to delivering meals to seniors, persons living with chronic or acute medical illnesses, or individuals recovering from surgery, illness or injury needs is in dire need of volunteers in this time of the COVID-19 state of emergency.

Inge Schamborzki, executive director of the Health and Home Care Society of B.C. (Care B.C.), told the Courier today that Meals on Wheels delivers 500 meals a day, half Western-style and the other half Asian.

article continues below

“We have less than 400 volunteers who make up our dedicated, outstanding team,” said Schamborzki. She added the vast majority of volunteers are retired, while there are some who work shift work and are only able to dedicate a limited number of hours during the week.

Schamborzki said many of those volunteers are concerned about COVID-19, despite the fact there is no contact between them and the clients.

“We have a 92-year-old woman from Richmond and a man in his seventies who have both been volunteering for 50 years [each],” said Schamborzki. “But we understand when volunteers are calling in and they feel terrible, but saying ‘I’m worried my myself, my husband, my wife.’”

Schamborzki said because there is no contact with the clients there is no need for masks or gloves, particularly since there’s a shortage at hospitals, though hand washing and sanitizing is constant.

“We expect our volunteers to be healthy,” said Schamborzki. “And we practise social distancing of at least an arm’s length.”

Schamborzki said when a volunteer delivers a meal, they conduct informal safety checks by knocking until the client answers. If they don’t answer the door, the volunteer will try phoning them and their care agencies. If that doesn’t resolve the issue, they then call 911.

Schamborzki noted 60 per cent of their clients live alone, 15 per cent are over 90 and 50 per cent are 80 or older.

“It’s a lot more than dropping off meals,” said Schamborzki. “We’re serving very frail, isolated people who live in the community. That contact is often the only contact they have in a day.”

The Health and Home Care Society of B.C. has been operating Meals on Wheels in Vancouver and Richmond since 1967. In 1996, Meals on Wheels added a service using Chinese-language volunteers.

Through both programs, meals are delivered weekdays between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m.

But, Schamborzki said, volunteers are desperately needed now to keep the program rolling. Schamborzki added she and other administration staff members have been helping to deliver the meals.

Due to a shortage of Chinese-speaking volunteers, Schamborzki attempted to drop off a meal to a Chinese client who refused to open the door. Schamborzki left and continued dropping off other meals until a Chinese-speaking staff member was able to reach the man and explain all was well.

“When I went back, he opened the door, said Schamborzki. “And sometimes clients are slow to answer the door because they have hearing problems or mobility issues. That’s why it can take up to two hours to finish a route.”

That also adds concerns that some volunteers could begin to burn out and that’s something Care B.C. wants to avoid.

“But, right now we sometimes have to ask, ‘Can you do one more shift?’” said Schamborzki. “We need 60 a day.”

Volunteers are needed to not only drive, but also to deliver meals. Schamborzki says parking is such an issue, especially in Vancouver, that the driver often circles the block while the server delivers the meal – so, a driver’s licence isn’t necessary.

But, Schamborzki added, a criminal records check is needed though at this point the organization is so short of volunteers it’s accepting them during their waiting period.

“But they’re paired with a known volunteer so it’s working,” said Schamborzki.

Mamas for Mamas’ Vancouver chapter is in urgent need of donations, including money and gift cards, fresh food, diapers, pull ups and formula.

article continues below

“We’re finding a lot of families — whether they were in the category of families we helped before, income-wise, or not — are now starting to look for help, because they’re going to the store and even if they have a little bit of money, the things that they can usually buy with that money that would usually be [at the store], are actually no longer there,” explained Anna Carr, Mamas for Mamas’ Vancouver chapter resource coordinator, in between food donation deliveries to moms in need.

“[These families] are finding they can't afford what's left.”

While Carr acknowledges the need for social distancing will probably prevent Mamas for Mamas from being able to deliver donations in the near future, she said the organization is hoping for donations in the form of e-gift cards.



“It’s the easiest thing to get out to families when they need it,” she said. (E-gift card donations can be emailed to anna@mamasformamas.ca)

“I think a lot of people are looking for ways to help,” Carr continued.

The grassroots organization began in Kelowna five years ago, aiming to connect moms and remove barriers to poverty relief through “digital sharing economies” like Facebook groups, where moms can ask for what they need or donate items they no longer use. Mamas for Mamas operates by the ethos that “kindness is our currency,” Carr explained.

The Vancouver chapter currently has five drop-off locations available for those with items to donate, in Langley, Richmond, Surrey, South Delta and North Delta. (Contact Mamas for Mamas Vancouver on Instagram or Facebook for the drop-off addresses).

“Let’s help each other through this,” Carr urged. “We can still support each other even though we’re social distancing.”

At 7 p.m. tonight, March 20, everyone is encouraged to step outside of their homes and make some noise as a very public and loud display of appreciation to our hard-working health-care professionals and essential workers keeping the city running in these uncertain times.

The Vancouver West Enders community group is inviting the entire city to join them from their balconies and windows to show their gratitude for the healthcare workers on the front lines of fighting COVID-19, as well as all the essential workers who are putting themselves at risk so Vancouverites can have access to food, transportation and other vital services.

So, honk your horn, bang a pot, sing a song, applaud or yell tonight and every night at 7 p.m. to show you care. It’s an easy gesture and, since most people are all home self-isolating or in quarantine, it doesn’t take a lot of effort and the kids will love it.

Make sure to spread the word to friends and family and make some noise at 7 p.m.

Share photos and videos on social media using the hashtags #TogetherWeCanDoIt and #Cheer4HealthWorkers.

Megaphone is a monthly, street-press magazine that focuses on issues pertaining to poverty and homelessness and is created by professional editors, journalists and designers, and also receives contributions from low-income or homeless populations.

article continues below

Issues of the magazine are sold to vendors for 75 cents, who can then sell it on the streets for two dollars and retain the profits. Sales of the magazine usually provide meaningful employment and a regular source of income for people experiencing poverty in Vancouver and Victoria, but due to the spread of the coronavirus, most of the vendors have had to stop selling.

Executive director of Megaphone, Julia Aoki, says of the 150 current vendors, that there are “very few right now” still selling the magazine on the streets. “We haven’t been advising anyone to stop selling completely — they are sole proprietors — but we are advising customers and vendors alike to practise social distancing, proper hygienic protocol, and to perhaps use the app to make a purchase whenever possible.”

“Our vendors are people experiencing poverty and homelessness, and often other forms of intersecting marginalization,” Aoki added. “Our vendors are not only vulnerable to income insecurity, but also to COVID-19 as many have compromised immune systems due to other illnesses, not to mention substandard housing and limited access to healthy food and personal hygiene supplies. While COVID-19 makes vending less possible, it also makes the financial support more crucial.”

Readers can now purchase and download a digital copy of the magazine either from the Megaphone app, or the magazine’s website. At the point of purchase, customers can choose to pay the cover price of $2 or, if they choose, they can also leave a tip.

“The proceeds of that sale will go either fairly, to all active vendors, or if people out there have a particular vendor that they like to purchase from, that they like to support, they can direct the sale to that individual,” said Aoki.

In addition, there is an option on the website to make a tax-free donation.

“We’re asking the public to consider donating to the organization as well, because if we can remain operationally strong, even if it’s not with the magazine and street sales, we can continue to find ways to enlist the vendors in other forms of work, and then pay them fairly.”

In the last two days, online sales of Megaphone have already surpassed $800.

“The reaction that I’ve seen so far, with the soft launch [of the online version of Megaphone] has been a positive one,” said Aoki. “I do think that there is a lot of interest and willingness to think in a community-minded way right now, and I’d just like to encourage everybody to continue doing that.”

“There are people with needs and those needs won’t go away with this pandemic. They’ll just increase,” she added.

Five Vancouverites began talking about how they could support their communities and offer mutual aid throughout the pandemic.

article continues below

It led to a conference call, which turned into a seven-hour discussion and meticulous planning for what’s evolved into a public Facebook page called “COVID-19 Coming Together (Vancouver).”

In less than a week, the page’s membership has soared to more than 21,000, which took Avery Shannon, one of the founders of the group, by surprise.

“We knew that there was an urgent need in the community, and knew that we would probably get multiple thousands [of members], but we didn't anticipate getting such a quick uptake in the group membership,” Shannon said.

The space is designed to allow members to share relevant information and post direct requests for help, whether it’s for material items, which they can’t get themselves because they’re self-isolated or have disabilities, or for out-of-stock goods they need. Others are offering services or assistance.

“COVID-19 is really creating unprecedented interruption to our day-to-day lives and poses a threat to many of our community members, especially those who are more vulnerable — those who are facing multiple barriers in society, such as homelessness, such as poverty, such as being disabled, and for senior citizens,” explained Shannon, who lives in East Vancouver.

“We really wanted to find a way to connect people and let them access resources and community and mutual aid.”

More than 30 people now work behind the scenes managing the page, as well as organizing spinoff initiatives such as political work like lobbying the federal government to provide more aid. Another team is working on outreach, connecting to organizations such as Vancouver Area Network of Drug Users, the Vancouver Tenants Union and the Single-Room Occupancy Collective to ensure their members are getting the assistance they need.

Strict guidelines outline what can be posted so the page isn’t filled with spam, misinformation about coronavirus, or flooded with unrelated messages.

While the effort to launch the group has been significant, those involved don’t mind.

“When we were formulating this group, and planning out what it could look like, I think we all felt very relieved to be able to channel our energy and our efforts into something because the city is really shutting down in a way that we've never experienced before,” Shannon said. “We knew that other people were probably feeling very similarly and we wanted to provide a platform for community to come together.”

Although it’s a Vancouver group, some members live as far away as Abbotsford. Residents from other municipalities have also been inspired to start sister groups.

“It's not just acts of kindness that people are providing. It's a real demonstration of social solidarity and people recognizing that now is the time to radically band together,” Shannon said.

The Facebook page can be found HERE.

Organizers also launched a gofundme campaign MArch 19 to help people meet immediate needs before the government's emergency care benefit package kicks in in April. It can be found HERE. In the first half hour it raised more than $11,000, with an initial goal of collecting $100,000.

""This will go a long way towards helping those most vulnerable in our community,"" Shannon said.

“I wanted to do something creative that day (March 23) to fill the void that the (Gateway) show would have. So, I decided to do it to honour the fact that I was supposed to start rehearsal that day,” explained Jason Sakaki, a Steveston resident and McMath secondary grad.

article continues below

Gateway Theatre’s production, From Alaska, was cancelled earlier this month due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Sakaki added, “(I didn’t) think it would pick up so much traction with many people being super invested in the show,” which was staged in every room in his house to give the impression of set changes.

Jason Sakaki took to Instagram for a one-man live stream of Les Miserables. Photo: Video screenshot

Sakaki’s choice of Les Miserables was no coincidence.

Les Miserables is a story about people going through a difficult time, similar to what Richmond and the world is going through today, he explained.

“We’re in this time of ‘what’s happening next’ and no one really knows. Even though the musical takes place in the 1800s, it’s completely relevant to what we’re experiencing right now,” Sakaki added.

Like many residents, the pandemic is affecting Sakaki as a performing artist financially, but the fear of the community turning away from theatre frightens him even more.

“It’s a little bit unsettling for actors because we don’t know when it’s going to end. Since we will not be able to get back to work until it’s fully over. That’s the scary thing right now I think,” said Sakaki.

“What we’re a little scared about is when we come back, are people going to come back to theatres and so … we want to keep them interested in what we’re doing.”

Sakaki will be hosting another one-man production of Beauty and the Beast on April 3 at 7 p.m. on Instagram @jasonsakaki.

With social isolation becoming the new normal and choirs everywhere forced to stop meeting in person, Chor Leoni is launching a new weekly show starting Wednesday, April 1 at 7 p.m.

article continues below

The Vancouver-area men’s choir will share the livestream on Facebook, YouTube and Instagram.

The Inside Chor Leoni Livestream will be hosted by artistic director Erick Lichte, from his home, and will include high-quality concert videos from the past seven years of filming at the choir’s shows.

The choir will also be creating new video content from its albums, pairing its music with artwork from local artists in an effort to reach out and help all artists as much as it can at a time that’s challenging the entire arts and cultural sector.

The livestream will also include a weekly guest – a locally or internationally recognized music luminary, with an interview and video.

Viewers will also be able to interact within the live comments section.

Lichte underscored the importance of choral music, especially at this time of global uncertainty.

“I believe that choral music has a unique healing quality,” he said in a press release. “It can offer serenity, beauty and can connect with people in ways I don’t even understand. We want to pair this music power with the fun wrapping of a show in a way that is very Chor Leoni.

“Choral music is, for me, the ultimate way in which people can come together. This show won’t replace the community we share as a choir and with our audience, but hopefully it will move us from our current reality to the day we can again bring our voices together and they can be heard.”

For the April 1 livestream, the guest is conductor Ethan Sperry, talking about Translations, his new recording of the works of Latvian composer Eriks Esenvalds on the Naxos label.

The show will also premiere the first video for the album’s recording of Esenvalds’ In Paradisum, paired in video with paintings by renowned Vancouver artist Tiko Kerr.

Provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix announced July 15 that there were 21 new cases in the past 24 hours, including two cases that they call ""epi-linked,"" or presumed cases that have not been proven through testing but are being treated as official cases.

article continues below

The province has now recorded 3,149 cases since the novel coronavirus first appeared in B.C. in late January.

More than 87.4% of those infected, or 2,753 people, have recovered. Of those who haven't, 189 people have died and 207 people are actively fighting the virus. Only 14 people are hospitalized, with five of those in intensive care units. The rest are self-isolating at home. There were no new deaths recorded in the past 24 hours.

Recording at least 20 new COVID-19 cases in a 24-hour period has become common in B.C., and Henry said yesterday that she found that number ""distressing,"" even though, she added, the good news is that the province knows where the clusters of infection are, many of the infections are linked and the number is not really that large given the province's population of more than five million residents.

The numbers in the past week were:

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12;

• 21 new cases on July 13;

• 13 new cases on July 14; and now

• 21 new cases on July 15.

In June, the number of daily new cases many times was in the single digits.

""There is one active community outbreak, in addition to several community exposure events,"" Henry and Dix said. ""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks.""

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,023 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,659 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 216 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

Find the stories that make that community unique and interesting among the city’s more than two dozen formally identified neigbhbourhoods.

The question became a challenge, and the challenge became the Vancouver Special neighbourhood series, which is wrapping up after 14 months.

article continues below

To the best of my knowledge, no news organization has done a project of the scope and breadth of Vancouver Special, and I can see why. It was a lot of work.

It was also worth it. We confirmed the notion that Vancouverites like to read stories about their own neighbourhoods. We discovered they also like to read stories about the city's other neighbourhoods, whether east side, west side, north or south. As with many of our readers, none of us knew what we would find when we started our journey. I wasn't expecting rabbit agility enthusiasts in Dunbar. Or an activist turned knitter and mom in Hastings-Sunrise. A Musqueam hip hop artist and mother who raps in the Musqueam dialect. An Arbutus Ridge barber who plays the accordion in his shop between clients. A Downtown Eastside drug addict whose life was saved by his dog.

In a city beset with well-documented problems, from social isolation to unaffordable housing, we found that many Vancouverites work hard to make a difference. Setting up coffee spots in traffic circles in Mount Pleasant. Leading bell ringers in Shaughnessy. Helping troubled kids find focus in Renfrew-Collingwood through paddling and making lonely newcomers in Victoria-Fraserview feel at home. Organizing community dinners in Marpole. Young foodies starting innovative fusion restaurants in Chinatown and longtime hash slingers maintaining British tradition in Point Grey.

What did we learn the most? That Vancouver is indeed special. But then, we knew that going in.

As part of our wrap-up, we asked our staff writers for their favourite stories from the past 14 months. Links to those stories can be found below. We also asked photography editor Dan Toulgoet for his favourite photos from the series.

Vancouver activist knits past with family life

Mike Howell: “As a reporter for more than 20 years, I’ve written many stories about many people. Often, I don’t get a chance to track them down years later and find out whatever happened to them. I did this with Anna Hunter and I thought my story gave readers a different perspective of the one-time Anti-Poverty Committee member, who is now a mom running a small business in Hastings-Sunrise.""

Master Chef serves up cheap food with side of Chinese poetry

Cheryl Rossi: “Entering Master Chef Cafe is a refreshing step back in time in a city where developers have bulldozed too many beloved haunts and replaced them with tall, characterless concrete and glass structures. Even more charming than the cafe’s decades-old décor and disorganized paraphernalia are Master Chef’s co-owners, octogenarian couple May and Tony Fung, who run their humble business with pride, providing a meeting spot for Hastings-Sunrise residents of various ethnic backgrounds and means. In this increasingly unaffordable city it’s easy to focus on who’s doing better than whom. It was a treat to meet Tony, who’s so pleased with what he has.""

Flamenco bar serves up funny business

Andrew Fleming: “My favourite Vancouver Special story to write was about the weekly comedy night at Kino Café. Not only did it give me chance to shake the hand of the man who shot the evil Cancer Man from The X-Files but it also provided an excuse to check out the local live comedy scene and shoot a video of their sixth anniversary party that’s available on our website. Komedy at Kino is also unique in the sense the performers are an interesting mix of established veterans and inexperienced rookies, not unlike the current roster of the Vancouver Canucks.”

Building confidence one paddle at a time

Jennifer Thuncher: “The story “Building confidence one paddle at a time” impacted me on a personal level more than most. I attended one of the group’s meetings and sat as they shared a meal. The whole vibe of the night was relaxed and family-oriented. Children raced around and members chatted easily. The youth interviewed were thoughtful in their answers and their candour was touching. I think of them often and wonder how they are doing and where they are rowing next. It also helps that it is a story based on beautiful canoes and the outdoors. What is not to love?”

Cohousing coming to the neighbourhood

Naoibh O’Connor: “My favourite story that I covered during the Vancouver Special neighbourhood series was about the cohousing complex that’s going to be built at East 33rd Avenue near Argyle Street. It attracted my attention because many people, including me, wonder what it will be like to live in a development that demands such cooperation and interaction among its inhabitants. It will be fascinating to follow the story through the years and see if their optimism about living under these conditions is matched by reality.”

Don’t drop the gloves: 20 rules for ball hockey

Megan Stewart: “There’s a hand-painted sign on Ontario Street that reads: “Slow. Children At Play.” You’ll pass this sign headed south from 12th Avenue on your way to an adult ball hockey game at Mount Pleasant Park.

For 18 years the ball has dropped at the centre of a fenced-in concrete court where hundreds of different players — mostly men — have come to play hockey. Covering this regular Sunday event was one of my favourite stories of our Vancouver Special series because the players had outrageous stories and because they’d returned to the neighbourhood even as their lives brought different jobs, the birth of children, and new homes in the suburbs. As is the case most weeks, as long as the puddles aren’t too big, the next game is 1 p.m. Sunday at 15th Avenue near Manitoba.”

Chico and the man whose life he saved

Sandra Thomas: “The Downtown Eastside is a neighbourhood that almost wasn’t covered by the Courier due to a debate about whether it’s an official standalone community or made up from parts of other areas we had already covered. Regardless, it turned out to be my favourite neighbourhood of the entire series so it should be of no surprise my pick for best-of is a story about a little dog that helps his owner stay clean and deal with depression.

“Chico and the man who saved him” is about the unlikely friendship between resident Rob Dumas, who lives in a low-income apartment building in the Downtown Eastside, and a little shih tzu with a big attitude. Walking down East Hastings Street with Chico and Dumas on a sunny afternoon, it was quickly apparent the little dog also brightens the lives of many of the residents and regulars to the neighbourhood.""",[]

neighbourhoods.

The Marpole Midden, a recognized ancestral Musqueam village dating back 4,000 years, is located near the north end of Arthur Laing Bridge. It became a Canadian heritage site in the 1930s.

article continues below

Known as Eburne Station in the 1860s, Marpole was renamed after Richard Marpole in 1916. The community joined Vancouver in 1929.

More than 23,800 people live in the area, which acts as a gateway into Vancouver for visitors flying in through the international airport in Richmond.

Major roads cutting through the neighbourhood include Granville, Cambie and Oak streets, West 70th and Southwest Marine Drive.

It’s home to 11 parks, although some need upgrading and improvement and there’s a lack of greenspace in the apartment area south of 70th Avenue.

Only 25 per cent of Marpole’s waterfront is publicly accessible.

It’s one of the few West Side neighbourhoods that’s considered relatively affordable in terms of rents and condo prices, but single-family homes are still priced into the millions — even teardowns.

Its population turned feisty when the City of Vancouver released details of the draft Marpole Community Plan last year.

The plan will guide growth and change in the neighbourhood over the next 30 years.

Residents fought the city over a thin-street proposal, which it quickly abandoned, as well as proposed rezoning of some single-family areas to allow stacked townhouses and low-rise apartment buildings.

The city backed down and a revised plan focuses growth along or near major streets where transit stops and services are available.

Council votes on the plan this spring, but “Stop Marpole Rezoning” signs still dot the neighbourhood.

Growth and change, which promises to attract a younger, hipper demographic, is nonetheless well underway in locations such as the new Safeway development at 70th and Granville, which is partially completed, and at Cambie and Marine Drive where construction has started on the massive Marine Gateway development known as MC².",[]

They include carrots, yellow potatoes, broccoli, onions, tins of coconut milk, limes, fresh ginger, cans of diced and stewed tomatoes, herbs, spices and bags of raisins and almonds.

Chef April Pringle sorts through the provisions and adds chicken marinated overnight in yogurt and masala.

It’s 4 p.m. on a Thursday afternoon in Marpole and preparations for the weekly three-course community meal begin. Tonight’s menu: Indian spiced-tomato soup, Tandoori chicken, curried potatoes and mixed vegetables, followed by rice pudding sprinkled with almonds for dessert.

Marpole Place Neighbourhood House runs the dinner, although due to a major flood last December, it’s been moved to the Anglican church on Hudson Street from the organization’s base at 1305 West 79th. Repairs won’t be complete for four to six months.

With just over two hours before service starts, Pringle puts chief volunteer Doug Cruthers to work. Tasked with prepping vegetables, Cruthers silently and single-mindedly peels five pounds of carrots.

“Doug is Mr. faithful. If the other volunteers don’t show up, I can always count on him,” Pringle says.

A perpetually cheerful Allan Minichiello watches from the pass-through while making coffee and tea. “She’s the best,” he says of Pringle — a compliment he applies to almost everyone he meets, including a writer from the Courier. Several other volunteers set up and lay the tables.

Although the dinner, designed to create social connections, started out years ago as a potluck for seniors, it now attracts a more diverse crowd of between 30 to 40 people. Many seniors still pop in for the made-from-scratch meals and the company, but the event also draws young families, those with mental health concerns, those with intellectual disabilities, as well as the homeless or those at risk of homelessness.

“Everybody knows food brings people together in many significant ways,” Cindy McMillan, executive director of Marpole Place Neighbourhood House, told the Courier.

The grocery bill is about $150 and the aim is to break even — diners pay $6 per person, volunteers eat for free and vouchers are given to those in need. Leftovers are sold at a discounted price.

Guests come for a variety of reasons, according to Pringle.

“It’s good food, good company, good price. [People] definitely come for the company. It’s a real community,” she explains. “For me it’s a job, but it’s a community for me too and it’s a job that I look forward coming to.”

ringle’s recent multicultural menus have ranged from Chinese roast pork, rice and veggie stir-fry to Moroccan stew with rice and vegetables.

On this occasion, Pringle wonders if the South Asian fare will scare off regulars — a fear that isn’t realized — but there’s not much time to worry as she and Cruthers work to meet their dinner-time deadline.

Spicy aromas build. Milk and basmati rice simmer on the stove, while Pringle sautés carrots, onions and garlic for the soup base.

Michael, a 22-year-old volunteer originally from Vietnam, arrives at 4:30 p.m. to help. He places chicken on baking pans before sliding them into the oven. Under Pringle’s guidance, he hand-juices limes and chops cilantro for the soup, pausing briefly to teach Pringle the Vietnamese word for herb. She struggles with the pronunciation before abandoning the effort with a laugh.

Bags of donated bread arrive and three pre-teens from David Lloyd George elementary — volunteer servers for the dinner — slice it before guests begin to trickle in. Diners claim their usual tables, saving seats for friends before grabbing cups of coffee or tea.

Amelia and Edwin Mui are among them. The couple, originally from Hong Kong, lived in Toronto before moving to a single-family home in Marpole 22 years ago.

They saw the community meal advertised for years before finally stopping in. Now they rarely miss a week.

“It’s quite interesting. You see neighbourhood people. It’s good to know our neighbours, right?” Amelia says. “I’m a fan of April. She’s a professional chef, first of all, and she really cooks from her heart and with consideration of our health. I like the community feeling and I like the chef. We can talk to people and make acquaintances. It’s very diversified [company]. That’s the one thing I like.”

Edwin adds: “Most of the next table are regulars. We know most of them by name. [The meal is] good especially for senior people — they get some social life.”

Like at a typical family dinner, a few grumble about minor details — the temperature of the soup or the number of raisins in the rice pudding, but almost all scrape their plates clean.

The results of more than two hours of preparation are devoured in less than half that time. Most leave by 8 p.m., save for seniors playing Rummoli — a post-dinner tradition.

Volunteers clear tables and do dishes. Pringle is satisfied. “We had a nice turnout. We had one extra piece of chicken. We fed all the volunteers, so that’s always good, and I had lots of compliments. So, yeah, it went really well tonight,” she says.

Virtually.

article continues below

Thursday, the BCHL launched a simulation — created in the EA Sports video game NHL2020 — of the rest of the league’s playoff series that were cancelled March 13, just as the second round of the post-season was set to begin.

A player representative from each of the eight teams remaining in the playoff tourney is handling the game controls in a head-to-head match-up against their second-round opponent, with a two-minute highlight reel — complete with commentary by the teams’ broadcasters — posted to the league website.

“We were looking for a way to keep fans engaged during this unfortunate downtime,” BCHL commissioner Chris Hebb said in a press release. “We’ve tried to make it a fun and unique BCHL experience for everyone to enjoy.”

The initiative sprang from a project by the former director of communications for the Express, Jacob Lazare. Bored and restless after the team dispatched the Langley Rivermen from the playoffs’ first round in four straight games and were awaiting the start of the second round, he put together a simulation of a series between Coquitlam and the Surrey Eagles, who took seven games to defeat the Chilliwack Chiefs.

Lazare said he was able to use the video game’s various customization features to recreate the rosters of the two rivals, ranking each player’s attributes and tendencies, like their skating ability, speed, puck-handling skills and physicality, on a scale from zero to 99.

“You can go through and create a player that mimics the actual players realistically,” Lazare told The Tri-City News, adding he can set a dazzling skater like Massimo Rizzo to weave around defenders and a skilled stickman like defender Drew Cooper to repel onrushing forwards one-on-one.

While his own knowledge of the Express gleaned from running the team’s video camera during games helped him build Coquitlam’s digital doppelgänger, Lazare reached out to contacts at the Eagles to inform his recreations of Surrey’s players.

The effort was an amusing distraction that got some attention on social media.

But when the actual series, and the rest of the season, was scrubbed because of the pandemic, the league reached out to spin his effort into a virtual march to the Fred Page Cup championship.

Lazare said it takes him a couple of hours to handicap all the players for each team, and additional time to create facsimiles of the uniforms and match headshots with the game’s graphics.

“It’s just to make it so fans can recognize their teams’ players,” he said of the laborious attention to detail.

Lazare lamented, however, that limitations in the game don’t allow him to recreate the cozy confines of BCHL arenas, so the virtual players are battling in front of likely the biggest crowds they’ve ever experienced, even if they’re comprised entirely of pixels.

Lazare said having actual players contest the rest of the playoffs, albeit with the help of the game’s artificial intelligence, adds an extra wrinkle of unpredictability, which is part of the fun.

“Somebody is able to win it for their team,” he said. “There can be upsets involved.”

The first series, contested between Express goalie Joe Howe and Hassan Akl of the Surrey Eagles, is already decided, with the three remaining series to be posted in the coming days. The third round of the playoff simulation commences next week.",[]

Tuesday, Batchelor put out the call to fans and his followers for random videos to which he would apply his vocal talents.

“I'm bored,” he said, adding he’ll do three such play-by-play calls a day.

HIs first three calls were a golfer at the driving range, a cat losing its mind in a cardboard box and a couple of pillow fighters blinded by hoods pulled over their faces.

“Keep ’em coming,” Batchelor said afterward.

Batchelor has been the Canucks’ play-by-play man since 2017 after several years calling Vancouver Giants games.

The Dr. Charles Best secondary school grad said he honed his commentary chops calling goals and assists while playing road hockey in the driveway of his parents’ home on Harbour Drive, playing table hockey in the basement and video games.

“I was huge into hockey,” Batchelor told The Tri-City News.

To fulfill his dream of announcing the sport, Batchelor studied broadcasting at BCIT and volunteered doing public address announcements for the Burnaby Express of the BC Hockey League (BCHL), then followed the team when it returned to Coquitlam.

In 2012, Batchelor became the broadcaster for the BCHL’s Surrey Eagles, then graduated to the Giants and the Western Hockey League the next year.

His Twitter project follows the lead of another social media effort by Port Moody’s Al Murdoch, the Canucks’ public address announcer. He has been taking requests to call goals and assists for the team’s fans and minor hockey players, posting one a day for his followers.

Murdoch said he launched the initiative because he missed doing the announcements at Rogers Arena, especially as the Canucks were in the thick of the playoff race before the season was abruptly suspended March 12.

He said he also wanted to help lift spirits at a time when everyone is anxious about the pandemic and its mounting economic and societal consequences.

His idea has since been picked up by other announcers, including Mike Ross of the Toronto Maple Leafs and the New Jersey Devils' goal and assist caller, Kevin Clark.

Lisa Sun, a Vancouver-based luxury realtor, says that there are huge differences in real estate philosophy between Canada and China. Sun grew up in Beijing and subsequently moved to Canada, where she had the opportunity to see these surprising differences head on. Sun says that her background enables her to give her clients the best of both worlds.

""In China, the customer comes first, and a relationship is developed,"" Sun says. ""Whereas in Canada, the marketing is prioritized and done so skillfully.""

""I specialize in marketing luxury homes. Luxury marketing is not a set strategy, it is a unique strategy tailored to each client’s needs,”explains Sun, saying that she doesn't just sell a house, she sells the idea of the type of lifestyle a person could have in a certain home.

Sun and her team invite property viewers to fully immerse themselves in homes through the means of 16-page magazine quality brochures, video tours, and professional photo galleries. They also offer 3D Matterport services – ""which is almost like a google maps tour of the inside of a house,"" she says. ""You can walk into the home virtually, go through each room, look at the art on the walls.""

Sun is passionate about expanding her services to clients outside of West Vancouver, saying, ""Luxury marketing is the West Van standard, but I haven't seen it much outside of that area… I want to change that. “

On top of her Western marketing strategies, Sun is very passionate about making sure she approaches customer service the Chinese way – one-stop shop full-service approach.

""Lots of my non-Chinese realtor friends, they sell a house and don't see those clients again. I hold my clients' hands every step of the way. I expect to build and maintain a relationship with them,"" Sun says. ""Five years down the road after the sale, it's completely normal for me to help a client pick out new furniture for their home, arrange for home maintenance appointments or help register their children for private school. I am hands-on.""

On top of lifelong customer service, Sun speaks Mandarin, and is very experienced in helping Chinese immigrants understand the Canadian real estate market. She also makes sure all of her listings are advertised on JuWai, one of the biggest Chinese real estate platforms, which gets over 300 million page views a month.

""I just really like people,"" Sun says, ""and real estate is about building trust and relationships. My job is to connect with buyers and sellers and truly understanding what they need to help find them their dream home.”

The public is keen to get moving, but that enthusiasm can often land them in the physiotherapist clinic and other health professional’s offices when their winter-couch physiques aren’t quite ready for springing into action.

article continues below

Kim Vopni answers to the moniker of “the Vagina Coach,” and is on a mission to increase awareness about common pelvic floor challenges and how fitness professionals can help.

“Spring is a fresh start, but make sure your client’s foundation, namely the pelvic floor is in check first,” she advises.

Since 2013, Vopni has helped fitness and movement professionals get certified in her Core Confidence Specialist certification. She believes it’s crucial for trainers, physiotherapists, and other movement pros to embrace pelvic floor health.

“The pelvic floor is talked about more frequently and women are seeking trainers who are in the know,” Vopni says.

Vopni believes fitness pros benefit from her course because they become better informed and in turn can better help their clients. It’s an investment worth making, since being certified and having the specialized know-how means charging more for services. Clients are willing to pay for that added value.

Women have long suffered in silence on matters like incontinence and organ prolapse, but they’re increasingly aware that these issues can be improved and sometimes resolved through exercise, breath work, posture and lifestyle modifications.

Fitness professionals can play a role in increasing awareness by being trained to screen their clients, understanding what certain movement patterns can suggest and what exercises can help their clients improve or eliminate their symptoms.

“If you train women, this is knowledge you really need to have,” Vopni says, since these conditions often prevent women from being as active as they should be.

This is information that applies to women at any stage from pregnancy to menopause. Pregnancy and birth are known contributors to issues like incontinence, organ prolapse, and diastasis recti, and since roughly 80 percent of women are likely to give birth at some point in their life, it is essential to understand these phases of life.

If you’re used to clients wanting “core-strengthening,” exercises then learning and understanding the female pelvic floor should come first. The pelvic floor is the foundation of the core after all.

Vopni offers two courses for professionals, “The Core Confidence Specialist” and “Pre/Post-Natal Fitness Specialist,” each of which comes with certification. Both courses are available in person or online, and come with 16 to 20 hours of training recognized by both canfitpro and BCRPA for annual continuing education credits.

For those who’d like to learn more about training their clients in pelvic floor health, Vopni has a discount on her online course for those registering before March 31st with the code “ccert15”, or visit www.vaginacoach.com .",[]

After spending some time working at a hockey store, and then at a supermarket, Farano decided it was time he looked for his dream job. He attended Douglas College to complete the Consumer and Employment Program, a program that was specifically designed to help people with barriers to employment. Farano has autism, but if you ask him, he would not consider his intellectual disability a barrier to employment.

“The biggest challenge I had was finding a job that suits me and that suits my skills,” he said. It was not until Farano teamed up with Liane Lowden, an employment specialist at posAbilities Employment Service,that he finally found his calling.

PosAbilties is an agency that assists people with developmental disabilities to lead meaningful and healthy lives, including securing and maintaining competitive employment. Its employment service matches the skills and interests of the career seekers with openings in a variety of industries, and provides coaching and support along the way.

Five months into his dream job, Justin now works as an administrator at Vancity. His duties include data entry and sorting mail. His favourite part of being an administrator at Vancity? Justin said it is delivering cookies and cards to his coworkers on special occasions and “seeing my friends, my coworkers, anybody, seeing them smile and making sure they have a happy day.”

Because of Vancity’s inclusive hiring policies, people with barriers to employment have equitable employment opportunities. While Vancity is just one of a number of posAbilities’ community partnerships, Justin’s supervisor and workforce manager, Max-Antoine Fleurentin, said it was a mutually-beneficial decision to connect with the employment agency. “It’s in our DNA to be inclusive and it was something that was very natural for us to do,” Fleurentin said. By creating an open and respectful work environment, Fleurentin said he has never encountered any issues of discrimination, regardless of the colour of your skin, sexual orientation, or ability. “We are all employees, we are all a big family here,” he said.

“Most people prefer to live in their own home,” says Shylo Director and Owner, Margot Ware. “We help make this dream a reality. Home Care is not a luxury reserved for the wealthy. The majority of our clients need only a few hours each day, and many only require care a few times a week or month.”

article continues below

Contrary to what some may think, a client does not need to be seriously ill or recovering from an injury or operation to receive home health care. The range of care listed on the Shylo website is extensive, even covering family support when a new baby graces a family. Home services range from palliative and respite care, to help with family illness, to basic support for those who have difficulty managing in their home.

Because homecare only takes place during a part of the day, clients don’t lose any aspect of their independence. The professional staff of home support workers— each one thoroughly screened before being hired — is there to help so that a client’s sense of independence remains intact.

“We take the time to get to know each client so that we can match them with the right home support worker,” says Ware. “Every small request or quick review from the client is listened and adhered to.”

If you need care but want to remain in your home, home health care is definitely the way to go. Not only will you keep your independence, you’ll receive care from someone who is just right for you.

That’s where J.R. Evans’ of Sutton Group-West Coast Realty unique experience as both a Realtor and mortgage broker can help provide advice well worth considering.

article continues below

“The fact I am a mortgage broker, as well as a Realtor, gives me some background to understand the relationship between mortgage rules and their effects on the real estate market,” he says. “I am able to take that information more into consideration than someone who is looking at a situation strictly from a real estate perspective.”

Evans says he is also constantly compiling information from economic and political news sources, as well as what he hears from industry insiders, clients and associates to formulate a clearer picture of future trends.

“I’m always receiving updates from our industry, and on top of that, I listen closely to what people say in the business. I am constantly thinking how this might affect the market, like the restrictions foreign-based clients may experience in accessing funds from their home country to finance a home purchase here.

“Plus, a mortgage broker doesn’t necessarily get access to detailed real estate statistics, so that gives me more data to model in my mind where things may be headed.”

That combination of information streams helped Evans predict the slowdown in the market that started in 2018.

So, what does he see happening in the short to mid-term for local real estate?

While the days of 30 per cent annual increases in valuations are not expected to return any time soon, Evans says a steady rise in prices is more likely.

“While the market has been relatively quiet, I still believe there’s significant interest in real estate,” he says. “It’s just that people haven’t been able to purchase what they wanted, or were waiting to see what happened in the market.

“And unless the government announces new policies related to real estate, I see a fairly steady market ahead,” Evans says, “with increases at least matching the rate of inflation, and maybe a little more, as realistic.”

""People asking this question are generally thinking that it would be good to pay for tomorrow's cost today,"" says Nicole Renwick, Executive Director of the Memorial Society of B.C. ""And they want to save their loved ones the bother of making financial decisions after they have passed, and there are a few other options.""

article continues below

For a nominal membership fee, the Memorial Society can work with you to pre-plan, rather than pre-pay, your funeral and arrangements for the disposal of your remains.

""We've been helping people with end of life arrangements for more than sixty years,"" Nicole notes. ""We have in excess of 242,000 members around the province, making us the largest memorial society in North America.""

Pre-planning with the Memorial Society is as simple as filling in an arrangement form detailing your wishes, and then making sure your survivors are aware of your membership in the Society.

""When end of life occurs,"" Nicole explains, ""the survivor should call us first. We will then refer them to a funeral home that is registered with us and with whom we have negotiated a member discount.""

While pre-paying is an option, there are other options to keep in mind such as the CPP Death Benefit or taking out a GIC with your executor. If you do decide to pre-pay your costs here are a few points to keep mind:

· You may move away from the area where your selected funeral home is located.

· If you ask for a refund from a funeral service provider for any reason after 30 days of signing a pre-payment contract, the provider is entitled to retain up to 20 percent of your money.

· A pre-payment contract usually does not include all the costs incurred at the time of death. For example, catering, flowers, cost for death certificates etc. are not included.

· If your survivors do not know about the pre-payments, it is possible that the money will be lost.

""We can give you peace of mind through pre-planning,"" she says, ""and relieve your loved ones of stress at an emotional time, while also making sure they receive a discounted rate on the provision of funeral services.""

The notion of establishing a framework to commercialize cannabis began as a promise by the Liberal Party in the 2015 federal election campaign that led to Justin Trudeau becoming prime minister. The implementation of the policy was not as smooth as first envisioned, and the provincial governments were put in charge of setting guidelines for the sale and consumption of marijuana.

article continues below

Research Co. and Glacier Media have been tracking perceptions about legalization every six months in British Columbia. Our latest survey shows that agreement with the new rules remains high across the entire province, that some residents are starting to ponder a future when other drugs could be treated in the same fashion as cannabis, and that – in stark contrast with what we found last year – marijuana users in British Columbia are starting to acquire all of their product through licensed retailers.

As more time passes, British Columbians appear happier with the decision to end prohibition. Seven in 10 of the province’s residents (70%) agree with marijuana being legal in Canada, while 26% disagree and 3% are undecided.

These findings represent a seven-point increase since a similar survey conducted in October 2019, as legal cannabis approached its first anniversary. The groups that are more likely to voice satisfaction with the new status quo are men (75%), British Columbians aged 35 to 54 (76%) and residents of northern B.C. (80%).

In recent weeks, we have seen more talk about creating a safe supply for drugs that are currently available only through illegal means. The impact of these discussions has led to a shift in the views of British Columbians about legalizing all drugs. It must be completely acknowledged that sizable majorities of the province’s residents continue to oppose a move to place any controlled substance inside a store, but the proponents of this option have grown since late last year.

At least two-thirds of British Columbians are opposed to legalizing ecstasy (66%), powder cocaine (70%), heroin (72%), crack cocaine (73%), methamphetamine or “crystal meth” (74%) and fentanyl (75%).

Support for making some of these drugs available in a fashion that would conceivably meet the same guidelines that govern cannabis has risen over the past six months, to 25% for cocaine (up from 18%) and to 24% for heroin (up from 19%). While these are still low proportions, the fluctuation could signal the start of a trend.

Just 10% of British Columbians say they only consumed marijuana after it became legal. Identical proportions of residents tried it before October 2018 (45%) or have never consumed it in Canada (also 45%). The incidence of “legal-only” marijuana users is highest among residents aged 18 to 34 (18%) and those who live in southern B.C. (19%).

But perhaps the biggest surprise, and a source of satisfaction for policy makers, is the way in which cannabis is being sought by users. Just over half of British Columbians who have consumed marijuana since legalization (51%) say that all of their product was acquired at a licensed retailer. In October 2019, only 31% of cannabis consumers in the province were getting all of their product at a licensed retailer.

We still see 16% of British Columbians who say none of their marijuana has been bought at a licensed retailer – a proportion that climbs to 25% among those aged 55 and over. Two-thirds of cannabis consumers aged 35 to 54 (68%) are buying all of their product at a licensed retailer.

Even though the delivery of cannabis products has improved over the past six months, there are significant regional differences that are indubitably related to the presence of stores in specific areas of the province. Cannabis consumers who reside in southern B.C. and Metro Vancouver are the most likely to be getting all of their product from licensed retailers (63% and 62%). The numbers are significantly lower in Vancouver Island (29%), northern B.C. (24%) and the Fraser Valley (19%).

Finally, the issue of “drug testing” remains a priority for British Columbians, with 61% saying that companies in the province should “definitely” or “probably” be able to administer these examinations to any employee now that marijuana is legal.

After a bumpy start that featured slow store openings and hitches with delivery options, there are signs that cannabis legalization is starting to work in a better fashion. More consumers are getting all of their product through licensed retailers, and the number of “new users” has not increased dramatically. Still, the significant regional disparities suggest that more marijuana outlets will need to be authorized in order to effectively eliminate the black market.

Other belongings included a discharge paper from the hospital, a wallet with a bit of cash in it and one of those walkers the elderly use for balance.

It was the sight of the walker, adorned with a single Christmas ornament, that deflated his younger and only sibling, Louise Wilson.

Her brother was 49, not 79. The fact he died Dec. 27 a frail homeless man behind a Marpole dollar store still doesn't compute with Wilson. Not when she studies the photographs she kept of her once sturdy brother.

The oldest image is of a fit 19-year-old in a striped V-neck shirt and jeans. He's sitting on a sofa with one of the family dogs at his feet. He's got a full head of hair, a thick moustache and he's smiling.

At 27, he's in a muscle shirt and looks relaxed at a summer gathering in his parents' backyard in Chilliwack. Same smile in that photo, too.

Four years later at 31, he's in dress pants, a shirt and tie. His hands are in his pockets and he's posing in front of a fireplace. This time, he's got a confident grin.

The story connecting the images goes like this: A likeable young man grows up in Steveston. He has many friends. He has a steady girlfriend. He has a passion for restoring Dodge muscle cars. He becomes a skilled carpenter.

So how is it that Rick Hofs got so low?

It's a question Wilson, who is two years younger than her brother, doesn't have a complete answer to. She doesn't know that she ever will. She's been trying, though.

Since she received news of her brother's death from a police officer, Wilson reached out to many in Marpole who knew Hofs as the homeless guy with the dog at 70 th and Granville.

"" I always hoped that he was married somewhere and he had a life, "" she said by telephone from her Langley home. "" To hear he was homeless was hard. And having to identify his body was the most horrible thing I've ever had to do. ""

Wilson last saw her brother in 2002.

Hofs showed up unannounced at her house in Langley. He owned an old camper van at the time and had his pit bull cross Bandit with him.

"" He looked very rough and he basically said I'll call you in a bit and he was on his way to Vancouver, "" she recalled. "" He had everything packed in his van and he left. ""

Wilson expected to hear from him again. Faithfully, every year, he would call her in April on her birthday. Those calls stopped.

She heard stories about him that worried her. She searched out his old friends and understood from one that Hofs was in Vancouver and doing fine.

Then she learned he was to appear in court. She didn't know what for. She showed up several times at the Main Street courthouse but never found him.

Married with three children, she didn't want to probe too deeply into her brother's life because of what she described as "" circumstances. "" Wilson believed her brother was once caught up in a dangerous drug scene, although he never confided in her about his choices in life.

She doubted he shared any of his troubles with their parents, either. Her father died in 2007, her mother lives in Chilliwack and wants nothing to do with her "" hobo "" son's funeral, according to Wilson, who, like her brother, was adopted and didn't have an ideal relationship with her parents.

Stories going around Marpole that Hofs was once married and had a child are hard to believe for Wilson. She'd like to think that was the case, but she has no proof. She knows her brother had a girlfriend when he was in his 20s but she left after a few years. The breakup crushed him.

"" I believe he had a broken heart, which led him to drugs, which led him to alcohol and astray into bad things. But it didn't make him a bad person. ""

Now divorced, Wilson purposely kept the same phone number and remained in the same house in Langley, hoping her brother would call or drop in.

"" He knew where I was, "" said Wilson, who works as a credit administrator at a home improvement store. "" At any point, he could have picked up the phone and I would have come and got him. As long as he was clean and away from that stuff, he would have had a home with me. ""

Wilson learned more about her brother last Thursday after 80 people attended a memorial for Hofs at Marpole Place on 70 th Avenue.

Single moms, seniors, the homeless, young kids, the disabled, a letter carrier, a pastor, the owner of the dollar store where he died and various people of ethnic backgrounds packed the small space. They shared stories, sang songs, laughed and cried over the better part of an hour as Wilson, dressed in black, sat on a piano bench at the front of the room to take it all in.

Two of her adult daughters were there, too, driven to tears like their mom, who was clearly moved by the outpouring of friendship from the guests.

Build a transition house in Marpole for homeless people and name it after Hofs, said Nikita Williams, who likened the homeless man to a father.

Put up a plaque in his memory outside the dollar store, said Lelan Shaffer, who started a shrine outside Amy's Loonie Toonie Town after learning of his friend's death.

"" If you look around this room today, each one of us has a different story about Rick, "" said Heather Pieters, sharing how Hofs looked out for her two teenaged boys. "" The fact is one person changed Marpole for many of us. We should remember that as we step outside these doors today - a homeless person actually touched our lives. ""

One man attempted to sing the old standard "" I believe, "" which begins with the lyrics "" I believe for every drop of rain that falls, a flower grows. I believe that somewhere in the darkest night, a candle glows. ""

The Federal Bureau of Prisons is expected to take Sidoo into custody on September 23 and release him from a Pacific Northwest area facility just before Christmas.

article continues below

Sidoo, 61, appeared online via Zoom in front of United States District Judge Nathaniel Gorton of the United States District Court for District of Massachusetts, as well as his lawyers and prosecutors. He wore a plaid suit while sitting in an office space inside his $31.7 million home in Vancouver’s Point Grey neighbourhood.

Sidoo, now a convicted felon, initially pled innocent to fraud and money laundering charges; he teared up before being sentenced and read a prepared statement:

“The last several months have been the hardest in my entire life and today I accept the court’s decision without reservation. No words can express how sorry I am for my decisions and actions that led to this day. I make no excuses, your honour. I broke the law and pled guilty and I now must pay for my actions.

“To my wife and boys, all I ever wanted was your love and respect and to be a good role model. And I know I have made a terrible mistake that has deeply affected our family. To my friends and colleagues and former teammates over the years, I am deeply ashamed today. To the young men and women who looked up to me as a role model, you deserve better. To the court and all of you, I wish to apologize for my actions.

“I will serve my sentence and am committed to returning to the community and doing everything possible to make a positive impact. I hope in time people will not judge me for the worst mistake in my life but for the work in the days, weeks and years ahead in which I am committed to being a better man.”

Gorton told Sidoo he was “impressed” by the businessman’s “obvious remorse.”

But Gorton pointed out two omissions in Sidoo’s statement.

“You expect to put this behind you and go forward and make up for what you called mistakes. I would call it a crime, not a mistake, but nevertheless, it is important that you acknowledge it and realize how many constituencies you have disappointed,” said the judge.

Sidoo also did not explicitly acknowledge that his crimes resulted in two students missing an opportunity to attend the universities his sons, Dylan Sidoo and Jordan Sidoo, were admitted to.

“What you accomplished, along with getting them into college, is to deprive two other deserving students of admittance into those universities — an act that is the very antithesis of one you want to be known for,” said Gorton.

Likewise, United States Attorney Andrew Lelling submitted to Gorton: “Sidoo engaged in serious criminal conduct involving fraud and deception that stretched over multiple years.

“His crimes warrant significant punishment. By engaging in the scheme, with [scheme mastermind Rick Singer] and others, Sidoo was able to steal two college admissions slots for his sons, including one from the University of California at Berkeley, one of the top public universities in the nation.”

Sidoo, said Gorton, “committed a crime that displayed an unbelievable lack of integrity, morality and common sense.

“You have let your selfish desire, your pride and your enormous wealth overcome all of what you apparently want to stand for with your works of charity,” Gorton told Sidoo.

Sidoo’s philanthropy, derived from his earnings in the capital markets, was central to his sentencing defense. According to Sidoo he has donated several million dollars to charitable causes, such as the University of B.C. football program.

In pleading guilty to fraud, Sidoo avoided a maximum prison term of 20 years and prosecutors subsequently agreed to 90 days behind bars, plus a $250,000 fine and one-year of supervised release, which will not be enforced in Canada by the U.S. Probation Department. Prosecutors also agreed to drop the money laundering charge.

The prison Sidoo goes to is expected to have harsher conditions since his options are limited due to his foreign citizenship. His attorney Martin Weinberg said he is expected to spend 14 days in isolation in a “maximum security setting,” due to COVID-19.

Sidoo will get four days credit for time already served. If he serves the full 90 days he will be released December 17 but will have to spend 14 days in isolation at home should B.C. public health rules for international travellers and COVID-19 continue into the fall.

Gorton said Sidoo’s crime would normally warrant more time in jail but there are mitigating circumstances, such as his remorse, lack of criminal record, philanthropy and “collateral consequences,” such as not being able to enter the U.S. as a felon and being stripped last month of his Order of B.C. medal for community service. Sidoo’s attorneys also previously noted he did not directly pay the universities but that his fraud was limited to cheating on the tests.

The former B.C. Lions football player worked as a stock broker in the 1990s and an investment banker between 2000 and 2010. Since 2010 he has made millions of dollars directing a handful of public companies that have failed to generate wealth for retail investors.

Sidoo was arrested March 8, 2019, in San Jose, California, on charges by the U.S. Department of Justice of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering related to the high-profile U.S. college admissions and bribery scandal, brought to light by a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe dubbed Operation Varsity Blues.

One of dozens of parents to be charged, Sidoo initially pled innocent to paying $200,000 total to scheme mastermind William ‘Rick’ Singer, who hired corrupt exam expert Mark Riddell to take Dylan and Jordan’s SAT exams, in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Sidoo also helped falsify one of his son Jordan’s university applications in October 2013 with an essay that originally included a fake claim of Jordan being held up at gunpoint by gangsters, while he was purported to be an intern for an anti-gang organization.

Co-conspirators Singer and Riddell pled guilty last year in exchange for cooperating with the government’s investigation.

The guilty parties in the case, who used Singer’s criminal services, were generally well-off individuals. Celebrities such as actress Lori Loughlin and her clothing designer husband Mossimo Gianulli and actress Felicity Huffman also pled guilty for related crimes and brought much media attention to the investigation.

Sidoo’s sons had no involvement in their father’s crime.

Jordan is now a 2018 history graduate from University of California Berkeley. Dylan graduated in cinematic arts in 2016 from the University of Southern California (USC). The two previously attended Vancouver’s prestigious St. George’s School.

Neither university has announced whether or not their degrees will remain valid. Dylan, according to the sentencing documents, had scored a 1,460/2,400 SAT score until Riddell, using a fake ID in December 2011, bumped up the score to 1,700, which was high enough for Dylan to enter Chapman University (and later transfer to USC). Riddell then scored 2,280/2,400 for Jordan in December 2012, paving the way to Berkley.

Riddell also took a high school test for Dylan. The B.C. Ministry of Education has issued no statement on how its testing process was so vulnerable to fraud.

Both sons have since entered into penny stock promotion with their father.

Exactly one week ago, on July 7, the province recorded 12 new cases. What followed was an uptick in recorded cases:

• 18 new cases on July 8;

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12; and

• 21 new cases on July 13.

article continues below

""I know it was distressing to me to see 20, especially 25 [new cases] one day,"" Henry said. ""That's way above my comfort zone.""

She added, however, that the slight rise in cases was not unexpected, given that the province has been allowing restaurants and other indoor businesses to reopen.

""We do know where those cases are,"" she said. ""We're testing the people who need to be tested.""

It would be more concerning, she said, if the cases were spread out across the province in an unlinked way. The most recent cluster of cases is linked to the Krazy Cherry Fruit Company in Oliver, she announced yesterday (July 13).

Given B.C.'s population, 20 cases in one day is also better than some other jurisdictions, she said.

The province has identified 3,128 infections since the virus first appeared in the province in late January.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,015 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1649 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 212 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 52 people who reside outside Canada.

Of the 209 people currently fighting COVID-19 in B.C., 14 people are in hospital with five of those in intensive care units. That leaves 2,730 people who have recovered from the virus.

No new deaths from the virus were identified in the past 24 hours, leaving the death toll at 189 people.

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

So far 399 residents and 252 staff at seniors' care facilities have been infected by COVID-19 in B.C.

Health Minister Adrian Dix said that it is his understanding that the federal government and the U.S. government have agreed to extend the closure of the two countries' border for one additional month, until August 21.

""This is obviously positive and necessary news,"" he said. ""Everybody who lives in B.C. knows how inconvenient and how difficult that is for many businesses and many individuals for a variety of circumstances.""

Harry Bains said injured workers have complained for too long that the system lacks fairness and support in times of injury and recovery.

article continues below

Changes Bains proposes include raising the maximum annual salary on which compensation benefits are based; authorizing WorkSafeBC to provide preventative medical treatment before claim acceptance; giving powers to the court to issue WorkSafeBC search and seizure warrants appropriate for investigating workplace safety infractions; and giving people a voice in serious workplace prosecutions and trials by using victim impact statements.

Victoria is also fast-tracking legislation to handle situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic so workers can access benefits more easily.

During the pandemic, the regulator is allowing businesses to defer paying their premiums for six months without penalty or interest. It is also waiving premiums on wages paid to workers of employers receiving the Canadian Emergency Wage Subsidy.

The amendments to the Workers Compensation Act comes after three expert reviews were completed in 2018 and 2019.

The ministry said of the more than 44,000 injured workers currently receiving permanent disability benefits because of a work-related injury, about 35% are in the Lower Mainland, while the rest are spread throughout all regions of B.C.

There are more than 100,000 workplace injury or fatality claims annually.

In 2019, there were 140 workplace fatalities in B.C. Of that number, 84 were due to occupational disease, 40 to traumatic injury and 16 the result of a motor vehicle incident.

In a fiscal update Tuesday, B.C. Finance Minister Carole James said the COVID-19 pandemic will result in ""the worst downturn experienced in our province in recent history.""

article continues below

""The projected numbers are staggering, but they're not without hope,"" James said, in summing up B.C.'s fiscal position.

She said B.C. had entered the pandemic perhaps better situated than other provinces, as it had a balanced budget, a triple AAA credit rating and one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country.

B.C. also managed to contain the pandemic and flatten its growth curve better than some other provinces, and it has been able to move earlier on a phased economic restart plan.

""Because of that strength, we were able to take immediate action to help people, to help businesses, to help communities with our $5 billion COVID action plan,"" James said.

She said the province is expecting a loss of $4.2 billion in tax revenue, including $1 billion less in personal income tax revenue, $973 million less in corporate taxes, $1.3 billion in provincial sales tax revenue, $300 million in natural resource revenues and $882 million less in Crown Corporation income.

The province is also spending $5 billion in emergency spending, and has approved $1.3 billion in tax credits and deferrals. In total, the increased spending, lost tax revenue and foregone revenue will bring the deficit to $12.5 billion.

In February, James brought down, but never passed, a balanced budget and modest surplus of $227 million and provincial GDP growth projections of 2% in 2020.

""Mere weeks after the budget 2020 was tabled, our entire world changed,"" James said.

James said the B.C. economy is now expected to contract 6.8% in 2020, according to some forecasters.

Since February, B.C. lost 235,000 jobs, and saw retail sales declined by 23.6% in April compared to February. Overall, home prices dropped 4%.

Home sales declined 45.4% in May, compared to February, and B.C. merchandise exports are down 14.7% year-to-date, compared to January to May 2019.

""While the job losses in March and April were record-breaking, figures for May and June in fact have seen some recovery of the losses that we experienced in the previous two months,"" James said.

Asked if her government planned to resort to spending cuts to address the deficit, James said ""now is not the time to be able to cut back on services and support for people and business in British Columbia.""

As for any long-range plans for dealing with debt and deficits, James said: ""I do not believe that it's going to be a quick fix.""

Asked if the $5 billion that her government has already approved could be added to later this year, James said ""I believe the $5 billion is enough now.""

However, she added no one can predict what might happen should there be a second wave of COVID-19.

As for the $22 billion in capital spending allocated in the 2020 budget over three years for big capital works projects, like new schools, hospitals, bridges and roads, that will continue to be spent.

""This is going to serve us very well because it translates into huge investments,"" James said.

551,vancourier,https://www.vancourier.com/community/gun-violence-imported-from-u-s-is-a-key-concern-for-canadians-1.24169958,Gun violence imported from U.S. is a key concern for Canadians,['Mario Canseco'],,"National governments have a tendency to overreact immediately after they are forced to face an unexpected challenge. No example is better than the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks in the United States, which gave us the “Patriot Act” after just 45 days of deliberation to expand government surveillance of Americans to previously unimagined levels.

In mid-April, the actions of Gabriel Wortman led to the deaths of 22 people in Nova Scotia after multiple shootings and fires. Most Canadians, at the time still under lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, were horrified at Wortman’s actions, which included impersonating a police officer.

article continues below

It took the federal government only 13 days after Wortman’s criminal activity was evident for the entire country to announce a nationwide ban on 1,500 types of military-grade “assault-style” weapons in Canada. Any Canadian who possesses these firearms will have two years to get rid of them. The prohibition led to many new discussions about the role that firearms play in Canada’s urban and rural areas.

We know now that the perpetrator of the 22 murders in Nova Scotia had obtained his weapons illegally from Canadian and American sources. This was not a surprise for Canadian authorities, who have consistently reported that more than 70% of the weapons used in gun-related crimes in our country come from the United States.

On the issue of firearms, Canada is decidedly different from the United States. In Canada, it is not legal for a person to own or carry a firearm for the purpose of self defence against human beings. When Research Co. and Glacier Media asked Canadians about this key precept of Canadian law, more than three in four (77%) agreed with it, while 18% disagreed and 5% were undecided.

Atlantic Canada (31%), Saskatchewan and Manitoba (29%) and Alberta (24%) boast the highest number of residents who openly question Canada’s long-standing regulations for firearms. While higher than what is observed in Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia, these are not proportions of voters that would sway an election, certainly not in the way American statewide and congressional races can be tilted if your candidate can adequately hold a shotgun and recite the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution in a manner that panders to the base.

Fewer than one in five Canadians welcome the notion of citizens carrying firearms for something other than hunting or scaring wildlife away. Any survey measuring opinions on banning “assault-style” weapons would be met with near unanimity. The opposition reacted to the announced ban as it always has under its outgoing leader, by claiming the regulations would affect law-abiding Canadians. Lost in this unfortunate combination of inadequate polling and incapable opposition are the solutions that matter to Canadians.

In our survey, more than three in five Canadians (63%) told us that gun violence in Canada is a “very serious” or “moderately serious” problem – a proportion that climbs to 69% among women and 68% among those aged 55 and over.

Sizable majorities of Ontarians and British Columbians, who have experienced gang wars in urban areas, are more likely to look at gun violence as particularly problematic (76% and 67%, respectively). The COVID-19 pandemic did little to curb gun violence in Toronto, where 61 people were shot in the first four months of the year.

We asked Canadians about the effectiveness of four possible measures, and their responses outline a public that is ready for bold action. More than three in five Canadians (62%) think enacting a complete ban on handguns would be “very effective” or “moderately effective” in reducing gun violence in Canada. Most crimes, after all, are not being committed with the military-grade “assault-style” weapons that the federal government was quick to ban.

A higher proportion of Canadians deem two other measures as effective: imposing mandatory jail terms for crimes committed with firearms (74%) and introducing new outreach programs to steer youth away from gangs (also 74%).

Canadians place dealing with firearms smuggled from the United States as the most important issue that needs to be addressed. Many of the country’s residents also want to make sure gangs are not attractive to our country’s youth and believe mandatory minimum jail sentences would act as a deterrent.

Banning military-grade “assault-style” weapons is low-hanging fruit in a challenge that definitely has Canadians preoccupied and wishing for a type of government intervention that goes beyond a photo-op celebrated by poorly executed survey charity work.

True sociologists know that we learn nothing from posing the wrong questions to Canadians, and capable politicians should go beyond voicing displeasure with plans and proposals just because that is what they are expected to do. Meanwhile, Canadians are still worried about gun violence and expecting their elected officials to do better. •

552,vancourier,https://www.vancourier.com/community/what-s-the-deal-with-a-partridge-in-a-pear-tree-1.2137708,What’s the deal with a partridge in a pear tree?,['Pat Johnson'],,"Everyone knows the 12 Days of Christmas song. Few of us know the meaning of the gifts delineated in the somewhat monotonous carol or, in fact, the significance of the 12 days to the story of Jesus’s birth. When I started poking around, I found some deep historical secrets and also an ongoing mix-up that blows the lid off the usual imagery of baby Jesus in the manger.



Let’s start with the facts. I spoke with Dr. Paul Spilsbury, academic dean and professor of the New Testament at Regent College on the UBC campus.



“Basically, the church calendar is divided into seasons, and Christmas, in the church calendar, is a season rather than a day,” he says. “Christmas lasts for 12 days. It’s a secret we’ve kept from our kids all this time.”



The 12 days of Christmas go from Dec. 25 until Jan. 5. Traditionally, including in my grandmother’s house, the Christmas tree had to come down on or before the 5th, because that was the end of the Christmas season and the beginning of Epiphany.



Usually we think of the first Christmas as the moment the world (in the Christian narrative) realized the saviour had arrived. Not so. That was 12 days later.

Epiphany is the feast associated with the Magi, the Three Wise Men, coming to Jesus, presenting their gifts. It also commemorates the presentation of Jesus in the Temple.



“Epiphany is like the coming out of Jesus,” says Spilsbury. “The manifestation of Jesus to the world.” And here is where much of what you think you know about the manger scene is wrong.



“There are two stories in the Gospels about the birth of Jesus,” he explains, one in the Gospel of Matthew and one in the Gospel of Luke. “And the two stories are not exactly the same.”



In one gospel, the Magi visit Jesus in a house, not in a manger. In the other, the arrival of Jesus in the manger is met with angels and shepherds, but no wise men.



“Christian tradition has always kind of woven the two stories together and said the one happened first and the other one second or something like that,” says Spilsbury. “In your typical pageant or Christmas card, you often have a scene in which there are wise men in the stable, but if you look at the original stories in the gospel, those are two separate scenes. We’ve kind of mixed them all together… they get kind of coalesced, fused together.”



Mary and Joseph had advance warning that her son was the manifestation of God made flesh. The world, however, became aware of this only on Epiphany — 12 days after Jesus was born. The Three Wise Men represent the awareness of Jesus as the son of God spreading to the larger world.



“It’s when the wise men come with their gifts and that, in a sense, is the revealing to the world,” Spilsbury says. “That’s what epiphany is about, revealing to the world the holiness of this baby… the Magi were from another country, they were not Jews, so it was the making known of the Christ child to the world, as it were.”



In traditional Christian churches, especially Anglican and Catholic, there will be fairly strict adherence to the appropriate liturgies of the season. Leading up to Christmas is Advent, a month of spiritual preparation, introspection and repentance. Christmas, which we now know lasts a full 12 days, is associated with a heightened holiness, and then Epiphany is also accompanied by its own traditions.



So that’s what the 12 days of Christmas are all about. Now what about that song?



Between 1558 and 1829, Roman Catholics in England were forbidden from openly practising their religion. In order to inculcate the catechism in their children, Catholics created the song as, basically, a series of mnemonic devices to give kids the broad outline of the Roman Catholic worldview and teachings.



Both “my true love” and the partridge in a pear tree represent Jesus — the partridge because it’s a bird that will sacrifice its life to save its children. Two turtle doves represent the Old and New Testaments. The three French hens are faith, hope and love. Four calling birds are the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. The five golden rings are the Pentateuch, the first five books of the Old Testament and so on, through six days of creation (geese a-laying), seven gifts of the holy spirit (swans a-swimming), eight beatitudes (maids a-milking), nine fruits of the holy spirit (ladies dancing), the 10 commandments (lords a-leaping), 11 faithful apostles (pipers piping) and 12 points of belief in the Apostle’s Creed (drummers drumming). If one understood the song’s underlying meaning, it provided a pretty good skeleton upon which to begin a wider exploration about religious teachings. And it could be sung publicly leaving the Protestant establishment none the wiser.



Have a merry Christmas… all 12 days of it.

553,vancourier,https://www.vancourier.com/community/much-loved-campagnolo-roma-says-ciao-to-east-vancouver-1.23479788,Much-loved Campagnolo Roma says ciao to East Vancouver,['Grant Lawrence'],,"So long and thanks for all the pizza.

After seven busy, community-building years, one of the only upscale eateries in Hastings-Sunrise is closing the lid on its last pizza box. Campagnolo Roma opened at the corner of East Hastings and Garden Street in 2011 as a satellite of chef Robert Belcham’s popular Main Street Campagnolo location. Both restaurants take inspiration from rustic northern Italian cuisine, while Roma focused on the specialties of the Italian capital.

article continues below

When Roma opened its doors at 2297 East Hastings, it helped kick start a restaurant boom in the area, along with Tacofino, What’s Up? Hot Dog, Trans Am, Jackalope’s, Red Café, Yolks and Wagon Rouge.

Over the course of Roma’s run, the cozy restaurant with the sweet patio became the local eatery of choice for special occasions, whether it was an anniversary, birthday, homecoming or graduation.

“We’ve seen it all in here over the years,” Roma’s general manager Sarah Jensen told me. “I remember one time a family moved to this neighbourhood sight unseen from the U.K. On their first night, they were walking around and spotted our restaurant. We served them their first dinner in Canada. That was years ago and they’ve been coming ever since. Every time they get visitors from out of town, this would be the first place they come for a meal.”

My family has a very personal memory connected to Roma and its oh-so-delicious food. On the night our first child was born, my wife went into labour in a planned home birth. Our midwife told me my wife would likely be extremely hungry after the birth and to be sure to have some good food on hand. I headed to Campagnolo Roma for some pasta to go. At around midnight, our son was born. At about 1 a.m., my wife devoured that pasta like a hungry wolf.

Jensen was working that rainy night in August, wished us luck, and has since seen my son grow up to devour Roma’s top-selling margherita pizzas like a hungry wolf cub.

“I had another moment like that the other night,” said Jensen. “The restaurant was full and a mother and daughter were sitting at the bar. I realized that I had met that little girl when she was three and now here she is at 10, and I’ve watched her grow up. Every day is like that in here. It’s made me realize that it’s not just about your money for our food. A neighbourhood restaurant like this is about community on a certain level, and I will really miss that.”

No concrete reason has been given from the ownership group to Jensen or the restaurant’s staff for the closure, but lack of diners wasn’t the problem. The reason is likely financial.

There were rumours the restaurant had fallen into the red, but staff had been working hard trying to put it back in black.I reached out to Campagnolo Roma’s co-owner, executive chef Robert Belcham, who sent me this reply via email:

“I feel heartbroken for the staff and customers that made Roma so amazing. The one constant in life is change, and either you go with the proverbial flow or you drown. Roma had an absolutely amazing run. I cannot say enough good things about the staff and the vibrant neighbourhood. We look forward to continuing what we do at Campagnolo Main Street and hope our Roma regulars join us there.”

Belcham told Scout Magazine that “staffing was getting more difficult and food costs weren’t very helpful.”

Customer reaction to the polished family restaurant’s impending closure has been emotional.

“Last week we had a man actually get angry about it,” Jensen told me. “Roma is part of their family routine. Every Friday night he and his wife and kids come in for dinner. For them, Friday night at Roma was a thread of stability within their family.”

Most of the kitchen staff at Roma will be absorbed by the Main Street location. The eight to 10 front-of-house staff, including Jensen, are being laid off, but Jensen was quick to point out that there is no shortage of work for quality servers in Vancouver.

Campagnolo Roma’s final night is Thursday, Nov. 8.

As to what might open in Roma’s place at Hastings and Garden, Jensen offered a challenge. “What I want is this — whatever new restaurant that opens here needs to be better than Roma. The bar is high.”

Over the course of its time in the neighbourhood, through fine food and atmosphere, this little restaurant reminded us that there is nothing more communal than breaking bread with friends, visitors, and loved ones. Roma, you will be missed in our tummies and our hearts. Grazie.

Over the last couple of weeks, daily numbers have sometimes been in the single digits. But over the last three days, since Friday, there have been an average of 20 to 21 new cases per day: 62 in total since Friday.

article continues below

That brings the total confirmed cases to 3,115. Of that number, 51 are non-residents who live outside of Canada but are currently in B.C. Although public health officials aren't saying where these non-residents are from, it is likely that some are temporary foreign farm workers, as there have been outbreaks at a number of farms in B.C.

There have been two deaths since Friday attributed to COVID-19. While there have been no new community outbreaks in long-term care or acute care facilities, there have been a number of community exposure events in the Okanagan.

Public health has issued an isolation order for the Krazy Cherry Fruit Co. in Oliver, where two cases have been identified at the farm. Interior Health has also issued alerts for possible community exposure events in Kelowna.

""Anyone who was at the Discovery Bay Resort from July 1 to 5 and Boyce Gyro Beach Lodge on July 1 is directed to self-isolate,” provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix said in a joint release Monday, July 13.

“Anyone who was at Cactus Club on Water Street from July 3 to 6 and Pace Spin Studio on July 2, 4, 5, 7 to 9 is asked to monitor themselves and contact public health immediately to arrange to get tested should symptoms develop.

""Spending an extended period of time, even an evening together with a large number of people in an enclosed space, increases the likelihood that you will be exposed to someone with COVID-19. As much as possible, British Columbians are asked to avoid closed spaces, crowds and close contact with others.”

Here are today’s COVID-19 numbers for Monday, July 13, with numbers from Friday July 10, the last reporting period, in brackets:

New cases: 62 (25)

The provincial government has extended its temporary authorization, which allows businesses with food-primary and liquor-primary licences to sell and deliver packaged liquor products, alongside meal purchases, for off-site consumption.

article continues below

The authorization would have expired July 15.

Prior to the measure, restaurants and bars were in general only allowed to sell liquor for consumption at their establishments. The sale of alcohol for off-site consumption has provided businesses with an additional source of revenue during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The province is also extending an authorization that allows for increased hours of retail liquor service. Extended hours will remain in place until August 31.

Provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix announced July 15 that there were 21 new cases in the past 24 hours, including two cases that they call ""epi-linked,"" or presumed cases that have not been proven through testing but are being treated as official cases.

article continues below

The province has now recorded 3,149 cases since the novel coronavirus first appeared in B.C. in late January.

More than 87.4% of those infected, or 2,753 people, have recovered. Of those who haven't, 189 people have died and 207 people are actively fighting the virus. Only 14 people are hospitalized, with five of those in intensive care units. The rest are self-isolating at home. There were no new deaths recorded in the past 24 hours.

Recording at least 20 new COVID-19 cases in a 24-hour period has become common in B.C., and Henry said yesterday that she found that number ""distressing,"" even though, she added, the good news is that the province knows where the clusters of infection are, many of the infections are linked and the number is not really that large given the province's population of more than five million residents.

The numbers in the past week were:

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12;

• 21 new cases on July 13;

• 13 new cases on July 14; and now

• 21 new cases on July 15.

In June, the number of daily new cases many times was in the single digits.

""There is one active community outbreak, in addition to several community exposure events,"" Henry and Dix said. ""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks.""

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,023 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,659 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 216 in Interior Health;

The Federal Bureau of Prisons is expected to take Sidoo into custody on September 23 and release him from a Pacific Northwest area facility just before Christmas.

article continues below

Sidoo, 61, appeared online via Zoom in front of United States District Judge Nathaniel Gorton of the United States District Court for District of Massachusetts, as well as his lawyers and prosecutors. He wore a plaid suit while sitting in an office space inside his $31.7 million home in Vancouver’s Point Grey neighbourhood.

Sidoo, now a convicted felon, initially pled innocent to fraud and money laundering charges; he teared up before being sentenced and read a prepared statement:

“The last several months have been the hardest in my entire life and today I accept the court’s decision without reservation. No words can express how sorry I am for my decisions and actions that led to this day. I make no excuses, your honour. I broke the law and pled guilty and I now must pay for my actions.

“To my wife and boys, all I ever wanted was your love and respect and to be a good role model. And I know I have made a terrible mistake that has deeply affected our family. To my friends and colleagues and former teammates over the years, I am deeply ashamed today. To the young men and women who looked up to me as a role model, you deserve better. To the court and all of you, I wish to apologize for my actions.

“I will serve my sentence and am committed to returning to the community and doing everything possible to make a positive impact. I hope in time people will not judge me for the worst mistake in my life but for the work in the days, weeks and years ahead in which I am committed to being a better man.”

Gorton told Sidoo he was “impressed” by the businessman’s “obvious remorse.”

But Gorton pointed out two omissions in Sidoo’s statement.

“You expect to put this behind you and go forward and make up for what you called mistakes. I would call it a crime, not a mistake, but nevertheless, it is important that you acknowledge it and realize how many constituencies you have disappointed,” said the judge.

Sidoo also did not explicitly acknowledge that his crimes resulted in two students missing an opportunity to attend the universities his sons, Dylan Sidoo and Jordan Sidoo, were admitted to.

“What you accomplished, along with getting them into college, is to deprive two other deserving students of admittance into those universities — an act that is the very antithesis of one you want to be known for,” said Gorton.

Likewise, United States Attorney Andrew Lelling submitted to Gorton: “Sidoo engaged in serious criminal conduct involving fraud and deception that stretched over multiple years.

“His crimes warrant significant punishment. By engaging in the scheme, with [scheme mastermind Rick Singer] and others, Sidoo was able to steal two college admissions slots for his sons, including one from the University of California at Berkeley, one of the top public universities in the nation.”

Sidoo, said Gorton, “committed a crime that displayed an unbelievable lack of integrity, morality and common sense.

“You have let your selfish desire, your pride and your enormous wealth overcome all of what you apparently want to stand for with your works of charity,” Gorton told Sidoo.

Sidoo’s philanthropy, derived from his earnings in the capital markets, was central to his sentencing defense. According to Sidoo he has donated several million dollars to charitable causes, such as the University of B.C. football program.

In pleading guilty to fraud, Sidoo avoided a maximum prison term of 20 years and prosecutors subsequently agreed to 90 days behind bars, plus a $250,000 fine and one-year of supervised release, which will not be enforced in Canada by the U.S. Probation Department. Prosecutors also agreed to drop the money laundering charge.

The prison Sidoo goes to is expected to have harsher conditions since his options are limited due to his foreign citizenship. His attorney Martin Weinberg said he is expected to spend 14 days in isolation in a “maximum security setting,” due to COVID-19.

Sidoo will get four days credit for time already served. If he serves the full 90 days he will be released December 17 but will have to spend 14 days in isolation at home should B.C. public health rules for international travellers and COVID-19 continue into the fall.

Gorton said Sidoo’s crime would normally warrant more time in jail but there are mitigating circumstances, such as his remorse, lack of criminal record, philanthropy and “collateral consequences,” such as not being able to enter the U.S. as a felon and being stripped last month of his Order of B.C. medal for community service. Sidoo’s attorneys also previously noted he did not directly pay the universities but that his fraud was limited to cheating on the tests.

The former B.C. Lions football player worked as a stock broker in the 1990s and an investment banker between 2000 and 2010. Since 2010 he has made millions of dollars directing a handful of public companies that have failed to generate wealth for retail investors.

Sidoo was arrested March 8, 2019, in San Jose, California, on charges by the U.S. Department of Justice of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering related to the high-profile U.S. college admissions and bribery scandal, brought to light by a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe dubbed Operation Varsity Blues.

One of dozens of parents to be charged, Sidoo initially pled innocent to paying $200,000 total to scheme mastermind William ‘Rick’ Singer, who hired corrupt exam expert Mark Riddell to take Dylan and Jordan’s SAT exams, in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Sidoo also helped falsify one of his son Jordan’s university applications in October 2013 with an essay that originally included a fake claim of Jordan being held up at gunpoint by gangsters, while he was purported to be an intern for an anti-gang organization.

Co-conspirators Singer and Riddell pled guilty last year in exchange for cooperating with the government’s investigation.

The guilty parties in the case, who used Singer’s criminal services, were generally well-off individuals. Celebrities such as actress Lori Loughlin and her clothing designer husband Mossimo Gianulli and actress Felicity Huffman also pled guilty for related crimes and brought much media attention to the investigation.

Sidoo’s sons had no involvement in their father’s crime.

Jordan is now a 2018 history graduate from University of California Berkeley. Dylan graduated in cinematic arts in 2016 from the University of Southern California (USC). The two previously attended Vancouver’s prestigious St. George’s School.

Neither university has announced whether or not their degrees will remain valid. Dylan, according to the sentencing documents, had scored a 1,460/2,400 SAT score until Riddell, using a fake ID in December 2011, bumped up the score to 1,700, which was high enough for Dylan to enter Chapman University (and later transfer to USC). Riddell then scored 2,280/2,400 for Jordan in December 2012, paving the way to Berkley.

Riddell also took a high school test for Dylan. The B.C. Ministry of Education has issued no statement on how its testing process was so vulnerable to fraud.

Both sons have since entered into penny stock promotion with their father.

Exactly one week ago, on July 7, the province recorded 12 new cases. What followed was an uptick in recorded cases:

• 18 new cases on July 8;

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12; and

• 21 new cases on July 13.

""I know it was distressing to me to see 20, especially 25 [new cases] one day,"" Henry said. ""That's way above my comfort zone.""

She added, however, that the slight rise in cases was not unexpected, given that the province has been allowing restaurants and other indoor businesses to reopen.

""We do know where those cases are,"" she said. ""We're testing the people who need to be tested.""

It would be more concerning, she said, if the cases were spread out across the province in an unlinked way. The most recent cluster of cases is linked to the Krazy Cherry Fruit Company in Oliver, she announced yesterday (July 13).

Given B.C.'s population, 20 cases in one day is also better than some other jurisdictions, she said.

The province has identified 3,128 infections since the virus first appeared in the province in late January.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,015 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1649 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 212 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 52 people who reside outside Canada.

Of the 209 people currently fighting COVID-19 in B.C., 14 people are in hospital with five of those in intensive care units. That leaves 2,730 people who have recovered from the virus.

No new deaths from the virus were identified in the past 24 hours, leaving the death toll at 189 people.

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

So far 399 residents and 252 staff at seniors' care facilities have been infected by COVID-19 in B.C.

Health Minister Adrian Dix said that it is his understanding that the federal government and the U.S. government have agreed to extend the closure of the two countries' border for one additional month, until August 21.

""This is obviously positive and necessary news,"" he said. ""Everybody who lives in B.C. knows how inconvenient and how difficult that is for many businesses and many individuals for a variety of circumstances.""

Harry Bains said injured workers have complained for too long that the system lacks fairness and support in times of injury and recovery.

article continues below

Changes Bains proposes include raising the maximum annual salary on which compensation benefits are based; authorizing WorkSafeBC to provide preventative medical treatment before claim acceptance; giving powers to the court to issue WorkSafeBC search and seizure warrants appropriate for investigating workplace safety infractions; and giving people a voice in serious workplace prosecutions and trials by using victim impact statements.

Victoria is also fast-tracking legislation to handle situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic so workers can access benefits more easily.

During the pandemic, the regulator is allowing businesses to defer paying their premiums for six months without penalty or interest. It is also waiving premiums on wages paid to workers of employers receiving the Canadian Emergency Wage Subsidy.

The amendments to the Workers Compensation Act comes after three expert reviews were completed in 2018 and 2019.

The ministry said of the more than 44,000 injured workers currently receiving permanent disability benefits because of a work-related injury, about 35% are in the Lower Mainland, while the rest are spread throughout all regions of B.C.

There are more than 100,000 workplace injury or fatality claims annually.

In 2019, there were 140 workplace fatalities in B.C. Of that number, 84 were due to occupational disease, 40 to traumatic injury and 16 the result of a motor vehicle incident.

In a fiscal update Tuesday, B.C. Finance Minister Carole James said the COVID-19 pandemic will result in ""the worst downturn experienced in our province in recent history.""

article continues below

""The projected numbers are staggering, but they're not without hope,"" James said, in summing up B.C.'s fiscal position.

She said B.C. had entered the pandemic perhaps better situated than other provinces, as it had a balanced budget, a triple AAA credit rating and one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country.

B.C. also managed to contain the pandemic and flatten its growth curve better than some other provinces, and it has been able to move earlier on a phased economic restart plan.

""Because of that strength, we were able to take immediate action to help people, to help businesses, to help communities with our $5 billion COVID action plan,"" James said.

She said the province is expecting a loss of $4.2 billion in tax revenue, including $1 billion less in personal income tax revenue, $973 million less in corporate taxes, $1.3 billion in provincial sales tax revenue, $300 million in natural resource revenues and $882 million less in Crown Corporation income.

The province is also spending $5 billion in emergency spending, and has approved $1.3 billion in tax credits and deferrals. In total, the increased spending, lost tax revenue and foregone revenue will bring the deficit to $12.5 billion.

In February, James brought down, but never passed, a balanced budget and modest surplus of $227 million and provincial GDP growth projections of 2% in 2020.

""Mere weeks after the budget 2020 was tabled, our entire world changed,"" James said.

James said the B.C. economy is now expected to contract 6.8% in 2020, according to some forecasters.

Since February, B.C. lost 235,000 jobs, and saw retail sales declined by 23.6% in April compared to February. Overall, home prices dropped 4%.

Home sales declined 45.4% in May, compared to February, and B.C. merchandise exports are down 14.7% year-to-date, compared to January to May 2019.

""While the job losses in March and April were record-breaking, figures for May and June in fact have seen some recovery of the losses that we experienced in the previous two months,"" James said.

Asked if her government planned to resort to spending cuts to address the deficit, James said ""now is not the time to be able to cut back on services and support for people and business in British Columbia.""

As for any long-range plans for dealing with debt and deficits, James said: ""I do not believe that it's going to be a quick fix.""

Asked if the $5 billion that her government has already approved could be added to later this year, James said ""I believe the $5 billion is enough now.""

However, she added no one can predict what might happen should there be a second wave of COVID-19.

As for the $22 billion in capital spending allocated in the 2020 budget over three years for big capital works projects, like new schools, hospitals, bridges and roads, that will continue to be spent.

""This is going to serve us very well because it translates into huge investments,"" James said.

Over the last couple of weeks, daily numbers have sometimes been in the single digits. But over the last three days, since Friday, there have been an average of 20 to 21 new cases per day: 62 in total since Friday.

That brings the total confirmed cases to 3,115. Of that number, 51 are non-residents who live outside of Canada but are currently in B.C. Although public health officials aren't saying where these non-residents are from, it is likely that some are temporary foreign farm workers, as there have been outbreaks at a number of farms in B.C.

There have been two deaths since Friday attributed to COVID-19. While there have been no new community outbreaks in long-term care or acute care facilities, there have been a number of community exposure events in the Okanagan.

Public health has issued an isolation order for the Krazy Cherry Fruit Co. in Oliver, where two cases have been identified at the farm. Interior Health has also issued alerts for possible community exposure events in Kelowna.

""Anyone who was at the Discovery Bay Resort from July 1 to 5 and Boyce Gyro Beach Lodge on July 1 is directed to self-isolate,” provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix said in a joint release Monday, July 13.

“Anyone who was at Cactus Club on Water Street from July 3 to 6 and Pace Spin Studio on July 2, 4, 5, 7 to 9 is asked to monitor themselves and contact public health immediately to arrange to get tested should symptoms develop.

""Spending an extended period of time, even an evening together with a large number of people in an enclosed space, increases the likelihood that you will be exposed to someone with COVID-19. As much as possible, British Columbians are asked to avoid closed spaces, crowds and close contact with others.”

Why it matters: The program brings cost relief to businesses hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, and is intended to support employment.

article continues below

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologized on Monday for not recusing himself from discussions about the administration of Ottawa's $900 million student volunteer program.

WE Charity was initially selected to deliver the initiative under a nearly $20 million contract. Trudeau said he was aware of his family's ties to the organization, but unaware of the honorariums his mother and brother received for their involvement.

""It is not a surprise to me that they got paid by WE, but I did not know that they got paid by WE,"" Trudeau said.

""In this situation, I should have recused myself,"" he added, acknowledging that his involvement in Ottawa's student volunteer program has created controversy. Members of the Conservative Party of Canada have called on Trudeau to address his involvement before Ottawa's ethics committee.

""I get that. I made a mistake in not recusing myself immediately from the discussion.""

Trudeau said he will evaluate any requests to address the issue before parliament. He also said that, because of his involvement, the rollout of the student volunteer program has been a bit delayed – an outcome he deeply regrets.

In addition to addressing the issue, Trudeau said on Monday that the federal government will extend its wage subsidy program until the end of the year. More information on the extension is expected this week.

The prime minister also said he spoke with U.S. president Donald Trump earlier in the day about the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement – which took effect July 1, – Black Lives Matter, China, the two Canadians who remain detained in China and U.S. aluminum tariffs.

""I highlighted to the president that the pandemic has disrupted usual manufacturing processes and supply chains,"" said Trudeau. ""It would be a shame to see tariffs come in between our two countries at a time when we're celebrating the new NAFTA.""

Trudeau briefly told reporters to expect a joint announcement regarding the closure of the Canada-U.S. border.

Non-essential travel across the border is banned until late July.

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreaks at Tabor and at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred to those homes from the hospital. The outbreak at the Tabor long-term care home was declared over on July 7.

B.C.'s provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix said in a July 10 joint statement that the province recorded 25 new cases in the past 24 hours, for a total of 3,053 cases since the virus that has caused a global pandemic first appeared in B.C. in late January.

Stephen Without pleaded guilty to assaults involving directly massaging patients’ breasts or touching or rubbing their vaginal areas.

article continues below

The court said the activity had no therapeutic or valid reason during treatment in 2015 and 2016 at Witvoet’s Thrive Physiotherapy business.

He was charged with 16 offenses in total.

“The victims went to see Mr. Witvoet for pain relief. They trusted him. He abused that trust,” Vernon Provincial Court Judge Jeremy Guild said.

The first complaint came in July 2015 when a woman told police Witvoet had massaged both of her breasts under her sports bra with his hand. She did not want to proceed with charges unless someone else came forward.

Three months later, another woman complained of similar behaviour. Police contacted the first woman and Witvoet was charged.

Two more complaints led to charges in June 2019.

After that, RCMP appealed to the public for assistance and a further 12 charges resulted.

The victims ranged in age from 18 to 57.

They had sought Witvoet’s services for issues such as flat feet, shoulder injuries, lockjaw and other injuries.

The October 2019 guilty plea came after a joint submission from Crown and defence.

“The guilty pleas were also important for him as an acceptance of his responsibility, and an acknowledgment that he did wrong and that the victims were right,” Guild said in the July 8 sentencing ruling. The guilty pleas help make sure justice is done from the victims’ perspectives.”

Witvoet is now separated from his wife, with whom he has two children.

“He now takes full responsibility for his offending, is remorseful and recognizes that he abused his position of trust. The publicity has left him feeling like a pariah,” Guild said. “He may have to find a new career. He has been working in construction to make ends meet and support his family.”

Guild said he initially had concerns about the sentence “because there seemed to be very little punitive aspect to it.”

But, he said, the guilty plea spared the victims having to testify. Despite their names being barred from publication, their need to be in court would leak out and people would know the details of what had happened to them, Guild said.

“Being spared the necessity of testifying helped protect their privacy and save them from embarrassment. That was one of the main goals in the Crown arriving at the joint submission,” Guild said.

The 18-month sentence is broken into six months’ house arrest and a year with a 10 p.m.-6 a.m. curfew.

He also received two years’ probation also include a ban on treating female patients while on probation.

“Given the notoriety of his offending, his neighbours and the community will know of his restrictions,” Guild said.

The College of Physiotherapists of British Columbia in June 2019 prohibited Witvoet from treating female patients pending the completion of its regulatory investigation. With sentencing complete, the college will conclude its regulatory process with results to be published on its website.

Since B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix announced on June 30 that his government would start accepting these plans, 61 of the 681 homes in the province have submitted them, he said July 9. He did not elaborate on how many of the plans would be approved.

article continues below

Homes that have approved plans could start allowing visitors into the facilities as early as next week.

The breakdown of seniors' homes with plans submitted to the government, by health region, is:

• 3 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 18 in Fraser Health;

• 18 in Island Health;

• 4 in Interior Health; and

• 18 in Northern Health.

Initial provincial restrictions on visits include that they will happen with each resident having a single designated visitor, that each visitor and resident would go to a designated place within the care home and that both vistor and resident would wear protective equipment.

""Keeping people safe in those communal-living environments is incredibly important,"" provincial health officer Bonnie Henry said July 9.

""Visiting is an important part of what we need to do to keep the mental health as well as the physical health of our seniors in care, however it needs to be done in a measured fashion so that we're not introducing this virus into a care home again.""

Dix on June 30 announced $165 million in new funding for up to three new full-time staff per home to oversee the visits and train visitors on how to wear protective equipment. He also announced that the government would provide a total of $26.5 million to care home operators to subsidize them for extra costs endured during the pandemic, including such items as hand sanitizer and masks.

The plan to allow visitors in B.C. care homes is contingent on the province continuing to record a relatively low number of new COVID-19 cases.

Henry said July 9 that the province had identified 20 new infections in the past 24 hours, for a total of 3,028 cases since infections were first recorded in the province in late January.

The province tweaked its system of reporting where in the province cases have been recorded to separate cases of people whose residence is outside Canada.

The new breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 982 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1596 in Fraser Health;

• 133 in Island Health;

• 201 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 51 people who reside outside Canada.

There were no new deaths in the past day, meaning that B.C.'s death toll from the virus that has caused a global pandemic remains at 186. Of the 175 people actively fighting off the disease, 17 are in hospital, with four of those in intensive care. The rest are self-isolating at home.

More than 88% of those infected in the province, or 2,667, have recovered.

Bacon pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to murder Corey Lal in the so-called Surrey Six case.

article continues below

He also pleaded guilty to one count of counselling to commit murder in a separate case involving the shooting of a man who survived an attack on Dec. 31, 2008.

Sentencing has been tentatively scheduled for July 23 when victim impact statements will be heard by the court.

Court heard a joint sentencing submission that includes 18 years for conspiracy to murder and 10 years for counselling to commit murder to be served concurrently.

Outside court, defence lawyer Kevin Westell said if the sentencing submission is accepted, Bacon is looking at an additional five to six years in prison after time served is taken into account.

""This has been a long, deliberative process of coming to the right agreement with the Crown,"" he said. ""We've come to a resolution that's principled and that's appropriate from all sides.""

Bacon was also charged with one count of first-degree murder in the Surrey Six case, but only pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge as part of a plea deal. Court heard the murder charge will be stayed at the sentencing hearing.

Police have said four of the victims were targeted but Chris Mohan, who lived on the floor where the killings occurred, and Ed Schellenberg, a maintenance worker, were in the wrong place at the wrong time.

Eileen Mohan said outside court that she would like to see Bacon serve at least 12 years for his part in the Surrey Six case.

""It breaks my heart,"" she said when asked about the possibility Bacon could be free in five or six years.

""This crime came to my doorstep. We didn't go to it, and this crime dictated my son's life that he's buried and dead now, and it's dictating our lives for the last 13 years. That has to be considered.""

Mohan said she will deliver a victim impact statement in person at the sentencing hearing.

""I will have my day in court with him,"" she said.

""Six people's lives meant something to this country and to the laws of Canada.""

It's yet to be determined whether Bacon will appear at the sentencing in person or via video link due to restrictions aimed at stopping the spread of COVID-19.

In court documents, the Crown alleges that at the time of the murders Bacon was a leader of the Red Scorpions gang.

The officer in charge of the investigation previously told the court it was one of the largest and most complex investigations that police have undertaken in the province. By November 2016, about 1,300 officers had been involved in the investigation.

In 2014, two men were convicted of six counts of first-degree murder in the Surrey Six case.

“I wanted to do something creative that day (March 23) to fill the void that the (Gateway) show would have. So, I decided to do it to honour the fact that I was supposed to start rehearsal that day,” explained Jason Sakaki, a Steveston resident and McMath secondary grad.

Gateway Theatre’s production, From Alaska, was cancelled earlier this month due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Sakaki added, “(I didn’t) think it would pick up so much traction with many people being super invested in the show,” which was staged in every room in his house to give the impression of set changes.

Jason Sakaki took to Instagram for a one-man live stream of Les Miserables. Photo: Video screenshot

Sakaki’s choice of Les Miserables was no coincidence.

Les Miserables is a story about people going through a difficult time, similar to what Richmond and the world is going through today, he explained.

“We’re in this time of ‘what’s happening next’ and no one really knows. Even though the musical takes place in the 1800s, it’s completely relevant to what we’re experiencing right now,” Sakaki added.

Like many residents, the pandemic is affecting Sakaki as a performing artist financially, but the fear of the community turning away from theatre frightens him even more.

“It’s a little bit unsettling for actors because we don’t know when it’s going to end. Since we will not be able to get back to work until it’s fully over. That’s the scary thing right now I think,” said Sakaki.

“What we’re a little scared about is when we come back, are people going to come back to theatres and so … we want to keep them interested in what we’re doing.”

Sakaki will be hosting another one-man production of Beauty and the Beast on April 3 at 7 p.m. on Instagram @jasonsakaki.

The choir will also be creating new video content from its albums, pairing its music with artwork from local artists in an effort to reach out and help all artists as much as it can at a time that’s challenging the entire arts and cultural sector.

The livestream will also include a weekly guest – a locally or internationally recognized music luminary, with an interview and video.

Viewers will also be able to interact within the live comments section.

Lichte underscored the importance of choral music, especially at this time of global uncertainty.

“I believe that choral music has a unique healing quality,” he said in a press release. “It can offer serenity, beauty and can connect with people in ways I don’t even understand. We want to pair this music power with the fun wrapping of a show in a way that is very Chor Leoni.

“Choral music is, for me, the ultimate way in which people can come together. This show won’t replace the community we share as a choir and with our audience, but hopefully it will move us from our current reality to the day we can again bring our voices together and they can be heard.”

For the April 1 livestream, the guest is conductor Ethan Sperry, talking about Translations, his new recording of the works of Latvian composer Eriks Esenvalds on the Naxos label.

The show will also premiere the first video for the album’s recording of Esenvalds’ In Paradisum, paired in video with paintings by renowned Vancouver artist Tiko Kerr.

Virtually.

article continues below

Thursday, the BCHL launched a simulation — created in the EA Sports video game NHL2020 — of the rest of the league’s playoff series that were cancelled March 13, just as the second round of the post-season was set to begin.

A player representative from each of the eight teams remaining in the playoff tourney is handling the game controls in a head-to-head match-up against their second-round opponent, with a two-minute highlight reel — complete with commentary by the teams’ broadcasters — posted to the league website.

“We were looking for a way to keep fans engaged during this unfortunate downtime,” BCHL commissioner Chris Hebb said in a press release. “We’ve tried to make it a fun and unique BCHL experience for everyone to enjoy.”

The initiative sprang from a project by the former director of communications for the Express, Jacob Lazare. Bored and restless after the team dispatched the Langley Rivermen from the playoffs’ first round in four straight games and were awaiting the start of the second round, he put together a simulation of a series between Coquitlam and the Surrey Eagles, who took seven games to defeat the Chilliwack Chiefs.

Lazare said he was able to use the video game’s various customization features to recreate the rosters of the two rivals, ranking each player’s attributes and tendencies, like their skating ability, speed, puck-handling skills and physicality, on a scale from zero to 99.

“You can go through and create a player that mimics the actual players realistically,” Lazare told The Tri-City News, adding he can set a dazzling skater like Massimo Rizzo to weave around defenders and a skilled stickman like defender Drew Cooper to repel onrushing forwards one-on-one.

While his own knowledge of the Express gleaned from running the team’s video camera during games helped him build Coquitlam’s digital doppelgänger, Lazare reached out to contacts at the Eagles to inform his recreations of Surrey’s players.

The effort was an amusing distraction that got some attention on social media.

But when the actual series, and the rest of the season, was scrubbed because of the pandemic, the league reached out to spin his effort into a virtual march to the Fred Page Cup championship.

Lazare said it takes him a couple of hours to handicap all the players for each team, and additional time to create facsimiles of the uniforms and match headshots with the game’s graphics.

“It’s just to make it so fans can recognize their teams’ players,” he said of the laborious attention to detail.

Lazare lamented, however, that limitations in the game don’t allow him to recreate the cozy confines of BCHL arenas, so the virtual players are battling in front of likely the biggest crowds they’ve ever experienced, even if they’re comprised entirely of pixels.

Lazare said having actual players contest the rest of the playoffs, albeit with the help of the game’s artificial intelligence, adds an extra wrinkle of unpredictability, which is part of the fun.

“Somebody is able to win it for their team,” he said. “There can be upsets involved.”

The first series, contested between Express goalie Joe Howe and Hassan Akl of the Surrey Eagles, is already decided, with the three remaining series to be posted in the coming days. The third round of the playoff simulation commences next week.",[]

Tuesday, Batchelor put out the call to fans and his followers for random videos to which he would apply his vocal talents.

“I'm bored,” he said, adding he’ll do three such play-by-play calls a day.

HIs first three calls were a golfer at the driving range, a cat losing its mind in a cardboard box and a couple of pillow fighters blinded by hoods pulled over their faces.

“Keep ’em coming,” Batchelor said afterward.

Batchelor has been the Canucks’ play-by-play man since 2017 after several years calling Vancouver Giants games.

The Dr. Charles Best secondary school grad said he honed his commentary chops calling goals and assists while playing road hockey in the driveway of his parents’ home on Harbour Drive, playing table hockey in the basement and video games.

“I was huge into hockey,” Batchelor told The Tri-City News.

To fulfill his dream of announcing the sport, Batchelor studied broadcasting at BCIT and volunteered doing public address announcements for the Burnaby Express of the BC Hockey League (BCHL), then followed the team when it returned to Coquitlam.

In 2012, Batchelor became the broadcaster for the BCHL’s Surrey Eagles, then graduated to the Giants and the Western Hockey League the next year.

His Twitter project follows the lead of another social media effort by Port Moody’s Al Murdoch, the Canucks’ public address announcer. He has been taking requests to call goals and assists for the team’s fans and minor hockey players, posting one a day for his followers.

Murdoch said he launched the initiative because he missed doing the announcements at Rogers Arena, especially as the Canucks were in the thick of the playoff race before the season was abruptly suspended March 12.

He said he also wanted to help lift spirits at a time when everyone is anxious about the pandemic and its mounting economic and societal consequences.

His idea has since been picked up by other announcers, including Mike Ross of the Toronto Maple Leafs and the New Jersey Devils' goal and assist caller, Kevin Clark.

The Church also wants to reach out and be a contributing part of the larger Vancouver community.

""We want to be able to impact our world,"" says Ashia Lennon, a pastoral intern and assistant director of the OAC Kids' Day Camp, ""We live here, so we want to contribute positively and help Vancouver grow.”

Part of its sense of community is portrayed through some of OAC's programs, such as the Think Green supper.

""Every month,"" Ashia explains, ""we host Think Green. It's a vegan supper and it gives our Church family the opportunity to experience community by sharing a meal while learning how to make healthy vegan dishes.""

The program has proved so popular that the 75 seats fill up quickly with a waiting list of more than 50 people.

""Each month has a different theme,"" Ashia says. ""One month it was vegan pizza, another had a Mexican theme and so on. We make the food, we go through the ingredients and we teach you how to remake the meal at home. Then you have the amazing opportunity to eat it all!""

Another community building program is the Deeper Roots Community Garden. Located right at the front of the building, the Deeper Roots Community Garden was initiated by a pastor on the recommendation of a Church member.

""A member of our Church family had set up a garden in front of his home,"" Ashia explains, ""He was able to connect with so many people in his community. We applied for some government funds along with donations from our Church family and we built ten plant boxes. It looks amazing – all green and lush. We have benches out there on which people can sit and check out what other people are growing.""

Relaxing on the benches isn't limited to Church members.

""We have lots of non-Church members stop by,” says Ashia. “We have some older people in our local community come by and sit, for example—it helps them feel less isolated and more a part of what's going on.”

At OAC, it’s about being a viable part of the local community.

“And things like the community garden and offering affordable daycare through the OAC Kids' Day Camp help us do that,"" says Ashia.

The notion of establishing a framework to commercialize cannabis began as a promise by the Liberal Party in the 2015 federal election campaign that led to Justin Trudeau becoming prime minister. The implementation of the policy was not as smooth as first envisioned, and the provincial governments were put in charge of setting guidelines for the sale and consumption of marijuana.

article continues below

Research Co. and Glacier Media have been tracking perceptions about legalization every six months in British Columbia. Our latest survey shows that agreement with the new rules remains high across the entire province, that some residents are starting to ponder a future when other drugs could be treated in the same fashion as cannabis, and that – in stark contrast with what we found last year – marijuana users in British Columbia are starting to acquire all of their product through licensed retailers.

As more time passes, British Columbians appear happier with the decision to end prohibition. Seven in 10 of the province’s residents (70%) agree with marijuana being legal in Canada, while 26% disagree and 3% are undecided.

These findings represent a seven-point increase since a similar survey conducted in October 2019, as legal cannabis approached its first anniversary. The groups that are more likely to voice satisfaction with the new status quo are men (75%), British Columbians aged 35 to 54 (76%) and residents of northern B.C. (80%).

In recent weeks, we have seen more talk about creating a safe supply for drugs that are currently available only through illegal means. The impact of these discussions has led to a shift in the views of British Columbians about legalizing all drugs. It must be completely acknowledged that sizable majorities of the province’s residents continue to oppose a move to place any controlled substance inside a store, but the proponents of this option have grown since late last year.

At least two-thirds of British Columbians are opposed to legalizing ecstasy (66%), powder cocaine (70%), heroin (72%), crack cocaine (73%), methamphetamine or “crystal meth” (74%) and fentanyl (75%).

Support for making some of these drugs available in a fashion that would conceivably meet the same guidelines that govern cannabis has risen over the past six months, to 25% for cocaine (up from 18%) and to 24% for heroin (up from 19%). While these are still low proportions, the fluctuation could signal the start of a trend.

Just 10% of British Columbians say they only consumed marijuana after it became legal. Identical proportions of residents tried it before October 2018 (45%) or have never consumed it in Canada (also 45%). The incidence of “legal-only” marijuana users is highest among residents aged 18 to 34 (18%) and those who live in southern B.C. (19%).

But perhaps the biggest surprise, and a source of satisfaction for policy makers, is the way in which cannabis is being sought by users. Just over half of British Columbians who have consumed marijuana since legalization (51%) say that all of their product was acquired at a licensed retailer. In October 2019, only 31% of cannabis consumers in the province were getting all of their product at a licensed retailer.

We still see 16% of British Columbians who say none of their marijuana has been bought at a licensed retailer – a proportion that climbs to 25% among those aged 55 and over. Two-thirds of cannabis consumers aged 35 to 54 (68%) are buying all of their product at a licensed retailer.

Even though the delivery of cannabis products has improved over the past six months, there are significant regional differences that are indubitably related to the presence of stores in specific areas of the province. Cannabis consumers who reside in southern B.C. and Metro Vancouver are the most likely to be getting all of their product from licensed retailers (63% and 62%). The numbers are significantly lower in Vancouver Island (29%), northern B.C. (24%) and the Fraser Valley (19%).

Finally, the issue of “drug testing” remains a priority for British Columbians, with 61% saying that companies in the province should “definitely” or “probably” be able to administer these examinations to any employee now that marijuana is legal.

After a bumpy start that featured slow store openings and hitches with delivery options, there are signs that cannabis legalization is starting to work in a better fashion. More consumers are getting all of their product through licensed retailers, and the number of “new users” has not increased dramatically. Still, the significant regional disparities suggest that more marijuana outlets will need to be authorized in order to effectively eliminate the black market.

No example is better than the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks in the United States, which gave us the “Patriot Act” after just 45 days of deliberation to expand government surveillance of Americans to previously unimagined levels.

In mid-April, the actions of Gabriel Wortman led to the deaths of 22 people in Nova Scotia after multiple shootings and fires. Most Canadians, at the time still under lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, were horrified at Wortman’s actions, which included impersonating a police officer.

article continues below

It took the federal government only 13 days after Wortman’s criminal activity was evident for the entire country to announce a nationwide ban on 1,500 types of military-grade “assault-style” weapons in Canada. Any Canadian who possesses these firearms will have two years to get rid of them. The prohibition led to many new discussions about the role that firearms play in Canada’s urban and rural areas.

We know now that the perpetrator of the 22 murders in Nova Scotia had obtained his weapons illegally from Canadian and American sources. This was not a surprise for Canadian authorities, who have consistently reported that more than 70% of the weapons used in gun-related crimes in our country come from the United States.

On the issue of firearms, Canada is decidedly different from the United States. In Canada, it is not legal for a person to own or carry a firearm for the purpose of self defence against human beings. When Research Co. and Glacier Media asked Canadians about this key precept of Canadian law, more than three in four (77%) agreed with it, while 18% disagreed and 5% were undecided.

Atlantic Canada (31%), Saskatchewan and Manitoba (29%) and Alberta (24%) boast the highest number of residents who openly question Canada’s long-standing regulations for firearms. While higher than what is observed in Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia, these are not proportions of voters that would sway an election, certainly not in the way American statewide and congressional races can be tilted if your candidate can adequately hold a shotgun and recite the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution in a manner that panders to the base.

Fewer than one in five Canadians welcome the notion of citizens carrying firearms for something other than hunting or scaring wildlife away. Any survey measuring opinions on banning “assault-style” weapons would be met with near unanimity. The opposition reacted to the announced ban as it always has under its outgoing leader, by claiming the regulations would affect law-abiding Canadians. Lost in this unfortunate combination of inadequate polling and incapable opposition are the solutions that matter to Canadians.

In our survey, more than three in five Canadians (63%) told us that gun violence in Canada is a “very serious” or “moderately serious” problem – a proportion that climbs to 69% among women and 68% among those aged 55 and over.

Sizable majorities of Ontarians and British Columbians, who have experienced gang wars in urban areas, are more likely to look at gun violence as particularly problematic (76% and 67%, respectively). The COVID-19 pandemic did little to curb gun violence in Toronto, where 61 people were shot in the first four months of the year.

We asked Canadians about the effectiveness of four possible measures, and their responses outline a public that is ready for bold action. More than three in five Canadians (62%) think enacting a complete ban on handguns would be “very effective” or “moderately effective” in reducing gun violence in Canada. Most crimes, after all, are not being committed with the military-grade “assault-style” weapons that the federal government was quick to ban.

A higher proportion of Canadians deem two other measures as effective: imposing mandatory jail terms for crimes committed with firearms (74%) and introducing new outreach programs to steer youth away from gangs (also 74%).

Canadians place dealing with firearms smuggled from the United States as the most important issue that needs to be addressed. Many of the country’s residents also want to make sure gangs are not attractive to our country’s youth and believe mandatory minimum jail sentences would act as a deterrent.

Banning military-grade “assault-style” weapons is low-hanging fruit in a challenge that definitely has Canadians preoccupied and wishing for a type of government intervention that goes beyond a photo-op celebrated by poorly executed survey charity work.

True sociologists know that we learn nothing from posing the wrong questions to Canadians, and capable politicians should go beyond voicing displeasure with plans and proposals just because that is what they are expected to do. Meanwhile, Canadians are still worried about gun violence and expecting their elected officials to do better. •

The COVID-19 pandemic did little to curb gun violence in Toronto, where 61 people were shot in the first four months of the year.

We asked Canadians about the effectiveness of four possible measures, and their responses outline a public that is ready for bold action. More than three in five Canadians (62%) think enacting a complete ban on handguns would be “very effective” or “moderately effective” in reducing gun violence in Canada. Most crimes, after all, are not being committed with the military-grade “assault-style” weapons that the federal government was quick to ban.

A higher proportion of Canadians deem two other measures as effective: imposing mandatory jail terms for crimes committed with firearms (74%) and introducing new outreach programs to steer youth away from gangs (also 74%).

Canadians place dealing with firearms smuggled from the United States as the most important issue that needs to be addressed. Many of the country’s residents also want to make sure gangs are not attractive to our country’s youth and believe mandatory minimum jail sentences would act as a deterrent.

Banning military-grade “assault-style” weapons is low-hanging fruit in a challenge that definitely has Canadians preoccupied and wishing for a type of government intervention that goes beyond a photo-op celebrated by poorly executed survey charity work.

True sociologists know that we learn nothing from posing the wrong questions to Canadians, and capable politicians should go beyond voicing displeasure with plans and proposals just because that is what they are expected to do. Meanwhile, Canadians are still worried about gun violence and expecting their elected officials to do better. •

This year’s presidential campaign in the United States will be very different from the ones of elections past, with the COVID-19 pandemic affecting public gatherings, events and conventions.

Research Co. has been tracking this democratic process, and some themes are starting to emerge. The last presidential contest that saw an incumbent seek a new term took place in 2012, when Democrat Barack Obama ultimately defeated Republican Mitt Romney. I had the privilege of following that election from start to finish, and there are many differences between what we saw eight years ago and the mood of Americans in 2020.

In July 2012, there was no clear frontrunner in the race for the White House. Obama and Romney were supported by 47% of decided voters across the United States, with Independents barely breaking in favour of the incumbent president. Obama could count on the votes of most women and young voters, while Romney connected well with men and older voters.

This year, the situation is dissimilar. Trump, the Republican incumbent, sits 10 points behind prospective Democratic Party nominee Joe Biden at the national level. Across the country, in a survey that was completed before the Independence Day celebrations, 53% of decided voters said they would cast a ballot for Biden, while 43% would support Trump.

Independents, who backed Trump over Hillary Clinton in 2016, are no longer happy with the president. In this crucial group, Biden is ahead of Trump by 15 points (54% to 39%). Unless the numbers tighten among American voters who do not align themselves with the Democrats or the Republicans, Trump’s chances will fade.

In our tracking, Trump’s approval rating dropped to 40% this month, down six points since we checked in early June, well into the COVID-19 pandemic but before the protests about racial equality dominated media coverage. An approval rating hovering around 50% is usually an indicator of a lost election for an incumbent president. Trump is significantly below this threshold right now.

Trump’s approval rating is particularly bad with African Americans (21%) and Latino and Hispanic Americans (32%). These two groups are usually supportive of Democrats, so the results are not earth-shattering. Still, his numbers also fell to 46% among White Americans.

When we asked Americans to select six words out of a list of 18 to describe Trump, almost three in five selected “arrogant” (57%). Of the six words chosen, the only one that is remotely positive is “strong” (36%). More than a third of Americans perceive their current head of state as “dishonest” (40%), “uncaring” (39%), “foolish” (also 39%) and “out of touch” (34%).

This does not mean that Americans are enthralled by Biden. When we pose the same question about the prospective Democratic Party nominee, about three in 10 Americans describe him as “intelligent” (32%), “compassionate” (also 32%), “down to earth” (30%), “honest” (28%), “weak” (28%) and “out of touch” (28%).

We could look at Biden’s results as superior to Trump’s, since only one of the six words is overly negative (“weak.”) These numbers are very different from what Barack Obama and Mitt Romney posted in July 2012.

At that time, 50% of Americans regarded Obama as “intelligent” and 46% felt the same way about Romney. In an exceedingly polarized nation, the numbers on this indicator are significantly lower for both Biden (32%) and Trump (31%).

Right now, Biden is clearly favoured at the national level, but we still need to look into the way specific American states will behave. The Democrats hope to win the three jurisdictions that took Trump to the White House (Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin) and perhaps make inroads in Florida and Ohio.

No election is decided four months in advance. In any case, three indicators point to Biden enjoying unique advantages in 2020: Trump’s weak approval rating, reminiscent of what Jimmy Carter and George H. W. Bush posted in 1976 and 1992, his difficulties in reconnecting with Independents, and a lower proportion of voters willing to cast a ballot for a third-party candidate.

In 2016, almost 6% of all cast ballots in the American presidential election went to third-party candidates, most notably Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party and Jill Stein of the Green Party. This year, Americans are not looking at third parties as much as they were four years ago, with only 3% selecting Libertarian Jo Jorgensen or “some other candidate.” However, we collected our data before a man called Kanye Omari West flirted with becoming the Ross Perot of the 21st Century.

Given that B.C. has an estimated population of about 5,190,000 people, that translates into one case for every 1,735 residents, or 0.579 people per 1,000 residents. That compares with Washington State's estimated population of 7,615,000 people and 37,491 cases, for about one case of COVID-19 for every 203 people, or 4.92 people per 1,000 residents.

Three people in B.C. have died in the past day from the virus that spawned a global pandemic, making the death toll in the province now 186. Of the 162 people actively fighting off the disease, 17 are in hospital, with three of those in intensive care. The rest are self-isolating at home.

More than 88% of those infected in the province, or 2,660, have recovered.

""While there are no active community outbreaks in B.C., new cases and community exposure events continue to occur in the community,"" Health Minister Adrian Dix and provincial health officer Bonnie Henry said in a joint statement.

The two acknowledged that there has been a second case of exposure to the virus in a strip club – at the No. 5 Orange bar on Main Street. That is the second instance of exposure at a strip club, following one at Brandi's Exotic Show Lounge on Hornby Street in late June.

Public health teams have issued an alert for anyone who may have been at the No. 5 Orange on July 1.

""If you have been at a location with a community exposure event, monitor yourself for symptoms, limit your contact with others and contact 811 to arrange for testing if any symptoms develop,"" Dix and Henry said. ""Contact tracing to contain the spread of COVID-19 requires all of our involvement to be successful.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,018 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,589 in Fraser Health;

• 133 in Island Health;

• 203 in Interior Health; and

• 65 in Northern Health.

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreaks at Tabor and at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred to those homes from the hospital. The outbreak at the Tabor long-term care home was declared over on July 7.

""Fewer faces, bigger spaces is the safest approach, because we know crowded, closed spaces where people may be in close contact with each other are higher-risk environments for all of us and need to be avoided at this time,"" said Henry and Dix.

We have seen countless televised messages from elected politicians, as well as heated discussions about the proper use of masks. As we enter a very different summer, Research Co. and Glacier Media tracked the views of Canadians on political and behavioural matters.

The one consistent finding throughout the pandemic has been the high level of satisfaction that Canadians express toward the federal government. In our latest survey, 70% of Canadians are happy with how Ottawa has dealt with the COVID-19 outbreak, practically unchanged since we last asked in May (69%).

article continues below

The rating for provincial governments and municipal governments improved as more Canadians were able to leave the isolation pod. Three in four Canadians (75%, up 11 points since May) are satisfied with their provincial administration, and seven in 10 (70%) feel the same way about their local government.

The big jump for provincial governments was not uniform across the country. In Atlantic Canada and British Columbia, satisfaction reaches 86% and 83%, with positive perceptions increasing by 19 points and 14 points, respectively.

Two other areas experienced double digit rises in satisfaction: Saskatchewan and Manitoba (78%, up 19 points) and Ontario (76%, up 23 points). The lowest ratings are observed in Quebec (69%, up three points) and Alberta (62%, up six points). Quebec had the highest level of satisfaction when we started asking this question in March; Alberta has consistently been at the bottom.

On the behavioural side of things, there are some remarkable changes in the way Canadians are approaching the pandemic. Time and reassurance have made many residents feel safer about take-out and delivery. In April, 40% of Canadians said they were not ordering food because they feared infection. The proportion has dropped to 23%, in what will surely be welcome news to an industry that has been greatly affected by the pandemic.

Three in 10 Canadians admit to overeating, unchanged since April. There is an increase in consumption of alcohol at home (18%, up five points) and a steadier curve on losing our tempers more often (16%, down two points).

Throughout the pandemic, the gender gap on some questions related to safe practices has been staggering. This time, it is evident on two questions. Fewer Canadians (40%, down seven points) are cleaning the groceries they buy to prevent infection. While only 36% of men are sanitizing the provisions they buy, the proportion jumps to 44% among women.

Still, the biggest behavioural change is on our faces. Back in April, only 14% of Canadians said they wore a protective mask every time they went out. This time, practically half of Canadians (48%) are not leaving home without them. Regionally, Ontarians are leading the way in wearing masks (63%), followed by Albertans at 51%. The proportion is slightly lower in Quebec and British Columbia (each at 48%).

Again, women are being more meticulous. Most female respondents (57%) say they are wearing masks outside, while only 39% of male respondents report the same behaviour. There is also a generational gap, with more than half of Canadians aged 18 to 34 (55%) always bringing their masks, compared with 46% for those aged 35 to 54 and 44% among those aged 55 and over.

Mask or no mask, Canadians appear resigned to staying close to home and avoiding big crowds. Only 11% of Canadians expect to be able to travel abroad before the end of September, while a similar proportion (12%) believe they will be able to go to a live sporting event. There is slightly more hope about attending or hosting a large social gathering at some point before Labour Day (21%).

More than a third of Canadians think the calendar will hit December before they take a trip abroad (39%), witness a live sporting event (35%) or go to a large party (also 35%). In a sign of the difficulty of issuing any kind of forecast during the pandemic, the proportion of undecided respondents is high on all three options.

Even the seemingly simple task of shaking the hand of a person who is not at our home appears distant, with 20% of Canadians expecting to do this before September, and 29% foreseeing it perhaps as a Christmas miracle. In addition, three in four Canadians (75%) say they will “definitely” or “probably” take a vaccine against COVID-19 is one ultimately becomes available, up two points since April.

Even if the future seems bleak, Canadians are more optimistic now. In March, only 22% were willing to say that the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic was “behind us.” The proportion barely moved to 24% in May, but reached 49% at the end of June. Oddly enough, Quebecers (57%) and Ontarians (49%) are more enthusiastic about the corner being turned than those in two large provinces that have fewer COVID-19 cases: Alberta (44%) and British Columbia (39%). •

Seemed odd at the time, considering the mayor a few months previous supported an 8.2% tax hike going into council’s 2020 budget deliberations; council ultimately agreed on 7%.

article continues below

But, as regular readers will recall, Stewart had an explanation for what seemed like an about-face on his property tax stance.

“Well, when budgets come out, I like to support staff,” he said in response to a question from Coun. Sarah Kirby-Yung in February. “And so I have each year said that I support the staff’s initial recommendations, but then listen to council debates and make my final vote accordingly. So in this case, however, I think going through two years of this [debate] that an early cap is important.”

A couple weeks later, council went at it again over the mayor’s motion and eventually landed on directing staff to report back on a 5% scenario in time for a mid-year update on what the budget looks like for 2021.

Then the world turned upside down.

People continue to get sick with COVID-19 and die, people continue to lose their jobs and the City of Vancouver is still reeling from the pandemic’s effect, having for a stretch lost up to $5 million per week in revenues.

Now we’re in July and city staff has prepared that anticipated mid-year budget forecast. It goes before council next Wednesday.

The report runs 17 pages and is filled with numbers, percentages and scenarios, including what it would take to arrive at a 5% tax hike, even as the city grapples with its financial future.

Let’s take a look …

Off the top, a 5% increase would see the owner of a median single-family home assessed at $1.6 million pay another $146 in 2021. The owner of a median strata property assessed at $688,000 would be dinged another $64 in tax.

Those bills, of course, don’t include increases in utility fees, which are forecast to go up by six to 10%, according to the staff report.

For a 5% scenario to unfold, it would mean a $17 million gap would have to be filled. That $17 million, by the way, is equivalent to a 2% tax hike.

So that’s why staff has, so far, said a 7% increase is what makes more sense at this time, when considering fixed costs, collective agreements and infrastructure work for 2021.

Staff makes it clear that any budget adjustments must come from service areas that are funded by tax. And the biggest service areas are the police and fire departments.

A total of 78% of their budgets is funded by taxpayers. So it’s no surprise that cuts or delays to those departments’ budgets play a major part in arriving at the 5% tax hike scenario.

The police department would be hardest hit, with a $6 million budget decrease that would mean a delay in hiring 20 officers and 10 staff. The department would also have to hold off on replacing up to 55 positions left vacant from retirements.

The effect?

“Reductions would lead to slower response times to emergency calls, reduced service levels to citizens and businesses, limited ability to respond to non-emergency calls, greater risk of unsolved crimes and cases being lost in court and increased rate of officer burnout,” the report said.

The hit to fire and rescue services would be $3 million and mean no new hiring and a delay in hiring 25 new firefighters, which would “reduce the ability of the department to effectively respond to all incident types and lead to potential increased risk of delayed fire response.”

It would also mean a delay in hiring two new fire prevention staff, which would slow down the department’s efforts “to reduce the volume and severity of fire calls through targeted community risk reduction activities, especially in more marginalized communities in the Downtown Eastside and at single-room-occupancy hotels.”

Also on hold would be the hiring of an assistant chief and “lieutenant of diversity and outreach” positions to “build on culture and diversity, increase focus on critical social issues and expand efforts to attract and maintain a workforce that represents Vancouver.”

Other cuts or delays to people and projects would have to come in the parks department ($1.5 million), engineering and public works ($1.4 million), libraries ($1 million) and other service areas, including funding capital infrastructure.

Staff makes it clear these are just examples, but are placed against a backdrop of uncertainty, as the pandemic persists and economic forecasts remain fluid.

The mayor himself is worried that not all residents will be able to afford to pay their taxes this year or next. That includes owners of business properties, too.

So is a 5% tax-hike cap realistic in these times?

That question has become further unanswerable and complicated with movements to “defund police,” mounting evidence of a second wave of COVID-19 to come and more anticipated job loss.

The staff report also makes it clear that senior government support is needed to fully restart city operations and “is critical to the city’s recovery plans.”

Staff says the city is now looking at a $124 million revenue decline this year. More than 1,500 city workers remain laid off, pay cuts are still in effect and community centres remain closed, albeit two of them providing refuge for homeless people.

February, as all of us can agree, seems like such a long time ago.

Last year, when Research Co. and Glacier Media asked this question, there was near-total consensus about the flag, the Canadian Armed Forces and the domestic economy. Significantly fewer respondents felt great about the monarchy, Parliament and the justice system.

article continues below

One year later, after the COVID-19 pandemic altered the way we live and communicate, the perceptions on some on these institutions and features went through noticeable shifts. The biggest drop is observed on the Canadian economy, which went from making 80% of Canadians proud in 2019 to only 53% in 2020. This is not shocking, as economic activity slowed dramatically during the lockdown and the unemployment rate is now in double digits.

Two other items that are near the top in 2020 underwent double-digit declines from 2019: the Canadian Armed Forces (74%, down 15 points) and the Canadian flag (82%, down 11 points).

While 64% of Canadians admit that hockey makes them proud, this number represents an eight-point drop from 2019. It has been difficult to get as worked up about the national sport as last year, with leagues – professional, youth and beer – being forced to cancel or postpone contests.

Three in four Canadians (75%, down two points) say the health care system elicits feelings of pride. Quebec is partly responsible for this result. The province has traditionally been more critical about this feature of Canadian life than all others, and this year is no exception. While only 61% of Quebecers are proud of health care, the proportion in all other provinces and regions fluctuates between 79% and 81%.

A similar proportion of Canadians (66%) say they are proud of the state of democracy in Canada, down four points in a year. We went through a divisive federal election late last year, as the regional breakdowns outline. The two areas that elected the fewest Liberal Party candidates in last year’s election to the House of Commons are less likely to be satisfied: Saskatchewan and Manitoba at 63% and Alberta at 58%.

Once again, the lowest-rated item on our list is the monarchy, dropping seven points to reach 40% across the country. Quebec pushes the national average down (31%), while British Columbia emerges as the most monarchist province in Canada (50%).

Unless a vaccine against COVID-19 is found relatively quickly, we will not have any official visits from Royal Family members that could sway these numbers. We found out earlier this year that indifference towards the monarchy has risen across the country, and the prospect of Prince Charles becoming king is not particularly thrilling for many Canadians.

Still, not all institutions and features of the country fared worse this year than in 2019. More than half of Canadians say they are proud of the Canadian justice system (55%, up 15 points) and Parliament (53%, up eight points).

In the case of the legislative branch, Canadians who voted for the governing Liberal Party are more likely to feel proud (72%) than those who cast ballots for the Conservative Party (42%) and the New Democratic Party (NDP) (41%). This is not unforeseen. When I had the chance to ask this question during Stephen Harper’s tenure in Ottawa, Tory voters were consistently euphoric while Grit supporters were dismayed.

The past few months have brought a new emphasis on inclusivity and cultural sensitivity, especially in light of discussions related to racism and fairness. Seven in 10 Canadians (71%, up five points) say they are proud of multiculturalism, while more than three in five feel the same way about Indigenous culture (62%, up six points) and bilingualism (61%, up six points).

As expected, Quebec boasts the highest level of pride for bilingualism (71%). On Indigenous culture, pride reaches 67% in both British Columbia and Ontario. Multiculturalism is regarded positively by 77% of Canadians aged 18 to 34, but falls slightly to 70% among those aged 35 to 54 and to 66% among those aged 55 and over.

The differences between men and women are only sizable on three topics. Women are more like to feel pride in the health care system and multiculturalism (79% and 75% respectively) than men (70% and 66% respectively). Men switch on the monarchy, where 45% of female respondents are proud, but only 35% of male respondents join them.

The past 12 months were far from perfect, and the challenges are shown in the way Canadians are re-evaluating their relationship with what is supposed to define us. Our economy is no longer one of the top items on the list. The increases in pride for multiculturalism, Indigenous culture and bilingualism suggest that the country is growing fonder of what can be accomplished with consideration and an open mind.

While 21% of Canadians feel the environment is better now than it was six years ago, the proportion rises to 28% among those aged 18 to 34. Middle-aged and older voters are more skeptical about Ottawa’s policies on this file. Some would like to do more and others believe enough action has been taken already.

On this issue, party allegiance also plays a role south of the border. As Americans prepare for a presidential election that may lack the convention pageantry of the past, prospective Democratic Party nominee Joe Biden has his largest lead over incumbent Donald Trump on managing the environment. Almost half of Americans(46%) regard Biden as the best person candidate on this issue – a 20-point advantage over his Republican Party rival.

Earlier this month, we studied perceptions about climate change in Canada and the United States. Almost two-thirds of Canadians (64%) think global warming is a fact and is mostly caused by emissions from vehicles and industrial facilities. This represents a four-point increase since we last asked this question in July 2019, at the height of discussions about a “Green New Deal” before the federal election.

While 23% of Canadians believe global warming is a fact and mostly caused by natural changes, only 7% refer to it as a theory that has not yet been proven – a proportion that rises to 12% among those who voted for the Conservative Party last year.

In the United States, a smaller majority (53%) believe climate change is real and caused by emissions. The proportion of Americans who regard global warming as “natural changes” is similar to what we find in Canada (25%). Finally, 14% of Americans claim that climate change is an unproven theory – including 26% of Republican Party supporters.

A follow-up question provides a similar outcome, with 62% of Canadians and 51% of Americans branding climate change as a minor crisis. While 7% of Canadians and 16% of Americans think global warming is not a crisis at all, the numbers jump to 18% among federal Conservatives in Canada and 27% among Republicans in the United States.

In spite of the skepticism of these two well-defined groups, a countrywide consensus emerges on two possible ways forward. Large majorities of Canadians and Americans want companies and corporations (75% and 59% respectively), governments (69% and 56%), and individuals and consumers (64% and 55%) to do more in order to deal with issues related to climate change that are now happening or impacting people directly.

When asked about the consequences of climate change in the future, support is equally strong for decisive action from companies and corporations (76% in Canada and 61% in the United States), governments (71% and 58%), and individuals and consumers (66% and 55%).

When Canadians are asked about their willingness to pay higher taxes to adequately address seven specific issues, climate change is at the top of the list with 60%. Canadians are more reticent about higher taxes in order to address homelessness (55%), schools (also 55%), forest fires (53%), transit improvements (51%), housing improvements (50%) and floods (45%).

The way Americans perceive these fiscal choices is slightly different. In the United States, more residents are willing to pay higher taxes for schools (62%) and homelessness (58%). Climate change is ranked third on this list (54%), followed by forest fires (53%), transit improvements (52%), housing improvements (51%) and floods (47%).

There was an expectation that the actions of young environmental activists would be replicated inside North America’s homes. When parents are asked if their children’s lobbying efforts have been influential in some of their decisions, the numbers are similar in the two countries.

Majorities of parents (67% in Canada and 56% in the United States) say they have been compelled to recycle more because of conversations with their children. The level of effectiveness is lower on concerns such as driving less than usual (38% in Canada, 32% in the U.S.), taking shorter showers (34% in Canada, 31% in the U.S.) and reducing the consumption of meat (24% in the two countries).

The COVID-19 pandemic has not dented the desire of Canadians and Americans to deal with climate change, and their views are not particularly polarized. Most residents believe global warming is real, caused by humans, and a crisis, but American Republicans and Canadian Conservatives are more likely to be on the outside looking in.

Results are based on online studies conducted from June 1 to June 3, 2020, among representative samples of 1,000 adults Canada and the United States.

The COVID-19 pandemic compelled Canadians to figure out certain things that few of us had considered before.

For instance, two-thirds of provisional home workers in Canada (65%) told us that they want to continue working from home at least some days after their regular offices are available again. Most Canadians were also paying more attention to news and information, making changes to their exercise routines and acknowledging challenges with their diet.

As the lockdown lifts, we have a unique chance to study the intricacies of the Canadian household. The data collected by Research Co. and Glacier Media since March has shown remarkable gender gaps on issues such as the best moment to ease restrictions. This time, we wanted to take a look at how things are going inside the “confinement pod” for those who have lived through the lockdown with a spouse or partner.

At first glance, the findings point to a high level of satisfaction. Across the country, 46% of Canadians who live with their spouse or partner claim the COVID-19 pandemic made them grow closer to their significant other. A similar proportion (47%) report no change.

Only 6% of Canadians who are living with a spouse or partner disapprove of the performance of their significant other during the COVID-19 pandemic. This does not mean that the rating for our spouses or partners is close to perfect. While 69% of respondents “strongly approve,” 22% only “moderately approve.” This means that more than one in five Canadians are looking at their significant other across the room and thinking that an improvement would be welcome.

Gender and age decidedly play a role in the way we feel about our spouses or partners. Men are more likely to give an undisputed thumbs up (73%) than women (65%). While 85% of Canadians aged 55 and over “strongly approve” of their spouse or partner, the rating drops to 58% among those aged 35 to 54 and 56% among those aged 18 to 34.

Another key differentiator is how long a relationship has lasted. While the level of strong approval is 77% among those who have lived together for more than 10 years, it falls to 58% for those who have cohabited from six to 10 years and only 46% among those who have been together in the same household for five years or less.

Regionally, the pandemic seems to have led to more blissful couples in Manitoba and Saskatchewan (83%), Atlantic Canada (80%) and Alberta (75%). Three other provinces are below the 70% threshold on strongly approving of their spouse or partner: Ontario (66%), British Columbia (64%) and Quebec (also 64%).

We can see that there is some hesitation about providing perfect marks to a spouse or partner that – in most cases – we chose. The difference between men and women being “very satisfied” with their partner is minimal in these areas: taking care of pets (57% from men, 58% from women), overall attitude and demeanor (57% from men, 52% from women) and making decisions on what to do (56% from men, 50% from women).

The needle starts to move on two other issues: personal hygiene (72% from men, 66% from women) and providing emotional support when you need it (57% from men, 50% from women).

Women become decidedly more critical of men on the remaining three aspects tested. While 62% of men are “very satisfied” with their partner keeping the home clean and tidy, only 46% of women provide the same glowing marks. Similar fluctuations are observed on taking care of children (63% of men are “very satisfied”, compared with 46% of women) and cooking meals (64% of men are “very satisfied”, compared with 48% of women).

Few people can say they began 2020 expecting to spend most of their time at home, unable to go to the office, gyms or restaurants, and slowly welcoming other persons into their social circle in the summer. The COVID-19 pandemic compelled Canadian couples to rely on their spouse or partner in new ways.

While very few Canadians are voicing outright dissatisfaction with what they have witnessed from their spouse or partner in a time of crisis, there are some aspects – such as child rearing, meal preparation and cleanliness – where women have done better than men. A 17-point gender gap on satisfaction with “taking care of children” during the pandemic is not a great thing for Canada’s dads to find out right after Father’s Day. •

More specifically, the 11-member council will decide whether adults living in or visiting this city will be able to legally enjoy an alcoholic beverage in select public spaces — at least for the summer, and perhaps into early fall.

article continues below

If this seems like déjà vu all over again, it’s because it is.

Regular readers will recall that back on June 2, the council vote on this proposal ended in a 5-5 tie; Mayor Kennedy Stewart didn’t vote because he was on a scheduled leave of absence.

That meant the vote failed, which disappointed the mover of the motion, Green Party Coun. Pete Fry, and the four other councillors who supported the idea. Fry wanted to give those people who don’t have access to private green space a place to legally enjoy a drink.

The fact that adults can act responsibly in public spaces, as evidenced by residents’ buy-in to physical distancing measures during the pandemic, was driving his argument.

Five other councillors, led by the NPA, didn’t agree.

Since then, as I reported last week, NPA Coun. Lisa Dominato has had a change of heart. She has a motion going before council June 23 requesting reconsideration of that June 2 vote. She heard wide support from the public, she said, and it’s worth giving a pilot program a try.

That means a pilot could go ahead this summer, if the other councillors stick with their June 2 vote; the mayor’s vote, either way, would still give Fry and company a majority.

To be clear, such a pilot wouldn’t include beaches or parks. That’s something the park board continues to work on, and could be in place before the end of the summer.

Meanwhile, in a head scratcher of a move, two of Dominato’s NPA colleagues who also opposed Fry’s motion, are now interested in allowing adults to legally drink booze in public. Yes, you read that right.

But here’s the catch — not until next year.

And not without the democratic exercise that Vancouver apparently needs more of — good ole further consultation.

This council, you may have observed, doesn’t exactly move swiftly in making decisions.

Melissa De Genova and Sarah Kirby-Yung have drafted their own motion for next week’s meeting that reads, in part, that council direct staff to “explore and develop a strategy for public consumption of alcohol, in designated public spaces and places in the City of Vancouver, in collaboration and with input from Vancouver Coastal Health and the Vancouver Police Department, and to report back to council with recommendations no later than April 2021.”

That motion sort of falls in line with what both of them were saying during debate at the June 2 meeting that sunk Fry’s proposal.

Before I get to their comments from that meeting, I should mention De Genova successfully moved a motion in June 2019 to have city staff work with the Italian community to explore the creation of “an age-friendly ‘piazza’ pilot space in Vancouver.”

That space would include local artisans, restaurateurs, proprietors and vendors and allow for community-led events in a designated outdoor space “that also would include the responsible enjoyment of beer, wine and ‘appertivos’ along with food, and if possible to be implemented before the end of June 2020.”

De Genova got hung up on that motion in her vote June 2, stating that she was satisfied that city staff was still working on the piazza plan, and that there was no need to support Fry’s motion.

She was worried, too, about the lack of consultation around Fry’s motion, even though Fry requested staff consult with the Vancouver Police Department and business improvement associations before anything went ahead.

It should be noted council heard from Howard Chow, one of the VPD’s deputy chiefs, a week before the June 2 decision. Council also heard from Dr. Patricia Daly, the chief medical health officer for Vancouver Coastal Health.

Daly gave council an earful about her concerns related to increased alcoholism in B.C. Chow raised concerns about allowing more legal alcohol use in a city that already has its problems with impaired people.

What else De Genova and Kirby-Yung, who are both married to police officers, need to consult Daly and Chow about is unclear.

But here we are.

Here’s what De Genova said June 2: “There are certain ways that we can move forward with this in a responsible way. But we need to have that oversight with the Vancouver Police Department, with Vancouver Coastal Health. Also, I think there’s other organizations that don’t even know we’re talking about this. I think about Mothers Against Drunk Drivers, I think about other organizations and some implications that I haven’t maybe considered yet.”

Kirby-Yung: “Patty Daly was very clear when she said it couldn’t come at a worse time. We’re trying to support the restaurants and the businesses, we’re trying to really focus on what the core things are that the city needs to be doing [during the pandemic]. We’re asking a lot of our staff as it relates to COVID response and licensing, and I just think from a health perspective, it just goes against all the research we heard [from Daly].”

Added Kirby-Yung: “I’m not against responsible drinking, and I support it on the parks and beaches, but just not everywhere. Alcohol is not the answer to the pandemic. It’s just not. Those harms are just too significant to ignore and I think it’s going to bring a number of associated issues and additional expenses.”

Next Tuesday’s council meeting begins at 9:30 a.m.

But debate and decision around this issue will likely occur the next day.

Which, I’m sure, will take no time at all.

Note: De Genova has since reached out to me on Twitter with “corrections,” saying she and Kirby-Yung are requesting a bring-your-own-booze pilot this year, and that it will align with the city’s temporary patio program and that results of this pilot will “inform long-term strategy for next year.”

So, yes, I’m confused.

Here again is the first sentence in the motion: “That council direct staff to explore and develop a strategy for public consumption of alcohol, in designated public spaces and places in the City of Vancouver, in collaboration and with input from Vancouver Coastal Health and the Vancouver Police Department, and to report back to council with recommendations no later than April 2021.”

You can read the rest of the motion here, which contains some of what Fry initially requested in his motion along with amendments back in that June 2 vote, which again was shot down. As mentioned, I’m sure the debate next week over all this will take no time at all and exclude any partisanship.

We’re not seeing a political race here to own the legal public drinking file in Vancouver, are we readers?

Only a cynic would think that.

For more than five years, concerns about housing, homelessness and poverty dominated the issue landscape, with residents aged 18 to 34 and Metro Vancouverites being significantly more worried than their non-urban and older counterparts.

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the way we look at the challenges facing the province. British Columbians aged 55 and over are responsible for pushing health care to the top of the list of provincial concerns, while those aged 35 to 54 became increasingly troubled by economic matters. For those aged 18 to 34 and Metro Vancouverites, however, housing affordability remains the one issue that requires attention.

article continues below

In December 2019, most British Columbians endorsed the performance of the provincial government on housing. At the time, more than 70% of the province’s residents expressed some agreement with the fiscal policies designed and implemented by the BC New Democratic Party (NDP) administration, and 49% expected them to be “effective” in making housing more affordable.

Six months later, views on the taxes have not shifted drastically. Practically four in five British Columbians agree with the provincial government’s decision to increase the foreign buyer’s tax (79%) and expand it to areas located outside of Metro Vancouver (also 79%).

The introduction of a “speculation tax” in specific urban areas targeting foreign and domestic homeowners who pay little or no income tax in British Columbia, and those who own second properties that are not long-term rentals, is currently endorsed by 77% of residents.

Public support is also high for the introduction of a tax of 0.2% on the value of homes between $3 million and $4 million, and a tax rate of 0.4% on the portion of a home’s value that exceeds $4 million (76%) and an increase in the property transfer tax from 3% to 5% for homes valued at more than $3 million (72%). The 5% portion only applies to the value greater than $3 million.

There is movement on the perceptions of residents on what the taxes may ultimately accomplish. Across the province, 57% of British Columbians think the actions of the BC NDP government will be effective in making housing more affordable, an eight-point increase since last year.

Among British Columbians who voted for the BC Liberals in the 2017 provincial election, views of the government’s actions improved from 49% in December 2019 to 67% this month. These are remarkable numbers for one of the key policy planks that the opposition party focused on after the government transition, particularly in the Vancouver riding that is represented by BC Liberal leader Andrew Wilkinson. The proportion of British Columbians who are disappointed with how this issue has been handled has become smaller over time.

In spite of these figures, there are some fears that have been brought up by the COVID-19 pandemic. If real estate prices come down severely in British Columbia, the market may become too attractive for foreign buyers who will outbid young people trying to upgrade or simply attempting to get into the market.

There are some examples abroad on how to deal with this conundrum. New Zealand passed legislation that bans most foreigners from purchasing real estate in the country. There are exceptions for those who hold residency status in New Zealand, as well as citizens from Australia and Singapore, due to existing free trade agreements.

When British Columbians are asked about implementing a similar regulation across Canada, more than three in four (78%) are in favour of following New Zealand’s lead, while only 15% disagree and 7% are undecided.

Support for a new kind of legislation that would effectively forbid most non-Canadians from purchasing real estate is endorsed by sizable majorities across all demographics. The numbers climb markedly among men (80%), British Columbians aged 35 to 54 (88%) and residents of Vancouver Island (also 88%).

Once again, there is political consensus. While 73% of BC Green voters are in favour of a Canada-wide ban on foreigners owning real estate, the proportion jumps to 81% among BC Liberals and 87% among BC NDP voters.

The level of support for the provincial government’s taxes has been remarkably consistent over the past year. Still, this does not mean that the issue of housing affordability will be settled before the next provincial election rolls around. The provincial government will need to cut some ribbons in the next 16 months to show that its fiscal plans have actually been turned into housing units that local residents can enjoy.

Results are based on an online study conducted from June 13 to June 15, 2020, among 800 adults in British Columbia.

At the time, 30% of Canadians said they were exercising at home more often than before the COVID-19 pandemic, including 36% of British Columbians.

Changing our habits is usually difficult. The first days of the lockdown may have motivated Canadians to act differently, but new traits are hard to stick by. By mid-April, some confided about overeating (29%) and drinking too much alcohol (13%) during the pandemic.

Just last week, we talked about the appreciation of millennials for goods baked at home and saw 30% of Canadians acknowledge that they have gained weight during the COVID-19 pandemic. This time, our focus went back to exercise.

The Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines recommend that adults in Canada accumulate at least two and a half hours of moderate- to vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity per week. Across the country, more than a third of Canadians (36%) told us that they were able to meet this goal “every week” before the COVID-19 pandemic began, while 24% were able to do this “on most weeks.”

Almost two in five Canadians aged 18 to 34 (38%) and aged 35 to 54 (also 38%) claim to have met the desired exercise threshold every week earlier this year, along with 38% of Ontarians, 37% of Albertans and 36% of British Columbians.

What a difference a pandemic makes. With some adults working from home and taking care of children, and many gyms and fitness facilities closed or slowly reopening with limited time slots, the amount of calories burned across the country has dropped significantly. This month, only 29% of Canadians are exercising vigorously for two and a half hours each week, down seven points since the days when COVID-19 did not affect our plans.

The drop in exercise appears in all age groups, with millennials trying their best to maintain their exercise routines every week (34%, down four points). Generation X has been less successful (29%, down seven points). Baby boomers also plunged on this measurement, to 25% from 33%.

British Columbia shows a worrying fluctuation. Before March, only 19% of the province’s residents said they “never” met the desired threshold for vigorous exercise, tied for the lowest number in the country with Alberta. Now, almost three in 10 British Columbians (28%) have given up on exercising, the third highest level in the country after Atlantic Canada (33%) and Quebec (29%). Practically one of every 10 residents of B.C. – usually the fittest province – simply gave up on exercise.

The current state of affairs is forcing people to find new ways to work out. A few weeks, ago, 47% of British Columbians told us they would not go back to the gym without a vaccine for COVID-19 – a proportion that climbed to 54% among women.

In this latest poll, practically half of Canadians (49%) say their exercise routine has been affected by the pandemic. The biggest setback, affecting 33% of residents, is not being able to go to a gym or community centre. This is especially problematic for Canadians aged 18 to 34 (48%), as well as British Columbians and Ontarians (39% each).

There are other components of physical activity that we miss. One in five Canadians (21%) has stopped going to a pool for swimming, and smaller proportions are no longer participating in an organized sports league (15%), going to a yoga studio (13%) or playing pickup sports that are not part of a league (12%).

The confinement has made some Canadians more creative. One in four (25%) is following workouts or routines online, 17% decided to take up a sport that does not require equipment, 12% acquired weightlifting gear and 9% bought a cardio machine for their home, such as an elliptical, treadmill or climber.

The actions of Canadians are not uniform across the country. While 52% of Ontarians have chosen not to do anything new to get their workout fix, the proportion is higher in Alberta (54%), Quebec (56%) and British Columbia (61%).

The country is slowly reopening, with each province specifying the guidelines that will need to be followed to prevent a second wave of infection in the fall. The prospect of a summer with some form of outdoor activities remains alive, but organized sports and pickup games appear to be more of a risk. In any case, some Canadians are showing resilience in trying to recreate their gyms at home and figuring out ways to stay healthy. •

At the time, most residents believed governments should find a way to help restaurants, cafes, bars, retail outlets and boutiques affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

As British Columbia begins to reopen after the lockdown, we asked the province’s residents about their views on whether 10 different business sectors should be eligible for a government bailout in order to continue offering their services. Across the province, the highest level of support for government assistance is observed for agri-food companies (73%), individual municipalities (70%), retailers (67%) and news organizations (57%).

The federal government has been particularly active in supporting the agrifood industry, increasing the lending capacity of Farm Credit Canada by an additional $5 billion and launching a venture capital fund to help companies adapt to the challenges that lie ahead.

With two-thirds of British Columbians calling for financial assistance for retailers, the big question will be what to save and how. Before the pandemic, we had already seen corporations closing bricks-and-mortar stores and moving to an online model. Any additional assistance for retailers may have to focus more on avoiding layoffs and less in facilitating leases for large spaces.

On individual municipalities, there is a conundrum, as local governments are not allowed to run a deficit. In April, some mayors expressed satisfaction with the measures of the provincial government related to borrowing authority for local governments and tax deferrals for businesses. This, however, stopped short of being an actual bailout.

If the federal or provincial governments decided to take a different course of action to ensure that municipalities can meet the needs of residents, they would not face a political meltdown. Solid majorities of residents who voted for the BC Liberals (78%), the BC New Democratic Party (71%) and the BC Green Party (63%) in 2017 are in favour of bailing out individual municipalities.

The public is divided on some other components of the provincial economy. Just under half of British Columbians are in favour of allowing airlines (49%) and film and entertainment companies (45%) to be eligible for government bailouts.

Airlines appear to be the type of business that would benefit from federal action, especially as it has become patently evident that international tourism will not be coming back to British Columbia in its previous form any time soon. Help has been provided so far in an attempt to stave off job losses, but it has not been completely effective. Provinces are starting to reopen and will urge Canadians to act as international tourists this summer: visit restaurants, stay the night and spend on souvenirs. Domestic flights could take a prominent role if the push to restart economic activity embraces interprovincial tourism.

Regions of the province that are not touched as prominently by the film and entertainment industry are not as likely to support a bailout. But in Metro Vancouver, where productions were happening every day before the pandemic, half of residents (50%) are in favour of governmental financial assistance.

As was the case when we asked Metro Vancouverites in April, British Columbians are more likely to endorse a bailout of taxi companies (49%) than ride-hailing companies (39%). In both instances, men are more supportive of this course of action (53% for taxis and 48% for ride-hailers) than women (46% and 32% respectively).

Enacting a program to help a different component of the local economy appears to be more complicated. Across the province, 38% of residents think individual sports franchises should be eligible for a government bailout, and 34% would extend this possible benefit to professional sports leagues.

As British Columbia paces slowly to Phase 3 of the pandemic recovery, some sporting events are happening in other parts of the world, albeit without fans in the stands. Residents of this province do not currently perceive sports franchises and leagues as a priority that requires immediate attention.

As expected, there is a sizable gender gap on sports that is not present in other industries. While 46% of men would allow governments to buttress individual franchises, only 29% of women concur. Also, while 43% of male respondents think government funds should assist professional leagues, just 26% of their female counterparts agree.

There are also some nuances on all questions when it comes to age. British Columbians aged 55 and over are the least likely to support bailouts in the areas of transportation, information, entertainment and sports. There might be an ideological opposition to deficits from Baby Boomers, as well as growing concerns about present and future commitments.

Younger residents appear more optimistic. British Columbians aged 35 to 54 – with established careers and eager to return to life as it was before the pandemic – are more likely to want to save everything. B.C. residents aged 18 to 34 put news organizations ahead of sports leagues and franchises.

Canadians were told to stay at home as much as possible, minimize trips to grocery stores, sanitize everything and adapt how they prepare meals in their household. With 40% of Canadians saying in April that they were not ordering food from restaurants because of a fear of infection, figuring out what to make every night presented a new challenge.

article continues below

Research Co. and Glacier Media asked Canadians about what they are eating, how long it takes for them to make dinner and whether the isolation of the lockdown has forced them to reach for ampler clothes insider their closets.

Earlier this year, the federal government updated Canada’s Food Guide, a document that proposes ways for residents to achieve a healthy diet. Across the country, two-thirds of Canadians (66%) say they are “very familiar” or “moderately familiar” with Canada’s Food Guide, a proportion that jumps to 75% among women.

This high level of familiarity would suggest that Canadians are following the government’s recommended guidelines. But, as is often observed with bylaws related to bike helmets, pet waste or alcohol in parks, they are not being followed intently. Only 41% of Canadians say they follow the recommendations of Canada’s Food Guide “all the time” or “most of the time.”

Canadians who have decided to discard specific foods from their diet (such as vegans, vegetarians and pescatarians) are more likely to abide by the recommendations of the guide (62%) than those who can be described as omnivores (37%).

Nobody should attempt to blame younger generations for the demise of government-endorsed nutritional habits. Canadians aged 55 and over are the most likely to say they “never” follow the recommendations of Canada’s Food Guide (35%). The proportion of rejecters is lower among those aged 35 to 54 (28%) and those aged 18 to 34 (22%).

Aside from the fact that many Canadians are not following the guide, there are some shifts in what we are consuming during the pandemic. One in five Canadians (19%) report eating less fish and shellfish, and a slightly smaller proportion (15%) are eating less meat. In contrast, similar proportions of Canadians are adding more legumes (14%) and poultry (13%) to their diets.

Practically one in four Canadians (24%) say they are eating more fruits and vegetables than before the pandemic began, a proportion that includes three in 10 of those aged 18 to 34.

For the past several weeks, social media posts have been overloaded with pictures of people baking. Ingredients such as flour and yeast were in short supply at one point, and conversations that included the phrase “sourdough starter” multiplied. In our survey, one in five Canadians (21%) say they are baking bread more often at home, and three in 10 (29%) are baking more cookies and cakes than before the pandemic began.

Once again, millennials are leading the way, with 30% of Canadians aged 18 to 34 baking bread more and 39% indulging more often in homemade desserts.

In July 2019, we looked at how much time Canadians spent making dinner on an average weeknight. At the time, 30% of residents said they were done in less than 30 minutes, 60% devoted 31 to 60 minutes to prepare a meal and 10% took more than an hour to make dinner.

With fewer Canadians commuting and many working from home because of the pandemic, we could assume that more time would be spent learning about ingredients and partaking in more challenging recipes. This is not the case. The proportion of Canadians who prepare dinner on a weekday in less than half an hour increased by six points to 36%, and those who spend more than hour are down slightly to 8%.

The final question looked at the effect of the lockdown on our waistlines. Just over three in 10 Canadians (31%) confide that they have gained weight during the pandemic, while a majority (52%) report no change and 14% say they have lost weight.

Women (33%) and Canadians aged 18 to 34 (36%) are more likely to acknowledge that they have gained weight recently. Regionally, the numbers are highest in British Columbia (33%) and lowest in Ontario (29%).

The pandemic has showed some fluctuations in the behaviour of Canadians when it comes to food. While familiarity with Canada’s Food Guide is high, not many Canadians are looking at it when designing their meals. Even after spending all day at home, few Canadians are staying in the kitchen for more than one hour. •

Councillors say they are hearing that people want to be able to legally drink booze in public spaces and at beaches and parks.

article continues below

The argument is many residents don’t have access to personal outside spaces — yards and balconies — where they can safely and legally drink their own store-bought beer, or a glass of wine.

That reality, they say, has become more pronounced during the pandemic and physical distancing measures, with people shut in their homes for months.

The extension of that argument, which was articulated by some councillors Tuesday, was that not everyone has a budget that allows for expensive drinks on a restaurant patio.

There’s also the issue of people of colour more likely to be targeted for drinking a beer at the beach than a white guy like me, as was argued by Coun. Michael Wiebe and Will Shelling, a member of the equity and inclusion office at the University of B.C., who spoke to council.

“As a black man myself, I have accepted and faced a hard reality that I will face extra scrutiny when it comes to conduct in society,” Shelling told council by telephone.

“I’ve witnessed many of my peers imbibe responsibly but illegally on Vancouver’s beaches, but I’ve chosen not to because of the difficult reality of disproportionate rates of ticketing against black, Indigenous and other persons of colour.”

If all that information wasn’t enough to digest, there’s also the push from unlicensed cafes and restaurants for temporary licences to sell booze to help them recover — or attempt to recover — from the losses suffered from closures.

My thought, and maybe yours: Could not have predicted booze was going to be such a big topic for council during the pandemic, but here we are.

So what is council doing about all of this?

In no particular order, it said yes to unlicensed cafes and restaurants, no to drinking in public spaces and yes to booze in select parks and beaches.

But that last one about parks and beaches is not in council’s jurisdiction, with the park board scheduled to discuss the topic at next Monday’s board meeting.

So, you’re probably wondering, why did councillors spend the better part of Tuesday afternoon debating and amending amendments to the amendment, taking recesses over points of order and prattling on about allowing the legal consumption of alcohol at beaches and parks when it’s not in their jurisdiction?

Very good question, and one asked by Coun. Sarah Kirby-Yung, a former park board commissioner, at the end of the debate — not, sadly, at the beginning.

“What I really struggle with today, to be honest, is understanding why we are spending council time on something that’s not under the jurisdiction of Vancouver city council,” Kirby-Yung said.

“There are so many critical issues that we have across the city, whether it’s the Downtown Eastside, mental health and addictions, housing, vulnerable people that are out of work, people being exposed to COVID, not feeling safe to go on transit, how we’re going to move forward with greening our buildings…I’m perplexed to why council’s dealing with this in the first place.”

Anyway, they dealt with it, with the mover of the motion — Coun. Christine Boyle — explaining it was simply meant as an “advocacy motion” to encourage park board commissioners to allow people to legally drink booze at select beaches and parks this summer.

Which is interesting, since this isn’t a new idea for park board and one that was introduced by park board commissioner Dave Demers in December 2018.

Demers successfully requested staff conduct a feasibility study for a pilot project that would allow people to drink booze at select parks and beaches.

That study was supposed to be completed by the end of 2019.

Which sets up Monday’s park board meeting. The report isn’t on the agenda but another motion from Demers is, written in much of the same language used by Boyle.

Demers is asking for a “temporary enactment” of a bylaw that allows people to drink booze at select beaches and parks “in time for summer 2020.”

Those beaches and parks haven’t been named.

I phoned Demers after the majority of council approved Boyle’s motion Tuesday night. He was happy and wasn’t concerned what critics are saying about council interfering in park board business.

“It’s not a push from council, but more of a pull,” said Demers, noting the issue now has a high profile in the news and community.

“It’s adding pressure on everybody, and I think it’s helping.”

It’s no secret to any Vancouverite who has visited a park or beach that drinking already happens in those spaces and has for years, despite it being illegal.

It’s also no secret to regular readers that Vancouver and the rest of the province likes to drink more than other people in the country,” as Dr. Patricia Daly told council in a May 27 presentation.

Those who read my story Wednesday about council saying no to legal drinking in public spaces will recognize these sentences and quotes below from Vancouver Coastal Health’s chief medical health officer.

Daly said the pandemic has had a great effect on the mental health of Canadians and that evidence showed 25 per cent of Canadians were drinking more alcohol.

Which, she said, was concerning in B.C., the province with the highest per capita alcohol consumption rate in Canada and home to a “significant binge-drinking culture.”

“Public health leaders in B.C. have identified this increase in alcohol consumption as one of the most serious negative unintended consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic response,” Daly said.

“Also, alcohol has recently passed tobacco and other drug overdoses as the most common cause of preventable hospitalizations in the province.”

Added Daly: “In fact, B.C. ranks number one among Canadian provinces in its rate of hospitalizations for alcohol misuse — nearly 50 per cent higher than the Canadian rate.”

Council also heard from Deputy Police Chief Howard Chow that police already have problems with people drinking booze at beaches and parks, with eight officers working in the southwest of the city issuing 6,000 liquor warnings and 401 tickets over three months last year at beaches such as Kits and Jericho.

“When I’m talking about those 6,000 incidents where we’re stopping people on the beaches that are drinking, I can tell you that’s just scratching the surface,” he said.

“Almost all of our calls that are relative to this are complaint driven. It’s because people are fed up with a group that’s getting rowdy that have been drinking that’s causing problems.”

He said couples having a glass of wine on the beach is “really not our issue, our problem” — a point he made to a question from Coun. Pete Fry about discretion used by officers when enforcing liquor laws.

In fact, Chow said, he supports a pilot project at beaches and parks.

“I support a measured approach in terms of a pilot study where we’re looking at the impacts before and after in the community…and on health and on us,” he said.

“If it’s something like that, with enough constraints and oversight, I think it’s very viable.”

So over goes the issue to park board.

Fry, meanwhile, is still not happy that five of his fellow councilors shot down his motion to have city staff look at implementing a pilot project for drinking in select public spaces.

His argument is that adults should be treated as adults, with impressive efforts to flatten the epidemiological curve in B.C. proof of how responsible the majority of residents are in this city and across the province.

The Stanley Cup riot of June 2011. File photo Dan Toulgoet

Maybe so, but I do recall a similar comment from Penny Ballem when she was city manager. I asked her whether there was any chance that people were going to riot in the streets after Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals in 2011 — essentially repeat the riot of 1994.

She was standing on West Georgia in a Canucks jersey, fielding calls when I asked her that question. The Canucks were losing to the Bruins 3-0 at that point.

“This city has matured so much since then,” she said of the riot that occurred after the Canucks lost to the New York Rangers in another Game 7.

“We’ve really learned a lot, and I think there’s a very different sense of how important it is not to do that. This is a big crowd and there’re a lot of people downtown. We’re being very careful, but I don’t think anyone thinks there’s going to be anything like that.”

We all know how that story ended.

Yes, different circumstances and maybe an unfair comparison, but booze was at the core of it, as the two-inch thick independent riot report concluded.

Have we matured since then?

Depending on the will of park board commissioners Monday, we may find out whether Vancouverites and their visiting suburban neighbours can handle their booze in parks and beaches this summer.

Many, it seems, are already capable.

The gong show that is the Granville strip on weekends is another story, as is the frustration of Canucks’ fans fed up with an organization’s inability to build a winner.

It’s enough to drive someone to drink.

“I wanted to do something creative that day (March 23) to fill the void that the (Gateway) show would have. So, I decided to do it to honour the fact that I was supposed to start rehearsal that day,” explained Jason Sakaki, a Steveston resident and McMath secondary grad.

Gateway Theatre’s production, From Alaska, was cancelled earlier this month due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Sakaki added, “(I didn’t) think it would pick up so much traction with many people being super invested in the show,” which was staged in every room in his house to give the impression of set changes.

Jason Sakaki took to Instagram for a one-man live stream of Les Miserables. Photo: Video screenshot

Sakaki’s choice of Les Miserables was no coincidence.

Les Miserables is a story about people going through a difficult time, similar to what Richmond and the world is going through today, he explained.

“We’re in this time of ‘what’s happening next’ and no one really knows. Even though the musical takes place in the 1800s, it’s completely relevant to what we’re experiencing right now,” Sakaki added.

Like many residents, the pandemic is affecting Sakaki as a performing artist financially, but the fear of the community turning away from theatre frightens him even more.

“It’s a little bit unsettling for actors because we don’t know when it’s going to end. Since we will not be able to get back to work until it’s fully over. That’s the scary thing right now I think,” said Sakaki.

“What we’re a little scared about is when we come back, are people going to come back to theatres and so … we want to keep them interested in what we’re doing.”

Sakaki will be hosting another one-man production of Beauty and the Beast on April 3 at 7 p.m. on Instagram @jasonsakaki.

With social isolation becoming the new normal and choirs everywhere forced to stop meeting in person, Chor Leoni is launching a new weekly show starting Wednesday, April 1 at 7 p.m.

The Vancouver-area men’s choir will share the livestream on Facebook, YouTube and Instagram.

The Inside Chor Leoni Livestream will be hosted by artistic director Erick Lichte, from his home, and will include high-quality concert videos from the past seven years of filming at the choir’s shows.

The choir will also be creating new video content from its albums, pairing its music with artwork from local artists in an effort to reach out and help all artists as much as it can at a time that’s challenging the entire arts and cultural sector.

The livestream will also include a weekly guest – a locally or internationally recognized music luminary, with an interview and video.

Viewers will also be able to interact within the live comments section.

Lichte underscored the importance of choral music, especially at this time of global uncertainty.

“I believe that choral music has a unique healing quality,” he said in a press release. “It can offer serenity, beauty and can connect with people in ways I don’t even understand. We want to pair this music power with the fun wrapping of a show in a way that is very Chor Leoni.

“Choral music is, for me, the ultimate way in which people can come together. This show won’t replace the community we share as a choir and with our audience, but hopefully it will move us from our current reality to the day we can again bring our voices together and they can be heard.”

For the April 1 livestream, the guest is conductor Ethan Sperry, talking about Translations, his new recording of the works of Latvian composer Eriks Esenvalds on the Naxos label.

The show will also premiere the first video for the album’s recording of Esenvalds’ In Paradisum, paired in video with paintings by renowned Vancouver artist Tiko Kerr.

Virtually.

article continues below

Thursday, the BCHL launched a simulation — created in the EA Sports video game NHL2020 — of the rest of the league’s playoff series that were cancelled March 13, just as the second round of the post-season was set to begin.

A player representative from each of the eight teams remaining in the playoff tourney is handling the game controls in a head-to-head match-up against their second-round opponent, with a two-minute highlight reel — complete with commentary by the teams’ broadcasters — posted to the league website.

“We were looking for a way to keep fans engaged during this unfortunate downtime,” BCHL commissioner Chris Hebb said in a press release. “We’ve tried to make it a fun and unique BCHL experience for everyone to enjoy.”

The initiative sprang from a project by the former director of communications for the Express, Jacob Lazare. Bored and restless after the team dispatched the Langley Rivermen from the playoffs’ first round in four straight games and were awaiting the start of the second round, he put together a simulation of a series between Coquitlam and the Surrey Eagles, who took seven games to defeat the Chilliwack Chiefs.

Lazare said he was able to use the video game’s various customization features to recreate the rosters of the two rivals, ranking each player’s attributes and tendencies, like their skating ability, speed, puck-handling skills and physicality, on a scale from zero to 99.

“You can go through and create a player that mimics the actual players realistically,” Lazare told The Tri-City News, adding he can set a dazzling skater like Massimo Rizzo to weave around defenders and a skilled stickman like defender Drew Cooper to repel onrushing forwards one-on-one.

While his own knowledge of the Express gleaned from running the team’s video camera during games helped him build Coquitlam’s digital doppelgänger, Lazare reached out to contacts at the Eagles to inform his recreations of Surrey’s players.

The effort was an amusing distraction that got some attention on social media.

But when the actual series, and the rest of the season, was scrubbed because of the pandemic, the league reached out to spin his effort into a virtual march to the Fred Page Cup championship.

Lazare said it takes him a couple of hours to handicap all the players for each team, and additional time to create facsimiles of the uniforms and match headshots with the game’s graphics.

“It’s just to make it so fans can recognize their teams’ players,” he said of the laborious attention to detail.

Lazare lamented, however, that limitations in the game don’t allow him to recreate the cozy confines of BCHL arenas, so the virtual players are battling in front of likely the biggest crowds they’ve ever experienced, even if they’re comprised entirely of pixels.

Lazare said having actual players contest the rest of the playoffs, albeit with the help of the game’s artificial intelligence, adds an extra wrinkle of unpredictability, which is part of the fun.

“Somebody is able to win it for their team,” he said. “There can be upsets involved.”

The first series, contested between Express goalie Joe Howe and Hassan Akl of the Surrey Eagles, is already decided, with the three remaining series to be posted in the coming days. The third round of the playoff simulation commences next week.",[]

Tuesday, Batchelor put out the call to fans and his followers for random videos to which he would apply his vocal talents.

article continues below

“I'm bored,” he said, adding he’ll do three such play-by-play calls a day.

HIs first three calls were a golfer at the driving range, a cat losing its mind in a cardboard box and a couple of pillow fighters blinded by hoods pulled over their faces.

“Keep ’em coming,” Batchelor said afterward.

Batchelor has been the Canucks’ play-by-play man since 2017 after several years calling Vancouver Giants games.

The Dr. Charles Best secondary school grad said he honed his commentary chops calling goals and assists while playing road hockey in the driveway of his parents’ home on Harbour Drive, playing table hockey in the basement and video games.

“I was huge into hockey,” Batchelor told The Tri-City News.

To fulfill his dream of announcing the sport, Batchelor studied broadcasting at BCIT and volunteered doing public address announcements for the Burnaby Express of the BC Hockey League (BCHL), then followed the team when it returned to Coquitlam.

In 2012, Batchelor became the broadcaster for the BCHL’s Surrey Eagles, then graduated to the Giants and the Western Hockey League the next year.

His Twitter project follows the lead of another social media effort by Port Moody’s Al Murdoch, the Canucks’ public address announcer. He has been taking requests to call goals and assists for the team’s fans and minor hockey players, posting one a day for his followers.

Murdoch said he launched the initiative because he missed doing the announcements at Rogers Arena, especially as the Canucks were in the thick of the playoff race before the season was abruptly suspended March 12.

He said he also wanted to help lift spirits at a time when everyone is anxious about the pandemic and its mounting economic and societal consequences.

His idea has since been picked up by other announcers, including Mike Ross of the Toronto Maple Leafs and the New Jersey Devils' goal and assist caller, Kevin Clark.

“By resource sector, we’re talking about the whole spectrum,” says Barinder Rasode, Director of Social Development for the Resource Works Society. “It’s about oil, gas, LNG, agriculture; everything that comes from the earth and helps sustain our way of life.”

article continues below

More often than not the community will read or hear anti-resource development sentiments that aren’t based in fact, Barinder asserts.

“Often opinions are voiced in the community without referencing credible research about how much the resource sector in B.C. is committed to the environment and environmental concerns, or what it will mean to our economy if we don’t have a thoughtful economic plan around development.”

Barinder likens the concept of sustainability to a three-legged bar stool.

“The three legs are environmental, social, and economic issues,” she explains. “If even just one of these legs is shorter than the others, then the stool tips. We can’t survive without the resource industry. It supplies many of the things we need and which we take for granted.”

Resource Works Society spends its time and money gathering facts based on research of the industry and its contribution to society. Barinder notes that we all wear clothes, use household appliances, own mobile phones, and rely on hospital equipment, all of which have come from resources that have been extracted and developed.

“Sadly, the dialogue out there now is so extreme and anti-resource development,” Barinder says, “that responsible resource companies have been vilified. This has caused project delays that are costing short-term economic development in the province and providing an economic barrier in the long-term. Companies are pulling back on investments in British Columbia because of arguments based on emotion, rather than facts.”

The aim of Barinder and her team at the Resource Works Society is to bring factual research to the conversation and promote the benefits of responsible resource development.

That would be at the BC Highland Games and Scottish Festival to be held at Percy Perry Stadium in Coquitlam on June 17, 2017.

“I like to call it a moveable feast of activities,” laughs Mike Chisholm, Chair of the BC Highland Games. “There’ll be something for everyone.”

The Scot’s were one of Canada’s first immigrant groups, exploring the country and producing many of our early politicians such as Sir. John A. MacDonald, Canada’s first prime minister. As a community that enjoys celebrating its culture, it was only natural that it would bring its Highland Games to Canada.

“The original Games grew out of the Scottish Highland chieftains calling the clans together to find the best runner, the strongest man, the best musician or dancer and so on,” Mike explains. “In the 19th century Baron Pierre de Coubertin visited the highlands of Scotand, witnessed a demonstration of the Highland Games and was so impressed he took it as the basis of an idea for the modern Olympic Games.”

On June 17, the programme starts on the Friday evening with a grand Piobaireachd (pronounced “pea-brock”) piping competition featuring the classical music of the pipes from some of the best professional pipers in the Pacific northwest.

“On Saturday,” Mike says, “rain or shine, we’ll have the competitive games, including the Scottish heavy athletic events, such as the caber toss and the shot putt. There’ll also be lots of British food, like haggis and bacon butties, British cars, kids activities, cultural talks, and our ever popular Whisky School.”

This year, getting to the Games has never been easier. Hop on the new Evergreen SkyTrain Line and stay on. That’s right, stay on until the end of the line (Lafarge Lake-Douglas Station). The Percy Perry Stadium is a scenic seven-minute walk from there.

They are your baristas, concierges, hotel staff, cooks, winery and brewery workers, waiters, bartenders and wine sales people. While providing hospitality can be rewarding, most jobs in the industry are part-time and can have minimal benefits.

The committee that would eventually form the BC Hospitality Foundation (BCHF) came together in fall 2006, inspired by the desire to help long-time wine agent Michael Willingham with the money he needed for a machine in order to breathe at night. The machine was $50,000 and not covered by his medical plan.

article continues below

Willingham’s situation brought forward the need to establish funding that could be used to help anyone within the foodservice, beverage and hospitality industry who required extraordinary support due to illness or accident.

The founding planning committee was made up of friends and colleagues of Willingham. Together they created BCHF as a registered charity that raises funds to support those in the hospitality industry facing financial crisis due to a serious health condition. Each year hospitality workers across B.C. face financial challenges and have nowhere else to turn. The BCHF helps them when all other options have been exhausted.

Since 2006, BCHF has helped over 200 hospitality industry workers with approximately $850,000.

In addition, it offers a scholarship program to foster the development of the next generation of workers and industry leaders. To do this, the BHCF gives out about 25 scholarships annually. Since 2009, the Foundation has granted almost 200 scholarships worth over $225,000. Combined that adds up to over $1M in support.

The BCHF is person-centered and localized to B.C. In its practices, the BCHF seeks to be sustainable and transparent to its community, the hospitality-related industries.

The BCHF hosts three major fundraising events each year in order to continue supporting hospitality workers, including both scholarship winners and beneficiaries: DISH (May), the Vancouver Golf Tournament (July), and the Victoria Golf Tournament (August). Additionally, it hosts several lotteries with industry partners.

Twenty years ago a monument to Angelo Holmes' grandfather — celebrated Italian-Canadian jurist Angelo Branca — was dedicated with great pride near the SkyTrain line on Clark Drive. Now it sits forgotten and neglected.

article continues below

A small plaque, inscribed Oct. 11, 1986, affixed to a large, but bare pedestal, hints at the origin of a long-abandoned concrete plaza on the west side of Clark Drive at Grandview Highway North.

Little else offers passersby a clue to its significance. Bits of debris and used hypodermic needles litter the surrounding area and nearby bushes, stagnant water sits in a broken-down fountain and the monument's lights no longer function.

Overhead, SkyTrain cars roar by at regular intervals, while rush-hour traffic speeds along Clark — drivers oblivious to the plaza's existence, history and ultimate neglect.

Angelo Holmes darts across the busy six-lane truck route, arriving at the plaza with a frown on his face.

""It looks like it's used by drug users. I haven't been here in years. It's absolutely horrible. I'm just getting upset coming here,"" he says surveying the site, irritated by both its state and a location that's both absurd and difficult to reach.

Holmes, 46, was here 20 years earlier to attend the site's christening in honour of his grandfather, Angelo Branca — a former B.C. Supreme and Appeal Court justice who grew up on the East Side.

It was one of many small parks and plazas created along the B.C. Parkway, roughly following the SkyTrain line, as a beautification project in the mid-'80s when the system debuted during Grace McCarthy's term as B.C. minister of transportation. Others include the German-Canadian Heritage Plaza across from the 29th Avenue SkyTrain station.

The Confratellanza Italo-Canadese (Italian-Canadian Brotherhood), funded this endeavour, which once featured a three-foot-tall Christopher Columbus statue — a gift from the City of Genoa in memory of Branca.

Over the years vandals damaged the site, a plaque explaining its origin was stolen and the statue disappeared mysteriously, only to reappear later just as mysteriously at Hastings Park Italian Garden. Other than the occasional cleaning the plaza has been ignored.

That's until Laara Egan started making calls this spring. The Surrey resident, who lived on the East Side until property prices drove her to the suburbs, isn't Italian but the plaza's history piqued her interest when a friend pointed it out.

Over the past three months, she's talked to TransLink, the Greater Vancouver Regional District, B.C. Rapid Transit, the city and the parks board, as well as to Angelo Holmes, to uncover the details behind the plaza's creation, with hopes another memorial could be created in a more appropriate spot as a permanent tribute to Branca.

""It is heartbreaking that this once beautiful memorial plaza is not even a memory. All that money and energy for nothing,"" she says.

But Branca's grandson and other Branca family members are satisfied the Columbus statue is in the Italian Garden in an area named for Branca. With no sentimental attachment to the Clark Drive plaza site, largely because of its poor location, they also see no point in maintaining the memorial.

""I wouldn't put anything here anymore,"" says Holmes above the constant drone of traffic on this sunny Tuesday afternoon. ""This is true, as far as I'm concerned, they can level it and put grass in here.""

Angelo Branca was considered one of Vancouver's most influential Italian-Canadians of his time. Born near Duncan on Vancouver Island in 1903, the son of a coal miner, he grew up on the East Side, then moved to Dunbar in the 1940s before settling in West Vancouver's British properties in 1965.

He was the youngest prosecutor of his day, a park commissioner and an amateur boxer who won the middleweight championship of B.C. in the 1930s. From 1963 to 1966 he sat as a Supreme Court Justice, before being elevated to the B.C. Court of Appeal, a position he held between 1966 and 1978 when he retired at 75. Branca died in October of 1984 at age 81.

A devout Catholic, he was father to daughters Dolores Holmes — Angelo's mother and a retired provincial judge — and Patricia Battensby, a retired nurse.

Battensby wrote about her father for a 2004 tribute recalling, ""Christmas was legendary. It was always truly a United Nations as Angelo, during wartime, would drive down the street and pick up service men who lived out of town and no Christmas with family to be with. The table proudly boasted Christians, Jews, Muslims and people of various languages. He was never happier than when he presided over his great table at home.""

Admirers weren't limited to his immediate family. Yeshiva University in New York awarded him the ""Reverence of the Law"" honour, California State University bestowed on him the ""Lincoln Reverence of Law"" distinction, while the State of Israel granted him the Prime Minister honour in 1978, awarded by then Prime Minister Menachem Begin because of Branca's close association with the Jewish community.

That relationship was cited in a glowing article about Branca by writer Eve Rockett, which appeared in the Vancouver Sun in 1973. It noted he was co-chairman of the Canadian Council of Christians and Jews, Pacific region, and received its human relations award in 1972.

""This Roman Catholic was the second Canadian ever to receive the Yeshiva University Award, presented by the Jewish Community of Vancouver,"" she wrote. ""Each year an Angelo Branca scholarship fund sends a Canadian student to Yeshiva, the oldest and largest Jewish university in the United States.""

Rockett noted Branca defended 62 accused murderers during his career and lost only two cases: four charges were reduced to manslaughter and the rest of the accused were freed.

""Branca was indeed a performer, but underneath was a dagger-sharp mind with a magnetic affinity for law; a mind kept finely honed by one of the largest privately owned law libraries in Canada,"" Rockett wrote, noting many of his clients were on legal aid.

Branca was also the founder of the Confratellanza Italo-Canadese in 1966, which amalgamated four of the oldest Italian-Canadian societies in the City of Vancouver.

The club, still active today, donates to charities, hospitals, scholarships and medical research. It's one of several associations affiliated with the Italian Cultural Centre.

Holmes served as vice-president of the club when the memorial plaza to his grandfather's considerable legacy was erected. It sits on land owned by the neighbouring C. Martino Auto Centre, although it's on a TransLink right-of-way.

Norm Langerhorst, wayside manager for B.C. Rapid Transit, which operates and maintains SkyTrain, says staff drop by several times a year to clean up the site.

""We do graffiti every week, but when it comes to pavers that need to be replaced or weeds pulled we do that four times a year,"" he says, pointing out the German-Canadian plaza is maintained by that group but B.C. Rapid Transit takes care of all the other parks and plazas along the B.C. Parkway through its maintenance budget.

He agrees the location of the Italian Plaza is unfortunate, although Clark Drive wasn't as busy 20 years ago. Langerhorst isn't aware of any plans by TransLink to do anything with the site.

""There was some plans to extend what they call the greenway. There was going to be a bridge there that goes from the northwest corner of the Clark Street bridge over the Grandview Cut,"" he says. ""It was supposed to connect over to Terminal Street by the Home Depot, but that's been abandoned because of cost. I'm not sure what's going there now.""

TransLink spokesman Ken Hardie says about 20 different mini-parks sprung up in the '80s along the SkyTrain route, sponsored by different ethnic societies. Some, like the German-Canadian site, are well-maintained, while other societies disbanded, he says, and the plazas abandoned.

Aside from the Confratellanza, prominent private donors for the Italian Plaza project included the late ship builder Vito Trevisi, Frank Folino of McRae Electric, which did the electrical work, and Pat Baratta of P. Baratta Construction, which did the excavation. The total cost was $50,000--$25,000 from the Confratellanza, $15,000 from Trevisi and $10,000 from the province.

Holmes confesses he hadn't given the plaza much thought in years until Egan called. The former library technician used her researching skills to track information down, although few seemed clear on its history and some of the information was contradictory. Holmes, she says, proved the best source.

""This [plaza] is just where the homeless sleep. I think it's a shame because of all the energy and money that people put into it to honour Angelo Branca,"" she adds. ""He was great. He stood for the underdog. He fought for people's rights. He was a really outspoken judge and he stood for decency and justice and earned the respect of everybody.

Egan wishes the plaza had been maintained, but concedes another location is preferable. ""I'd love to see something done and people educated about Vancouver history and some of the great people in it.""

Sitting on the plaza's dirty steps, Holmes clearly regrets its location. He says the club was told two decades ago that the area was to become more residential. Instead it became solidly industrial and commercial, with Clark Drive used as a major through-way for trucks on their way to the port and commuters crossing Vancouver.

""How can anybody even come near it. I'm upset because we got conned into this whole thing. It's terrible, it's dangerous. I get upset coming here just thinking how stupid the whole thing was. It was supposed to be developed differently, more pedestrian-friendly. We would never have put this here if we knew it was going to stay the same. The Confratellanza would never have financed it if was going to stay the way it looked 20 years ago and it hasn't changed,"" he says.

""TransLink is supposed to maintain this — that was the deal in perpetuity if we built this and they were supposed to keep the lighting going. I remember that was part of the deal. They haven't kept up with it.""

He says the Confratellanza also didn't maintain it.

Perhaps doomed from the start, the Italian plaza's problems continued over 20 years. Just ask Carmen Martino, owner of the auto centre, which opened in 1989.

""If it was mine, I would have already levelled it. You won't believe what's going on over there night and day — between drugs, prostitution, garbage and the graffiti,"" he says. ""It's not a question of location, it's the way that thing is made — it provides a haven and hideout for people to go in and do whatever business they want to do.""

Martino, who is familiar with Branca's contributions to the city, maintains the site never did justice to the judge's memory, even with the Christopher Columbus statue.

""You wouldn't believe how many times we had to remove garbage from right on top of it,"" he explains. ""We used to leave tires in the back over there. In the morning, you would find two of three of them right on top of the statue — it was just ridiculous. I don't know why they didn't place the statue in the Italian community centre.""

It might have been safer. The plaque explaining its origin was pried off the pedestal in the early 1990s, around the 500th anniversary of Columbus' ""discovery"" of America.

Four remaining bolt holes are the only sign of its existence. Some speculated First Nations people destroyed it to protest the controversial celebration focused on Columbus, although many plaques around the city are also stolen for the value of the brass.

But it wasn't the only thing to go missing. Years later, in the spring of 2000, the Columbus statue was stolen in the dead of night during the period when the Italian Garden at Hastings Park was being designed and spearheaded by parks commissioner Allan De Genova, now a member of the Confratellanza.

Rumour has it that prominent members of the Italian community were involved in the caper, determined to find a better home for the sculpture. De Genova says he doesn't know who took it, but points out the Italian community and Confratellanza were divided over whether it should remain at the Clark Drive site or be moved.

He recalls what happened several months after the theft, before the Italian Garden's official opening.

""A number of [parks] staff were standing at the garden as it was just being finished and this white van pulls up and all of a sudden out comes this statue. They bring it over to a podium and start bolting it down,"" De Genova says. ""Everyone was a little surprised. All of a sudden this mysterious statue showed up. There was a police investigation, I even got called by the police wanting to know how it disappeared. It was quite the thing. All of a sudden it showed up and some guys got out of a van and they started bolting it down and then drove off.""

The Vancouver Police Department couldn't track down old reports about the incident for the Courier. Holmes suspects police simply dropped the matter.

""It was buried. I think it was just, 'Shut up and let it appear.' I think the police left it alone and let the Italian community figure it all out,"" he says. ""They have more pressing issues. Maybe they thought if nobody from the Branca family or the Confratellanza were really pursuing it, what are they going to do. So it all just came out right... The statue is now where it should be and let's just let it rest and leave it there.""

Holmes doesn't know who took Christopher Columbus, nor where it was stored for four months. He says he simply hoped at the time it would end up in the right place. ""It was just not appropriate to take it in the dead of night,"" he says.

The statue, called The Dreamer, now resides in ""Il Giardino,"" the main entrance of which is on Renfrew at Triumph Street. It's located midway down the block between Hastings and McGill streets, through the Angelo Branca Parterre.

Egan doesn't object to Columbus's location, but would like to see more done to recognize one of the city's most highly regarded citizens.

""Off the top of my head, I'd like to see a better place, a better location and some sort of monument to Angelo Branca. I think the family deserves that — his memory deserves that,"" she says. ""I think the Columbus statue has found a nice home in the Italian Garden and it seems to be at peace there. But it's not really related to Angelo Branca really. That was donated by the City of Genoa. It would be nice if there's just something for Angelo Branca.""

Holmes, while appreciating Egan's effort and sentiment, would rather leave well enough alone, satisfied with the statue's new location and certain the Clark Drive plaza site is a lost cause.

Provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix announced July 15 that there were 21 new cases in the past 24 hours, including two cases that they call ""epi-linked,"" or presumed cases that have not been proven through testing but are being treated as official cases.

article continues below

The province has now recorded 3,149 cases since the novel coronavirus first appeared in B.C. in late January.

More than 87.4% of those infected, or 2,753 people, have recovered. Of those who haven't, 189 people have died and 207 people are actively fighting the virus. Only 14 people are hospitalized, with five of those in intensive care units. The rest are self-isolating at home. There were no new deaths recorded in the past 24 hours.

Recording at least 20 new COVID-19 cases in a 24-hour period has become common in B.C., and Henry said yesterday that she found that number ""distressing,"" even though, she added, the good news is that the province knows where the clusters of infection are, many of the infections are linked and the number is not really that large given the province's population of more than five million residents.

The numbers in the past week were:

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12;

• 21 new cases on July 13;

• 13 new cases on July 14; and now

• 21 new cases on July 15.

In June, the number of daily new cases many times was in the single digits.

""There is one active community outbreak, in addition to several community exposure events,"" Henry and Dix said. ""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks.""

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,023 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,659 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 216 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 51 people who reside outside Canada.

Sidoo, now a convicted felon, initially pled innocent to fraud and money laundering charges; he teared up before being sentenced and read a prepared statement:

“The last several months have been the hardest in my entire life and today I accept the court’s decision without reservation. No words can express how sorry I am for my decisions and actions that led to this day. I make no excuses, your honour. I broke the law and pled guilty and I now must pay for my actions.

“To my wife and boys, all I ever wanted was your love and respect and to be a good role model. And I know I have made a terrible mistake that has deeply affected our family. To my friends and colleagues and former teammates over the years, I am deeply ashamed today. To the young men and women who looked up to me as a role model, you deserve better. To the court and all of you, I wish to apologize for my actions.

“I will serve my sentence and am committed to returning to the community and doing everything possible to make a positive impact. I hope in time people will not judge me for the worst mistake in my life but for the work in the days, weeks and years ahead in which I am committed to being a better man.”

Gorton told Sidoo he was “impressed” by the businessman’s “obvious remorse.”

But Gorton pointed out two omissions in Sidoo’s statement.

“You expect to put this behind you and go forward and make up for what you called mistakes. I would call it a crime, not a mistake, but nevertheless, it is important that you acknowledge it and realize how many constituencies you have disappointed,” said the judge.

Sidoo also did not explicitly acknowledge that his crimes resulted in two students missing an opportunity to attend the universities his sons, Dylan Sidoo and Jordan Sidoo, were admitted to.

“What you accomplished, along with getting them into college, is to deprive two other deserving students of admittance into those universities — an act that is the very antithesis of one you want to be known for,” said Gorton.

Likewise, United States Attorney Andrew Lelling submitted to Gorton: “Sidoo engaged in serious criminal conduct involving fraud and deception that stretched over multiple years.

“His crimes warrant significant punishment. By engaging in the scheme, with [scheme mastermind Rick Singer] and others, Sidoo was able to steal two college admissions slots for his sons, including one from the University of California at Berkeley, one of the top public universities in the nation.”

Sidoo, said Gorton, “committed a crime that displayed an unbelievable lack of integrity, morality and common sense.

“You have let your selfish desire, your pride and your enormous wealth overcome all of what you apparently want to stand for with your works of charity,” Gorton told Sidoo.

Sidoo’s philanthropy, derived from his earnings in the capital markets, was central to his sentencing defense. According to Sidoo he has donated several million dollars to charitable causes, such as the University of B.C. football program.

In pleading guilty to fraud, Sidoo avoided a maximum prison term of 20 years and prosecutors subsequently agreed to 90 days behind bars, plus a $250,000 fine and one-year of supervised release, which will not be enforced in Canada by the U.S. Probation Department. Prosecutors also agreed to drop the money laundering charge.

The prison Sidoo goes to is expected to have harsher conditions since his options are limited due to his foreign citizenship. His attorney Martin Weinberg said he is expected to spend 14 days in isolation in a “maximum security setting,” due to COVID-19.

Sidoo will get four days credit for time already served. If he serves the full 90 days he will be released December 17 but will have to spend 14 days in isolation at home should B.C. public health rules for international travellers and COVID-19 continue into the fall.

Gorton said Sidoo’s crime would normally warrant more time in jail but there are mitigating circumstances, such as his remorse, lack of criminal record, philanthropy and “collateral consequences,” such as not being able to enter the U.S. as a felon and being stripped last month of his Order of B.C. medal for community service. Sidoo’s attorneys also previously noted he did not directly pay the universities but that his fraud was limited to cheating on the tests.

The former B.C. Lions football player worked as a stock broker in the 1990s and an investment banker between 2000 and 2010. Since 2010 he has made millions of dollars directing a handful of public companies that have failed to generate wealth for retail investors.

Sidoo was arrested March 8, 2019, in San Jose, California, on charges by the U.S. Department of Justice of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering related to the high-profile U.S. college admissions and bribery scandal, brought to light by a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe dubbed Operation Varsity Blues.

One of dozens of parents to be charged, Sidoo initially pled innocent to paying $200,000 total to scheme mastermind William ‘Rick’ Singer, who hired corrupt exam expert Mark Riddell to take Dylan and Jordan’s SAT exams, in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Sidoo also helped falsify one of his son Jordan’s university applications in October 2013 with an essay that originally included a fake claim of Jordan being held up at gunpoint by gangsters, while he was purported to be an intern for an anti-gang organization.

Co-conspirators Singer and Riddell pled guilty last year in exchange for cooperating with the government’s investigation.

The guilty parties in the case, who used Singer’s criminal services, were generally well-off individuals. Celebrities such as actress Lori Loughlin and her clothing designer husband Mossimo Gianulli and actress Felicity Huffman also pled guilty for related crimes and brought much media attention to the investigation.

Sidoo’s sons had no involvement in their father’s crime.

Jordan is now a 2018 history graduate from University of California Berkeley. Dylan graduated in cinematic arts in 2016 from the University of Southern California (USC). The two previously attended Vancouver’s prestigious St. George’s School.

Neither university has announced whether or not their degrees will remain valid. Dylan, according to the sentencing documents, had scored a 1,460/2,400 SAT score until Riddell, using a fake ID in December 2011, bumped up the score to 1,700, which was high enough for Dylan to enter Chapman University (and later transfer to USC). Riddell then scored 2,280/2,400 for Jordan in December 2012, paving the way to Berkley.

Riddell also took a high school test for Dylan. The B.C. Ministry of Education has issued no statement on how its testing process was so vulnerable to fraud.

Both sons have since entered into penny stock promotion with their father.

What are the legal obligations for employers toward employees in the pandemic? Lindsie Thomson, managing partner at the Harris and Co. law firm, discusses the challenges of remote work and returning to work as part of a week-long video podcast series on human resources.

Our discussions continue tomorrow with a conversation with Rocky Ozaki from NowOfWork.

Exactly one week ago, on July 7, the province recorded 12 new cases. What followed was an uptick in recorded cases:

• 18 new cases on July 8;

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12; and

• 21 new cases on July 13.

article continues below

""I know it was distressing to me to see 20, especially 25 [new cases] one day,"" Henry said. ""That's way above my comfort zone.""

She added, however, that the slight rise in cases was not unexpected, given that the province has been allowing restaurants and other indoor businesses to reopen.

""We do know where those cases are,"" she said. ""We're testing the people who need to be tested.""

It would be more concerning, she said, if the cases were spread out across the province in an unlinked way. The most recent cluster of cases is linked to the Krazy Cherry Fruit Company in Oliver, she announced yesterday (July 13).

Given B.C.'s population, 20 cases in one day is also better than some other jurisdictions, she said.

The province has identified 3,128 infections since the virus first appeared in the province in late January.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,015 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1649 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 212 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 52 people who reside outside Canada.

Of the 209 people currently fighting COVID-19 in B.C., 14 people are in hospital with five of those in intensive care units. That leaves 2,730 people who have recovered from the virus.

No new deaths from the virus were identified in the past 24 hours, leaving the death toll at 189 people.

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

So far 399 residents and 252 staff at seniors' care facilities have been infected by COVID-19 in B.C.

Health Minister Adrian Dix said that it is his understanding that the federal government and the U.S. government have agreed to extend the closure of the two countries' border for one additional month, until August 21.

""This is obviously positive and necessary news,"" he said. ""Everybody who lives in B.C. knows how inconvenient and how difficult that is for many businesses and many individuals for a variety of circumstances.""

Harry Bains said injured workers have complained for too long that the system lacks fairness and support in times of injury and recovery.

article continues below

Changes Bains proposes include raising the maximum annual salary on which compensation benefits are based; authorizing WorkSafeBC to provide preventative medical treatment before claim acceptance; giving powers to the court to issue WorkSafeBC search and seizure warrants appropriate for investigating workplace safety infractions; and giving people a voice in serious workplace prosecutions and trials by using victim impact statements.

Victoria is also fast-tracking legislation to handle situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic so workers can access benefits more easily.

During the pandemic, the regulator is allowing businesses to defer paying their premiums for six months without penalty or interest. It is also waiving premiums on wages paid to workers of employers receiving the Canadian Emergency Wage Subsidy.

The amendments to the Workers Compensation Act comes after three expert reviews were completed in 2018 and 2019.

The ministry said of the more than 44,000 injured workers currently receiving permanent disability benefits because of a work-related injury, about 35% are in the Lower Mainland, while the rest are spread throughout all regions of B.C.

There are more than 100,000 workplace injury or fatality claims annually.

In 2019, there were 140 workplace fatalities in B.C. Of that number, 84 were due to occupational disease, 40 to traumatic injury and 16 the result of a motor vehicle incident.

In a fiscal update Tuesday, B.C. Finance Minister Carole James said the COVID-19 pandemic will result in ""the worst downturn experienced in our province in recent history.""

article continues below

""The projected numbers are staggering, but they're not without hope,"" James said, in summing up B.C.'s fiscal position.

She said B.C. had entered the pandemic perhaps better situated than other provinces, as it had a balanced budget, a triple AAA credit rating and one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country.

B.C. also managed to contain the pandemic and flatten its growth curve better than some other provinces, and it has been able to move earlier on a phased economic restart plan.

""Because of that strength, we were able to take immediate action to help people, to help businesses, to help communities with our $5 billion COVID action plan,"" James said.

She said the province is expecting a loss of $4.2 billion in tax revenue, including $1 billion less in personal income tax revenue, $973 million less in corporate taxes, $1.3 billion in provincial sales tax revenue, $300 million in natural resource revenues and $882 million less in Crown Corporation income.

The province is also spending $5 billion in emergency spending, and has approved $1.3 billion in tax credits and deferrals. In total, the increased spending, lost tax revenue and foregone revenue will bring the deficit to $12.5 billion.

In February, James brought down, but never passed, a balanced budget and modest surplus of $227 million and provincial GDP growth projections of 2% in 2020.

""Mere weeks after the budget 2020 was tabled, our entire world changed,"" James said.

James said the B.C. economy is now expected to contract 6.8% in 2020, according to some forecasters.

Since February, B.C. lost 235,000 jobs, and saw retail sales declined by 23.6% in April compared to February. Overall, home prices dropped 4%.

Home sales declined 45.4% in May, compared to February, and B.C. merchandise exports are down 14.7% year-to-date, compared to January to May 2019.

""While the job losses in March and April were record-breaking, figures for May and June in fact have seen some recovery of the losses that we experienced in the previous two months,"" James said.

Asked if her government planned to resort to spending cuts to address the deficit, James said ""now is not the time to be able to cut back on services and support for people and business in British Columbia.""

As for any long-range plans for dealing with debt and deficits, James said: ""I do not believe that it's going to be a quick fix.""

Asked if the $5 billion that her government has already approved could be added to later this year, James said ""I believe the $5 billion is enough now.""

However, she added no one can predict what might happen should there be a second wave of COVID-19.

As for the $22 billion in capital spending allocated in the 2020 budget over three years for big capital works projects, like new schools, hospitals, bridges and roads, that will continue to be spent.

""This is going to serve us very well because it translates into huge investments,"" James said.

This question was fervently debated on Twitter last week following my posting of a website created by some nearby residents — 28floors.com.

article continues below

Before offering my answer, I should note that over four decades, I have sought many rezonings for larger buildings. I even contemplated buying the vanity license plate “REZONE” but thought better of it when I realized my car would be constantly vandalized.

Many of my rezonings were what planners call “spot rezonings” since they were not in accordance with an approved community plan.

In 1985, I upset Point Grey residents by rezoning three blocks between West Seventh and Ninth Avenues and Alma and Highbury Streets from single-family to multi-family for low-rise apartments.

A few years later, I angered many Cambie corridor residents by proposing a fourth 18-storey rental tower at Langara Gardens. While it was approved, a subsequent application for three more rental towers was rejected due to community opposition. Today there are plans for buildings up to 28 storeys on the site.

In 1995, many Oak Street area residents opposed my proposal for a four-storey seniors’ apartment at 42nd and Oak. It was eventually approved at three-storeys.

Two years later, a Kerrisdale neighbourhood opposed a three-and-a-half storey apartment at West 41st and Balaclava. Despite then-Alderman George Puil’s claim in the Courier that the building would be as obscene as Eaton’s large blank wall, today The Lanesborough sits comfortably in its surroundings.

Most recently, I rezoned a property at Capilano and Marine in North Vancouver, next to a Denny’s restaurant. Although the Community Plan called for an 18-storey limit, I requested approval for 23 and 19 storey buildings. They are underway.

Which brings us back to the Broadway Denny’s, where the purpose-built rental housing development has been proposed.

For decades, building designs along West Broadway have been controlled by the Central Broadway C3-A zoning and guidelines establishing a maximum height of approximately 12 floors and 3.0 FSR limit.

In early 2018, Jameson Development received rezoning approval for a 16-floor Secured Market Rental building containing 158 residential units. An increased 7.07 FSR was allowed.

The proposed massing of 1296 Broadway will dramatically change the neighbourhood character and views along the street, says columnist Michael Geller.

However, given the Millennium Line Broadway extension, the developer now wants rezoning approval for an even higher 28-storey, 10.7 FSR building containing 262 market rental units under a new Moderate-Income Rental Housing Pilot Program that will come into effect in 2019.

On Twitter, I opined that notwithstanding the need for more rental housing, this building proposal appeared too big for its site context and should not be approved, especially in the absence of a new community plan.

I was immediately attacked — OK, challenged — by an organization called Abundant Housing and UBC professor Tom Davidoff and others, who questioned how I could possibly think any purpose-built rental building could be too big given today’s rental housing crisis and the coming subway. Why was I so afraid of tall buildings?

As this column’s introduction hopefully demonstrates, I am not afraid of tall buildings. However, I am concerned that too many very tall and dense buildings are being approved in the name of sustainability and affordability.

I wrote about this six years ago, which led to an SFU City Conversations debate “Where is big TOO big?”

Rezonings for larger buildings are often justifiable. One higher density building in a lower density neighbourhood might be fine. However, we need to think about the cumulative effect of 20 similar buildings. Or 40.

What will be the impact on views? Shadowing? Will the buildings be neighbourly? Are new parks planned? Will there be adequate school and community centre spaces? This is what a good, overall plan will address.

Too often I see politicians allowing large Community Amenity Contributions, or developer claims to be responding to the housing crisis, to trump good planning and design.

Architects and planners have a responsibility to speak out.

The city has already approved a purpose-built rental project at Broadway and Birch at more than twice the previously zoned density. That’s fine. But any further density and height increases should only be considered within the context of a new approved Broadway Corridor Plan.

671,vancourier,https://www.vancourier.com/opinion/why-hundreds-of-homeless-avoid-vancouver-shelters-1.24025000,Why hundreds of homeless avoid Vancouver shelters,['Mike Howell'],,"It appears Vancouver has to do something about its homeless shelters.

And that something — in the absence of a miraculous supportive housing construction boom — is making whatever changes necessary to make homeless people feel welcome and safe in these buildings of refuge.

article continues below

Because hundreds would rather sleep outside.

That is an unfortunate finding of a new report authored by the Homelessness Services Association of B.C., the B.C. Non-Profit Housing Association and Urban Matters CCC.

The report, which is an analysis of the City of Vancouver’s homeless count in March, is the same one I referred to in my previous post. But I didn’t get into detail about the state of the city’s shelters and why homeless people avoid them.

The report provides information that wasn’t available when city staff updated council in June about the homeless count. The number of homeless veterans, for example, is listed (108).

It’s an interesting read, if you want to learn more about why Vancouver’s homeless population continues to grow year over year, with a record-breaking 2,223 counted this year.

Which brings me back to the concern with shelters.

Of the “unsheltered” people surveyed during the 24-hour count, 87 said they “disliked” shelters — the report didn’t elaborate as to why — and 58 said they didn’t “feel safe.”

Another 244 said they refused to stay at a shelter for “other reasons,” including concerns with shelter staff, couldn’t bring their pet with them, preferred to be alone and “shelters are not for them.”

A total of 23 cited bedbugs and pests as reasons.

At the same time, 50 homeless people interviewed in March who wanted to stay in a shelter said they were turned away, although the reason or reasons was not listed in the report.

Unsheltered survey participants were also asked where they stayed the previous night of the count.

A total of 377 stayed outside, 106 at someone else’s or a friend’s place, 69 in a makeshift shelter or tent, 31 in a vehicle and two in an abandoned or vacant building.

Shelters, as previous and current civic politicians have concluded in obvious observations, are not homes.

And, as tenants and housing advocates have told me over the years, neither are many of the single-room-occupancy hotels.

That’s why the Balmoral and Regent hotels, known for decades as buildings with deplorable living conditions and magnets for crime, are still shuttered.

The Flint Hotel on Powell Street, which some of the campers in Oppenheimer Park moved into, was described to me by tenant Sandy Parisien as “disgusting” and “the worst place ever.”

Another camper, Edwin Yobani Zarabia, said he briefly stayed at the Flint but returned to Oppenheimer after he was shot with a BB gun.

So what to do?

Here we are in December, with temperatures falling and people still sleeping outside. Many are in poor health and live with a mental illness, an addiction, or both.

For the past decade, the city has relied on money from the provincial government to open winter shelters, with more than 300 temporary beds available this year. As memory serves, most, if not all, fill up quickly.

The city also recently opened the Britannia Community Centre, Vancouver Aquatic Centre, Powell Street Getaway and Overdose Prevention Society as “warming centres.”

Those buildings are activated when the temperature reaches -5 Celsius, or it feels like -5 C, or below. In other words, when it gets really cold like it did last week.

In addition to those buildings, 145 spaces at “extreme weather response” shelters are open. When combined with other centres of refuge, that makes for a lot of indoor space, much of it allowing carts and pets.

But if people have legitimate reasons for not wanting to stay at any of these places — whereas many others seek out the warmth, the mats and the food — where do they go?

The first answer: it’s complicated.

The second answer: look outside your window.

672,vancourier,https://www.vancourier.com/opinion/vancouver-park-board-cut-down-those-trees-1.2279145,Vancouver Park Board... cut down those trees!,['Allen Garr'],,"When forestry specialist Bill Stephen joined the Vancouver Park Board staff back in 1991, he realized the board had made a huge mistake. When the city’s urban forest strategy was in its infancy a decade earlier, they planted some 12,000 Linden trees on Vancouver streets and in its parks.

They had no idea the variety they planted (Tilia Euchlora) was notorious for attracting massive numbers of aphids from May through August.

article continues below

Also worth noting: The drier the weather, the more abundant the aphids. These aphids exude a sticky liquid called “honeydew,” which rains down on pavement, parked cars, lawn furniture, patios, laundry out to dry and plants. If there is a breeze, it will blow through open windows.

Cars and other inanimate objects require regular washing. Honeydew-coated plants, both annuals and perennials, eventually die. The liquid falling on leaves or blossoms shed by the trees causes them to stick to anything they touch, including your shoes.

The insects and their droppings also attract a large number of wasps, which regularly sting kids.

The honeydew also promotes the growth of a black sooty mould, which can trigger allergies and asthmatic attacks. I refer you to page 341 of Volume 9, Number 5, of the 2008 edition of the American Journal of Clinical Dermatology.

Realizing the problems created by Linden trees, the park board stopped planting them and that’s been the case for the past 16 years.

But, you may well ask, did the park board staff, in realizing the error of their ways, recommend the removal of those troublesome trees? Nope.

Citizens complained to their elected officials, including a Mrs. Movana Ramar with respect to nuisance trees at 46th Avenue and St. George Street, according to the board’s December 2010 minutes. Did that move them to take those trees down? Nope.

At this point in the city’s history and its “greenest city strategy,” promoted by Mayor Gregor Robertson, removing a city tree required more effort than gaining dispensation from the Pope.

Staff told the board they were spraying insecticide (soapy water) and dispatching buckets of ladybugs to try and control the aphid infestation. And did that do the trick? Not really.

The irony, of course, is while the board tenaciously held on to these troublesome trees, the urban canopy was being devastated with the full blessing of the city.

As my colleague, Mike Howell, reported in March, the number of trees removed on private property between 1995 and 2013 would be enough to cover an area the same size as Stanley Park.

Other citizens plagued by the admitted “serious mistake” of Linden trees planted on their boulevard were given short shrift.

That includes Jennifer Aarestad and her neighbour Lyz Sayer, both residents on the 800-block of West 15th Avenue. Along with the majority of homeowners on their block, they have been attempting to lobby both the park board and the city for the past five years to have the Linden trees in front of their houses removed.

Their houses are on short lots, which make their front yards effectively their back yards, and their front yards are in the line of fire of all those Linden trees and those goop-deploying, plant-destroying, car-coating, sooty mould-promoting aphids making their lives miserable.

They put together a slide show and invited park board officials to attend a meeting at VanDusen Gardens. Officials came, but there was no real resolution. They asked for a meeting with the mayor. They were refused. They offered to pay whatever it would cost to remove the Linden trees and replace them with a more compatible tree. Nothing.

Then on Tuesday morning, following an inquiry from the Courier to park board commissioner John Coupar, including the fact that this was a ridiculous situation and allowing it to persist would be exposed, I got a call from park board manager Malcolm Bromley.

Bromley assured me a meeting will be held for the residents of that blighted block within the month. Then the offer will be made to take down and replace the Lindens in two stages, with every second tree going first, including the trees in front of the Aarestad and Sayer homes. And the park board will pick up the bill.

Thank you very much. It couldn’t happen soon enough.

The notion of establishing a framework to commercialize cannabis began as a promise by the Liberal Party in the 2015 federal election campaign that led to Justin Trudeau becoming prime minister. The implementation of the policy was not as smooth as first envisioned, and the provincial governments were put in charge of setting guidelines for the sale and consumption of marijuana.

article continues below

Research Co. and Glacier Media have been tracking perceptions about legalization every six months in British Columbia. Our latest survey shows that agreement with the new rules remains high across the entire province, that some residents are starting to ponder a future when other drugs could be treated in the same fashion as cannabis, and that – in stark contrast with what we found last year – marijuana users in British Columbia are starting to acquire all of their product through licensed retailers.

As more time passes, British Columbians appear happier with the decision to end prohibition. Seven in 10 of the province’s residents (70%) agree with marijuana being legal in Canada, while 26% disagree and 3% are undecided.

These findings represent a seven-point increase since a similar survey conducted in October 2019, as legal cannabis approached its first anniversary. The groups that are more likely to voice satisfaction with the new status quo are men (75%), British Columbians aged 35 to 54 (76%) and residents of northern B.C. (80%).

In recent weeks, we have seen more talk about creating a safe supply for drugs that are currently available only through illegal means. The impact of these discussions has led to a shift in the views of British Columbians about legalizing all drugs. It must be completely acknowledged that sizable majorities of the province’s residents continue to oppose a move to place any controlled substance inside a store, but the proponents of this option have grown since late last year.

At least two-thirds of British Columbians are opposed to legalizing ecstasy (66%), powder cocaine (70%), heroin (72%), crack cocaine (73%), methamphetamine or “crystal meth” (74%) and fentanyl (75%).

Support for making some of these drugs available in a fashion that would conceivably meet the same guidelines that govern cannabis has risen over the past six months, to 25% for cocaine (up from 18%) and to 24% for heroin (up from 19%). While these are still low proportions, the fluctuation could signal the start of a trend.

Just 10% of British Columbians say they only consumed marijuana after it became legal. Identical proportions of residents tried it before October 2018 (45%) or have never consumed it in Canada (also 45%). The incidence of “legal-only” marijuana users is highest among residents aged 18 to 34 (18%) and those who live in southern B.C. (19%).

But perhaps the biggest surprise, and a source of satisfaction for policy makers, is the way in which cannabis is being sought by users. Just over half of British Columbians who have consumed marijuana since legalization (51%) say that all of their product was acquired at a licensed retailer. In October 2019, only 31% of cannabis consumers in the province were getting all of their product at a licensed retailer.

We still see 16% of British Columbians who say none of their marijuana has been bought at a licensed retailer – a proportion that climbs to 25% among those aged 55 and over. Two-thirds of cannabis consumers aged 35 to 54 (68%) are buying all of their product at a licensed retailer.

Even though the delivery of cannabis products has improved over the past six months, there are significant regional differences that are indubitably related to the presence of stores in specific areas of the province. Cannabis consumers who reside in southern B.C. and Metro Vancouver are the most likely to be getting all of their product from licensed retailers (63% and 62%). The numbers are significantly lower in Vancouver Island (29%), northern B.C. (24%) and the Fraser Valley (19%).

Finally, the issue of “drug testing” remains a priority for British Columbians, with 61% saying that companies in the province should “definitely” or “probably” be able to administer these examinations to any employee now that marijuana is legal.

After a bumpy start that featured slow store openings and hitches with delivery options, there are signs that cannabis legalization is starting to work in a better fashion. More consumers are getting all of their product through licensed retailers, and the number of “new users” has not increased dramatically. Still, the significant regional disparities suggest that more marijuana outlets will need to be authorized in order to effectively eliminate the black market.

Provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix announced July 15 that there were 21 new cases in the past 24 hours, including two cases that they call ""epi-linked,"" or presumed cases that have not been proven through testing but are being treated as official cases.

The province has now recorded 3,149 cases since the novel coronavirus first appeared in B.C. in late January.

More than 87.4% of those infected, or 2,753 people, have recovered. Of those who haven't, 189 people have died and 207 people are actively fighting the virus. Only 14 people are hospitalized, with five of those in intensive care units. The rest are self-isolating at home. There were no new deaths recorded in the past 24 hours.

Recording at least 20 new COVID-19 cases in a 24-hour period has become common in B.C., and Henry said yesterday that she found that number ""distressing,"" even though, she added, the good news is that the province knows where the clusters of infection are, many of the infections are linked and the number is not really that large given the province's population of more than five million residents.

The numbers in the past week were:

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12;

• 21 new cases on July 13;

• 13 new cases on July 14; and now

• 21 new cases on July 15.

In June, the number of daily new cases many times was in the single digits.

""There is one active community outbreak, in addition to several community exposure events,"" Henry and Dix said. ""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks.""

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,023 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,659 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 216 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

The Federal Bureau of Prisons is expected to take Sidoo into custody on September 23 and release him from a Pacific Northwest area facility just before Christmas.

article continues below

Sidoo, 61, appeared online via Zoom in front of United States District Judge Nathaniel Gorton of the United States District Court for District of Massachusetts, as well as his lawyers and prosecutors. He wore a plaid suit while sitting in an office space inside his $31.7 million home in Vancouver’s Point Grey neighbourhood.

Sidoo, now a convicted felon, initially pled innocent to fraud and money laundering charges; he teared up before being sentenced and read a prepared statement:

“The last several months have been the hardest in my entire life and today I accept the court’s decision without reservation. No words can express how sorry I am for my decisions and actions that led to this day. I make no excuses, your honour. I broke the law and pled guilty and I now must pay for my actions.

“To my wife and boys, all I ever wanted was your love and respect and to be a good role model. And I know I have made a terrible mistake that has deeply affected our family. To my friends and colleagues and former teammates over the years, I am deeply ashamed today. To the young men and women who looked up to me as a role model, you deserve better. To the court and all of you, I wish to apologize for my actions.

“I will serve my sentence and am committed to returning to the community and doing everything possible to make a positive impact. I hope in time people will not judge me for the worst mistake in my life but for the work in the days, weeks and years ahead in which I am committed to being a better man.”

Gorton told Sidoo he was “impressed” by the businessman’s “obvious remorse.”

But Gorton pointed out two omissions in Sidoo’s statement.

“You expect to put this behind you and go forward and make up for what you called mistakes. I would call it a crime, not a mistake, but nevertheless, it is important that you acknowledge it and realize how many constituencies you have disappointed,” said the judge.

Sidoo also did not explicitly acknowledge that his crimes resulted in two students missing an opportunity to attend the universities his sons, Dylan Sidoo and Jordan Sidoo, were admitted to.

“What you accomplished, along with getting them into college, is to deprive two other deserving students of admittance into those universities — an act that is the very antithesis of one you want to be known for,” said Gorton.

Likewise, United States Attorney Andrew Lelling submitted to Gorton: “Sidoo engaged in serious criminal conduct involving fraud and deception that stretched over multiple years.

“His crimes warrant significant punishment. By engaging in the scheme, with [scheme mastermind Rick Singer] and others, Sidoo was able to steal two college admissions slots for his sons, including one from the University of California at Berkeley, one of the top public universities in the nation.”

Sidoo, said Gorton, “committed a crime that displayed an unbelievable lack of integrity, morality and common sense.

“You have let your selfish desire, your pride and your enormous wealth overcome all of what you apparently want to stand for with your works of charity,” Gorton told Sidoo.

Sidoo’s philanthropy, derived from his earnings in the capital markets, was central to his sentencing defense. According to Sidoo he has donated several million dollars to charitable causes, such as the University of B.C. football program.

In pleading guilty to fraud, Sidoo avoided a maximum prison term of 20 years and prosecutors subsequently agreed to 90 days behind bars, plus a $250,000 fine and one-year of supervised release, which will not be enforced in Canada by the U.S. Probation Department. Prosecutors also agreed to drop the money laundering charge.

The prison Sidoo goes to is expected to have harsher conditions since his options are limited due to his foreign citizenship. His attorney Martin Weinberg said he is expected to spend 14 days in isolation in a “maximum security setting,” due to COVID-19.

Sidoo will get four days credit for time already served. If he serves the full 90 days he will be released December 17 but will have to spend 14 days in isolation at home should B.C. public health rules for international travellers and COVID-19 continue into the fall.

Gorton said Sidoo’s crime would normally warrant more time in jail but there are mitigating circumstances, such as his remorse, lack of criminal record, philanthropy and “collateral consequences,” such as not being able to enter the U.S. as a felon and being stripped last month of his Order of B.C. medal for community service. Sidoo’s attorneys also previously noted he did not directly pay the universities but that his fraud was limited to cheating on the tests.

The former B.C. Lions football player worked as a stock broker in the 1990s and an investment banker between 2000 and 2010. Since 2010 he has made millions of dollars directing a handful of public companies that have failed to generate wealth for retail investors.

Sidoo was arrested March 8, 2019, in San Jose, California, on charges by the U.S. Department of Justice of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering related to the high-profile U.S. college admissions and bribery scandal, brought to light by a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe dubbed Operation Varsity Blues.

One of dozens of parents to be charged, Sidoo initially pled innocent to paying $200,000 total to scheme mastermind William ‘Rick’ Singer, who hired corrupt exam expert Mark Riddell to take Dylan and Jordan’s SAT exams, in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Sidoo also helped falsify one of his son Jordan’s university applications in October 2013 with an essay that originally included a fake claim of Jordan being held up at gunpoint by gangsters, while he was purported to be an intern for an anti-gang organization.

Co-conspirators Singer and Riddell pled guilty last year in exchange for cooperating with the government’s investigation.

The guilty parties in the case, who used Singer’s criminal services, were generally well-off individuals. Celebrities such as actress Lori Loughlin and her clothing designer husband Mossimo Gianulli and actress Felicity Huffman also pled guilty for related crimes and brought much media attention to the investigation.

Sidoo’s sons had no involvement in their father’s crime.

Jordan is now a 2018 history graduate from University of California Berkeley. Dylan graduated in cinematic arts in 2016 from the University of Southern California (USC). The two previously attended Vancouver’s prestigious St. George’s School.

Neither university has announced whether or not their degrees will remain valid. Dylan, according to the sentencing documents, had scored a 1,460/2,400 SAT score until Riddell, using a fake ID in December 2011, bumped up the score to 1,700, which was high enough for Dylan to enter Chapman University (and later transfer to USC). Riddell then scored 2,280/2,400 for Jordan in December 2012, paving the way to Berkley.

Riddell also took a high school test for Dylan. The B.C. Ministry of Education has issued no statement on how its testing process was so vulnerable to fraud.

Both sons have since entered into penny stock promotion with their father.

Exactly one week ago, on July 7, the province recorded 12 new cases. What followed was an uptick in recorded cases:

• 18 new cases on July 8;

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12; and

• 21 new cases on July 13.

""I know it was distressing to me to see 20, especially 25 [new cases] one day,"" Henry said. ""That's way above my comfort zone.""

She added, however, that the slight rise in cases was not unexpected, given that the province has been allowing restaurants and other indoor businesses to reopen.

""We do know where those cases are,"" she said. ""We're testing the people who need to be tested.""

It would be more concerning, she said, if the cases were spread out across the province in an unlinked way. The most recent cluster of cases is linked to the Krazy Cherry Fruit Company in Oliver, she announced yesterday (July 13).

Given B.C.'s population, 20 cases in one day is also better than some other jurisdictions, she said.

The province has identified 3,128 infections since the virus first appeared in the province in late January.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,015 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1649 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 212 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 52 people who reside outside Canada.

Of the 209 people currently fighting COVID-19 in B.C., 14 people are in hospital with five of those in intensive care units. That leaves 2,730 people who have recovered from the virus.

No new deaths from the virus were identified in the past 24 hours, leaving the death toll at 189 people.

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

So far 399 residents and 252 staff at seniors' care facilities have been infected by COVID-19 in B.C.

Health Minister Adrian Dix said that it is his understanding that the federal government and the U.S. government have agreed to extend the closure of the two countries' border for one additional month, until August 21.

""This is obviously positive and necessary news,"" he said. ""Everybody who lives in B.C. knows how inconvenient and how difficult that is for many businesses and many individuals for a variety of circumstances.""

Harry Bains said injured workers have complained for too long that the system lacks fairness and support in times of injury and recovery.

article continues below

Changes Bains proposes include raising the maximum annual salary on which compensation benefits are based; authorizing WorkSafeBC to provide preventative medical treatment before claim acceptance; giving powers to the court to issue WorkSafeBC search and seizure warrants appropriate for investigating workplace safety infractions; and giving people a voice in serious workplace prosecutions and trials by using victim impact statements.

Victoria is also fast-tracking legislation to handle situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic so workers can access benefits more easily.

During the pandemic, the regulator is allowing businesses to defer paying their premiums for six months without penalty or interest. It is also waiving premiums on wages paid to workers of employers receiving the Canadian Emergency Wage Subsidy.

The amendments to the Workers Compensation Act comes after three expert reviews were completed in 2018 and 2019.

The ministry said of the more than 44,000 injured workers currently receiving permanent disability benefits because of a work-related injury, about 35% are in the Lower Mainland, while the rest are spread throughout all regions of B.C.

There are more than 100,000 workplace injury or fatality claims annually.

In 2019, there were 140 workplace fatalities in B.C. Of that number, 84 were due to occupational disease, 40 to traumatic injury and 16 the result of a motor vehicle incident.

In a fiscal update Tuesday, B.C. Finance Minister Carole James said the COVID-19 pandemic will result in ""the worst downturn experienced in our province in recent history.""

article continues below

""The projected numbers are staggering, but they're not without hope,"" James said, in summing up B.C.'s fiscal position.

She said B.C. had entered the pandemic perhaps better situated than other provinces, as it had a balanced budget, a triple AAA credit rating and one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country.

B.C. also managed to contain the pandemic and flatten its growth curve better than some other provinces, and it has been able to move earlier on a phased economic restart plan.

""Because of that strength, we were able to take immediate action to help people, to help businesses, to help communities with our $5 billion COVID action plan,"" James said.

She said the province is expecting a loss of $4.2 billion in tax revenue, including $1 billion less in personal income tax revenue, $973 million less in corporate taxes, $1.3 billion in provincial sales tax revenue, $300 million in natural resource revenues and $882 million less in Crown Corporation income.

The province is also spending $5 billion in emergency spending, and has approved $1.3 billion in tax credits and deferrals. In total, the increased spending, lost tax revenue and foregone revenue will bring the deficit to $12.5 billion.

In February, James brought down, but never passed, a balanced budget and modest surplus of $227 million and provincial GDP growth projections of 2% in 2020.

""Mere weeks after the budget 2020 was tabled, our entire world changed,"" James said.

James said the B.C. economy is now expected to contract 6.8% in 2020, according to some forecasters.

Since February, B.C. lost 235,000 jobs, and saw retail sales declined by 23.6% in April compared to February. Overall, home prices dropped 4%.

Home sales declined 45.4% in May, compared to February, and B.C. merchandise exports are down 14.7% year-to-date, compared to January to May 2019.

""While the job losses in March and April were record-breaking, figures for May and June in fact have seen some recovery of the losses that we experienced in the previous two months,"" James said.

Asked if her government planned to resort to spending cuts to address the deficit, James said ""now is not the time to be able to cut back on services and support for people and business in British Columbia.""

As for any long-range plans for dealing with debt and deficits, James said: ""I do not believe that it's going to be a quick fix.""

Asked if the $5 billion that her government has already approved could be added to later this year, James said ""I believe the $5 billion is enough now.""

However, she added no one can predict what might happen should there be a second wave of COVID-19.

As for the $22 billion in capital spending allocated in the 2020 budget over three years for big capital works projects, like new schools, hospitals, bridges and roads, that will continue to be spent.

""This is going to serve us very well because it translates into huge investments,"" James said.

682,vancourier,https://www.vancourier.com/authors/gun-violence-imported-from-u-s-is-a-key-concern-for-canadians-1.24169958,Gun violence imported from U.S. is a key concern for Canadians,['Mario Canseco'],,"National governments have a tendency to overreact immediately after they are forced to face an unexpected challenge. No example is better than the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks in the United States, which gave us the “Patriot Act” after just 45 days of deliberation to expand government surveillance of Americans to previously unimagined levels.

In mid-April, the actions of Gabriel Wortman led to the deaths of 22 people in Nova Scotia after multiple shootings and fires. Most Canadians, at the time still under lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, were horrified at Wortman’s actions, which included impersonating a police officer.

article continues below

It took the federal government only 13 days after Wortman’s criminal activity was evident for the entire country to announce a nationwide ban on 1,500 types of military-grade “assault-style” weapons in Canada. Any Canadian who possesses these firearms will have two years to get rid of them. The prohibition led to many new discussions about the role that firearms play in Canada’s urban and rural areas.

We know now that the perpetrator of the 22 murders in Nova Scotia had obtained his weapons illegally from Canadian and American sources. This was not a surprise for Canadian authorities, who have consistently reported that more than 70% of the weapons used in gun-related crimes in our country come from the United States.

On the issue of firearms, Canada is decidedly different from the United States. In Canada, it is not legal for a person to own or carry a firearm for the purpose of self defence against human beings. When Research Co. and Glacier Media asked Canadians about this key precept of Canadian law, more than three in four (77%) agreed with it, while 18% disagreed and 5% were undecided.

Atlantic Canada (31%), Saskatchewan and Manitoba (29%) and Alberta (24%) boast the highest number of residents who openly question Canada’s long-standing regulations for firearms. While higher than what is observed in Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia, these are not proportions of voters that would sway an election, certainly not in the way American statewide and congressional races can be tilted if your candidate can adequately hold a shotgun and recite the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution in a manner that panders to the base.

Fewer than one in five Canadians welcome the notion of citizens carrying firearms for something other than hunting or scaring wildlife away. Any survey measuring opinions on banning “assault-style” weapons would be met with near unanimity. The opposition reacted to the announced ban as it always has under its outgoing leader, by claiming the regulations would affect law-abiding Canadians. Lost in this unfortunate combination of inadequate polling and incapable opposition are the solutions that matter to Canadians.

In our survey, more than three in five Canadians (63%) told us that gun violence in Canada is a “very serious” or “moderately serious” problem – a proportion that climbs to 69% among women and 68% among those aged 55 and over.

Sizable majorities of Ontarians and British Columbians, who have experienced gang wars in urban areas, are more likely to look at gun violence as particularly problematic (76% and 67%, respectively). The COVID-19 pandemic did little to curb gun violence in Toronto, where 61 people were shot in the first four months of the year.

We asked Canadians about the effectiveness of four possible measures, and their responses outline a public that is ready for bold action. More than three in five Canadians (62%) think enacting a complete ban on handguns would be “very effective” or “moderately effective” in reducing gun violence in Canada. Most crimes, after all, are not being committed with the military-grade “assault-style” weapons that the federal government was quick to ban.

A higher proportion of Canadians deem two other measures as effective: imposing mandatory jail terms for crimes committed with firearms (74%) and introducing new outreach programs to steer youth away from gangs (also 74%).

Canadians place dealing with firearms smuggled from the United States as the most important issue that needs to be addressed. Many of the country’s residents also want to make sure gangs are not attractive to our country’s youth and believe mandatory minimum jail sentences would act as a deterrent.

Banning military-grade “assault-style” weapons is low-hanging fruit in a challenge that definitely has Canadians preoccupied and wishing for a type of government intervention that goes beyond a photo-op celebrated by poorly executed survey charity work.

True sociologists know that we learn nothing from posing the wrong questions to Canadians, and capable politicians should go beyond voicing displeasure with plans and proposals just because that is what they are expected to do. Meanwhile, Canadians are still worried about gun violence and expecting their elected officials to do better. •

Virtually.

Thursday, the BCHL launched a simulation — created in the EA Sports video game NHL2020 — of the rest of the league’s playoff series that were cancelled March 13, just as the second round of the post-season was set to begin.

A player representative from each of the eight teams remaining in the playoff tourney is handling the game controls in a head-to-head match-up against their second-round opponent, with a two-minute highlight reel — complete with commentary by the teams’ broadcasters — posted to the league website.

“We were looking for a way to keep fans engaged during this unfortunate downtime,” BCHL commissioner Chris Hebb said in a press release. “We’ve tried to make it a fun and unique BCHL experience for everyone to enjoy.”

The initiative sprang from a project by the former director of communications for the Express, Jacob Lazare. Bored and restless after the team dispatched the Langley Rivermen from the playoffs’ first round in four straight games and were awaiting the start of the second round, he put together a simulation of a series between Coquitlam and the Surrey Eagles, who took seven games to defeat the Chilliwack Chiefs.

Lazare said he was able to use the video game’s various customization features to recreate the rosters of the two rivals, ranking each player’s attributes and tendencies, like their skating ability, speed, puck-handling skills and physicality, on a scale from zero to 99.

“You can go through and create a player that mimics the actual players realistically,” Lazare told The Tri-City News, adding he can set a dazzling skater like Massimo Rizzo to weave around defenders and a skilled stickman like defender Drew Cooper to repel onrushing forwards one-on-one.

While his own knowledge of the Express gleaned from running the team’s video camera during games helped him build Coquitlam’s digital doppelgänger, Lazare reached out to contacts at the Eagles to inform his recreations of Surrey’s players.

The effort was an amusing distraction that got some attention on social media.

But when the actual series, and the rest of the season, was scrubbed because of the pandemic, the league reached out to spin his effort into a virtual march to the Fred Page Cup championship.

Lazare said it takes him a couple of hours to handicap all the players for each team, and additional time to create facsimiles of the uniforms and match headshots with the game’s graphics.

“It’s just to make it so fans can recognize their teams’ players,” he said of the laborious attention to detail.

Lazare lamented, however, that limitations in the game don’t allow him to recreate the cozy confines of BCHL arenas, so the virtual players are battling in front of likely the biggest crowds they’ve ever experienced, even if they’re comprised entirely of pixels.

Lazare said having actual players contest the rest of the playoffs, albeit with the help of the game’s artificial intelligence, adds an extra wrinkle of unpredictability, which is part of the fun.

“Somebody is able to win it for their team,” he said. “There can be upsets involved.”

The first series, contested between Express goalie Joe Howe and Hassan Akl of the Surrey Eagles, is already decided, with the three remaining series to be posted in the coming days. The third round of the playoff simulation commences next week.",[]

Tuesday, Batchelor put out the call to fans and his followers for random videos to which he would apply his vocal talents.

“I'm bored,” he said, adding he’ll do three such play-by-play calls a day.

HIs first three calls were a golfer at the driving range, a cat losing its mind in a cardboard box and a couple of pillow fighters blinded by hoods pulled over their faces.

“Keep ’em coming,” Batchelor said afterward.

Batchelor has been the Canucks’ play-by-play man since 2017 after several years calling Vancouver Giants games.

The Dr. Charles Best secondary school grad said he honed his commentary chops calling goals and assists while playing road hockey in the driveway of his parents’ home on Harbour Drive, playing table hockey in the basement and video games.

“I was huge into hockey,” Batchelor told The Tri-City News.

To fulfill his dream of announcing the sport, Batchelor studied broadcasting at BCIT and volunteered doing public address announcements for the Burnaby Express of the BC Hockey League (BCHL), then followed the team when it returned to Coquitlam.

In 2012, Batchelor became the broadcaster for the BCHL’s Surrey Eagles, then graduated to the Giants and the Western Hockey League the next year.

His Twitter project follows the lead of another social media effort by Port Moody’s Al Murdoch, the Canucks’ public address announcer. He has been taking requests to call goals and assists for the team’s fans and minor hockey players, posting one a day for his followers.

Murdoch said he launched the initiative because he missed doing the announcements at Rogers Arena, especially as the Canucks were in the thick of the playoff race before the season was abruptly suspended March 12.

He said he also wanted to help lift spirits at a time when everyone is anxious about the pandemic and its mounting economic and societal consequences.

His idea has since been picked up by other announcers, including Mike Ross of the Toronto Maple Leafs and the New Jersey Devils' goal and assist caller, Kevin Clark.

In terms of overall global impact, however, the best comparison may be the 1918 influenza pandemic, which was inaccurately named “Spanish Flu.”

The NHL’s response to COVID-19 has likewise been compared to the 1918 pandemic for obvious reasons: the only year the Stanley Cup was not awarded was 1919, because of a flu outbreak that ravaged the roster of the Montreal Canadiens during the playoff series. The timeline for the pandemic and the hockey season deserves some closer scrutiny, however, as it provides an important warning.

article continues below

Just like now, the 1918 pandemic threw the world of sports into chaos. College football games were cancelled or postponed, though some ignored bans and played games in front of large crowds anyway. Bowling alleys were closed, to great protest, and the public was urged to stop gathering together for games of rugby and baseball.

Professional sports, however, continued unabated. The Major League Baseball season continued even as the flu spread across the United States. When the league ended the regular season early in September, it was because of World War I shutting down non-essential industries, not the flu, and the league still played the World Series later that month.

Perhaps it was for the best: the second wave of the flu struck in October and November, the deadliest wave of the pandemic. The early end to the MLB season might have saved lives.

The NHL, meanwhile, chose to begin their season as planned in December, despite the danger. To be fair, the league wasn’t playing to thousands of fans in large arenas at the time. The Montreal Canadiens played in Jubilee Arena, with a seating capacity of 3,000.

It was also a much, much smaller league. Just three teams played during the 1918-19 season: the Canadiens, Toronto Arenas, and Ottawa Senators. It was just the second season for the fledgling NHL and what threatened the league’s operations wasn’t influenza, but legal actions and competing leagues. This was despite one player, Hamby Shore of the Senators, already having died from the pandemic in October.

Only 18 games of the planned 20-game season were played, but again, it wasn’t because of concerns due to the flu. The Arenas, who were the defending Stanley Cup champions, were a mess behind the scenes — their players didn’t have contracts and were being paid under the table and attendance for the struggling Arenas was abysmal — and officially withdrew from the league in February.

The Canadiens defeated the Senators for the NHL championship and travelled to Seattle to play the Pacific Coast Hockey Association champion Seattle Metropolitans. Worry over the flu pandemic had subsided to a certain extent. After all, it had been a full year since the first outbreak in the US.

In Seattle, the schools had reopened in January. By March, no influenza deaths were reported in the city. It seemed like the danger had largely passed, so why not play for the Stanley Cup?

Then, in Game 5, veteran defenceman Joe Hall collapsed on the ice. He was hospitalized with a temperature of 104 F. Players on both teams reported symptoms of the flu and, eventually, all but three of the Canadiens players were diagnosed.

The Canadiens tried to forfeit the Cup to Seattle, but the Metropolitans refused to win the Cup that way and the series was cancelled. Hall contracted pneumonia and passed away a few days after the final game was to be played.

What can the NHL learn from this experience? One important aspect is that they can’t let their guard down. It seemed like the worst had passed when the Canadiens travelled to Seattle, but that clearly wasn’t the case. That strain of the flu even came back for another wave in 1920.

The other aspect is how quickly the flu was able to spread through the entire Canadiens roster. The NHL can’t get back to playing before there are clear protocols for identifying who is carrying the COVID-19 virus and quarantining those affected. That can’t happen until tests are widespread and readily available to the general population.

Most importantly, the NHL needs to understand that this could take a long time. While medical science has taken leaps and bounds in the last century, there’s no guarantee that the COVID-19 pandemic will be dealt with any faster than that of the 1918 flu pandemic. Fortunately, the league appears to be taking this pandemic far more seriously than a century ago.

Big Numbers

7 Under the more progressive PCHA rules, which allowed forward passing in all zones of the ice, the Metropolitans dominated the Canadiens in 1919, scoring 7 goals in Games 1 and 3. The Canadiens won two games played under NHL rules, while Game 4 ended in a tie.

Stick-taps and Glove-drops

A tap of the stick to all the healthcare workers in Vancouver, British Columbia, and around the world that are on the frontlines of this pandemic. In a just world, you’d all be paid like professional hockey players.

A stick-tap to Vancouver residents who have taken to cheering for said health care workers every evening at 7 p.m. Without being able to cheer for the Canucks, you’ve chosen the right people to cheer on.

The Western Hockey League made that official today with the cancellation of the 2020 WHL playoffs.

Following a meeting with the WHL Board of Governors and consultation with medical professionals, it was determined that the best course of action was the 2020 WHL Playoffs not be contested due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Nothing is more important to the WHL than the health and safety of our players, officials, staff, and fans,” commented WHL Commissioner Ron Robison. “Without any ability to predict as to when it will be safe and responsible to return to play, the WHL has made the difficult decision to cancel the WHL Playoffs and the balance of the 2019-20 season. All of us at the WHL will continue to do our part in battling this virus so that we may be in a position to enjoy more WHL hockey.”

Despite obvious disappointment, the Vancouver Giants support this difficult decision which prioritizes the long-term safety of the public, all players and staff.

While the sting of this news is still fresh, the Giants want to first assure all season ticket holders and corporate sponsors that they’ll receive full value on their 2019-20 investment with the club. The operations, business and ticketing staff are currently working on contingency plans, and hope is to have those plans in place by April.

It wasn’t the same every time, but he always sent out a special hello “to all hospital patients and shut-ins, the pensioners and the blind, those fans who can’t get out to hockey games.”

Right now, of course, no fans can get out to hockey games. There are no hockey games to get out to. We all need that special hello from Robson.

article continues below

Taking inspiration from Robson, here are the 10 best Canucks play-by-play calls of all time to help you get through this time of social distancing and self-quarantining with no hockey. Appropriately, Robson himself shows up a few times.

Honourable mention: “Let’s it go, he scores!”

Sometimes the best call is no call at all. Sometimes you have to let the moment speak for itself.

Consider the 2009 World Juniors when Pierre McGuire ruined a great moment and a fantastic goal call from Gord Miller.

Canada was down 5-4 in the final minute of their semi-final game against Russia. All hope seemed loss as the puck was stuck in a board battle with just seconds left to play. Somehow, the puck came out of the scrum and John Tavares shoveled the puck towards the goal, where it was blocked. That’s when Jordan Eberle found the loose puck, cut to his backhand and scored the tying goal with six seconds left.

Miller cut loose with a superb goal call, adding grit to his voice as he roared, “Eberle scores! Tie game! Can you believe it?”

“I can!” came McGuire’s entirely unnecessary response to Miller’s rhetorical question. As the fans cheered and the Canadian players celebrated, McGuire started breaking down the play, drowning out the moment with minutiae.

Compare that to how John Shorthouse and John Garrett treated Daniel Sedin’s overtime game-winning goal in the Sedins’ final home game. At the six second mark of the above video, Shorthouse excitedly shouts, “He scores!” and then he and Garrett don’t say a single word for over two-and-a-half minutes.

It was exactly what the moment needed, letting the sights and sounds of the crowd and of the Canucks mobbing the Sedins do all the talking.

1 | “Henrik! From Daniel! Canucks win in four overtimes!”

Sometimes a purely factual goal call is the best, particularly when the facts of the moment already have some serious heft.

This goal came during the 2007 playoffs and is one of the longest games in NHL history, lasting two hours, 18 minutes, and six seconds before Henrik Sedin ended it. It’s definitely the longest game in Canucks history, as Marty Turco and Roberto Luongo went save-for-save in the opening game of the playoff series between the Canucks and Dallas Stars.

It was a preview of what was to come: an incredible goaltending battle that lasted all seven games, including two more games that went to overtime. Incredibly, Turco had three shutouts in the series, as well as going three full overtime periods without allowing a goal, but still lost the series to Luongo and the Canucks.

John Shorthouse nailed the call of the game-winning goal in Game 1, letting his excitement carry the moment rather than any fancy verbiage.

As the Sedins cycled around the offensive zone — keeping in mind this is prior to their dominance in the years to come — Shorthouse let the excitement build in his voice, ramping up at the moment Daniel Sedin sent a centring pass to his brother in front for the goal. Then Shorthouse punctuated it perfectly.

“Henrik! From Daniel! Canucks win in four overtimes!”

Shorthouse’s call of the goal has shown up frequently in montages ever since.

“The Sedins on that shift looked like they were possessed!” added Tom Larscheid. I’m betting Alain Vigneault didn’t laugh at that description, unlike when Kyle Wellwood was described as playing like “a man possessed.”

Long-time Bulies will also recognize this as the game from which “Pass it to Bulis” originated, but that’s a story for another time.

2 | “GREG ADAMS! GREG ADAMS!”

Sometimes you don’t need to describe anything at all for an iconic call. All you need is a great moment and a name.

It doesn’t even have to be a unique name. After all, there were two Gregs Adams.

This goal was, of course, the overtime game-winner that sent the Canucks to the 1994 Stanley Cup Final, eliminating the Toronto Maple Leafs. That’s a big moment with plenty of emotional weight. Somehow the simplicity of just repeating the goal scorer’s name made it even more momentous.

“Long shot, Potvin had trouble with it! Adams shots, scores! GREG ADAMS! GREG ADAMS! Adams gets the winner! 14 seconds into the second overtime. The Vancouver Canucks are going to the Stanley Cup Final!”

It’s that last bit that Shorthouse appreciated so much, describing it as perfect: the sheer wonder and disbelief in Robson’s voice as he said, “The Vancouver Canucks are going to the Stanley Cup Final!”

Robson himself isn’t the biggest fan of his goal call — “I couldn’t think of anything else to say, I said his name three times, that wasn’t necessary” — but he was always a bit of a perfectionist.

“I’m not proud of those calls,” said Robson in 2018. “At the end of a broadcast, you think of what you could have said, could have done.”

I’ll go with Shorthouse’s opinion: the call was perfect.

3 | “Brendan Morrison! A silencer!”

Before the four-overtime game in 2007, the longest game in Canucks history was Game 6 of the opening round of the 2004 playoffs against the Calgary Flames. It went three overtimes, lasting one hour, 42 minutes, and 28 seconds and ended in an identical 5-4 score.

This was a particularly wild game: the Canucks went up 4-0 through the first half of the game, but the Flames clawed their way back with four unanswered goals. It seemed like the Flames had all the momentum heading into overtime, but Alex Auld and the Canucks stalled the Flames through two overtimes until Brendan Morrison came through in the clutch.

Chris Cuthbert nailed the call, with an emotional vocal break on the word, “Scores!” as Morrison tucked the puck around Miikka Kiprusoff. His emphatic delivery following the goal is what sells it.

“Brendan Morrison! A silencer! And we will have game seven!”

The denouement following this classic climax is a little unfortunate — the Flames won Game 7 to send the Canucks home — but this was still a fantastic goal call.

4 | “They’ve tied the game!”

Most great goal calls come in the playoffs, as that’s where a lot of the most excitement and meaningful moments occur. Occasionally you get a great moment during the regular season that requires a great goal call, like this one from a game against the Toronto Maple Leafs on March 6, 2000.

Shorthouse’s goal call is soaked with pure disbelief, which requires some context to understand.

The Leafs were up 5-1 in the third period. Darcy Tucker had scored two shorthanded goals to truly demoralize the Canucks fans in attendance, who surely thought the game was over.

Five minutes into the third period, however, Ed Jovanovski scored on the power play to make it 5-2. Still, the Canucks were down by three with just seven minutes remaining. Then Alexander Mogilny scored at 13:16 to make it 5-3. Rookie Harold Druken added another at 17:48 to make it 5-4.

In the final minute of the third period, however, it seemed impossible that the Canucks could complete the comeback. Mogilny was in the box for interference, so the Canucks were shorthanded. It seemed like there was no way for the Canucks to score.

Then Markus Naslund made a way.

Ed Jovanovski sent a great pass ahead to Naslund and he undressed Glenn Healy with a deke to the backhand for the tying goal. If Shorthouse sounds incredulous, it’s for good reason: four unanswered goals in less than 15 minutes.

“Naslund! Into the zone! Dekes! Scores! They’ve tied the game!”

To top it off, the goal came at 19:19 for number 19.

Just ignore that Mats Sundin went on to score the winner for the Leafs in overtime, ruining the comeback. It’s still a classic call.

5 | “They’re still alive!”

As mentioned above, Game 7 against the Flames in 2004 didn’t end well for the Canucks, but it still gave us an iconic moment in Canucks history and a classic goal call from Chris Cuthbert.

The Canucks were down by one with less than a minute to go in the third period, but they were on the power play and had the goaltender pulled, giving them a six-on-four. At least, they did until Ed Jovanovski took an undisciplined penalty in front of the Flames goal, repeatedly crosschecking Rhett Warrener, including one that caught the Flames defenceman in the neck.

That eventually led to the indelible image of Jovanovski going absolutely nuts in the penalty box as he watched what ensued.

Cuthbert’s call is a play-by-play master class. Notice all the details he casually dropped into his call, while simultaneously building the excitement of the moment.

“Debris on the ice and 15 seconds left. Iginla has the stick knocked out of his hand and he falls at centre. Naslund dashing in. 10 seconds left! Markus Naslund to the net. Stopped... scores! Scores! Matt Cooke cashes in! 5.7 seconds left! And they’re still alive!”

Cuthbert creates a countdown with the mention of 15, then 10 seconds left, which ramps up the tension of the moment. He takes notice of the debris thrown on the ice by a fan without missing a beat in his call. He adds in the crucial detail of Jarome Iginla getting his stick knocked out of his hand away from the puck. He even gets in a quick, “Stopped!” during the split second between the initial save and Cooke scoring.

It’s brilliant.

6 | “It’s a wonderful day for an exorcism.”

One of the most famous goals in Canucks history has two great goal calls. We’ll start with Jim Hughson’s call on the CBC broadcast.

The situation: the Canucks were in Game 7 against their dreaded rivals, the Chicago Blackhawks, who had knocked the Canucks out of the postseason in each of the two previous seasons.

2011 was supposed to be different. The Canucks were clearly the best team in the NHL heading into the playoffs. They won the Presidents’ Trophy with ten more points than the next best team. They led the league in both goals for and goals against, had the number-one ranked power play, and the second-best penalty kill.

Daniel Sedin led the league in scoring and won the Art Ross. Ryan Kesler scored 41 goals and won the Selke as the league’s best defensive forward. Daniel and Henrik Sedin were first-team All-Stars. This was a team of destiny: how could they get knocked out in the first round by the Blackhawks?

The series started as expected: the top-seeded Canucks won the first three games to take a seemingly-insurmountable 3-0 series lead. Then the wheels came off and the Blackhawks started surmounting.

The Blackhawks demolished the Canucks 7-2 in Game 4, and then did it again in Game 5, shutting out the Canucks 5-0. After a pair of blowout losses, Alain Vigneault shocked Canucks fans by starting Cory Schneider over Luongo in Game 6, but Schneider suffered a leg cramp in the third period and Luongo went in. With a strong performance in relief, Luongo got the call for Game 7.

There was no blowout here. Luongo made 31 saves, allowing just one goal. It was a crucial one, however, a shorthanded, game-tying goal late in the third period by Jonathan Toews to send the game to overtime. Just like that, the unthinkable — the Presidents’ Trophy-winning Canucks giving up a 3-0 series lead in the first round — seemed all too possible.

That’s when Alex Burrows saved the day.

Burrows caught a Chris Campoli clearance attempt, dropped the puck down to his stick, and blasted a slap shot past Corey Crawford for the overtime winner. Cuthbert’s call of the goal is solid, but it’s the unexpected line at the end that sticks to the memory banks.

“For Vancouver, it’s a wonderful day for an exorcism.”

The line is delivered with panache. It’s incongruous — when do you ever hear “wonderful” and “exorcism” in the same sentence? — but it perfectly captures the moment, as Alex Burrows exorcised the Canucks’ playoff demons against Chicago.

7 | “They’ve slayed the dragon!”

Here’s the same goal, but with John Shorthouse’s call from the radio broadcast: “They’ve slayed the dragon!”

Whether you prefer Cuthbert’s “exorcism” line or Shorthouse’s “slayed the dragon” line likely comes down to a matter of preference, but it’s the latter that led to a memorable nickname for Alex Burrows: The Dragon-Slayer.

“The day the Canucks found out who they were playing,” recalled Shorthouse in 2019, “I got an email from my friend in California saying, ‘Time to slay the dragon.’ That was the subject line. I didn’t really think about it, I didn’t plan it as something I would ever say, but it just popped into my head as the puck went in.”

There’s something about the spontaneity of the call that makes it extra special. It wasn’t just a pre-planned line: it was something true to the moment.

8 | “Alex Burrows has done it again!”

This was the moment when every Canucks fan was certain the Canucks would win the Stanley Cup. Just bask in this moment and ignore everything else that happened after.

Alex Burrows opened the scoring in this game before the Bruins replied with two goals in the second period. Thanks to a third period goal from Daniel Sedin (assisted by Burrows), the game went to overtime. There was a lot of nervous energy in the building that exploded just 11 seconds into overtime, as Burrows wasted no time getting his second goal of the game.

There’s something about the sheer disbelief in Cuthbert’s voice that makes this a great call. Just think about the journey Burrows took to get to this goal. He was undrafted, arguably better known in the ball hockey world than the ice hockey world. He spent two full seasons in the ECHL, and then worked his way up from the AHL to the Canucks’ fourth line, then the third, before a gut feeling from Alain Vigneault landed him on the first line with the Sedins. He went from nothing to becoming a crucial part of the best line in the entire NHL and here he was in the Stanley Cup Final, scoring an overtime game-winning goal — not even his best known overtime game-winning goal of those playoffs.

“Alex Burrows has done it again!”

9 | Brown to Bure

This goal gets remembered as “Brown to Bure,” but that’s not exactly what Robson said. Instead, he said, “Brown, a long pass to Pavel Bure. In the clear, right in!”

What makes this an all-time great call, however, is Tom Larscheid going full homer, screaming a nearly incoherent “Yes!” before Jim Robson even said, “He scores!”

To top it off, Robson threw in some wonderful alliteration: “Pavel Bure picked up a perfect pass” and Larscheid added, “This is the greatest moment in Vancouver Canucks history.”

As you might expect, Robson isn’t “particularly proud of the call,” and pointed out that he hesitated to say “scores” because the red light didn’t come on and he wanted to make sure the puck was in.

As for Larscheid, the incoherent “yes” was apparently because he hit his head jumping too high in the booth.

10 | “He’ll play on crutches!”

It was Game 6 of the 1994 Stanley Cup Final and Trevor Linden could barely get off the ice. To add injurious insult to injury, Mark Messier sideswiped Linden away from the puck as he crawled back to the bench.

Cliff Ronning later shared just how banged up Linden was in that series.

“You don't know this, but Trevor Linden had cracked ribs and torn rib cartilage for the last four games of the 1994 Stanley Cup Final,"" said Ronning. ""You can't imagine what it's like to hear your captain, in a room down the hall, screaming at the top of his lungs as they injected the needle into his rib cage. Knowing him, he probably thought we couldn't hear. He would then walk into our dressing room like nothing had happened. That was inspirational.”

Ronning added that he broke his hand during Game 7, “But how do I say I can't play when there's a guy who has played four games with broken ribs and torn cartilage and he's dropping his shoulder into guys to make plays?”

Linden wasn’t going to let anything keep him from playing that Game 7 and Jim Robson perfectly captured that with his call.

“He will play. You know he’ll play! He’ll play on crutches! He will play! And he’ll play at Madison Square Garden on Tuesday night!”

The hyperbole of Linden playing on crutches captured his indomitable spirit and the injured captain scored the Canucks’ only two goals in Game 7, trying to will the Canucks to the Stanley Cup.

He played, as we all knew he would.

School Sports (BCSS) announced Monday that the spring season of play has been suspended indefinitely.

Prior to Tuesday’s announcement from the provincial government that shuttered B.C. schools until further notice, BCSS issued a notice to all coaches and athletic directors.

The memorandum, sent to all BCSS members from its board of directors, directed that all activities related to school sports, including training, practices, jamborees, scrimmages, matches and inter- and intra-school sports activities, were to cease.

“We recognize that schools across the province are out on spring break for the next one or two weeks, but note that many train or compete with their school team during spring break. … All school sports activities, including those noted above, are to remain cancelled until further notice from B.C. School Sports,” the memorandum stated.

“Due to the speed at which things are changing, we will evaluate the situation moving forward, and determine the ability to safely offer a spring season of play at a later date.”

That decision involves all spring sports, including girls soccer, rugby, badminton, track and field, golf, ball hockey, netball, tennis, ultimate and volleyball.

The scheduled BCSS annual general meeting, scheduled for April 18 to 19, has also been suspended. The board is looking at potential dates in June but will wait for guidance from provincial health authorities before proceeding.

The Burnaby-New West spring season began a couple of weeks ago. The senior girls soccer season got off to a bang for both Alpha and Burnaby Central.

New Westminster and Burnaby North also won a pair of games each.

Some of the certainty people are seeking, however, is a little less serious.

Canucks fans, for instance, would love to know for certain when the NHL season will start again or if it will at all. There’s a lot at stake for the Canucks — a berth in the playoffs, the fate of their first-round pick from the J.T. Miller trade, Quinn Hughes’ pursuit of Canucks records and the Calder Trophy. Sure, those are pretty low stakes compared to the rest of the world, but it’s nice to be highly-invested in such low stakes action when all the high stakes stuff is so depressing.

NHL players aren’t big fans of the uncertainty either. There’s less financial anxiety for the players, who are well compensated and are still getting paid, but the current situation still leaves a lot of uncertainty for the players.

Should they prepare as if the NHL season will start up again in May, as the NHL has tentatively planned, even if that is an unlikely scenario? Should they assume the season is over and move into off-season mode?

As the NHL tries to figure out the best path forward, the players have come up with their own plan that aims to avoid the uncertainty of having to constantly move goalposts as the situation worsens. Instead of preparing to re-start the season in May, then moving it to early June, then to late June, etc., they’re proposing a jump straight to the summer months, according to a report by TSN’s Frank Seravelli on Insider Trading.

“Some of the best players in the NHL — think Hart trophy and Conn Smythe-caliber players — have been kicking around some ideas in some group chats,” Seravelli said on Tuesday. “They’re following along with the health experts knowing that this may take until July or August for the coronavirus to really have enough people recover and build up immunity.

“So they’re saying, in these uncertain times, how could we find a way to potentially create some certainty here for the players. One way to do that, the idea that they’ve proposed, is to open training camps at some point in July, then play regular season games — potentially enough games to formulate the playoffs and have enough teams play the same number of games.”

The mention of the caliber of players involved is mildly amusing. If these were fourth-line grinders or depth defencemen coming up with this plan, perhaps it wouldn't be as good. It seems they haven't been invited to the group chat.

The wait until July would be a larger gap of time than the current recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which has so far just recommended cancelling or postponing gatherings of 50 or more people. The players’ plan would skip straight over May and June to provide some certainty: a late July re-start date for the regular season.

It would also mean playing fewer than 82 regular season games, instead playing just enough games so that every team finishes with the same number of games. Or, maybe not “just enough”: there would also need to be enough warm-up games for playoff teams that already had a higher number of games played, so that they’re not going into the playoffs completely cold.

“Then, start those playoffs in early August, have the Stanley Cup awarded by late September, and then begin a three-to-four week transition period in which you conduct the draft and free agency in October,” continued Seravelli, “followed by the start of a full 82-game regular season, that would of course be on a condensed schedule, starting then in November.”

The natural consequence of pushing the season back into the summer is that next season would have a later start date, resulting in a condensed schedule that would challenge both the schedule makers and the players.

The shorter “offseason” would also mean cramming a lot into the month of October: the draft, free agency, cuts and waivers to send players to the AHL, along with a whirlwind schedule behind-the-scenes to get everything ready for an all-new season.

That said, it seems like a feasible plan with some significant upsides. It would be a long time to wait for the NHL to return, but at least fans would know it’s coming back.

This plan hasn’t been officially present to the NHL yet — the players will first take it to the NHLPA — but some version of it has been shared with NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman via an NHL governor, according to Pierre LeBrun. There’s a distinct benefit to waiting longer, according to this anonymous governor.

“If the NHL tries to come back in May or June and there’s a positive test, it shuts down the season again. Wait as long as you can, is this governor’s opinion,” said LeBrun. “It doesn’t mean that this global pandemic will be done by August, but perhaps, hopefully, there are drugs in place or a better medical situation to deal with positive tests. He’s all in favour — he has shared this idea with commissioner Gary Bettman and he hopes that Gary Bettman continues to have an open ear to this type of idea.”

Waiting longer is the safer option from a health standpoint and it provides a little more certainty for the players (and fans). There’s another consideration, however: money.

“Waiting longer allows you to potentially play in front of full buildings right from the start,” said Seravelli. “The players don’t want to be playing a Stanley Cup that’s going to be awarded in front of an empty building. In addition to that, that would all maximize revenue: you get as many games as you can to finish out this season and then you get a full slate next year.”

Should maximizing revenue be a major concern for the players and the NHL in this situation? From a self-interested standpoint it makes sense: the lower revenues caused by the suspended season would affect the salary cap, which affects the earnings of players. The NHL and its teams, of course, are always interested in making as much money as possible.

Expecting full buildings on July, August and September is either optimistic or naive. Perhaps fans, eager to attend a hockey game again, will stream to games in the middle of summer. Or perhaps they’ll still steer clear of big events and mass gatherings, fearful of another outbreak, or stay outside in the sunny summer weather.

It wouldn’t be surprising to see a season that restarts in July could still play in front of empty buildings, with bizarrely silent playoffs in August and September.

That would be very strange, but so is the idea of playoff hockey during the hottest months of the year. When you’re facing an unprecedented situation, it needs to be met with an unprecedented plan.

Hopefully your go-to.

We've hired Daniel Wagner as a full-time staffer to head up our new Pass it to Bulis section, which is actually old enough to be in grade five; Wagner launched PITB as a blog ten years ago in a basement with his friend Harrison Mooney (who is now at The Province).

article continues below

They started taking things seriously for the 2010-2011 season and, according to Wagner, ""couldn't have picked a better time"" as the team had the best season in franchise history and ""everyone was clamouring for more Canucks content; we were there to provide it.""

The blog grew in popularity and the Vancouver Sun picked it up, providing a part-time job to the prolific writer. In 2015 he left the Sun and our sister publication the Vancouver Courier became the new home of PITB, running daily stories on their website as well as weekly features in their printed newspaper.

As of today we're moving Daniel over to Vancouver Is Awesome to expand on PITB, featuring articles from a new stable of regular freelance contributors he'll be editing, while also continuing his own signature coverage.

Here's the roster for our inagural season so far, with Wagner as Captain:

- Jackson McDonald, the managing editor of CanucksArmy, will be bringing his acerbic wit and trenchant analysis to PITB.

- Lachlan Irvine has covered both the Canucks for The Daily Hive and the San Jose Sharks for Fear the Fin. He brings some much-needed knowledge of goaltending to the site.

- Will Graham, long-time contributor to PITB in the past, will make his return to the site with his heart, humour, and hopefully photoshops of toast intact.

- David Quadrelli and Natalie Hoy were two of the up-and-coming writers featured in The Botchford Project, which gives young writers an opportunity to cover a game and publish an article on the Canucks website. Full of passion and talent, they're our top draft picks.

- And speaking of draft picks, Cody Severtson does unparalleled coverage of the Canucks' farm team the Utica Comets on his blog, Comets Harvest. He'll be giving fans a closer look at exciting prospects on the farm, like Kole Lind and Brogan Rafferty.

And that's just a start. We're in conversation with other writers to bring more unique voices to PITB on V.I.A., and we're also open to submissions; writers can pitch ideas to submissions@passittobulis.com, along with some writing samples.

The thing that sets Daniel and PITB apart from the others is that they've always provided Canucks coverage that's a little bit off-kilter, taking the silliest aspects of hockey way too seriously and poking holes in the facade of the most serious aspects. You can expect both serious analysis of the Canucks on-ice play and plenty of humour that sometimes still makes a serious point.

Look for multiple Canucks stories from us every day from here on out, located in the Pass It To Bulis section HERE. And be sure to pick up the Vancouver Courier newspaper every week as the PITB weekly feature will continue to live on in print.",[]
692,vancourier,https://www.vancourier.com/pass-it-to-bulis/zack-kassian-opens-up-about-his-journey-to-sobriety-on-ryan-kesler-and-kevin-bieksa-s-podcast-1.24056719,Zack Kassian opens up about his journey to sobriety on Ryan Kesler and Kevin Bieksa’s podcast,['Daniel Wagner'],,"It seems like everyone has a podcast these days. Not every podcast, however, also has a combined 1,996 games of NHL experience between the two hosts.

That’s what two former Canucks, Ryan Kesler and Kevin Bieksa, have: both 1,996 NHL games and a podcast. The Kes & Juice Podcast is a fun listen, as the two long-time friends share stories from their days in the NHL and perspective on current NHL news, along with a surprising amount of The Bachelor updates.

article continues below

In their most recent episode, Kesler and Bieksa weighed in on the incident between Zack Kassian and Matthew Tkachuk, an incident the NHL’s Department of Player Safety handled poorly. In an incredible coincidence, they lined up an interview with Kassian before the incident happened.

Or, perhaps it wasn’t a coincidence at all.

“I’m not taking credit for anything, but I say to him, ‘Hey do something interesting this week, like maybe a Gordie Howe Hat Trick,’” said Bieksa, “and then two days later, this thing happens.”

Kassian, or as Kesler and Bieksa call him, “The Big Cat,” touched on the revival of the Alberta rivalry, partly thanks to Kassian’s actions.

“This is a fun time,” said Kassian, “The way the game has evolved, there’s not too many incidents like this anymore.”

“Good TV ratings,” Kassian added in reference to the rematch after the All-Star break. “Bettman should give me a call, I’d love to see the TV ratings, this is good for hockey. At the end of the day, they’re a good team, we’re a good team, we’re fighting to get into the playoffs — who doesn’t like this?”

They also got into an infamous incident when Kassian was with the Canucks, when Bieksa and Kassian started fighting in the elevator, with poor Frank Corrado trying to break it up.

“I was probably being an idiot,” laughed Kassian.



The real meat of the episode, however, came when they asked Kassian about his sobriety. Kassian has had a well-publicised battle with substance abuse, specifically alcoholism, but has come out the other side with the tools and knowledge to stay sober, and has turned his career around with the Edmonton Oilers.

“You guys were the main source of helping me out in the beginning,” said Kassian. “I went to Vancouver and it was an older team and I think there were some warning signs that I could’ve ruined my career. You guys tried to step in and intervene multiple times.”

That’s good to hear from a Canucks perspective. The team was criticized when Kassian was traded to Montreal for not doing enough to help Kassian through his substance abuse problems, but knowing that the veteran leadership in the room were trying means a lot.

“One thing I’ve learned through this whole process of getting clean is the only way you’re going to do it is if you want to do it yourself,” said Kassian. “You’ve got to be willing to help yourself. Sadly, you guys tried to help multiple times, but it took, ultimately, a car accident to hit my rock bottom and to really think about what I was doing and how it was affecting the people around me, not only my career, but my family, my friends, and my teammates.

“You guys tried to put a stop to it, you guys tried to help the best way you could, and you planted the seed. There were days where I was thinking about what you guys said. You guys were two NHLers, played a long time, two leaders of our team, clearly you’re not just going to intervene for no reason.”

Kassian wasn’t behind the wheel for the car accident, which resulted in a broken nose and foot, but it was still his truck and he certainly bore responsibility. He admitted in his testimony in court that he had been drinking and using cocaine prior to the accident.

“Obviously the incident in Montreal was pretty humbling,” he said. “After that accident, my world came crumbling down. There’s no easy way to put it: I broke down, I cried a couple times, I didn’t think I was going to get back to the NHL, to be honest.

“I struck out with Buffalo, Vancouver didn’t want me, my last chance was in Montreal and I screwed that one up before the season even started. That was really a turning point and right then and there I knew something was wrong and I had to get better and I surrendered. That day changed my life.”

Kassian then joked, “When I go back to Montreal, I want to go dig up that tree that got hit, that the girl hit driving, and plant it in my backyard because, essentially, that’s what changed my life.”

Perhaps the most heartwarming aspect of the episode is Kesler and Bieksa talking about how proud they are of Kassian. You can tell how much they care about their former teammate.

Kassian also talked about the life-changing experience of having a daughter and the support system of his family as he’s battled to get clean.

“I wish I would’ve figured it out at a younger age,” said Kassian, “but sometimes you’ve got to take a different path.”

The biggest bombshell of the interview, however, is that Matt Kassian now helps Bieksa manage his money.

Okay, that’s not actually a bombshell, but it is pretty random. Canucks fans might remember Matt Kassian from the Kassassin controversy: started to call Zack Kassian “The Kassassin,” which angered Matt Kassian, who had the nickname legally trademarked.

Apparently, Matt Kassian took trademarking his nickname seriously because he saw the importance of taking care of your assets. He’s now a financial advisor, who often works with professional athletes because of his own experience in the NHL. I wonder if he still goes by “Kassassin” when he’s helping his clients navigate their investments.

“That guy always had a bone with me,” said Kassian. “Remember, he played in Minnesota when I played in Vancouver. He lined up with me and just right away, he slashed me and said, ‘Let’s see who the tougher Kassian is.’ I’m like, holy s***, man, I’m 22 and this guy’s heavy and I’m, like, whoa relax a little bit here. Thank god he left me alone after that.”

Prior to the Kassian interview, Kesler and Bieksa delved into a number of topics, from grotesque mouth injuries and the perils of using a different dentist when on the road, to The Bachelor and who Kesler’s ideal Bachelorette would be.

The most interesting segment for Canucks fans was when they were talking about the Kassian/Tkachuk incident and brought up how similar Tkachuk’s hits were to those of their former teammate, Raffi Torres.

“It’s the Raffi Torres hit,” said Kesler. “That’s what it was exactly. And the fact that the league’s defending that and basically ran Raffi out of the f***ing league because of those hits, and then Tkachuk does it twice in one game? To be honest, we all know what Tkachuk’s doing: he’s trying to hurt him.”

“Maybe he’s not meaning to hurt him, but he’s certainly meaning to blow him up,” said Bieksa.

“The league’s not being f***ing consistent at all,” said Kesler. “I think that’s where the confusion comes in. But if Tkachuk’s going to play like that, he has to fight. Period.”

“We used to feed off of Raffi’s hits,” said Bieksa. “Remember when he hit Seabrook behind the net? Looking at it today, it was like the Scott Stevens hit on [Paul] Kariya and [Eric] Lindros: big time late, interference. It was like a swing hit that swung all the momentum in the series.”

“How about when he used to come down from the point once a game and just take a run at the guy, whether he got him or not,” added Bieksa. “The guys down low, the forwards down low trying to make their plays, were like, ‘Heads up!’ when he was on the ice.”

Finally, there was this golden exchange when Kesler and Bieksa were talking about injuries.

“You make fun of my nose every other f***ing day,” said Kesler.

“I say your nose is really big and sticks out, but mine’s big and flat,” Bieksa replied. “So we both have nose issues, but we’re still models.”

“Obviously,” said Kesler. “Nose models.”

Give these two nose models a listen. The entire episode is great and it will likely leave you wanting more. Fortunately, there are six other episodes to listen to so far.

Sure, if they had lost this game, they would be fifth in the Pacific Division and 19th in the NHL, because the Pacific is a hot mess and the NHL has taken parity to a dangerous extreme that threatens us all, but let’s focus on the positive.

article continues below

Since mid-December, the Canucks have been on a tear, interrupted only briefly by the fiasco in Florida. They’ve now won 11 of their last 14 games and sit atop the Pacific with games in hand on three of the four Pacific teams that are a point behind them. Yes, four Pacific Division teams are one point behind the Canucks. Like I said, it’s a hot mess.

The Canucks are now on-pace for 97 points, which is well beyond even the most optimistic preseason projections. Tanner Pearson is a point-per-game in his last 31 games, Jake Virtanen looks like a legitimate first-line forward, and Loui Eriksson, of all people, is suddenly a fan favourite.

It’s a wonderful and enjoyable hot streak and the great thing about hot streaks is that they keep going forever and they never end and everyone stays happy and there are rainbows and puppies all the time. It’s pretty great.

There’s definitely a little part of me that is saying something like the following: “Yes, everything is going well right now, but that’s because everything is going well, and the Canucks are still just inches away from being out of the playoffs. What happens when things stop going so well? What happens when the regression kicks in? What happens when someone important gets injured? Do you really believe the Canucks can keep this rolling through the second half of the season?”

I’m trying to ignore that little part of me, because winning is fun and life’s too short to always be worried about regression. You should only worry about regression 33% of the time. I got out all my regression-sweats in the afternoon, so I didn’t even think about regression one time while I watched this game.

Team Chaos would have appreciated an overtime loss, actually, as that would have led to a five-way tie for first place in the Pacific.

I joked around in the intro, because that’s what I do, but this run has honestly been great and there are a lot of really positive signs for the future. It’s way more fun to write about a team that’s playing well and it’s also a lot more fun to be in the room talking to the players when they’re on a roll. When hockey players are in a bad mood, they tend to be less-inclined to answer some of the sillier questions I like to ask.

Speaking of bad moods, everyone on the Sharks seemed to be in one in this game, probably because the Sharks are third-last in the Western Conference. They’re more sour than Sarah Michelle-Gellar when she had to hang out with a shirtless Scott Weiland for a day.

Alex Edler didn’t help Kevin Labanc’s mood when he rocked him with a big bodycheck in the first period. Labanc went nuts, chasing Edler down the ice and crosschecking him in the back for an obvious penalty. Then, on his way to the bench, Brandon Sutter chirped Labanc, so Labanc sucker-punched him in the face. As the French say, that’s la bad.

That should have been a four-minute power play for the Canucks, but Sutter chased down Labanc in the scrum that ensued and put him in a headlock, so the refs nabbed him for the coincidental minor. Personally, I think Labanc should have been tossed for the blatant sucker punch, but what do I know?

The Loui Revolution — The RevoLoution, if you will — has begun in earnest. There’s a lot of Loui love in the Canucks fanbase right now, as he’s stepped up ably on Bo Horvat’s wing, even if most of his points seem to be on empty net goals. It’s quite the face turn for Eriksson, as it wasn’t that long ago that fans booed when his name was announced in the opening lineup; now they’re unironically Lou-ing.

Seriously, the Rogers Arena crowd seemed fit to explode when Eriksson got a shorthanded chance midway through the second period. And when he did actually score a few minutes later, the crowd went wild. Tanner Pearson fanned on his shot and Eriksson smartly lifted Erik Karlsson’s stick at just the right time to allow the puck to slide through. With his stick in the air, Eriksson had to stop the puck with his skate — an impressive feet/feat of coordination — then backhanded the puck into the open net.

The goal from number 21 came on the Canucks’ 21st shot of the game, so it seemed like destiny. The Sharks challenged the goal for offside, but you can’t fight destiny, man. And also, Bo Horvat totally dragged his back skate to stay onside, because he’s the captain, and that’s what captains do.

The Canucks were dummying the Sharks through the first two periods, even if they only managed the one goal. They out-shot the Sharks 27-to-7 through 40 minutes. The Sharks didn’t start the third any better: on one of their most dangerous-looking rushes of the game, Timo Meier negated it by skating straight into Thatcher Demko for the most hilariously obvious goaltender interference call of all time.

The Canucks made Meier pay, as the second power play unit delivered a goal with a simple, but well-executed play. Adam Gaudette gained the line, dropped the puck to Jake Virtanen, and he delivered a great pass to Tanner Pearson, who had made a beeline for the front of the net. Pearson made like Harlan Thrombey losing at Go and tipped it upstairs.

Demko didn’t have much action in the Canucks crease, but stopped all but one shot he faced. That shot came on a scrum in front of the net that was a complete mess. Virtanen somehow ended up boxing out Chris Tanev from the rebound with his stick pointing straight up in the air, so he was no help. Quinn Hughes tried to play the puck when he should have played the man and vice versa. And Demko just couldn’t find the puck to cover it up.

Hughes quickly made up for the 2-1 goal by restoring the two-goal lead 37 seconds later. Antoine Roussel raced to a puck on the end boards and swatted it around to Hughes at the point. His shot navigated its way through traffic like a motorcycle in Hanoi and beat Dell past a Roussel screen.

The Canucks made it 4-1 on another fantastic pass by Virtanen. He made a great play in the neutral zone to chip the puck past Mario Ferraro and broke in 2-on-1 with J.T. Miller. With Brent Burns sliding to prevent the pass, Virtanen calmly saucered the puck over Burns right onto the tape of Miller, who sent the puck back against the grain on Dell.

That gives Virtanen three points in his last two games and he’s already set a career high with 28 points. My one concern about Virtanen is that there comes a point every season where we ask, “Has Virtanen finally figured it out?” and as soon as someone writes that article, Virtanen immediately regresses and starts playing worse. So, as long as no one writes a “Has Virtanen finally figured it out?” article, we should be fine. Which means I need to ignore that article burning a hole in my Drafts folder.

In the third period, Joe Thornton got downright ornery, as old men often do. He hit Jay Beagle with a late, blindside check at one point, but the truly egregious hit came on Brandon Sutter, as Thornton bodied him to the ice when he never even touched the puck. That sparked a melee, a brouhaha, a donnybrook, a fracas, and a yard sale.

Sutter went after Thornton, who dropped the gloves anticipating a fight, but Burns tackled Sutter to the ice, perhaps out of beard solidarity or because he’s worried that Thornton’s old-man knuckles would crumble to dust if he tried to punch someone.

Here’s how you can tell this game got out of hand: Chris Tanev got kicked out of the game. The refs handed out 10-minute misconducts to five different players to try to calm things down — though somehow they all evened out despite the egregious interference by Thornton that kicked things off. One of the players kicked out was Tanev, because if anyone was going to run around and cause problems, it’s the mild-mannered defensive defenceman.

While the Canucks are sending three players — Elias Pettersson, Jacob Markstrom, and Quinn Hughes — the St. Louis Blues will have four.

That’s fitting for the team hosting the event and the Blues deserve it too. They’re currently first in the Western Conference by a wide margin and are just one point behind the Washington Capitals for first in the entire NHL.

article continues below

If you expand beyond just the team, however, Vancouver is tied with St. Louis for the most representatives. That’s because Pettersson, Markstrom, and Hughes will be joined by the Vancouver Police Department’s own Meghan Agosta.

The 32-year-old Agosta has represented Canada at four Olympic Games and eight World Championships and is second all-time in goals and fifth all-time in points at the Olympics, with 17 goals and 28 points in 20 games. Her signature performance came at the 2010 Olympics in Vancouver, when her 9 goals and 15 points in 5 games led the tournament in scoring and led Canada to the gold medal.

Now Agosta will represent Canada once again, albeit on a slightly different stage. And, in a way, she’ll be representing all of women’s hockey.



Agosta, along with 19 other female hockey players, will face off at the All-Star Skills Competition, showing off their skills in a Canada vs USA 3-on-3 game. It’s an opportunity to showcase the women’s game in a different venue, at a time when women’s hockey is at a crossroads, with over 200 players boycotting professional hockey this season until their demands for appropriate resources and sustainable financing are met.

It’s not just a showcase for the women, of course; the 3-on-3 game will also attract more attention to the NHL All-Star Game, which is in a constant battle to stay relevant, as stars like Alex Ovechkin have refrained from attending and some hockey fans complain about the low intensity of the hockey itself.

Four women participated in last year’s All-Star Skills Competition and established that their skills are right up there with the best in the NHL. Kendall Coyne-Schofield became the first woman to officially participate in the Skills Competition, taking the place of Nathan Mackinnon in the Fastest Skater competition. Her time of 14.346 seconds landed her 7th out of 8 participants, ahead of Clayton Keller.

Meanwhile, Rebecca Johnston, Renata Fast, and Brianna Decker participated in the Skills Competition by demonstrating the events before the NHL players. Decker made headlines when her run through the passing event was timed as three seconds faster than Leon Draisaitl, who won the event.

The NHL didn’t recognize Decker’s time — and refused to pay her the $25,000 that the winner of each event receives — but CCM stepped up to #PayDecker in the wake of a social media campaign. By bringing women into the Skills Competition in their own separate event, the NHL likely hopes to avoid a similar controversy this year, though some raised concerns on social media that the players won’t be paid for their participation.

The one event at the Skills Competition where women will compete alongside the men is a new event introduced this year: the Shooting Stars event. One player each from the Canadian and American teams, selected by social media vote, will participate in the event, along with eight NHL All-Stars.

In the Shooting Stars event, players will be positioned in the stands, 30 feet above the iice surface, where they will shoot pucks at a variety of targets on the ice, with different point values for each target. It seems like an event inspired by trick shot YouTubers like Dude Perfect, and it seems like it has more potential for entertainment than some of the other oddball skills competition events the NHL has tried in the past.

Will Agosta get picked to participate in the Shooting Stars event? Since it’s a social media vote, perhaps the Vancouver contingent that showed up in force a couple years ago to vote Brock Boeser as All-Star MVP will show up again. At the very least, it will be a nice opportunity for her to focus on hockey for a weekend; while she’s taken time off from hockey to pursue her career with the Vancouver PD, she still has eyes on playing in the Beijing Olympics in 2022.

695,vancourier,https://www.vancourier.com/pass-it-to-bulis/matthieu-perreault-walked-back-his-harsh-words-for-nhl-player-safety-but-he-s-not-entirely-wrong-1.24055424,"Matthieu Perreault walked back his harsh words for NHL Player Safety, but he's not entirely wrong",['Daniel Wagner'],,"“Player safety, my ass.”

That was Mathieu Perreault of the Winnipeg Jets on Thursday when it became clear that no discipline would be assessed to Jake Virtanen for his elbow to Perreault’s head.

article continues below

Virtanen’s elbow came in the first period of the Canucks’ game against the Jets on Tuesday. It was undoubtedly a cheap hit: the puck was long gone and Perreault never actually had possession of the puck, so it was certainly a late hit or interference.

What made it worse is that Virtanen, seemingly aware that he wasn’t going to make solid contact with Perreault, stuck out his elbow and popped Perreault in the jaw. It was a classic “chicken wing” hit, the type that made Shane Doan very unpopular among some NHL fanbases. Perhaps it wasn’t as egregious as a Doan elbow, but it was still pretty blatant.

That’s why it was surprising that it didn’t earn Virtanen a penalty on the ice. Perreault was apoplectic, shocked that there was no call and he chirped Virtanen on the bench that a suspension was surely coming.

Was it worthy of a suspension? Perhaps. It’s the type of unnecessary headshot that the NHL’s Department of Player Safety should be concerned about and, at the very least, should have spoken to Virtanen about the hit and levied a fine. While the outcome this time wasn’t too bad — Perreault, who has a history of concussions, escaped injury — it’s a hit that shouldn’t have happened and could have a worse result next time.

Call it prevention rather than punishment: if the Department of Player Safety is indeed designed to keep players safe, that’s the type of step they should be taking to curtail future injuries. Unfortunately, as we’ve seen far too often the Department of Player Safety doesn’t seem to be concerned with player safety at all.

In other words, “Player safety, my ass.”

“This is literally an elbow to the face to a guy that didn’t have the puck,” continued Perreault to reporters. “They’re not going to do anything about it, so I’ve got to take matters into my own hands next time this happens, and I get to swing my stick across his forehead and I shouldn’t get suspended.”

That’s the reaction you get when the league doesn’t protect its players. The players feel they need to protect themselves and that just leads to an escalation of violence. For a smaller player like Perreault, he feels like all he can do is use his stick to do so.

“The only thing I can do defend myself is use my stick,” added Perreault, “so next guy that does that to me is going to get my f***ing stick and I better not get suspended for it.”

On Friday, Perreault walked back his comments, perhaps because the one thing the Department of Player Safety does seem to take seriously is stick-swinging incidents.

“First of all, I'd like to say my emotion got a little high there,"" said Perreault to reporters. ""I obviously wouldn't slash anybody in the face. That's not who I am, I've never done anything like that in my career.”

Before proclaiming Perreault as a clean soul, let’s remember that he’s also the guy who knocked Jannik Hansen out of the lineup for weeks back in 2016 with a late knee-on-knee hit. It’s not a slash to the face, but it’s not pretty either.

In any case, the larger issue is that players that don’t feel protected by the league will take matters into their own hands. The Department of Player Safety doesn’t seem to be dissuading players from pursuing that retribution, which will, in turn, make the game more dangerous.

Virtanen certainly doesn’t seem to feel like he did anything wrong. When reporters asked about Perreault’s comments, he had a big smile on his face.

“It could have been a lot worse if I really hit him,” said Virtanen. “I honestly didn’t even mean to do that.”

The issue is, he did do that. He did elbow him in the face.

“It’s hockey. Stuff’s going to happen,” he added. “It’s not going to be flowers and roses all the time, where everything’s clean.”

It’s true. With the speed of the game, there will always be the possibility for danger and injuries. What you can do, however, is reduce the risk by teaching players how to avoid hitting other players in the head with an unnecessary chicken-wing elbow.

Let’s face it, a mid-season matchup against the Arizona Coyotes on a Thursday in the middle of what is typically the coldest month of the year in Vancouver? No thank you.

Except that innocuous Thursday night matchup turned into a clash of titans, as the two top teams in the Pacific Division — at least by points percentage — faced off.

Sure, being the two top teams in the Pacific might not be saying much (and the Flames technically passed both the Coyotes and the Canucks in points percentage before the game started with their win over the Leafs), but this was still, in a way, a marquee matchup.

You could also pitch it as veteran stars vs the young stars of tomorrow. Taylor Hall vs Elias Pettersson! Phil Kessel vs Brock Boeser! Oliver Ekman-Larsson vs Quinn Hughes! Michael Chaput vs Bo Horvat! Adin Hill vs Jacob Markstrom!

Okay, this matchup thing got away from me at the end there. I mean, Hill is six years younger than Markstrom.

Let’s face it, it’s hard to drum up excitement for a game against the Coyotes, but you shouldn’t sleep on them. They’ve got speed, even if they mainly use it to make life miserable for opposing teams in the neutral zone. They’ve got game-breaking skill in Hall, a decent power play with Phil Kessel, and some top-tier defencemen.

Most importantly, they have fantastic goaltending, as long as Darcy Kuemper and Antti Raanta can get and stay healthy.

In other words, the path to the playoffs — or the path to a playoff run beyond the first round — will likely go through the Coyotes, so the Canucks and their fans better get amped up to face them. You have no choice but to get hyped up about playing the Coyotes, even if this less-than-thrilling game didn’t exactly help. I know, because I watched this game.

This game wasn’t terrible, by any means, it was just weirdly inconsistent. There were long stretches of nothing really happening, then it got momentarily exciting when it seemed like something amazing was about to happen, and then the amazing thing didn’t happen. It was frustrating.

A sign for how exciting the game was: the first “highlight” in the NHL’s recap video above is an unscreened point shot by Chris Tanev that was easily blockered into the corner. The third “highlight”: a weak, unscreened wrist shot from 40 feet out by Derek Stepan that went directly into Markstrom’s glove. Be still my beating heart. If those are the highlights they’re leading with, it’s slim pickings.

There was some early excitement when the fourth line surprised the Coyotes by stealing the puck at the blue line, with Jay Beagle tipped a Tyler Motte pass into the top corner. There was just one problem: the Canucks didn’t steal the puck at the blue line. They stole it outside the blue line. The linesman let it go thinking the Coyotes played the puck back into their zone, but a challenge from Coyotes coach Rick Tocchet quickly overturned the goal.

The Coyotes eventually opened the scoring thanks to Taylor Hall, who got in on the forecheck, nabbed a deflected puck out of mid-air, dropped it to his stick, and centred for Christian Dvorak, who fired it into the net faster than you can type on a DVORAK keyboard. Oscar Fantenberg, parked in front, didn’t get to him in time, as he’s a die-hard QWERTY guy. Blame Mavis Beacon.

It feels like Alex Edler has been a lot more physical this season. Perhaps it’s that grizzled old-man strength. He lowered the boom on his fellow countryman Oliver Ekman-Larsson in the first period, sending him spinning to the ice with a solid body check.

The Canucks’ first go-around on the power play wasn’t pretty, as they had trouble gaining the zone and then didn’t take shooting opportunities when they had them. They looked better on their second power play. First Elias Pettersson’s one-timer hit the post, then Quinn Hughes fired a slap shot off the post and the puck popped out to Bo Horvat, who missed the post entirely. Instead, he sent his snap shot over the Hill and far away into the back of the net.

The young stars on the Canucks kept trying fancy moves throughout the game, as if they realized the game lacked excitement and they were trying to spice things up. I particularly enjoyed Quinn Hughes’s spinning between-the-legs backhand bank pass to himself to evade Taylor Hall.

Brandon Sutter returned to the lineup after missing a month with a back injury and looked pretty solid on the wing of the fourth line. He nearly got a goal in the second period on a scramble in front of the net, but Hill made like a surrendering soldier and laid down his arms, getting his glove on Sutter’s shot along the ice.

Jake Virtanen is getting his shot on the top line with Elias Pettersson and J.T. Miller and cashed in with a goal. After Miller took a hit to get the puck to him, Virtanen made a great play, choosing not to take the easy shot and instead dragging the puck around the net for a wraparound, banking the puck off Hill’s skate and in.

Horvat tried to add some bonus excitement to the game late in the second period. After Loui Eriksson forced the puck out of the defensive zone and maybe kinda sorta tripped Jakob Chychrun without a penalty, he centred for Horvat. All alone in front, Horvat could have kept things simple with a deke to the backhand; instead, he tried to go between his legs and roof the puck. It was a noble attempt, but destined for failure.

The Canucks and Coyotes sped through the third period like they wanted to get out of the rink before the roads got any worse. At one point the two teams went over seven minutes without a whistle, running straight time like it was a soccer game. Hopefully everyone made it home safely.

The Coyotes pulled the goalie for the extra attacker and the Canucks put on the empty net dream team: Loui Eriksson, Bo Horvat, and Tanner Pearson. Brendan Batchelor referred to them as the Insurance Line, and it has a nice ring to it. They’re the only three players on the Canucks with empty net goals this season: Eriksson has two, Horvat had three, and Pearson now has four after his goal in this game.

Eriksson did all the work for the goal, out-battling Jason Demers down the left wing for the puck, then passing up the chance to pad his goalscoring stats in favour of passing to Pearson, who made like a drag queen on a budget and did his own padding.

Pearson’s empty net goal was actually an important one for an unexpected reason. Alex Edler passed the puck up that Eriksson fought for, giving him the secondary assist. That assist meant Edler passed Dennis Kearns for the franchise record for most assists by a Canucks defenceman. Edler already held the franchise record for most goals and points for a defenceman, but now he holds all three.

That is a quote from Tyler Motte, a forward for the Vancouver Canucks who recently sat down and discussed his struggles with mental health. I was inspired by Motte’s courage to open up and share his story with the world. I wanted to share some thoughts on how I myself struggle with anxiety and depression and how relatable Motte’s story is.

article continues below

I’ve battled anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember. I was so reluctant to seek help and open up about these issues for multiple reasons. I first saw a psychologist in high school and was in denial that anything was wrong. In short, I had plenty of other things on my mind and wasn’t willing to accept that I was “different” than my friends. Some people tried to help, but I wasn’t willing to open up and, as a result, the sessions with this professional ended and I didn’t see another until last March, more than 15 years later.

I was in a relationship from the age of 20 to 32. I didn’t seek help even though I knew something was wrong. I wasn’t myself because I felt I had to be strong, be a man, not show any weakness. In hindsight, I realize how poor of a decision that was: every day I didn’t get the help I needed, I was doing damage to myself and those around me. Experience is a heck of a teacher and I definitely learned a lesson there.

I didn’t get help until I was scared into it. I had my first anxiety attack as I arrived at work during the summer of 2018. I was 32 years old.

It was a full-on anxiety attack, a terrifying experience. I’ve never had a heart-attack before but that’s what I thought was happening, it was that intense. On top of that, your mind starts racing. It’s difficult to explain, but it’s like everything you’ve ever worried about hits you in the face all at the same time and you realize you don’t have any control over the situation.

Even after that happened, I was stubborn. I thought I could make some changes in my life that would stop that from ever happening again. Instead, I had another full blown anxiety attack later that winter, another one shortly after, and another one after that.

I had tried everything I could to attempt to control my situation by myself and failed miserably. Finally, I had the worst night of my life, where I had no control whatsoever of my thoughts, and every bad thing that had ever happened and negative thought I’d ever had was racing through my mind to the point where I ended up in hospital. I knew it was time to get help.

The first thing I did was find a counsellor, I was reluctant to see a doctor because I was scared to go on medication. I was fearful of the side effects; I didn’t want them to change who I was. I’ll touch more on that later.

I can happily say now that seeing my Counsellor, Matt, is likely the best decision I’ve ever made in my life. Opening up and discussing what was bothering me changed my life drastically.

So when Motte said, “For me, just accepting and saying out loud that I was diagnosed with depression and had a mental health issue, that was the first weight off my shoulders,” I can second that: if you feel like you have some symptoms of a mental health issue, I can’t encourage you enough to get some help.

It’s a massive weight off yourself when you realize you’re not alone. You start feeling like a new person.

“Just having them know that there’s something going on with me,” said Motte about talking to his family and friends, “but it’s nothing to worry about but it is something I deal with.”

When I opened up about it to a professional, friends, and family, I discovered how much good there is in people. Additionally, I learned how many other people are dealing with similar issues, that we’re not alone in this battle. People will help you, people will support you.

I was happy to hear Motte had a supportive girlfriend who encouraged him to seek help. Further, he said that the Canucks have a mental skills coach who works with the players, which I think is a progressive, positive initiative and they should be applauded for it.

Additionally, I truly appreciate the fact that this video was produced. It says something that Motte can open up like this, a guy who has to claw for every inch of ice every shift to ensure he has a spot in the lineup next game. It says a lot about the guys in the Canucks dressing room, especially the leaders.

The fact that Motte can say, “I love the group of guys here, so I’m not worried about judgement or change of action from them towards me,” shouldn’t be overlooked.

I wholeheartedly believe in not focusing primarily on developing players, but instead creating an environment where they can develop not just as players, but more importantly as people. From my perspective, it seems the Canucks have created that culture off the ice. When your best players — Elias Pettersson, Quinn Hughes, Brock Boeser and Bo Horvat — are also great people, you have an opportunity to do something special because you’ve set a higher standard.

Motte goes on to admit he’s nervous sharing his story with the world but, “it’s not about telling my story, it’s about helping that one person, or handful of people that need to know they’re not alone.”

That is exactly why I’m writing this right now. I know I was influenced by a couple of people opening up about their mental health issues on hockey twitter, so I’m hoping that by writing these words I can be a positive influence in one’s life. Trust me, it gets better. You deserve it.

I can only speak for myself because everyone’s situation is different. I’m on a low dose of medication that I feel absolutely zero side effects from. I was worried that I’d be a shell of my former self if I started taking medication, but that just wasn’t the case.

In my case, my medication enabled to be myself for potentially the first time in my entire life. I don’t really think about that though; I just know that I’m in an amazing spot now and can say honestly that I’ve never been happier.

If you have any questions, comments or just need to talk, my DM’s are always open on twitter.

Take care of yourself,

Darryl Keeping

P.S. A bit of a funny side story I’ll share with everyone. During the winter of 2018, Harman Dayal, Ryan Biech, Jeremy Davis, and myself were invited by the Canucks to a meeting with their Analytics and PR staff. Keep in mind, this is before I got help. I was pretty much at my worst.

I can’t get into the details of the meeting but we were all sitting around a table, discussing various topics — I’m sitting there and my anxiety is steadily climbing. I hit the “Uh oh, what am I going to do point” — I can’t have an anxiety attack right here in the meeting, I’ll be ruined!

I didn’t know what to do so I sat there stewing, I hit the 99 out of 100 point and then I don’t know what happened, but it all went away and I was fine, crisis averted. On top of all that, I really had to pee the entire time. I can laugh about it now but in the moment, it was a nightmare!

That may seem like a bold statement, but it’s just a simple declaration of facts. Even the top team in the Pacific right now, the Arizona Coyotes, has the 13th-best record in the NHL when you take into account games played. They’ve earned 58.2% of the possible points from their 49 games this season; five teams from the Metropolitan Division have a better record.

article continues below

The teams from the Pacific that were supposed to be good have struggled. The Calgary Flames were the top team in the Western Conference last season with 50 wins, 107 points, and a dominant plus-62 goal differential. This season, they suddenly can’t find the back of the net — they’re 26th in the NHL in goals per game.

The San Jose Sharks were second in the Pacific Division last year. While they were expected to take a step back with age and the loss of several good players to free agency, they’ve instead been truly dreadful, with help from arguably the worst goaltending tandem in the league.

Then there’s the Vegas Golden Knights, who have arguably the best top-six forward group in the Western Conference, along with solid depth. They were supposed to be even better this season with a full season of brilliant two-way winger Mark Stone, who they added at the trade deadline last season. They’ve been sunk, however, by their defence and goaltending and sit outside the playoff picture.

All three of those teams have fired their head coach, though for the Flames it wasn’t related to his performance but racist comments from his past. The latest firing was Gerald Gallant from the Golden Knights, replaced by the coach the Sharks fired, Peter DeBoer, because NHL coaching is an ouroboros.

So, the Pacific Division has no good teams; what it has in abundance, however, is average teams. Some might even say “mediocre.” The Pacific Division’s top-five teams all inhabit the mushy middle of the NHL standings by points percentage, from the Coyotes in 13th to the Golden Knights in 19th.

As a result, the playoff race in the Pacific Division is tighter than Jake and Amy’s nups. For the Canucks, that means they have a significantly better chance of making the playoffs than if they were in any other division.

Right now, the Canucks are right behind the Coyotes in points percentage, second in the Pacific Division thanks to winning 9 of their last 12 games. Point projections from Micah Blake McCurdy of HockeyViz have the Canucks right in the mix with a projected 92.4 points by the end of the season.

Point projections over the past fortnight. pic.twitter.com/7eoRVuuQ4f — Micah Blake McCurdy (@IneffectiveMath) January 16, 2020

That puts the Canucks within a point of the Flames (92.6 points), Golden Knights (92.2 points), and Oilers (91.6 points). According to McCurdy, that gives the Canucks a 64% chance of making the playoffs, which are better odds than they got heading into the season. In his season preview, Dom Luszczyszyn of the Athletic gave the Canucks a 25% chance of making the playoffs using his Game Score model.

Of course, with the Pacific Division so tightly-packed with average teams, the margin for error is slim. If the Canucks, who have been relatively healthy so far this season, see a rash of injuries and don’t have the depth to handle them, they could be in trouble. Or, if the other Pacific Division teams get their acts together, it could be tough for the Canucks to keep up.

Alternatively, maybe it will be the Canucks that hit a hot streak in the second half of the season and pull away from the rest of the division. That’s what’s wild about the Pacific right now: it’s nearly impossible to predict what might happen next.

Track it down!

The Canucks have significantly revamped their defence corps over the last year. General manager Jim Benning evidently made a New Year’s resolution for 2019: let go of past mistakes and move forward.

article continues below

That meant moving on from several defencemen he acquired, like Michael Del Zotto, Erik Gudbranson, and Derrick Pouliot. Gudbranson, in particular, was a big move. The Gudbranson trade with the Florida Panthers was a signature move for Benning, but he stopped throwing good money after bad and instead finagled Tanner Pearson from the Pittsburgh Penguins in exchange for the hulking defenceman.

The Canucks also let Ben Hutton and Luke Schenn go in free agency, then traded Alex Biega to the Detroit Red Wings after he didn’t make the team out of training camp. That’s a lot of turnover, though the Canucks retained long-time veterans Alex Edler and Chris Tanev and 25-year-old Troy Stecher.

In place of the departing defencemen came rookie Quinn Hughes, high-priced free agent signing Tyler Myers, veteran free agent Jordie Benn, and depth signing Oscar Fantenberg.

Of the four new defenceman, Hughes is undoubtedly the most important. The 20 year old is already the quarterback of the Canucks’ first power play unit, easing the ice-time burden on Edler, and is one of the top-scoring defencemen in the NHL. He’s on-pace to set a new franchise record in scoring from a Canucks defenceman and could even threaten Elias Pettersson’s franchise record in rookie points set last season.

Hughes’ importance to the Canucks is readily apparent on the ice, where his thrilling rushes and dangerous dashes have made him a key component of the Canucks’ offensive attack. Beyond just the offence, however, Hughes is eating up big minutes — he leads all rookies in ice time with over 21 minutes per game — because his coaches know they can trust him defensively.

We can see the impact of Hughes on the Canucks by taking a peek behind the curtain at his underlying numbers. In this case, we’re going to look at Expected Goals, a statistic that aims to find how many goals a team or player “should” score given the quantity and quality of shots they create.

If we look at the Canucks’ defence pairings that have spent at least 20 minutes together at 5-on-5 this season and rank them by Expected Goals Percentage (xGF%), we immediately see a pattern. An xGF% over 50% means the Canucks have out-chanced their opposition with that pairing on the ice — the only three pairings about 50% all have Quinn Hughes on the left side.

Canucks Defensive Pairs Expected Goals Percentage at 5-on-5 via NaturalStatTrick.com LD RD TOI xGF% Hughes Stecher 39.07 57.66 Hughes Myers 244.87 55.79 Hughes Tanev 417.93 53.78 Edler Myers 353.67 49.02 Edler Tanev 72.78 48.24 Edler Stecher 159.28 47.98 Benn Tanev 120.92 42.78 Benn Stecher 342.57 42.75 Fantenberg Stecher 63.07 40.05 Fantenberg Tanev 66.83 37.11 Benn Myers 55.90 36.85 Fantenberg Myers 130.30 35.62



After Hughes, there are three pairings with Alex Edler. The Canucks’ franchise record holder for points from a defenceman has been supplanted on the power play by Hughes, but still plays big and difficult minutes. He starts more often in the defensive zone than Hughes and has played less with the Canucks’ top line, so it’s still impressive that his pairings this season are hovering near 50%.

The bottom pairing, on the other hand, has struggled. The signing of Benn in the summer was meant to shore up the bottom pair, but instead, he’s sunk it, significantly dragging down the performance of his defence partners. It’s a far cry from how he performed with the Montreal Canadiens last season, where he was frequently relied upon to play up the lineup and more than held his own.

Benn has been a frequent healthy scratch of late in favour of Fantenberg, who saw some early success when he entered the lineup. Fantenberg is a quieter and safer defenceman, but as he’s played more games, the flaws have started to show. Too often Fantenberg and his defence partner get pinned in their own end of the rink for long stretches and eventually get burned.

The Canucks have had defensive troubles beyond just Benn and Fantenberg, and have been a little too reliant on goaltenders Jacob Markstrom and Thatcher Demko to bail them out of tough jams. The issue is that none of the Canucks’ right side defencemen seem to mesh well with either Benn or Fantenberg, which makes it tough to rely on the bottom pair for regular minutes.

That means turning to Hughes more and more. Fortunately, Hughes has answered every call.

Stick-taps and Glove-drops

A tap of the stick to Elias Pettersson, Quinn Hughes, and Jacob Markstrom, who will represent the Canucks at the 2020 NHL All-Star Game next weekend. It’s a well-deserved honour for all three.

A big stick-tap to Tyler Motte, who bravely shared his story of dealing with anxiety and depression heading into the Canucks' Hockey Talks game on Thursday against the Arizona Coyotes.

Big Numbers

28 - Tanner Pearson had just 6 points in his first 18 games. Since then, however, Pearson leads the Canucks in scoring, with 28 points in 29 games. Pearson is currently on-pace for 59 points, which would crush his career-best 44 points from the 2016-17 season.

193 - Few players in the NHL take a physical pounding like the Canucks’ Chris Tanev, who has blocked 106 shots this season and been hit 87 times. Combine those two stats and you get 193: only three players in the NHL have been hit by more players and pucks this season than Tanev.

Provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix announced July 15 that there were 21 new cases in the past 24 hours, including two cases that they call ""epi-linked,"" or presumed cases that have not been proven through testing but are being treated as official cases.

The province has now recorded 3,149 cases since the novel coronavirus first appeared in B.C. in late January.

More than 87.4% of those infected, or 2,753 people, have recovered. Of those who haven't, 189 people have died and 207 people are actively fighting the virus. Only 14 people are hospitalized, with five of those in intensive care units. The rest are self-isolating at home. There were no new deaths recorded in the past 24 hours.

Recording at least 20 new COVID-19 cases in a 24-hour period has become common in B.C., and Henry said yesterday that she found that number ""distressing,"" even though, she added, the good news is that the province knows where the clusters of infection are, many of the infections are linked and the number is not really that large given the province's population of more than five million residents.

The numbers in the past week were:

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12;

• 21 new cases on July 13;

• 13 new cases on July 14; and now

• 21 new cases on July 15.

In June, the number of daily new cases many times was in the single digits.

""There is one active community outbreak, in addition to several community exposure events,"" Henry and Dix said. ""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks.""

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,023 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,659 in Fraser Health;

These are the cities they hear about the most and they might not be aware of the opportunities that await in other cities or provinces.

For those who have only a high school diploma, the best path to citizenship is by going to where the jobs are, says Rachel Gary, COO of Canada Direct. “Be flexible about where you’re willing to move to,” she advises.

Manitoba has the most lenient eligibility requirements because it needs people the most, she says. It’s also the only province that does not require applicants to pass an English language test. Saskatchewan is also making it easier for people to immigrate there.

People might think it’s too cold in these prairie provinces, or prefer more urban environments. Gary suggests that they start in Manitoba or Saskatchewan and, once they earn enough points to get resident status, apply for jobs in other provinces.

“We can submit their application to move to Vancouver right from the start but I can almost guarantee they won’t be in the pool,” she says. “We always tell them the truth because immigrating to Canada is not a cheap process. We don’t want to submit people’s applications and not get them here. If they only have a high school diploma and want this opportunity to come to Canada, they have to go to Manitoba.”

“Getting started on the dream design is easy” says Ali Mozaffari, one of three brothers who own and run the company. “Call us and describe your plans. We’re happy to provide a free estimate with no obligation.”

To bring your dream to life, Iron Age Manufacturing employs a team of designers experienced in computer-aided design (CAD) software.

“You can bring us photos that you have seen or a description of a railing you like,” Ali says, “or we can come to your home, listen carefully as you describe your project, and then our designers will work with you to create something that is just perfect for your setting. And best of all, it will be handcrafted and unique.”

While pre-fabricated iron railings can be purchased at most home DIY stores, Ali advises doing your homework and being clear about what you want.

“Sure, there are pre-fabricated designs that are maybe a little cheaper,” he says, “but the workmanship may have been done overseas to less exacting standards. We’re a family-owned business here on the Lower Mainland. We live in the community and we are driven to create and install high-quality, durable pieces to your specifications. A hand-forged piece of iron will add beauty and functionality to any surrounding for many years to come.”

Iron doesn’t need to be relegated to the garden or the outside. Iron Age Manufacturing fill many orders for indoor stair railings or features for dining room walls.

“There is no limit to where you can put an iron creation,” Ali explains. “It looks beautiful whether it’s inside or out.”

So the Vancouver business has opened its doors to women wanting internships as carpenters.

J&S Reclaimed Wood owners Steve McFarlane and Josh Hooge have connected with Tradeworks, a program that works with women who have barriers to employment. They help participants with life and job skills, and get them internships in the carpentry trade.

“A friend of mine was going through Tradeworks and couldn’t find a comfortable place for her practicum, particularly for carpentry training,” says Steve.

She was going to quit but then asked J&S to host her.

It was at that point that Steve and Josh decided to provide a place for women to receive professional training and develop practical skills in a real shop environment. They host women interns to provide a comfortable environment and equal opportunity in the trade. Many have gone on to careers in woodworking.

Some have even come back to join the J&S team.

J&S was recognized by the Industry Training Authority of BC in 2015 for the support they’ve given women in the Tradeworks program. So far to date they have hosted 13 women.

“The women we’ve hosted here are fantastic to work with,” says Steve. “They’ve demonstrated an amazing attention to detail and an eye for design,”

“They also give lots of forethought to their work and have proven to be very good at multitasking and communication,” says Josh. “Most people think that physical strength is an issue, but with the opportunity to practice and train a bit, a lot of the ladies that have come through our shop are as strong if not stronger than the guys we’ve encountered. It’s always fun to watch the shocked expressions as our girls routinely out lift, out carry and out work guys on the jobsite.”

Both Josh and Steve think it’s much harder for women to get jobs in the trades. As a result, they’re more appreciative when they get a job opportunity.

“Lots of other shops don’t give them the time of day or treat them with respect,” says Josh. “I think they are missing out on a valuable resource to their team.”

The women work on three- or four-week internships. So far, four women have been hired back in the shop after completing the Tradeworks program.

She was leading a healthy and active lifestyle, so she felt whatever the underlying condition was that made wearing her ring uncomfortable it would go away in due course.

She was wrong.

article continues below

Johnson was experiencing the initial indications that arthritis was steadily creeping into her life and would change it almost completely.

The pain eventually radiated throughout her body, from her jaw to her toes.

“I became one ball of pain,” she said. “And I knew from the level of pain something wasn’t right.”

It was also the start of her journey through varying stages of the disease with the assistance of the Arthritis Society, which will hold its 10th annual Walk for Arthritis on June 1 in Vancouver that supports research and education into the disease.

After puzzling doctors as to what ailed her, Johnson was ultimately sent to see a rheumatologist who came back with a triple diagnosis - she had rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and fibromyalgia.

It came as an emotional shock.

In her professional life, she was used to being the point person people looked to for leadership.

“Going from that to being so ill I was in a wheelchair, it emotionally blindsided me.”

She said the Arthritis Society and Mary Pack Arthritis Centre in Vancouver, where she was sent, were pivotal in her treatment, specifically the outpatient day program where a team of five healthcare professionals - a rheumatologist, nurse, an occupational and physiotherapist, and a social worker came to her aid.

“That was the turning point,” she said.

During that time Johnson also found herself reaching out to fellow patients, helping them through their own journeys - an act of empathy Arthritis Society staff recognized, leading them to later ask her to be part of their team of assistants.

“I was so grateful for what help I was receiving that I wanted to help others, because that’s who I am,” she said. “I wanted to pay it forward.”

“They (Arthritis Society staff) saw that even at my weakest I had potential and skills I could offer to others as an educational leader.”

That’s why, since the very first event, Johnson has been a Walk for Arthritis supporter.

“I’ve become an advocate about this and remain passionate because it touches so many lives,” she said.

The notion of establishing a framework to commercialize cannabis began as a promise by the Liberal Party in the 2015 federal election campaign that led to Justin Trudeau becoming prime minister. The implementation of the policy was not as smooth as first envisioned, and the provincial governments were put in charge of setting guidelines for the sale and consumption of marijuana.

article continues below

Research Co. and Glacier Media have been tracking perceptions about legalization every six months in British Columbia. Our latest survey shows that agreement with the new rules remains high across the entire province, that some residents are starting to ponder a future when other drugs could be treated in the same fashion as cannabis, and that – in stark contrast with what we found last year – marijuana users in British Columbia are starting to acquire all of their product through licensed retailers.

As more time passes, British Columbians appear happier with the decision to end prohibition. Seven in 10 of the province’s residents (70%) agree with marijuana being legal in Canada, while 26% disagree and 3% are undecided.

These findings represent a seven-point increase since a similar survey conducted in October 2019, as legal cannabis approached its first anniversary. The groups that are more likely to voice satisfaction with the new status quo are men (75%), British Columbians aged 35 to 54 (76%) and residents of northern B.C. (80%).

In recent weeks, we have seen more talk about creating a safe supply for drugs that are currently available only through illegal means. The impact of these discussions has led to a shift in the views of British Columbians about legalizing all drugs. It must be completely acknowledged that sizable majorities of the province’s residents continue to oppose a move to place any controlled substance inside a store, but the proponents of this option have grown since late last year.

At least two-thirds of British Columbians are opposed to legalizing ecstasy (66%), powder cocaine (70%), heroin (72%), crack cocaine (73%), methamphetamine or “crystal meth” (74%) and fentanyl (75%).

Support for making some of these drugs available in a fashion that would conceivably meet the same guidelines that govern cannabis has risen over the past six months, to 25% for cocaine (up from 18%) and to 24% for heroin (up from 19%). While these are still low proportions, the fluctuation could signal the start of a trend.

Just 10% of British Columbians say they only consumed marijuana after it became legal. Identical proportions of residents tried it before October 2018 (45%) or have never consumed it in Canada (also 45%). The incidence of “legal-only” marijuana users is highest among residents aged 18 to 34 (18%) and those who live in southern B.C. (19%).

But perhaps the biggest surprise, and a source of satisfaction for policy makers, is the way in which cannabis is being sought by users. Just over half of British Columbians who have consumed marijuana since legalization (51%) say that all of their product was acquired at a licensed retailer. In October 2019, only 31% of cannabis consumers in the province were getting all of their product at a licensed retailer.

We still see 16% of British Columbians who say none of their marijuana has been bought at a licensed retailer – a proportion that climbs to 25% among those aged 55 and over. Two-thirds of cannabis consumers aged 35 to 54 (68%) are buying all of their product at a licensed retailer.

Even though the delivery of cannabis products has improved over the past six months, there are significant regional differences that are indubitably related to the presence of stores in specific areas of the province. Cannabis consumers who reside in southern B.C. and Metro Vancouver are the most likely to be getting all of their product from licensed retailers (63% and 62%). The numbers are significantly lower in Vancouver Island (29%), northern B.C. (24%) and the Fraser Valley (19%).

Finally, the issue of “drug testing” remains a priority for British Columbians, with 61% saying that companies in the province should “definitely” or “probably” be able to administer these examinations to any employee now that marijuana is legal.

After a bumpy start that featured slow store openings and hitches with delivery options, there are signs that cannabis legalization is starting to work in a better fashion. More consumers are getting all of their product through licensed retailers, and the number of “new users” has not increased dramatically. Still, the significant regional disparities suggest that more marijuana outlets will need to be authorized in order to effectively eliminate the black market.

Mario Canseco is president of Research Co.

Results are based on an online study conducted from July 10 to July 12, 2020, among 800 adult British Columbians. The data has been statistically weighted according to Canadian census figures for age, gender and region in British Columbia. The margin of error, which measures sample variability, is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.",[]

The Federal Bureau of Prisons is expected to take Sidoo into custody on September 23 and release him from a Pacific Northwest area facility just before Christmas.

article continues below

Sidoo, 61, appeared online via Zoom in front of United States District Judge Nathaniel Gorton of the United States District Court for District of Massachusetts, as well as his lawyers and prosecutors. He wore a plaid suit while sitting in an office space inside his $31.7 million home in Vancouver’s Point Grey neighbourhood.

Sidoo, now a convicted felon, initially pled innocent to fraud and money laundering charges; he teared up before being sentenced and read a prepared statement:

“The last several months have been the hardest in my entire life and today I accept the court’s decision without reservation. No words can express how sorry I am for my decisions and actions that led to this day. I make no excuses, your honour. I broke the law and pled guilty and I now must pay for my actions.

“To my wife and boys, all I ever wanted was your love and respect and to be a good role model. And I know I have made a terrible mistake that has deeply affected our family. To my friends and colleagues and former teammates over the years, I am deeply ashamed today. To the young men and women who looked up to me as a role model, you deserve better. To the court and all of you, I wish to apologize for my actions.

“I will serve my sentence and am committed to returning to the community and doing everything possible to make a positive impact. I hope in time people will not judge me for the worst mistake in my life but for the work in the days, weeks and years ahead in which I am committed to being a better man.”

Gorton told Sidoo he was “impressed” by the businessman’s “obvious remorse.”

But Gorton pointed out two omissions in Sidoo’s statement.

“You expect to put this behind you and go forward and make up for what you called mistakes. I would call it a crime, not a mistake, but nevertheless, it is important that you acknowledge it and realize how many constituencies you have disappointed,” said the judge.

Sidoo also did not explicitly acknowledge that his crimes resulted in two students missing an opportunity to attend the universities his sons, Dylan Sidoo and Jordan Sidoo, were admitted to.

“What you accomplished, along with getting them into college, is to deprive two other deserving students of admittance into those universities — an act that is the very antithesis of one you want to be known for,” said Gorton.

Likewise, United States Attorney Andrew Lelling submitted to Gorton: “Sidoo engaged in serious criminal conduct involving fraud and deception that stretched over multiple years.

“His crimes warrant significant punishment. By engaging in the scheme, with [scheme mastermind Rick Singer] and others, Sidoo was able to steal two college admissions slots for his sons, including one from the University of California at Berkeley, one of the top public universities in the nation.”

Sidoo, said Gorton, “committed a crime that displayed an unbelievable lack of integrity, morality and common sense.

“You have let your selfish desire, your pride and your enormous wealth overcome all of what you apparently want to stand for with your works of charity,” Gorton told Sidoo.

Sidoo’s philanthropy, derived from his earnings in the capital markets, was central to his sentencing defense. According to Sidoo he has donated several million dollars to charitable causes, such as the University of B.C. football program.

In pleading guilty to fraud, Sidoo avoided a maximum prison term of 20 years and prosecutors subsequently agreed to 90 days behind bars, plus a $250,000 fine and one-year of supervised release, which will not be enforced in Canada by the U.S. Probation Department. Prosecutors also agreed to drop the money laundering charge.

The prison Sidoo goes to is expected to have harsher conditions since his options are limited due to his foreign citizenship. His attorney Martin Weinberg said he is expected to spend 14 days in isolation in a “maximum security setting,” due to COVID-19.

Sidoo will get four days credit for time already served. If he serves the full 90 days he will be released December 17 but will have to spend 14 days in isolation at home should B.C. public health rules for international travellers and COVID-19 continue into the fall.

Gorton said Sidoo’s crime would normally warrant more time in jail but there are mitigating circumstances, such as his remorse, lack of criminal record, philanthropy and “collateral consequences,” such as not being able to enter the U.S. as a felon and being stripped last month of his Order of B.C. medal for community service. Sidoo’s attorneys also previously noted he did not directly pay the universities but that his fraud was limited to cheating on the tests.

The former B.C. Lions football player worked as a stock broker in the 1990s and an investment banker between 2000 and 2010. Since 2010 he has made millions of dollars directing a handful of public companies that have failed to generate wealth for retail investors.

Sidoo was arrested March 8, 2019, in San Jose, California, on charges by the U.S. Department of Justice of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering related to the high-profile U.S. college admissions and bribery scandal, brought to light by a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe dubbed Operation Varsity Blues.

One of dozens of parents to be charged, Sidoo initially pled innocent to paying $200,000 total to scheme mastermind William ‘Rick’ Singer, who hired corrupt exam expert Mark Riddell to take Dylan and Jordan’s SAT exams, in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Sidoo also helped falsify one of his son Jordan’s university applications in October 2013 with an essay that originally included a fake claim of Jordan being held up at gunpoint by gangsters, while he was purported to be an intern for an anti-gang organization.

Co-conspirators Singer and Riddell pled guilty last year in exchange for cooperating with the government’s investigation.

The guilty parties in the case, who used Singer’s criminal services, were generally well-off individuals. Celebrities such as actress Lori Loughlin and her clothing designer husband Mossimo Gianulli and actress Felicity Huffman also pled guilty for related crimes and brought much media attention to the investigation.

Sidoo’s sons had no involvement in their father’s crime.

Jordan is now a 2018 history graduate from University of California Berkeley. Dylan graduated in cinematic arts in 2016 from the University of Southern California (USC). The two previously attended Vancouver’s prestigious St. George’s School.

Neither university has announced whether or not their degrees will remain valid. Dylan, according to the sentencing documents, had scored a 1,460/2,400 SAT score until Riddell, using a fake ID in December 2011, bumped up the score to 1,700, which was high enough for Dylan to enter Chapman University (and later transfer to USC). Riddell then scored 2,280/2,400 for Jordan in December 2012, paving the way to Berkley.

Riddell also took a high school test for Dylan. The B.C. Ministry of Education has issued no statement on how its testing process was so vulnerable to fraud.

Both sons have since entered into penny stock promotion with their father.

Exactly one week ago, on July 7, the province recorded 12 new cases. What followed was an uptick in recorded cases:

• 18 new cases on July 8;

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12; and

• 21 new cases on July 13.

""I know it was distressing to me to see 20, especially 25 [new cases] one day,"" Henry said. ""That's way above my comfort zone.""

She added, however, that the slight rise in cases was not unexpected, given that the province has been allowing restaurants and other indoor businesses to reopen.

""We do know where those cases are,"" she said. ""We're testing the people who need to be tested.""

It would be more concerning, she said, if the cases were spread out across the province in an unlinked way. The most recent cluster of cases is linked to the Krazy Cherry Fruit Company in Oliver, she announced yesterday (July 13).

Given B.C.'s population, 20 cases in one day is also better than some other jurisdictions, she said.

The province has identified 3,128 infections since the virus first appeared in the province in late January.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,015 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1649 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 212 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 52 people who reside outside Canada.

Of the 209 people currently fighting COVID-19 in B.C., 14 people are in hospital with five of those in intensive care units. That leaves 2,730 people who have recovered from the virus.

No new deaths from the virus were identified in the past 24 hours, leaving the death toll at 189 people.

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

So far 399 residents and 252 staff at seniors' care facilities have been infected by COVID-19 in B.C.

Health Minister Adrian Dix said that it is his understanding that the federal government and the U.S. government have agreed to extend the closure of the two countries' border for one additional month, until August 21.

""This is obviously positive and necessary news,"" he said. ""Everybody who lives in B.C. knows how inconvenient and how difficult that is for many businesses and many individuals for a variety of circumstances.""

Harry Bains said injured workers have complained for too long that the system lacks fairness and support in times of injury and recovery.

article continues below

Changes Bains proposes include raising the maximum annual salary on which compensation benefits are based; authorizing WorkSafeBC to provide preventative medical treatment before claim acceptance; giving powers to the court to issue WorkSafeBC search and seizure warrants appropriate for investigating workplace safety infractions; and giving people a voice in serious workplace prosecutions and trials by using victim impact statements.

Victoria is also fast-tracking legislation to handle situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic so workers can access benefits more easily.

During the pandemic, the regulator is allowing businesses to defer paying their premiums for six months without penalty or interest. It is also waiving premiums on wages paid to workers of employers receiving the Canadian Emergency Wage Subsidy.

The amendments to the Workers Compensation Act comes after three expert reviews were completed in 2018 and 2019.

The ministry said of the more than 44,000 injured workers currently receiving permanent disability benefits because of a work-related injury, about 35% are in the Lower Mainland, while the rest are spread throughout all regions of B.C.

There are more than 100,000 workplace injury or fatality claims annually.

In 2019, there were 140 workplace fatalities in B.C. Of that number, 84 were due to occupational disease, 40 to traumatic injury and 16 the result of a motor vehicle incident.

In a fiscal update Tuesday, B.C. Finance Minister Carole James said the COVID-19 pandemic will result in ""the worst downturn experienced in our province in recent history.""

article continues below

""The projected numbers are staggering, but they're not without hope,"" James said, in summing up B.C.'s fiscal position.

She said B.C. had entered the pandemic perhaps better situated than other provinces, as it had a balanced budget, a triple AAA credit rating and one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country.

B.C. also managed to contain the pandemic and flatten its growth curve better than some other provinces, and it has been able to move earlier on a phased economic restart plan.

""Because of that strength, we were able to take immediate action to help people, to help businesses, to help communities with our $5 billion COVID action plan,"" James said.

She said the province is expecting a loss of $4.2 billion in tax revenue, including $1 billion less in personal income tax revenue, $973 million less in corporate taxes, $1.3 billion in provincial sales tax revenue, $300 million in natural resource revenues and $882 million less in Crown Corporation income.

The province is also spending $5 billion in emergency spending, and has approved $1.3 billion in tax credits and deferrals. In total, the increased spending, lost tax revenue and foregone revenue will bring the deficit to $12.5 billion.

In February, James brought down, but never passed, a balanced budget and modest surplus of $227 million and provincial GDP growth projections of 2% in 2020.

""Mere weeks after the budget 2020 was tabled, our entire world changed,"" James said.

James said the B.C. economy is now expected to contract 6.8% in 2020, according to some forecasters.

Since February, B.C. lost 235,000 jobs, and saw retail sales declined by 23.6% in April compared to February. Overall, home prices dropped 4%.

Home sales declined 45.4% in May, compared to February, and B.C. merchandise exports are down 14.7% year-to-date, compared to January to May 2019.

""While the job losses in March and April were record-breaking, figures for May and June in fact have seen some recovery of the losses that we experienced in the previous two months,"" James said.

Asked if her government planned to resort to spending cuts to address the deficit, James said ""now is not the time to be able to cut back on services and support for people and business in British Columbia.""

As for any long-range plans for dealing with debt and deficits, James said: ""I do not believe that it's going to be a quick fix.""

Asked if the $5 billion that her government has already approved could be added to later this year, James said ""I believe the $5 billion is enough now.""

However, she added no one can predict what might happen should there be a second wave of COVID-19.

As for the $22 billion in capital spending allocated in the 2020 budget over three years for big capital works projects, like new schools, hospitals, bridges and roads, that will continue to be spent.

""This is going to serve us very well because it translates into huge investments,"" James said.

No example is better than the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks in the United States, which gave us the “Patriot Act” after just 45 days of deliberation to expand government surveillance of Americans to previously unimagined levels.

In mid-April, the actions of Gabriel Wortman led to the deaths of 22 people in Nova Scotia after multiple shootings and fires. Most Canadians, at the time still under lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, were horrified at Wortman’s actions, which included impersonating a police officer.

It took the federal government only 13 days after Wortman’s criminal activity was evident for the entire country to announce a nationwide ban on 1,500 types of military-grade “assault-style” weapons in Canada. Any Canadian who possesses these firearms will have two years to get rid of them. The prohibition led to many new discussions about the role that firearms play in Canada’s urban and rural areas.

We know now that the perpetrator of the 22 murders in Nova Scotia had obtained his weapons illegally from Canadian and American sources. This was not a surprise for Canadian authorities, who have consistently reported that more than 70% of the weapons used in gun-related crimes in our country come from the United States.

On the issue of firearms, Canada is decidedly different from the United States. In Canada, it is not legal for a person to own or carry a firearm for the purpose of self defence against human beings. When Research Co. and Glacier Media asked Canadians about this key precept of Canadian law, more than three in four (77%) agreed with it, while 18% disagreed and 5% were undecided.

Atlantic Canada (31%), Saskatchewan and Manitoba (29%) and Alberta (24%) boast the highest number of residents who openly question Canada’s long-standing regulations for firearms. While higher than what is observed in Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia, these are not proportions of voters that would sway an election, certainly not in the way American statewide and congressional races can be tilted if your candidate can adequately hold a shotgun and recite the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution in a manner that panders to the base.

Fewer than one in five Canadians welcome the notion of citizens carrying firearms for something other than hunting or scaring wildlife away. Any survey measuring opinions on banning “assault-style” weapons would be met with near unanimity. The opposition reacted to the announced ban as it always has under its outgoing leader, by claiming the regulations would affect law-abiding Canadians. Lost in this unfortunate combination of inadequate polling and incapable opposition are the solutions that matter to Canadians.

In our survey, more than three in five Canadians (63%) told us that gun violence in Canada is a “very serious” or “moderately serious” problem – a proportion that climbs to 69% among women and 68% among those aged 55 and over.

Sizable majorities of Ontarians and British Columbians, who have experienced gang wars in urban areas, are more likely to look at gun violence as particularly problematic (76% and 67%, respectively). The COVID-19 pandemic did little to curb gun violence in Toronto, where 61 people were shot in the first four months of the year.

We asked Canadians about the effectiveness of four possible measures, and their responses outline a public that is ready for bold action. More than three in five Canadians (62%) think enacting a complete ban on handguns would be “very effective” or “moderately effective” in reducing gun violence in Canada. Most crimes, after all, are not being committed with the military-grade “assault-style” weapons that the federal government was quick to ban.

A higher proportion of Canadians deem two other measures as effective: imposing mandatory jail terms for crimes committed with firearms (74%) and introducing new outreach programs to steer youth away from gangs (also 74%).

Canadians place dealing with firearms smuggled from the United States as the most important issue that needs to be addressed. Many of the country’s residents also want to make sure gangs are not attractive to our country’s youth and believe mandatory minimum jail sentences would act as a deterrent.

Banning military-grade “assault-style” weapons is low-hanging fruit in a challenge that definitely has Canadians preoccupied and wishing for a type of government intervention that goes beyond a photo-op celebrated by poorly executed survey charity work.

True sociologists know that we learn nothing from posing the wrong questions to Canadians, and capable politicians should go beyond voicing displeasure with plans and proposals just because that is what they are expected to do. Meanwhile, Canadians are still worried about gun violence and expecting their elected officials to do better. •

Before 10 a.m. is preferred, earlier is better. Later than noon? Don’t bother.

article continues below

Buntzen Lake is one of the most popular multi-use recreation areas in the Lower Mainland, so parking fills up fast. I repeat: Get there early.

Another piece of advice: use GPS or online maps to find your way there. Even with existing direction signs, it can still be confusing since one route winds through new sub-divisions in Coquitlam.

But once you reach Buntzen Lake (early!) you have numerous options for great hikes, each with various degrees of difficulty.

The easiest, most family-friendly hike is the three-kilometre Buntzen Lake Trail that hugs the east side of the water to reach North Beach at the northern end of the lake. There is minimal overall elevation gain, but the well-marked and well-maintained trail rises and falls (never too steeply) and passes a few off-shoot trails to small lakeside spots.

The beach is a great place to enjoy lunch and take in the peaceful view. Just east of the beach is a huge outflow water pipe, the end point of a tunnel that begins four km to the east at Coquitlam Lake and runs under Eagle Mountain.

The Buntzen Lake Reservoir and recreational area is BC Hydro property. The water is used to generate electricity at a power station north of and far downhill from the reservoir, along Indian Arm.

From North Beach, you can simply re-trace your steps along the easy route. Or for a longer, more strenuous return, cross the suspension bridge and hike the west side of the Buntzen Lake Trail. Five-kilometres long, this side also has steeper sections that rise in and out of the rainforest. Bring plenty of water.

After the trail joins a gravel road for the last kilometer, return to your car by turning left at the “Floating Bridge” crossing the narrower south end of the lake.

For well-prepared and fit hikers looking for more of a workout and even more spectacular views, the Diez Vistas Trail (it translates to “ten views” in Spanish) is a popular choice. But be prepared for a climb over 500 metres elevation gain and bring extra water. You might want to re-name this hike the “Diez Heart Attacks” trail by the time you’re done — but it will be worth it.

The trailhead is at the southwest corner of the parking lot. Follow the flat trail south, turn right to cross the Floating Bridge, then stay straight as the first section rises immediately through second-growth forest. Large cedar stumps and remnants of an 100-year old “skid road” characterize the logging history of the area.

After a clearing under power lines, the real effort begins. The rocky, rooty trail moves northwest around and over a ridge to the west-facing side of the mountain, then begins a series of switchbacks that will test your fitness (I suggested calling this section the “Diez Switchbacks”).

After the first series of switchbacks you emerge — likely sweating — at a small rocky outcrop looking southwest to Belcarra Park. Many first-timers assume this must be Vista No. 1, but alas, it is not. It’s a great place for a water break, but more climbing and switchbacks are ahead before you finally reach the official first Vista.

And what a vista! On a clear day, the deep blue waters of Indian Arm shimmer like a jewel and Deep Cove is framed perfectly to the west. Behind it you can see downtown Vancouver and even glimpse Vancouver Island. Mount Seymour’s first peak and ski resort buildings are also easy to pick out.

If Vista No. 1 is enough — and for many people it is — return downhill through the switchbacks or via a side trail loop that leads to an east-facing lookout over Buntzen Lake.

Or you can continue north along the plateau trail to the rest of the Diez Vistas. Keep in mind, however, time and inevitable tree growth has obscured many of the vistas. Close to half are now blocked by trees, but the ones that still offer views are worth the time and trouble.

The trail eventually drops down to intersect with the steep, downhill Lakeview Trail and the Old Buntzen Lake Trail, for your return trip.

717,vancourier,https://www.vancourier.com/sports/hiking/hiking-fatal-origins-of-cypress-t-33-ski-run-1.1302330,Hiking: Fatal origins of Cypress T-33 ski run,['Mike Hanafin'],,"The date was November 23, 1963. The world was reeling from the news of John F. Kennedy’s assassination the previous day, but Vancouver newspapers soon minimized the JFK headlines for news of a military plane crash in the North Shore Mountains. This alpine hike gives you the opportunity to visit that crash site and, if you wish, pay your respects.

The Royal Canadian Navy T-33 training jet was flying in bad weather when it slammed into the dense forest of Mt. Strachan, in what is now the Cypress ski resort. Both pilots from Victoria were killed, and it took rescue workers more than three days to locate the wreckage. Today, you can hike to the debris field in close to two hours.

article continues below

The trailhead for this journey back in time is the Cypress Mountain parking lot. Find the Cypress Provincial Park information board and the Baden Powell Trail just a few steps north of the parking lot. Head east as the BP Trail quickly dives into a forest blessed with numerous old-growth cedar, hemlock and fir trees.

After crossing several creeks, you reach a junction with the Mt. Strachan Trail. Turn left and start climbing as the trail runs parallel to the creek gully on your left. Shortly after the next junction with the Old Strachan Trail, you reach a mammoth yellow-cedar tree — nicknamed the Hollyburn Giant— which stands three metres in diameter and is more than 1,000 years old.

As you continue climbing on a hot day, you’ll likely need a few water breaks (bring plenty to drink). One great place to stop and breathe the fresh alpine air is Frank Lake, which is slightly visible through the bush on a small plateau to the right. Take a look, but the best views of the lake are just ahead. As the trail rises, look back: the lake is perfectly framed between the trees.

Eventually you arrive at another junction in a shady mountain saddle between Mt. Strachan on your left and Hollyburn Peak to your right. Stay left, and enjoy the viewpoint looking east to Crown, Grouse, and Seymour mountains.

Resist the urge to turn right to Hollyburn. The trail is steep, rough, and there are many stories of injuries and visits from North Shore Rescue. If you want to tackle Hollyburn Peak (and by all means, you should), do it from the Cypress cross-country ski parking lot.

A little bit of scrambling up and down is required here and there as the trail turns back toward a ski run, Collins. But follow the tree markers, which weave through a number of small ponds and are great for dogs to cool off in. Just east of the base of the upper ski lift, turn right and back into the forest for the final ascent up the south peak of Mt. Strachan.

It won’t be long before you stop again. After a short, steep section which leaves you a bit breathless, the rest of your breath will be taken away at the sight of metal debris scattered in the woods.

The ferocity of the T-33 crash is immediately evident. The debris field covers a large area spreading from east to west across the trail and ending with a large concentration of fuselage and engine parts on the forest floor, just 30 to 40 metres away from the ski lift and a ski run named “T-33” in tribute. The ski resort has detailed the history.

A small metal plate on a tree announces: ""These are the remains of a Canadian Armed Forces T 33 Trainer which crashed on Nov 23, 1963, killing 2 — Do not take anything.""

Fortunately, it appears hikers have respected this request, even placing poppies beside the plaque.

After contemplating the accident, it is time to finish on a more uplifting note. Return to the trail, and start climbing — up, up, up — on the steepest ascent so far. You’ll likely need your hands and feet to scramble at some points.

Then, suddenly, you emerge from the forest, and over a rocky crest, appears your first view of The Lions to the north. You have reached the south peak of Mt. Strachan. Enjoy the stunning 360 degree views. And spare a final thought for the two pilots.

For the trip back to your car, you can either retrace your steps or simply follow the downhill ski runs, which are less interesting but quicker.

Let’s add great hiking to that list of reasons. For the cost of a 20 minute ferry ride to Snug Cove, you can hike to a mountain top or walk around a serene lake — or both.

article continues below

Originally this column was intended to describe the hike to the top of Mt. Gardner, Bowen Island’s highest peak at 720 metres, but because that hike is a bit of a brute and not for everyone, we’ve also included a visit to picturesque Crippen Regional Park, which is much more family friendly and requires much less effort.

Two pieces of advice: (1) leave the car at home and bring a bike if you can, and (2) bring plenty of water because you’ll need it. (Bring two litres minimum for the mountain hike.) The bike speeds up the journey to and from the Mt. Gardner trailhead, which is three kilometres from Snug Cove.

Also make sure you grab the Bowen Island tourist map onboard the Queen of Capilano, or at the visitor information booth after you get off the ferry. It is a great supplement to the hiking map we’ve provided.

You don’t need a car to reach Horseshoe Bay Terminal; the 257 Express bus has frequent service from downtown Vancouver (starting at Dunsmuir and Cambie, with pick-ups along Georgia). Check the TransLink and BC Ferries websites for exact departure times.

After enjoying the fresh air of Howe Sound, leave the Bowen ferry terminal and turn right at a well-marked trailhead for the Alder Grove Trail into Crippen Park. After passing (or exploring) the fish ladder on your right, turn right and follow Miller Road for about 100 metres until you see the Killarney Creek Trail across the road.

Head west along the wide, smooth trail, enjoying the shade and listening to birds in the trees. A number of large trees managed to survive logging, but one huge tree has fallen right beside the trail in the last two years, leaving a splintered stump and an opening in the forest canopy. Can you see the early signs of re-growth thanks to sunshine reaching the forest floor?

As you approach Killarney Lake, turn left towards a picnic area and park bench at the dam. Then turn right onto a loop trail that hugs the lake’s edge and gives you multiple vantage points for photos. Bird spotters can often be seen with binoculars.

You can continue hiking or biking around the loop, or — if Mt. Gardner is your primary goal — turn left at a well-marked junction and head uphill to Mt. Gardner Road. Turn right and follow the road until you reach post 490, at the intersection with “Hikers Road”. Cross the road carefully and get ready to start sweating!

There are many routes up the mountain — some marked better than others, and some parts not properly signed at all. Old and surprisingly inaccurate maps from hiking books add to the confusion for many hikers. Hopefully our map corrects that.





If you want the least confusing but consistently steepest way up, take the Skid Trail to the Mt. Gardner South Trail and turn left. For a longer and slightly gentler trip (but still plenty steep in places), turn right after the Skid Trail and follow signs and red tree markers to the Handloggers Trail and the Mt. Gardner North Trail. The biggest advantage of this route is that it takes you to a rocky bluff with spectacular views of the Sunshine Coast.

On a recent excursion I came across two groups of hikers struggling to follow incorrect maps and confusing signage. The good news is, all the routes eventually reach the destination. But my suggested route tries to avoid most of the rough logging and service roads.

After turning right after the Skid Trail, you follow a short smooth path heading north to a junction with the Bowen Pit Road, which comes up the hill towards you. You’ll be making a U-turn to the left here, but on the right is a small viewpoint, good for a quick stop.

Follow the rocky road uphill as it curves to the right… until you see a small path marked by flagging tape and red tree markers on the right. Turn here, and head north again, as you join the Handloggers Trail. The trail gets off to an inauspicious start, as you are forced to scramble down and back up a dry creek bed (where a small bridge may have collapsed).

Stay on the relatively flat Handloggers Trail as it curves west through second growth fir trees. There are some junctions with old roads and sketchy trails, but don’t turn off until you reach an obvious junction with a small sign that points left to Mt. Gardner.

From this point, the climb begins in earnest. Follow the red tree markers wherever possible. There is one tricky section where the path joins a gravel road with power lines overhead, then does a sharp U-turn to the right. Eventually you’re back on a proper uphill trail until you reach the Sunshine Coast Viewpoint, looking across to Keats Island and Gibsons.

Re-hydrate before leaving the bluff for the final uphill climb to the peak. A fork in the trail gives you options for the last stage. The left fork is the most direct route to the North Peak but it is much steeper, including one section with ropes and chains to help you ascend. In the spring this route can also be icy, so be careful. If ropes and chains aren’t your thing, the right fork eventually loops back to the peak via a much less severe climb.

A wooden platform (actually helicopter pad) among a myriad of communications towers at the North Peak is ideal for lunch and enjoying the unique views looking east to Vancouver, Horseshoe Bay and the mountains rising from Howe Sound.

For the trip down, leave the North Peak area via a small opening at the south end of the platform. The trail passes a cut-off to the slightly higher South Peak, but don’t waste your time and energy — there’s not much view from that peak. Turn left at the junction with the Mt. Gardner Trail. The well-marked South Trail is recommended for the descent and it leads to a shortcut back to the Skid Trail and eventually the original logging road connecting to Mt. Gardner Road. The bike really comes in handy here, for a fun, mostly downhill ride back to the village and ferry terminal.

It's incredible to me that less than 60 years ago the slopes of West Vancouver were still being logged commercially —and not just to clear space for million-dollar homes. The scars are still visible from Vancouver.

This hike takes you to the survivors of that 19th and 20th-century logging and these are some of the biggest and oldest fir trees in Canada.

article continues below

The suggested hike is a seven-kilometre combination of the Lawson Creek and Brother's Creek Forestry Heritage Walks, created years ago by the District of West Vancouver. But history aside, the highlight is the massive Hollyburn Fir.

The trailhead is at the corner of Millstream Road and Chartwell Drive in the upper section of British Properties. Hiking boots or sturdy shoes are highly recommended for these rocky, often muddy and moderately steep trails; bring plenty of water and pack a lunch as well. Head west on the Millstream Trail, turning right at the junction with the gravel fire access road. Soon a signpost on the right side of the road marks the ""Shields Incline Railway,"" but stay left and save that for the return trip. You'll soon come across remnants of an old army surplus truck (including the engine block) used by logging crews until it expired around 1950.

Keep pushing uphill until you reach the Skyline Trail, which is indicated by power lines overhead. Turn left at the Skyline Trail, then turn right at the junction for the Upper Brewis Trail. Follow the orange reflective tree markers uphill for 20 minutes until you catch your first glimpse of the giant Hollyburn Fir.

At three metres in diameter and 10 metres in circumference, it is one of the biggest and oldest Douglas fir trees in B.C. if not the world. It is estimated to be well over 1,100 years old and the surrounding 100-and 200-year-old ""youngsters"" look like twigs by comparison.

The Hollyburn Fir survived the axe and saw of the early 1900s because local loggers were mostly interested in cedar trees for shingles. It was re-discovered in the mid-1980s when the province was compiling a Big Tree Registry.

You can retrace your steps back downhill from here or turn right and head east along the aptly named Crossover Trail, which is relatively flat and usually muddy. After passing junctions for the Baden Powell and Brother's Creek trails (shortcuts back), the Crossover Trail eventually reaches a junction with the upper section of the Shields Incline Railway.

To see a few more giant trees, turn left and follow the uphill trail. It joins the Brother's Creek Fire Road before you see a marker for ""Giant Trees"" to the right. The first of these is another Douglas fir called the Candelabra Tree.

After a 300-metre elevation gain from the trailhead, it's all downhill from here. Retrace your steps down the fire road and turn right at the Shield's Incline Railway post. This trail-now grown-over but easier on the knees than the gravel road-is the former bed of a cable railway system which carried logs and shinglebolts downhill using ""Steam Donkey"" and ""Walking Dudley"" engines in the 1920s.

The trail is named after Robert Shields, popular owner of a shingle company that owned the land rights to log the area. The railway was abandoned in 1926 once the accessible cedars were cut down. Environmental concerns, including erosion and the degradation of the view, didn't rise until later in the century.

Turn right at the familiar Skyline Trail, cross the bridge over Brother's Creek, then turn left at the Brother's Creek Trail and follow it downhill until it rejoins the lower section of the Incline Railway Trail downhill to Millstream.

If you have a few minutes, turn right for a quick side-trip along the Millstream Trail to the Shields Log Dam and Flume Pond. This was once a mid-mountain stop for cedar shinglebolts carried by the railway and an extensive flume system.

From here, it's an easy stroll east along the Millstream Trail to your car, and a return to the 21st century.
