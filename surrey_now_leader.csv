As COVID-19 continues to spread, health officials are urging British Columbians to ensure they take the proper steps to get tested while also not spreading the virus to others.

“Now is the time to put some distance between us to keep our germs to ourselves,” provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said earlier this week, reiterating crucial steps of prevention she has noted since mid-February.

The virus has spread rapidly in B.C. over the past few weeks. There have been at least 46 cases and one death. Globally, there have been more than 118,00 confirmed cases and 4,300 deaths, the majority of them in China, Italy and Iran.

That includes at least four cases of community transmission, which means it remains unclear how those cases were contracted but were not from travelling.

So how do you know if you have the novel coronavirus? How can you tell if it is COVID-19 and not the flu or cold? And most importantly: What do you do if you are, in fact, infected?

Symptoms of COVID-19:

The symptoms of the novel coronavirus are similar to a common cold or flu, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada.

That includes a fever and cough but most importantly difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. In severe cases, symptoms can include severe lung infections.

Health officials have warned that it can take up to 14 days, or two weeks, for symptoms to appear and can range from mild to severe. Seniors and those with underlying medical conditions are most at-risk of seeing adverse impacts if they contract the virus.

Out of precaution, health officials have made it clear: if you feel sick, stay home.

""Now is the time to put some distance between us to keep our germs to ourselves,"" Henry says. #COVIDー19 — Ashley Wadhwani (@ashwadhwani) March 7, 2020

The B.C. government has now added an online assesment tool for those who think they may have the disease, and what steps they need to take based off their symptoms.

How the virus spreads:

Coronavirus is transmitted through larger liquid droplets – such as when a person coughs or sneezes. That means the virus can enter a second person’s system through their eyes, nose or throat if in close contact.

While the virus is not known to be airborne, or transmitted through the particles floating in the air, and it is not something that comes in through the skin, it can be spread by touch if a person has used their hands to cover their mouth or nose when they cough.

Health officials recommend to always cough or sneeze into the arm and wash your hands regularly. People should also avoid handshaking and hugs.

A good rule of thumb: Stay at least six feet away from another person.‎

How to get tested:

Anyone who thinks they may have the virus is being urged not to panic, and most importantly to stay home.

Anyone in B.C. who develops symptoms should first call HealthLink BC, by dialing 811, to talk to a health care worker and determine the most appropriate next steps.

The nurses at HealthLink BC will complete an exposure risk assessment of callers with compatible symptoms, such as cough or influenza-like symptoms. In some cases, nurses may suggest a caller go see a health care provider for assessment and testing, either at an urgent primary care centre or walk-in clinic.

Our 811 navigators and nurses are doing an incredible job with record high call volumes – providing support to 3291 callers yesterday. We are adding more staff and more phone lines to resolve the intermittent busy signals some people have experienced. @TeamPAL #COVID19 — Adrian Dix (@adriandix) March 12, 2020

It is highly recommend that anyone who may have COVID-19 call ahead to tell the clinicians that they are coming.

COVID-19 testing is done through a nasopharyngeal swab or throat swab.

Anyone who is tested may be told to self-isolate until the tests can be analyzed in a laboratory. Test results can be found by calling the B.C. Centre for Disease Control coronavirus hotline at 1-833-707-2792.

What happens if you have COVID-19:

Anyone with COVID-19 is being placed in quarantine, at their home or in the hospital, for at least 14 days. In order to be released from quarantine, an infected person must have two consecutive negative tests at least 24 hours apart.

The BC CDC suggests that if you are sharing your home to stay and sleep in a room with good airflow that is away from others. Other precautions include using a separate bathroom, if you can, avoid sharing household items, flush the toilet with the lid down, and clean and disinfect common areas once a day.

Is there a cure?

At this time, there is no vaccine for this particular coronavirus, and health officials say it could take many years to create.

There is no specific treatment, but many of the symptoms can be managed with home treatment such as drinking plenty of fluids, rest and using a humidifier or hot shower to ease a cough or sore throat, according to HealthLink BC.

Most people recover from coronaviruses on their own, however for people with more serious illness, supportive care in or out of hospital may be needed.

With new novel Coronavirus cases emerging all over the world, health officials are urging residents to take precautionary measures to prevent more individuals from getting sick.

Canadian health officials are urging people to wash their hands frequently, with soap, for at least 20 seconds at a time and avoid touching their face or other people.

Handshakes and embraces should also be avoided.

“Wash our hands, stay home when you’re sick, stay home from school, stay home from public events, stay home from visiting people in long term health [facilities] and hospitals,” Health Minister Adrian Dix said at a news conference in early March.

Lucky for us, a 17-year-old developer from Oxford, England has designed an easy way to make sure we all properly wash our hands.

William Gibson, the teen behind washyourlyrics.com, has created a poster generator that takes your favourite song and automatically turns it into a hand washing infographic.

Were you looking forward to a vacation this spring but are now worried about the COVID-19 pandemic?

Canada is under a global travel advisory due to the novel coronavirus. Canadians are being urged to avoid non-essential travel and Transport Canada is warning that repatriation flights are not currently being operated, which could leave those who choose to go abroad stranded.

For hotel stays and airlines outside of Canada, check with your airline, your hotel or your travel agent for their cancellation policies. Some travel insurance is continuing to cover COVID-19 but many providers are not, deeming it a “known circumstance,” which is typically excluded from coverage. Trip cancellation insurance may be an option for those who booked before news of COVID-19 broke.

All air passengers are required to wear masks, although some airlines have removed or relaxed physical distancing requirements on board.

As health officials work to sort out the particulars around what specific industries and sectors will need to do in order to re-open safely, British Columbians have been given a high-level road map as to what will relaunch, and when.

Led by provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry, the multi-phase plan which has been dubbed “the new normal” will rely on whether B.C. sees a required decrease in the number of new daily COVID-19 cases.

As long as British Columbians don’t let up on the basics – frequently washing hands, practising physical distancing, avoiding any non-essential trips, staying home when sick, and taking a careful approach to broadening social circles beyond those currently in their household – there has been much hope voiced by health officials that there could be overnight camping, movie theatres and other social activities returning in coming months.

“We need to have a slow and thoughtful reset, we do not want to undo all that we have done,” Henry said on Thursday (May 7).

ALSO READ: Here’s what is considered an essential service in B.C.

The plan to re-open parts of B.C., curated by Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix, will meet its first test in a few weeks, as the province moves to “Phase Two” with the re-opening of libraries, in-person counselling, restaurants and more.

Henry has made it clear that bans will be reintroduced if she sees a resurgence in cases.

Here’s a timeline of how the province plans to phase in various services.

Phase Two, mid-May:

Re-scheduling elective surgeries and other health services

Dix announced this week that health authorities have already started calling patients who were forced to reschedule an elective surgery due to hospital restrictions and so bed space remained open in case of a spike in COVID-19 cases.

Meanwhile, other medical services such as dentistry, physiotherapy, registered massage therapy and chiropractors will also be able to safely re-open. This includes physical therapy, speech therapy and similar services.

In-person counselling will also be able to resume under physical distancing protocols.

Hair salons and personal services

Welcome news for most: Salons, barber shops and other personal service establishments will be able to accept clients. The decision by health officials comes despite a growing petition signed by some stylists and barbers asking the province not to “single them out” by opening first.

Restaurants, cafes and pubs

In late April, a group of restaurateurs were asked to create a proposed plan on how the industry could re-open safely. Since mid-March, restaurants and pubs of all sizes have been operating only as take-out and delivery services due to concerns of physical distancing.

A possible blueprint, created by the BC Restaurant and Foodservices Association, on how businesses will have to adjust floor plans, seating arrangements and even the handling of cash, is currently before WorkSafeBC, which will be the final green light before dine-in options can return.

Henry has said that ensuring public trust is a second piece in the puzzle. The proposed plan includes a course that business owners and employees will have to undergo, and if passed, get to place a sticker on their front window.

Recreation and community spaces

Phase Two is also set to include the re-opening of museums, art galleries and libraries, as well as recreation spaces.

Parks, beaches and outdoor sites can also open. As with all other sites, physical distancing must be possible, as well as places to properly wash hands. In some cases, this could mean a cap on the number of visitors at any given time.

Health officials have OK’d some non-contact sports, such as soccer and lacrosse.

B.C. Parks has announced some trails will re-open to day use on May 14, with camping reservations to relaunch on May 25 through the Discover Camping online portal.

Office work spaces

Returning to the office will be likely for many British Columbians, but will have to be under measures that reduce the density of employees within certain areas.

Health officials have suggested that employers may stagger shifts, place physical barriers in between desks and space, and ensure hand sanitizer is available for staff.

All employers should have sick-day policies in place so employees don’t attend work when ill, and consider providing work from home options when possible, to reduce contact intensity.

Child care and education

As parents and caregivers prepare to return to work, the province is anticipating an increased need in child care support.

Child care has been considered an essential service, meaning that was not forced to close down like other businesses. Officials have said that in-classroom education will involve its own set of phases – yet to be released – that will allow kids back in the classroom before others.

“With weeks left in the school year, we anticipate many kids will not return to the classroom until September,” the province confirmed.

Phase Three, June to September

If transmission rates of COVID-19 remain low or in decline, Henry has said that further restrictions will be eased under enhanced measures.

While large-scale events, such as parades or mass gatherings will remain off the table through the summer and possibly into next year, the province is hopeful that British Columbians will be able to go to the movies again, starting in July.

Hotels and resorts

The hotel industry has been hard-hit due to a decrease in overall travel both inter-provincially and internationally, forcing many to shutter.

In Victoria and Vancouver, some have entered agreements with the province to serve as temporary housing for hundreds of homeless people currently living in three large encampments.

Exactly what protocols will be put in place in order for hotels and resorts to open safely have not been released, but will likely involve enhanced cleaning and limited guests. The World Health Organization and Henry have suggested that the bacterium does not live on surfaces for longer than hours to days, but specifics have not been confirmed by researchers.

Camping

Overnight camping will be available across B.C.’s parks beginning June 1. Meanwhile, some private campgrounds have remained open through the pandemic.

Film industry

It’s no surprise that Hollywood North has suffered due to border closures and physical distancing measures. Filming across B.C. tends to pick up in the spring and summer, specifically for Hallmark Christmas movies.

Health officials hope that in June or July that domestic productions will be able to resume.

Entertainment

In July, British Columbians may be allowed to head to the movies or attend a symphony, so long as transmission rates stay low.

While large concerts and festivals are off the table, movie theatres and smaller venues will have to follow current bans on gatherings being less than 50 people. Physical distancing also calls for at least two metres between individuals or strangers.

Education

The next school year will still be feeling the impacts of COVID-19, according to B.C.’s plan.

In September, Kindergarten to Grade 12 students will see a “partial return” to school. It’s too soon to say exactly what that will look like.

Post-secondary students could see a mix of online and in-class lectures, with a likely cap on attendance in larger-sized classrooms.

Phase Four, to be determined

It’s unclear when B.C. will enter Phase Four of the provincial plan, because it relies on the development of a widely available vaccine – which has yet to be created – the province reaching herd immunity, or a broad successful treatment that can manage COVID-19 symptoms.

Henry has said that B.C.’s goal is not to reach herd immunity because too many people, particularly seniors, run the risk of seeing adverse impacts of the virus and high numbers of cases would place too much pressure on the health care system.

ALSO READ: Gaining herd immunity through COVID-19 transmissions ‘ineffective’: B.C.’s top doctor

The BC Centre for Disease Control has warned it could take years for a vaccine to be developed, tested and widely implemented.

However, when that does come, B.C. health officials will look to allowing conventions, live audiences at professional sports, concerts, night clubs and casinos and international tourism. Those sectors will also have to create individually tailored plans that meet the necessary health requirements.

WARNING: This story discusses sexual violence

Metro Vancouver Transit Police are investigating after a woman received several AirDropped photos containing “extremely disturbing sexual threats” while on a bus in Surrey.

READ ALSO: Woman sexually assaulted, robbed near Surrey SkyTrain station: RCMP, July 11, 2020

Police say the incident happened July 14, around 11 p.m., after the woman got on a bus at the Newton Exchange.

“Shortly after sitting down, she received multiple AirDrop messages that contained extremely disturbing sexual threats. The woman did look around the bus and noticed there was about 15 other people on board,” said Constable Mike Yake, transit police media relations officer.

The woman in question posted about the ordeal on Facebook on July 15.

She said that “within minutes” of sitting down, she received an AirDrop image request. The image was black “except for a short sentence in white: ‘I’m going to rape you.’”

AirDrop messages, a feature on iPhones, lets people “share instantly with people nearby,” according to the feature. People can change their settings to receive AirDrops from everyone, contacts only or turn their receiving off.

The woman said that she then sent a screenshot of the AirDrop request to a friend, who offered to pick her up.

Before contacting transit police, the woman said she received the request twice more.

“I text them the screenshot and an explanation of the situation. They are helpful and start asking lots of questions, and some that I don’t have the immediate answer to,” according to her post.

Yake said the woman got off the bus at a stop in South Surrey to have her friend pick her up and transit police officers met her “a short time later.”

The incident, he said, is being “actively investigated.”

Yake said he can’t go into detail regarding the specific investigation techniques, “but we do have the ability through our investigation to possibly locate individuals who were on the bus at a specific time.”

As for incidents like this, Yake said transit police “strongly” encourages people to “discreetly” text 87-77-77, “whether they’re feeling uncomfortable or in a situation that they feel is going to unfold.”

By texting that number, he said the person will then be in “direct contact” with dispatchers and officers can be sent to wherever the incident is happening.

Yake added that reducing sexual offences is “one of Metro Vancouver Transit Police’s top-four priorities, so we take incidents like this extremely seriously and it’s going to be investigated to our full capabilities.”

(Image: City of Surrey)

Surrey council has given third-reading approval to a 25-storey office tower for the southeast corner of Central City mall, at 10045 King George Boulevard.

A “virtual” public hearing was held Monday, July 13.

Council then gave its approval with no debate.

Guildford resident Richard Landale, the first speaker to address council, noted a traffic impact study indicates 473 vehicles will impact the area at a “peak-hour” period while a report has 982 commercial parking stalls.

“Obviously there is more critical information staff is withholding from council that is relevant to any decisions made by council this evening,” he charged.

He also noted 89 trees will be removed in exchange for a $12,000 contribution by the applicant to the city’s Green City Fund.

“I do not understand why this 25-storey office building is not required, under the capital amenity contribution program, is not required to pay its fair share, especially in regards to policing and fire department services,” Landale said, “which is particularly important as the building is 25 storeys high.”

South Surrey resident Ivan Scott supported the application, saying it’s the “perfect time and place” to build such an office tower.

“Office towers are very seldomly built these days with developers instead going for a residential tower,” he told council. “This shows the confidence genuine business people have in the future of Surrey.”

South Surrey resident C0lin Pronger opposed the development.

“I believe that the city should be improving Whalley as a whole rather than perpetrating its division of King George Boulevard.”

The west side, he said, is for the “well-dressed” who may never have to cross over to the east side of the boulevard.

“Developers are only building for the ‘haves’ in Surrey, so they won’t be inconvenienced when they have to visit their lawyers and financial advisors,” Pronger said.

Elizabeth Model, CEO of the Downtown Business Improvement Association, supports the project

“It’s the first commercial building in quite some time,” she noted. “It’s going to provide a huge amount of economic development, with jobs and obviously with a spin-off of all the commercial build and the businesses coming to our area.”

A street in North Delta could soon be renamed to honour the passengers of the Komagata Maru.

Raj Toor, the grandson of one of the passengers on the Komagata Maru and vice-president of the non-profit Descendants of the Komagata Maru Society, presented Delta council’s Heritage Advisory Commission with a proposal on Wednesday, July 8 to name a park, street or other civic asset in memory of the passengers of the Komagata Maru.

The society’s proposal comes almost a year after the City of Surrey renamed 75A Avenue between 120 Street and 121A Street “Komagata Maru Way” following a similar request by the society.

“It would seem appropriate to rename the Delta part of 75A Avenue from 120th Street to 114th Street ‘Komagata Maru Way’ to show that consideration of this event transcends municipal boundaries,” Toor told Delta’s Heritage Advisory Commission.

“This would be greatly appreciated, not only by descendants of the passengers and by all of the South Asian community in Canada, but by every Canadian who believes in treating all humans with dignity and respect.”

Following Toor’s presentation, the commission unanimously passed a motion endorsing the society’s request, which will be forwarded to city council, along with staff recommendations, for their consideration in the coming months.

Toor said he was pleased with the commission’s vote, noting the large South Asian population living on both sides of Scott Road/120th Street.

“The South Asian community is a very important part of Delta,” Toor told the Reporter. “The South Asian community was very important in the development of modern-day Delta, and the Komagata Maru is an important part of the South Asian community’s history and B.C.’s history and Canadian history.”

RELATED: North Delta history: South Asian settlement throughout the 20th century

Toor said the Descendants of the Komagata Maru Society worked for more than 15 years to get apologies from both provincial and federal governments, stressing the society has never asked for any compensation for the passengers’ families.

As a result of the society’s efforts, the B.C. government apologized for the incident in 2008, followed by the federal government in 2016 and, most recently, the City of Vancouver on June 10, 2020, and several memorials have been erected throughout the region.

The Komagata Maru arrived in Vancouver from Hong Kong on May 23, 1914, carrying 376 passengers, according to komagatamarujourney.ca. Most of the passengers were immigrants from the Punjab region in what was then British India.

The hundreds of passengers, according to thecanadianencyclopedia.ca, were not allowed on shore. For two months, they remained in the waters outside of Vancouver.

“A long confrontation ensued with the passengers resisting immigration department efforts to make them leave voluntarily,” reads the website. “These efforts included limiting their communications with the outside world, blocking their attempts to take their case to a Canadian court, refusing to supply the ship with food and water except when conditions became desperate; and, at one point after a continuing standoff, attempting to take control of the ship by force with a police boarding party.”

At the time, according to the thecanadianencyclopedia.ca, the Continuous Passage regulation was in effect which meant immigration officers could “block the entry of anyone who came to Canada other than by continuous journey from their home country. Another regulation, the website adds, was that immigration officers could turn back “any Asians who arrived with less than $200, a very large sum in 1914.”

The passengers were eventually forced to return to India, but upon their return, some of the passengers were shot and killed “in an encounter with British Indian police,” according to the canadianencyclopedia.ca.

The Safe Surrey Coalition majority on council – whose members campaigned on reducing permit issuing times in the city during the 2018 election – defeated a motion Monday that sought to take that a step further.

Councillor Linda Annis’s motion asked the city’s planning department to review the city’s permitting and inspection processes and then report back to council with recommendations on what can be done to improve turnaround times to make it easier for business to get up and running as quickly as possible.

“More than ever cash is tight for our businesses,” she said.

Annis, sole member of the Surrey First slate on council, noted that there are more than 17,200 small businesses operating in Surrey, with over 2,500 more starting each year. She said that many of these businesses have negotiated rental agreements that include the first few months either rent free or at reduced rent.

“But it appears that we’re taking too long to process the permits and inspections oftentimes,” she said. “This results, often, that businesses end up having to pay rent before they are actually able to open.”

Councillor Laurie Guerra dismissed Annis’s motion as “vague.”

“The Safe Surrey Coalition campaigned on reducing permit times within the city and since being elected the turnaround time has decreased from 25 weeks to 10 weeks,” Guerra said, “and that is no small feat for this city. And staff get my compliments for efficiently implementing council’s direction.”

Councillor Mandeep Nagra agreed with Guerra.

“I think staff has done a very good job on reducing those times,” he said. “I think staff is already doing a fantastic job at it.”

Councillor Jack Hundial suggested council is looking behind, not ahead.

“Coming up to two years in our term now, we can probably stop talking about how we ran on something, because let’s look at the future, not the past,” he said.

Annis said her particular motion wasn’t targeted at residential construction but rather businesses “that are trying to get up and running with very little cash up front.

“Particularly in these times I thinks we need to be working more closely with them,” she said.

Councillor Doug Elford said he thinks staff is “already in the process of working on this.”

Staff told council the city is tracking its permitting process timelines and is currently on a positive, downward trend.

Mayor Doug McCallum praised city staff for moving quickly “on all levels.

“Because our growth is so fast it’s a constant battle to keep up,” he said.

According to Delta Foundation press release, a survey conducted in April found that 80 per cent of charities in Canada were operating with decreased capacity due to the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and nearly one in five organizations had suspended or ceased their operations. The projected financial losses for registered charities in Canada is between $9.5-15.7 billion and $15.7 billion.

The federal government launched the ECSF on May 19, and the Delta Foundation is one of 177 community foundations across the country participating in the program. Through the ECSF, the foundation is providing emergency support for charities throughout Delta in partnership with Community Foundations of Canada and the Government of Canada.

“Since the start of the pandemic, charities and non-profit organizations have been leading the charge to assist those who need it most in the fight against COVID-19,” Delta Foundation president Peter Roaf said in a press release. “We know the need for funding is still significant. Delta Foundation has granted the full funding available to our community through the ECSF. There are other charities supporting vulnerable populations and we would have been glad to support them, but, unfortunately, we can’t accept any more applications.”

More than 15 charities applied for ECSF support through the Delta Foundation for various worthy causes, but, in the rapid response and rolling approval process, the following eight charities serving Delta were allocated funding:

• Big Sisters of BC Lower Mainland: $5055 for its Study Buddy program, which provides weekly no-cost tutoring and mentoring focused on school work and study skills to at-risk youth aged 7-17 from low income families.

• Deltassist Family and Community Services Society: $70,000 for the temporary North Delta Food Bank, which serves 708 people in North Delta every two weeks who, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, are experiencing homelessness, job loss, or ongoing financial struggles and no access to local food banks which have been closed temporarily.

• Little House Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Society: $10,000 for the Heart of the Youth program, which provides youth affected by substance use disorder a safe, non-judgmental online space to share their thoughts and feelings, begin to heal and develop a supportive community.

• Mamas for Mamas — Metro Vancouver: $30,000 for the Respond Like a Mother program, which helps low income mothers access the basics such as food, hygiene, housing and other essential needs.

• Options Community Services: $8,000 for the Ready to Work (R2W) program, which aims to reduce barriers to finding post-COVID employment by increasing employability among clients experiencing mental illness.

• Reach Child and Youth Development Society: $25,805 for the Virtual Autism Early Intervention Therapies program, which helps ensure that children continue to receive the support programs and services they need to reach their potential, and that families receive the tools, materials, equipment and guidance necessary to support their child’s continued development from home where in-person services are not feasible.

• Surrey-North Delta Meals on Wheels: $15,000 for the Subsidized Meals During COVID-19 Pandemic program, which helps those in the community experiencing food and financial security issues and are housebound — either due to the restrictions placed on them by the COVID-19 virus or loss of employment, are immune-compromised individuals or families, or seniors who are ordinarily not able to afford the organization’s meals.

•WINGS Fellowship Ministries: $18,000 for the COVID-19 Mental Health and Well Being Project, which provides self-help tools to support mental well-being along with a way to reduce clients’ contact with other people by providing them a grocery gift card and a way to transport their groceries.

Charities that would like to be notified if additional ECSF funding becomes available can fill out an online form here.

Charities can also explore opportunities with other ECSF funding intermediaries in the community, such as United Way Centraide Canada and Canadian Red Cross. More information about these national funders is available at canada.ca/en/services/benefits/emergency-community-support-fund.

(Aaron Hinks photo)

White Rock council this week shot down any possibility of allowing alcoholic beverages at the picnic table area in Memorial Park, citing a lack of public support for the measure, as well as potential difficulties in managing it.

At the June 1 meeting, council discussed a request from the White Rock BIA to allow liquor consumption in public places to support and enhance outdoor dining during the COVID-19 pandemic. Council had requested a corporate report identifying the waterfront park, across Marine Drive from the West Beach restaurant strip, as a potential location.

In the report, submitted to council on Monday night (July 13), staff recommended information on the measure be submitted to the COVID-19 Recovery Task Force for further input.

But council instead took the option not to proceed further with the proposal, supporting a motion from Coun. Scott Kristjanson; with Coun. Erika Johanson casting the sole opposing vote.

“I don’t think I hear from the public that we really have an appetite for this at the moment,” Kristjanson said, adding that while he would welcome hearing the task force’s views, he would likely vote against allowing liquor in the park.

Coun. Anthony Manning was among councillors who shared Kristjanson’s view that the proposal should go no further.

“We’ve seen a number of municipalities across the Lower Mainland consider this and either defeat it, or postpone it,” he said, noting that while the City of Vancouver had been initially enthusiastic, a proposal there is “still being passed around council.”

He also pointed out that while the City of North Vancouver passed a similar proposal, “they have a very different situation than we have here,” and went on to note the concerns voiced by Coun. David Chesney at the June 1 meeting.

“I, certainly, would advocate that the sensible consumption of alcohol, by adults, is fine,” Chesney had said at that time.

“But looking at the history of White Rock, it’s a party town, it’s a party destination… oh, my God, the mess we’re going to have.”

On Monday, Chesney agreed there seemed to be no significant community appetite for the move since it had been proposed.

He also pointed to White Rock RCMP input to the report which had underlined that the detachment could only favour extending liquor consumption to areas immediately adjacent to existing restaurant businesses, providing the emphasis was on liquor as an accompaniment to meals.

“Not a public drinking area, or, as the RCMP referred to it, a beer garden, which is exactly what I think this would turn into,” Chesney said.

“The picnic tables down there are being well-used, it’s a great family environment… the businesses are doing fine down there. I don’t support bringing alcohol into that mix.”

Coun. Christopher Trevelyan said he felt that while extending approval for liquor to the picnic area was a “fantastic idea” in theory, there could be no practical way of guaranteeing moderate consumption of wine or beer with meals only.

“This is a huge can of worms, very difficult to police, very difficult to enforce,” he said. “In principle I love it, but when you get to the details it’s very, very difficult to manage effectively.”

Oxley says her son sustained an allergic reaction after playing in the tall grass. (Aaron Hinks photo)

A Peninsula mother says the type of grass in a public park that backs onto her South Surrey property caused her son to go into anaphylactic shock, and the city is doing little about it.

However, city officials say staff are aware of the concern and staff are reviewing next steps.

Calla Oxley said that her son Wade was playing in Bayview Woods Park on June 28. The park is described by the city as beautiful but hidden, and is accessible from between the hedges of 13815 and 13829 33 Ave.

After approximately 15 minutes of play in the knee-high grass with his brother, Wade returned home and was showing signs of a reaction, Oxley said.

The 10-year-old told Peace Arch News Tuesday (July 14) that he had difficulty swallowing and had broken out in hives on his legs and neck.

Oxley gave her son Benadryl and rushed him to the hospital. Doctors gave Wade adrenaline and steroids.

“We were told to watch him closely for three days because there’s a phenomenon with anaphylaxis where you can relapse within two or three days,” she said.

Oxley said the doctors told her it was the tall, brown grass that caused the reaction. After her son was in a more stable condition, she called the City of Surrey to ask if someone could meet with her to discuss what could be done.

“We obviously won’t allow him to play in the park. But if it’s the tall grass and it’s mowed and not captured when it’s mowed, it’s just blowing in the wind…. we’re worried about him even being in his bedroom at night and becoming anaphylactic, because it was a severe reaction.”

Oxley said the City of Surrey sent an employee to the park the day she called. However, the woman who showed up reportedly said she was the “green grass person” and that a “brown grass person” was required.

“She said the brown grass person was on holidays,” Oxley noted.

After getting an all-clear from a doctor, the Oxleys went on a 10-day trip and returned home July 13. She said that time while they were away from the property would have been an opportunity for the city to cut and capture the grass.

“We’ve lived here for 10 years and on many occasions they’ve cut that entire park,” she said.

Tuesday, a section of the short, green grass appeared to have been cut within the last two weeks. The taller, brown grass was left untouched.

“We were told by the city that it was too expensive to cut the grass. We offered to pay for the mowing of the grass and they haven’t responded to that at all. As far as taking it out, they said it would be a long process, with community involvement, and take months and months,” Oxley said.

Oxley said the line of communication with the city has ended, and that “at this point we’re just happy to get a phone call from them.”

Monday, PAN asked to speak to somebody from the city about the family’s concern.

City manager of parks Neal Aven emailed PAN a statement on Tuesday (July 14), through the communications manager, saying that the city is taking the concern seriously and staff have spoken directly with the Oxley family.

The statement says city staff are aware the grass is the cause of the allergic reaction and that they understand that the Oxleys have taken steps to ensure their son does not come into direct contact with the grass.

“Parks staff are continuing to review potential steps, which may include more frequent moving, and will be in touch with the family this week.”

Tuesday afternoon, Oxley said she has yet to hear from the city.

Corporal Elenore Sturko said Trevor Robert McKay, 29, was brought to hospital with a gunshot wound at about noon Saturday.

“He was spoken to by investigators and, although his life is in danger, he has provided very limited information to police,” Sturko said, adding McKay has been the “repeated target of violence” including this shooting “and a previous attempted murder on January 28, 2015.

“Trevor McKay has received multiple warnings regarding his safety from police,” Sturko said. “Trevor Robert McKay is known to police and has a history of involvement with drug trafficking in the Lower Mainland. The public should be aware that they may be at risk if they interact with this individual.”

Police ask anyone with information about the shooting to contact the Surrey RCMP at 604-599-0502 or, if they wish to remain anonymous, contact Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS or go to www.solvecrime.ca.

This came before council on Monday July 13 and was approved by the five Safe Surrey Coalition members.

Councillors Steven Pettigrew, Linda Annis, Jack Hundial and Brenda Locke voted against it.

Hundial said obligating Surrey taxpayers to pay for this information “to me does not seem transparent, and at a time when transparency is key for all levels off government, including local government.

“I don’t believe we should be charging a fee for a resident to ask questions that they otherwise will not be able to obtain or really get the answers that they need for their own decision-making processes.”

Councillor Brenda Locke also voted against it.

“I think that a flat fee of $150 for an FOI request without specifying the number of pages that’s being asked for is a bit unfair,” she said. “I think transparency is already an issue, in my opinion, with this council and therefore residents are gaining insight into what we do by FOI and I think the public does deserve to know what we’re doing and so if that’s how they have to find out the information, I believe that they are entitled to that.”

Council heard that these FOI requests take anywhere from 30 minutes to eight hours to process and that the $150 fee was arrived at based on the cost of staff time, on average, to respond to these requests.

Locke asked staff if there has been an increase in the number of FOI requests over the last year and a half.

She was told the number has increased steadily over recent years and there will probably be more requests this year compared to last year.

Council was also asked to approve amendments that would “accurately reflect” city staff titles and their responsibilities.

The FOI bylaw was adopted in March 1999, under Mayor Doug McCallum’s watch. Rob Costanzo, Surrey’s general manager of corporate services, noted that many staff job titles have changed since then.

Costanzo said the city commonly receives requests for attendance records at its facilities. “These requests are typically related to personal injury claims where, for example, law firms are required to prove attendance or non-attendance of their clients at city recreational facilities,” he stated in a report.

The city had been providing these records at no cost. Costanzo said a flat fee of $150 per request will help the city recover related administrative costs and be subject to annual budgetary increases.

His new job is also a first for this province. Harding, 54, a resident of Port Moody, was chosen unanimously by city council over more than 30 other well-qualified candidates.

Besides advising council on matters of ethical conduct, he also has the authority to investigate complaints and recommend disciplinary sanctions to its members, with the city’s Code of Conduct bylaw, which was approved in April, serving as his guidebook.

“Remember, it’s mayor and council that mete out the sanctions,” Harding told the Now-Leader on Tuesday.

“I only make recommendations. I don’t have jurisdiction to impose sanctions, they do, on my recommendations. But my goal is to be very much positive and proactive, and to push the advisory and educational aspects of this office.”

Harding is a partner with Young Anderson, specializing in local government law, which he has practised for 26 years. He will continue to practice law with his firm while also wearing his new hat as an independent officer.

Mayor Doug McCallum, in a written statement city hall issued Tuesday, said Harding’s “comprehensive experience in municipal law, advising elected officials on responsible conduct, and conflict resolution and his high standing among his peers makes him the right person to fill this important role at the City of Surrey.”

Harding admitted he doesn’t yet have a “tremendous amount” of knowledge about Surrey.

“I know what I read in the papers,” he said. “I’m not invested in the details of Surrey now and I think that’s actually helpful and beneficial because I do come, I think, to Surrey with a bit of objectivity and I don’t have a lot of deep relationships or historic relationships with a lot of the people in Surrey so I come, I think, with my reputation. It gives me a sense of, I hope anyway, some objectivity coming into Surrey to help, to be of assistance.”

Speaking of relationships, news and social media reports concerning the mysterious nature of the relationship between Surrey’s mayor and Councillor Allison Patton, which neither have publicly addressed, has not been lost on Harding.

“I’m aware of those things but I don’t know what role if any I would be playing in that, I think time will tell when it comes to that stuff. Remember, I was advised only yesterday that I was appointed to this role,” he told the Now-Leader on Tuesday, “so I’m going to need some time to get familiar with things. But my aim is to get familiar pretty quickly, to get up to speed on matters. We’ll see what’s engaged by the process, the Code of Conduct bylaws there. It puts a formal process in place and we’ll see what that process, we’ll see how it’s triggered, and what it leads to, so I don’t think I can comment in any detail on that.”

READ ALSO UPDATE: Surrey council votes to hire ethics commissioner

Harding said the key, in his new role, is “education, education, and more education” with the Code of Conduct bylaw setting out the “overarching” duties of the ethics commissioner.

“It’s all about providing to elected officials the opportunity to be advised and assisted on understanding that role, understanding what their roles require of them,” Harding said. “One of the things in this particular Code of Conduct bylaw that I think is really bold by the city is offering the elected officials the opportunity to seek guidance from the ethics commissioner on conflict of interest concerns.”

His advisory role, Harding said, is to help council members “stay out of a problem before they get into a problem.”

Asked what her first question for Harding might be, Councillor Linda Annis replied, “My question is, sort of motherhood in a way, is how can he help the council in Surrey become the benchmark for local politics in our province?” Annis said.

“I think there’s a real opportunity there because our council has been quite fractious.”

Close to 100 people rallied to keep the RCMP in Surrey on Monday (July 13).

The event was staged outside city hall as Surrey council met remotely, in another virtual meeting.

“Great evening at Surrey City Hall protesting the Mayor’s vanity SPD (Surrey Police Department),” Ramona Kaptyn posted to Facebook.

“Many many Surreyites turned out supporting #keepthercmpinsurreybc,” wrote Kaptyn, president of the Surrey/White Rock chapter of CARP (Canadian Association of Retired Persons).

“Our ‘honking’ cars circled City Hall, people waved at us from the street and from their vehicles. One supporter was on a recumbent bike and several RCMP vehicles in the area sounded their sirens and gave us a thumbs-up.”

Photos of the rally were posted to social media.

(Story continues below)

On June 29, the provincial Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General announced the members of Surrey’s new police board, as part of the city’s transition from the RCMP to a municipal police department.

The board will be responsible for “setting the direction and strategic priorities” of the Surrey Police Department, to replace the Surrey RCMP.

A next step in the City of Surrey’s transition plan will be for the new board to hire a chief constable.

In 2018, Surrey city council voted unanimously to terminate their agreement with the RCMP and transition to a municipal police department.

(Aaron Hinks photo)

In the second part of this series, Peace Arch News explores why some British Columbians are reaching for substances – at a time when overdose deaths have hit record highs – in order to find temporary relief or pleasure.

From a homeless person openly shooting heroin in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside to an over-achieving radio broadcaster with a secret $15,000-per-month problem, in more cases than not, people who suffer from the illness of addiction have at least one thing in common – a history of trauma.

Langley filmmaker Brian MacDonald, 61, who by the end of the ’90s was in the throes of addiction, was consuming more than an ounce of heroin a month.

He puts it bluntly: “Trauma equals addiction. In my experience, it’s over 90 per cent of the people have sexual abuse in their stories, physical abuse, alcoholic families, so on.”

MacDonald recently revamped his award-winning documentary – A Ravaged Soul – that tells his story of addiction, and how it took him from being a successful media entrepreneur to trolling the Downtown Eastside looking for a fix.

The self-narrated documentary is a reflection of his life, where MacDonald explains the reason he reached for drugs was to cope with trauma he was once ashamed to talk about.

His first traumatic experience happened when he was three years old, MacDonald said, after his father was upset that he came to the dinner table with dirt on his clothes. His father picked him up and threw him headfirst into the bathtub, he said. Two years later, his dad left the family.

PART ONE: How COVID-19 has exacerbated the drug overdose emergency

By the time MacDonald turned 12, he had been sexually abused by an extended family member for two years. He started drinking and smoking weed not long after.

MacDonald kept his trauma to himself and raised a family, while running a successful media business and making a name for himself in the market.

After 25 years of having no contact with his dad, MacDonald looked him up and learned he was living in Seattle. Less than 24 hours after an uneventful meeting with his father, MacDonald tried heroin for the first time.

“A file got opened and exploded in my head in regards to what he did to the family, the grief he brought to it and all of that stuff,” MacDonald said, adding that meeting with his father brought the trauma to “the forefront of my consciousness.”

“Heroin is a very powerful drug. It just shuts your emotions down and shuts your physical pain down, shuts your anxiety down. I thought, honestly, for the first three months, I actually found a medication to help what was going on – the spinning in my head.”

As heroin’s ability to mask his emotional stress started to fade, he became trapped in a cycle of using and seeking, which eventually drained his bank account and led to the collapse of his professional life and personal relationships.

He wasn’t eating, he was frequently sick and fighting infections and had even tried to kill himself.

He was on the edge of death when he reached out to his mother for help. She managed to raise enough money to send him to a treatment centre in Nanaimo in the early 2000s. It would be his ninth and final attempt at rehab.

During 18 months in treatment, MacDonald said he finally addressed his trauma, released it, and forgave his abusers.

However, his resilience was tested a couple years later. MacDonald was in a car accident and required more than a dozen surgeries.

The doctor prescribed him pain killers.

Rather than become addicted once more, he was able to stop once his prescription ran out because the root cause of why he’d used drugs – his trauma – had been “modified.”

“The will to go back into it is just not there anymore. It really dissolved.”

SEE ALSO: ‘Lifeguard’ app launches as made-in-B.C. solution to help prevent overdose deaths

White Rock psychologist Jennifer Mervyn, who is a leader in the field, says every client she’s worked with who suffers from addiction shares a common thread – they’ve experienced trauma in their life.

She describes trauma as any stressful life experience, perceived or otherwise, that keeps a person’s nervous system hyper-aroused for six weeks or longer.

“Because that’s when we shift our baseline. It’s our cortisol, our adrenaline, our stress response. Once we have practised six weeks of having our heart beat faster, our blood pressure raised, stress hormones at elevated levels, they tend to not shift back down to a normal baseline,” Mervyn said.

Drugs allow people to escape that stress, she added.

“You want to run away and substances give us this chemical shortcut that allows us to get to that place really quickly,” Mervyn said.

“It’s never sustainable and it’s not long-acting, but for that short, brief moment, they can escape their body and their brain’s response to the toxic stress they’ve experienced in their life.”

Dealing with trauma face-to-face is a critical step on the pathway to recovery, she added. It gives a person the ability to change the narrative of their trauma story.

The first time MacDonald talked about his trauma was when he walked into a police station in 2001 to report his experience of being sexually assaulted.

Halfway through the police-filmed interview, RCMP officers started to emotionally break down. The police officers, both male and female, showed that they believed him and didn’t dispute his comments, he said.

The police officers validating his feelings gave him “huge strength” to be more open about his trauma.

“I ended up being this little amoeba when I walked into the police station and I left 10 feet tall. It really psychologically switched, big time in my head, the shame factor.

“I’ll never forget that.”

The City of Delta has launched a new online community engagement platform where residents can share feedback and stay up to date on projects and initiatives that are happening in their community.

The new “Let’s Talk Delta” platform offers Deltans the opportunity to participate in online forums where they can provide opinions, ask questions and share concerns on a variety of projects, from budget consultation to community and social planning, neighbourhood road improvements and more.

The website offers a variety of feedback methods including surveys, polls, discussion forums and question-and-answer boards, giving residents an additional way to interactively engage with the City of Delta.

Community feedback gathered through letstalk.delta.ca will be used to inform clear and effective recommendations to Delta city council, in conjunction with pre-existing community engagement methods.

“We are constantly working to improve public consultation and government transparency in Delta. The COVID-19 pandemic has limited our ability to conduct consultation in person, but Let’s Talk Delta gives the community another opportunity to safely engage with the city and provide input on important issues,” city manager Sean McGill said in a press release.

‘We want people throughout Delta to feel comfortable and safe as we work together to build a healthy, diverse and innovative city — Let’s Talk Delta will help accomplish that goal.”

(Nick Greenizan photo)

A group of White Rock residents are concerned a proposed multi-family residential project will change the character of their neighbourhood, block views of the ocean and, in turn, lower property values.

A four-storey, multi-family building is proposed to be built at 1164 Elm St. – at the corner of Elm and Beachview Avenue – which is currently the site of a smaller, five-dwelling residential building.

Dubbing the project ‘A Nightmare on Elm Street,’ the neighbourhood group has been writing emails to city council members while also distributing a one-page flyer to residents who live on Elm, which connects to Marine Drive at the south end and Beachview at the north. Beachview has dead-ends on both its east and west sides, forming a T when connecting with Elm.

“Stop proposed rezoning, density and building height,” the flyer reads.

An application for the project was submitted to the city by Beech Westgard Developments Inc. in May and it is still in its early stages. There is no public information meeting yet planned; the city’s website lists a date as ‘TBD.’

In an email to Peace Arch News, City of White Rock communications manager Donna Kell said that, according to the city’s planning and development services department, the application “has been circulated to other City departments and the School District for comments.”

Anita Nielsen, who lives on Beachview right at the north end of Elm Street, told PAN that neighbourhood residents aren’t anti-development – both Nielsen and another neighbour said they realize some type of project will be built – but they want to see fewer storeys and units.

“There has to be a compromise somewhere,” Nielsen said last week, standing on the southeast corner of Elm and Beachview, just a few dozen feet from the development sign.

“And either end here, it’s a dead-end, so there’s nowhere for cars, for traffic to go, and it’s already a pretty busy area.”

The proposed building, if built as currently designed, would block partial ocean views for a number of Nielsen’s neighbours immediately to the east of her decades-old home, which she told PAN is one of the street’s original residences.

“With (21 units) on this tiny corner… it’s not only going to completely transform the area, it’s going to block views for so many different houses,” said Nielsen, who said she has lived on Beachview for 19 months and grew up on the Semiahmoo Peninsula.

“I think what will happen is, if this goes through, people will end up selling and then this will become a very condo-dense area instead of one of White Rock’s oldest (single-family home) areas, and it’s such a lovely little neighbourhood.

“It just feels like the start of the end of the neighbourhood.”

Nielsen is also concerned that proposed rezoning for Marine Drive – which was the subject of a digital public information meeting last Wednesday (July 8) – could affect what happens on Elm Street, which according to a map published by the City of White Rock, is part of the ‘waterfront village’ that is currently part of the city’s official community plan review.

Currently, just south of 1164 Elm St. are three older cottages and one newer home.

The newer home is currently listed for sale at $1, 529,000, while the older cottage next door is also for sale, for $1,299,000.

According to the city, following a digital public information meeting – if one is held – the applicant would then consider incorporating changes “suggested at the meeting or recommended by staff” before proceeding to the Advisory Design Panel for consideration.

In the meantime, in addition to emailing city councillors with concerns, Nielsen said she plans to invite them to the neighbourhood “so they can see what we’re concerned about.”

Here’s your update on the pandemic in Surrey, White Rock and beyond for Monday, July 13:

• With an estimated 7,000 people planting trees across Canada, the federal government has committed up to $30 million in emergency funding to help contractors cover the extra costs of COVID-19 protection.

• The Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy will be extended until December as the country’s economy recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic, Prime Minister Trudeau announced Monday (July 13).

• As hockey fans gear up for a truncated season to begin next month, some in Canada’s two “hub cities” say the temptation to celebrate – and flout physical-distancing guidelines – may prove too great.

• Indigenous bands along the west coast of British Columbia say their borders will remain closed to tourists and non-residents, despite the economic impact, as they work to raise awareness about the threat COVID-19 poses to their communities.

• A class-action lawsuit has been filed against Cargill Ltd. that claims the meat-packing company failed to take reasonable precautions to protect its workers in Alberta during the COVID-19 pandemic.

• B.C. islanders are feeling trapped and calling for action on a COVID-19 measure that allows residents to board ferries first as the summer tourist season heats up.

• For the last four months, Canada’s public health experts have been racing to stop the spread of COVID-19 by trying to figure out how everyone is getting it, and whom they may have given it to. Now, medical researchers and supercomputers are turning genetics labs into virus-detective agencies.

• As top doctor Dr. Bonnie Henry receives international attention for her efforts to fare the spread of COVID-19 among British Columbians, the provincial health officer is preparing for the likelihood of a second wave of the novel coronavirus in the fall.

Surrey city council will consider a staff recommendation to amend the Freedom of Information bylaw to approve a new $150 fee for processing “routine requests” for attendance records at Surrey’s facilities.

This is expected to come before council during tonight’s council meeting, on Monday July 13.

Council is also asked to approve amendments that would “accurately reflect” city staff titles and their responsibilities.

The FOI bylaw was adopted in March 1999, under Mayor Doug McCallum’s watch. Rob Costanzo, Surrey’s general manager of corporate services, noted that many staff job titles have changed since then.

Costanzo said the city commonly receives requests for attendance records at its facilities. “These requests are typically related to personal injury claims where, for example, law firms are required to prove attendance or non-attendance of their clients at city recreational facilities,” he stated in a report.

The city has been providing these records at no cost. Costanzo said a flat fee of $150 per request would help the city recover related administrative costs and be subject to annual budgetary increases.

Councillor Linda Annis said the three sheets of ice will open in a phased approach as part of Surrey’s COVID-19 Restart Plan.

Annis said two rinks at Surrey Sport & Leisure Complex will reopen on Aug. 17, followed by the third there on Sept. 1. If all goes according to plan, she said two additional sheets of ice will reopen at North Surrey Sport & Ice Complex on Sept. 14.

In a typical season, local hockey associations need ice starting in mid-August, for rep tryouts and camps.

“There are more than 4,000 Surrey kids who are looking forward to hitting the ice this season,” Annis says. “Now they and their families are being forced to look at buying ice times in other cities. It’s absolutely ridiculous to think that Surrey families have to look outside their own city when we have great facilities right here at home.”

She says the reopening of Surrey’s rec centres is being delayed in order to save money to pay for the city’s new police force, but that narrative is dismissed by Councillor Laurie Guerra, chair of the Parks, Recreation and Culture Committee.

“It is unfortunate that there has been misinformation circulated about the closures of our recreational facilities,” Guerra said in a city-issued news release on Friday (July 10).

“Our recreational facilities were closed on March 15 due to COVID-19 and not from budgetary pressures. Since June 1, we have re-opened to the public a number of outdoor facilities and programs. We are continuing to develop plans for the opening of additional facilities in the coming weeks and are working closely with our sports community on safety plans that will prepare them to return to sport when the facilities re-open.”

• RELATED STORY: Surrey-area associations gear up for hockey restart.

Guerra says the reopening of Surrey’s parks, rec and culture facilities will depend on four criteria, including the ability to comply with new Provincial Health Order, reasonable public demand for services, financial viability, and public and employee safety measures in place.

Several private rinks are already open across Metro Vancouver, Annis notes.

“Where there’s a will there’s a way, but right now there’s no will in the mayor’s office in Surrey,” Annis says in a news release Monday (July 13). “Reopening these important public facilities in Surrey should be our priority after so many months in the grip of Covid-19. Instead, we’re telling Surrey families to look elsewhere for ice time while our city’s rinks sit empty.”

The city’s public playgrounds reopened on June 1, followed by outdoor pools June 27 and outdoor fitness classes on July 16.

(Facebook photo)

You may think that you’ve never seen Ron Hupper, but if you‘ve lived in Chilliwack and you’ve ever driven along Keith Wilson Road, you almost certainly have.

Do you remember a guy sitting in a motorized wheelchair at the end of a driveway, waving at you as you drove by? Do you remember asking yourself, ‘Who is that guy?’

That was Ron, a local celebrity of sorts who epitomized the saying, ‘When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.’

Nearly nine years ago, he suffered a bad stroke that left the right side of his body completely paralyzed. Beforehand, he was an active guy who owned his own business and traveled the world with his wife.

Having all of that taken away would leave most of us wallowing in self pity, but not the man that Taylor Roseboom called ‘Papa.’

“When he got home after months of physical therapy in Vancouver and Coquitlam, it was really hard for him because he used to be the man of house,” said Taylor, Ron’s 20-year-old granddaughter. “My Grandma started bringing him outside when she was gardening, and while he was out there, occasionally a family member would drive by an honk.

“So he ended up going to the end of the driveway to sit, and that’s where it started.”

The stroke left Ron mostly non-verbal. He could say a few words, like yes and no and good.

“And a few choice curse words,” Taylor added with a laugh.

But the stroke didn’t take away his smile, and that’s what drew people in. They’d drive by and there he’d be, relaxing in his wheelchair, grinning and waving.

People started honking, which encouraged him to wave even more.

“It became this thing where he wanted to go out there every day, because it gave him something to smile about,” Taylor said. “He grabbed his newspaper first thing in the morning and then he’d come inside to eat breakfast, but some days he’d be out there before he even had breakfast and my Grandma would have to call out, ‘Honey! You haven’t had your toast yet!

“If there was snow outside and his wheelchair couldn’t make it, or it was super rainy, he would be so frustrated. But even when he was stuck inside, he could still hear people honking their horns. I’d be like, ‘Oh Papa. There’s your fans honking for you.”

Soon enough, some of the more curious among the passers-by started pulling over to introduce themselves. People brought him cookies and brownies, and one kind-hearted soul brought him a blanket to keep him warm on chillier days.

“People started saying to me, ‘Hey, have you ever seen that guy over on Keith Wilson?’ and I’d say, ‘He’s my grandpa!’” Taylor said.

Ron’s health started deteriorating in March of this year, with a series of strokes and seizures landing him in the hospital for several months. Around four weeks ago he was moved to a care home, and doctors discovered two untreatable brain bleeds.

“It was hard with COVID because we weren’t allowed to visit him,” Taylor said. “It was hard for him because he didn’t have his Keith Wilson Road anymore, and I didn’t realize so many people truly enjoyed seeing him until he wasn’t there anymore. The day he died, I heard eight cars honk out there and I thought, ‘Oh my. He’s not even here anymore and people are still honking for him.”

Taylor posted the news to Facebook Saturday and was shocked by the response. Two hundred and six heartfelt comments (as of Sunday afternoon) from people whose lives Ron touched, every one of them read and appreciated by Taylor.

“My Papa was a really tough man. What he went through was so hard and it was so hard watching him go through it,” she said. “The biggest thing I learned from him is that I’m never going to treat life like it’s short or dwell on things, ever, because he adjusted and overcame something horrible and he was still our Papa.

“I will always push through and persevere, just like he did.”

For one local charity, a row of clothing donation bins in Surrey helps form a financial lifeline during the COVID-19 pandemic.

BC Children’s Hospital programs benefit from the sale of items collected in orange-coloured donation bins now located at Surrey Transfer Station (9770 192nd St.), via the hospital auxiliary.

Erin Rylek, the organization’s co-ordinator of volunteer resources, said the clothing donation bin program is the auxiliary’s only source of income not greatly affected by the pandemic.

The auxiliary was forced to close its thrift and gift shops, and cancel a campus vendor program and silent auction.

“We partner with Salvation Army for this (donation bin) initiative,” Rylek told the Now-Leader, “so the clothing being donated to the bins is recycled back into the Surrey community and is also given to local shelters, which have seen an increase of need during the pandemic.

“The Auxiliary is also a non-profit charity so community support is vital to our success in funding programs at BC Children’s Hospital,” she added. “We are so pleased to work with Emterra at Surrey Transfer Station.”

Only clothing, footwear and accessories can be dropped into the bins. The collected goods are later resold at Salvation Army thrift stores.

The funds benefit a variety of BC Children’s Hospital programs, including a Fun Cart for young hospital patients, music therapy, “Coffee Nights” for families and parents, and a Therapeutic Clown.

In March 2020, the Auxiliary to BCCH supported a funding request of $60,000 to the Heart Centre, which had an urgent need for two TEE probes, used to assess the condition of a child’s heart — how large the heart is, how well it contracts, and how the valves function, Rylek noted.

“The long flexible instrument has an ultrasound transducer at the tip and is passed through a child’s mouth towards the throat to get as close to the heart as possible. It can be moved up, down and sideways to look at different parts of a child’s heart from different angles to get the best possible view. TEE probes are used in all 200-plus open-heart surgeries performed every year. They help surgeons save lives.”

In a July 10 press release, the Fraser Valley Heritage Railway Society (FVHRS) announced they will remain closed for the next month and a half.

“The board has decided not to open to the public during July and August this year, due to the uncertainty surrounding the increased activity under level 3 of the RestartBC protocols,” wrote FVHRS board chair John Sprung. He noted many of the society’s volunteers fall into the highest risk category for COVID-19.

Sprung said they’ll reassess their options in mid-August and decide then whether they’ll open up Cloverdale Station in September.

“Our priority throughout this challenging time is to provide a safe environment for our volunteers and the public,” Sprung said. “The Fraser Valley Heritage Rail Society will continue to provide a rich and entertaining heritage experience and plan for the future as part of B.C.’s railway heritage.”

Sprung explained the FVHRS will continue internal functions during the summer, such as continuing restoration work on BCER 1231 and on the Clayburn mine carts and locomotive. They will also keep up on rolling stock maintenance and upgrading the building and grounds. Previously scheduled operator training will also continue.

Sprung added the FVHRS will celebrate its 20th anniversary in 2021.

“We look forward to welcoming you back to continue with us on the heritage railway journey through time.”

Calling it a milestone for the heritage railway society, Sprung said celebratory events are being planned for weekends throughout the 2021 season.

“Much has been accomplished since 2001 when we started. There is a great deal more to look forward to as we move forward and complete the vision.”

(submitted photo)

A Surrey mother’s story about adopting her two children in India is told in a new book.

First-time author Raj Arneja has self-published a memoir called “Love at First Sight: A Mother’s Journey to Adoption.”

She began writing it about two years ago, after years of telling the story to family members.

“My kids, they’d heard the story before, and they were the ones who kind of prompted me to tell the story to others, to get the book done,” Arneja said.

Now adults, Kabir and Kirti are the children of Arneja and her husband, Gurpreet, who live in the Ocean Park area.

The family operates Surrey-based Nanak Foods, and in 2016 Arneja helped open SEVA Thrift Store on Scott Road as a charitable enterprise.

The 230-page book, available on Amazon.com, chronicles the author’s 7,000-kilometre trip from Canada to India to adopt Kabir and Kirti in the 1990s.

It’s not a how-to book about adoption, it is a celebration of motherhood through adoption.

Arneja says she hopes to inspire other couples to adopt.

“The book goes into my history, because I’m born and raised here,” Arneja said. “So going to India, for me, was going to a foreign country, dealing with the bureaucracy there, looking for a child, going from hospital to hospital, all those things.

“While I was there I began to understand where my parents came from, their journey of coming from India to a new country here in Canada with no family,” she continued. “I had those same feelings in India, because the first time I went, I went without my husband because he couldn’t go at the time. This was in 1992, and there was no internet, no cellphones, it was just talking on the phone during calls that cost a lot of money. My husband didn’t even see his son until I came to Canada with him, so the book tells the story about all those experiences.”

Raised in New Westminster, Arneja opens the book with the story of her flight to Japan in 1980, at the age of 16. Scaling Mount Fuji was a life-changing moment for Arneja, who in life has been motivated by the phrase “Never give up.”

Years later, at age 24, her life looked complete.

“I loved my career, working in an office in downtown Vancouver overlooking the harbor,” Arneja writes. “I loved life with my husband, Gurpreet, to whom I had been married for two years already. We had bought a house; we had our loving families and a close group of friends nearby. We enjoyed our ability to freely travel and did so every chance we could. We took a remarkable trip to India together, where we traveled to destinations that were off the beaten path, from north to south and everywhere in between. I was ready for the next chapter of my life. I wanted to become a mom.”

While it seemed like every couple around them was able to conceive easily, for some reason Raj and Gurpreet could not.

As an alternative, they turned to adoption.

“I just wanted people to know about these experiences, to have others do what we did if they can’t conceive, because it is a good alternative,” the author says.

“It’s something new for me, and I feel like I’m exposing myself quite a bit out there, but I think it’s an important story to tell and for people to hear, especially for a young couple looking to adopt,” Arneja continued. “Sometimes people are told no, you shouldn’t, and that happens in South Asian community more often, that the family doesn’t want to adopt outside of bloodlines, but that’s one of the reasons I pushed to get this done, because it can be done. I hope I inspire other couples to do this.”

Elgin Park Secondary and UBC grad Rajiv Dhaliwal, 25, secured a permit to hike the Pacific Crest Trail last May, which starts in B.C. and travels south to California. With the coronavirus putting those plans on hiatus, Dhaliwal made the spontaneous decision three weeks ago that he would instead mountain bike 12,000 kilometres from Crescent Beach to Newfoundland.

He plans to dip his rear tire in Crescent Beach Wednesday (July 15), signalling the start of his trip, which he expects to take three months.

“My bike came in the mail literally two days ago. And my plan was to leave as soon as my bike came in the mail. So I just quit my job and I’m planning to leave Wednesday,” he said.

SEE ALSO: B.C. man cycling across Canada

Salsa Cycles agreed to supply him with a bike and Bikepacking.com agreed to support him with an adventure grant. Dhaliwal said he planned the trip at the last minute, and it’s only possible with the help of the two companies.

“I reached out to these companies on a whim. I wasn’t really expecting them to actually get behind me. As soon as they said they were on board, I said I’m going to do it. It was pretty last-minute. I’m literally just running back and forth the last couple of days trying to get gear.”

The trip marks his second long-distance bike journey. Last year, he bought a $250 bike and rode it from Banff to New Mexico.

Dhaliwal says he’ll take the Great Trail, formally known as the Trans Canada Trail. He says the trail is made of dirt and gravel, but there are sections that are linked to the highway.

“I’m going to try and use Google Earth and figure out detour routes because my goal is I don’t want to ride anywhere on the highway,” he said.

He’ll pack all of his supplies on his bike and try to camp in the backcountry for as many days as possible, he added.

Dhaliwal plans to use his Instagram account to document the trip, which can be found here, and plans to write articles about his experience.",[]

A pair of new arrivals at the White Rock RCMP detachment this month won’t put more ‘boots on the ground’ in the seaside city – but the speckled siblings have certainly added an appreciated lightness to the job, says the city’s top cop.

Staff Sgt. Kale Pauls said the journey that ultimately led to a rescue operation on Thursday (July 9), began June 26 with the discovery of three seagull eggs on the detachment’s Pacific Avenue rooftop.

The find was made during maintenance efforts, Pauls told Peace Arch News Friday (July 10).

Just under a week later, the eggs started to hatch, and on July 8, “two fuzzy hatchlings were observed running around the roof.”

It’s unclear what became of the third egg, Pauls said, surmising it may not have survived.

July 9, a little drama unfolded after one of the two hatchlings somehow made it off the roof. It was found on the ground, seemingly unsure what to do with itself, after an officer noticed a parent seagull “squawking quite loud” from the rooftop, Pauls said.

“The parent bird was communicating with the hatchling, but would not go to the ground to help it,” he continued.

Animal control was contacted, and bird-rescue society officials advised that the hatchling should be returned to the roof by capturing it in a box, he said.

“The parent bird did not oppose the capture of the hatchling, possibly realizing that it was helpful. The hatchling was convinced to come into the box and was reunited with their sibling on the roof, which has an elevated ledge that acts as a fenced in playground.”

Pauls said the detachment roof “appears to be the safest place in the city for the hatchlings to avoid being prey.”

And while the adventure won’t be showing up in any police files, Pauls said it has been a nice journey to witness.

“I think the best part is that you rarely see a gull hatchling, so actually seeing these fuzzy creatures experiencing their first look a life is a nice addition to the daily operations at a detachment,” he said.

A “contactless” donation drive is happening in Surrey today.

Organized by the COVID-19 Women’s Initiative, the group is accepting donations for Lower Mainland women’s shelters and transition homes.

The Surrey drive, located at Platinum Pro-Claim Restoration (18651 52nd Ave.), runs from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.

There will also be donation drives in Vancouver (1580-505 Burrard St.) and Richmond (13880 Mayfield Pl.) during the same time.

People can also donate to their GoFundMe at tinyurl.com/ydhs9mbs.

Donations needed include toiletries, food, toys, art supplies, clothing, household items, gift cards and personal protective equipment.

Donations from Friday’s Lower Mainland drives will benefit Turning Point Recovery, Covenant House, Harmony House, Talitha Koumb Society, YWCA Vancouver, Chrysalis Society, Atira Women’s Resource Centre, Vancouver Rape Relief & Women’s Shelter, WISH Drop-In Centre and Society.

COVID-19 Women’s Initiative is a non-profit, student-led organization of medical students, physicians and community members across Canada, including Vancouver, Toronto, Ottawa and London.

According to the organization, it was started by two medical students “who recognized a need to help women are in challenging circumstances, further heightened by COVID-19.”

“There has been an increase in violent events during the COVID-19 pandemic,” the website reads. “Transition houses and anti-violence organizations have struggled during this time not only because of the increased need, but also a decrease in available resources.

“The CWI was formed to help support these organizations so that they could adequately help women and those experiencing violence. The items donated through this event will be distributed among the following organizations based on their expressed needs.”

A Bollywood-inspired class is just one of the dance fitness and yoga offerings raising funds and awareness for a local animal sanctuary.

North Delta’s Sweet Serenity Yoga and Wellness is partnering with Perfect Pastures Animal Sanctuary in Ladner for a bi-weekly outdoor fundraising event beginning this week.

Set on Perfect Pastures’ field, “Fridays at the Farm” is a four-class series that benefits the animal sanctuary while safely continuing group classes during the current COVID-19 restrictions. The outdoor program permits the Sweet Serenity community to stay active and connected while practicing in an open space.

“We’re offering two class style options: the ‘Fitness Mash-up’ — with Zumba, BollyX and Refit — and a yoga series featuring Hatha and Slow Flow. The variety makes it extra engaging and fun, and gives each instructor their time to shine,” explained Sweet Serenity owner Jenine Lehfeldt.

“Maggie [Ferguson] from Perfect Pastures is the kindest, most hard-working person I’ve ever met. She puts the animals before even her own well-being. I’m passionate about animals, too, and feel fortunate I’m able to help.”

Lehfeldt’s North Delta studio has hosted many local fundraising initiatives, including cat and bunny yoga benefiting the Delta Community Animal Shelter.

Sweet Serenity recently helped Perfect Pastures raise over $1,200 for Amaro, a rescue dog who needed medical attention for pneumonia and an enlarged heart.

Fridays at the Farm was conceived as a means to continue to support the sanctuary, which is a haven for farm animals like goats, sheep and pot-bellied pigs, as well as a temporary home for pets needing immediate refuge before moving to organizations that deal with foster care and adoption.

“Things are getting more difficult for animal rescue care, especially since COVID-19 has increased poverty in communities already in need,” Maggie Ferguson from Perfect Pastures said.

Ferguson has been based out of her Ladner farm, located at 9939 Ladner Trunk Rd., for 10 of the last 40 years she’s been helping rescue animals. For the past nine, she has also facilitated a food program aiding animals in northern B.C. communities. This year alone, she has collected and shipped 7,900 pounds of food to rescues, food banks and community support workers who in turn distribute the goods where they’re desperately needed.

“I realized northern communities weren’t getting the food support they needed, so I started collecting animal food and packaging it in bulk,” Ferguson said. “I approached Lower Mainland transport companies who go to remote areas about getting what I collect to the rescues – and the rest is history.”

This year, Ferguson’s trusted delivery truck finally reached the end of its life after 350,000 kilometres on the road. In order to continue its mission, Perfect Pastures has started a GoFundMe (gofundme.com/f/animal-rescue-food-fund) with a goal of $35,000 to purchase a replacement flat-deck truck.

Lehfeldt, meanwhile, has had to get creative since the pandemic hit, pivoting to online classes while her studio had to remain closed. On June 15, Sweet Serenity reopened the doors at 8330 112th St., but the new safety precautions needed to keep clients safe have dropped the studio’s capacity by 75 per cent.

“It’s been one of the hardest things any small business owner could have ever imagined facing, but through sheer determination and the support of our community, we have managed to stay afloat,” Lehfeldt said. “We aren’t out of the woods yet, as we don’t qualify for the majority of government assistance, however we’re determined to continue being the safe space our all-ages community needs for physical and mental health.

Fridays at the Farm kicks off this Friday, July 10 (Refit with Shilo and Zumba toning with Gabriella) and follows with classes July 24 (BollyX with Kat and Rev+Flow with Shilo), Aug. 7 (Refit with Shilo and Zumba Toning with Gabriella) and Aug. 21 (Zumba with Nadi and Rev+Flow with Shilo), weather-permitting. A Zoom link will be provided in case of rain.

Participants may attend one or all classes, and are asked to pre-register online (clients.mindbodyonline.com/asp/main_enroll.asp?fl=true&tabID=8), with a minimum donation of $44 for either four-class series.

A South Surrey senior who served in the Korean War nearly 70 years ago was thanked this week for his efforts “in restoring and preserving our freedom and democracy.”

Retired Col. Donald McClellan on Wednesday (July 8) was presented with an Ambassador for Peace Medal during a ceremony at Amica White Rock, where he has lived since last September.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, attendees were masked for the event.

Attended by Sen. Yonah Martin – who is Grand Patron of the Korea Veterans Association of Canada Heritage Unit – as well as Deputy Consul Gen. Yongwook Na (representing the Korean government), Korean War Veterans Association Western Chapter president Woo Seok Lee and McClellan’s daughter Linda, the ceremony was part of a three-year campaign that launched last month to honour the service and sacrifices of Canadians in the Korean War.

This year is the start of the 70th anniversary of the Korean War years, a news release explains. The Korean War Forgotten No More campaign will commemorate various milestones of the war, concluding July 27, 2023 – the 70th anniversary of the signing of the armistice.

The Ambassador for Peace Medal is “an expression of appreciation from the Korean government to veterans who served in the Korean War from June 25, 1950 to July 27, 1953,” the release states. It is also awarded to veterans who participated in UN peacekeeping operations until the end of 1955.

McClellan served in Korea from 1951-52 as a member of the 57th Independent Field Squadron, Royal Canadian Engineers. He was 23 years old at the time.

“We were the first brigade there,” he told Peace Arch News Thursday (July 9).

“We started planning it in 1950, as soon as the North Koreans crossed the line. The first job we had… was to guard the Han River bridge east of Seoul.

“I won’t tell you stories about that,” he continued, adding, “we didn’t have to fight it, but we shot somebody in the wrong place.

“It was a marine unit going along a north bank in the dark, and our sentry challenged and no answer… so he took a pot shot at them and he hit the fellow sitting up right of the driver and it went off his back into the driver, so he got two people with one bullet.

“We didn’t kill anybody, but it stopped them.”

McClellan said he is proud of the role Canadians played in the conflict – the first brigade group alone was 7,500 troops; in all, more than 26,000 served over the three years, and 516 died.

“I lost a couple of men who were not my friend because they were officers, and men don’t make friendships a rule,” McClellan said.

“I wear a pin every day for one of those men. It’s on my sweater, it’s a little poppy. I don’t know his first name, but his last name was Davis and he was 19 years old.”

McClellan’s 32 years of military service also included time in northern Europe after the war – for NATO in Germany and Belgium – and as a liaison officer to the U.S. army research and development laboratories in Virginia.

Martin on Wednesday spoke of how she and all people of Korean descent in Canada owe their lives to McClellan and other Korean veterans.

A proclamation presented with his medal expresses “everlasting gratitude of the Republic of Korea and our people for the service you and your countrymen have performed.”

“We cherish in our hearts the memory of your boundless sacrifices in helping us reestablish our Free Nation.”

Tavisha Kochhar, a Grade 9 student at Sullivan Heights Secondary, has made hundreds of cloth masks in recent months, selling them to raise funds for Lower Mainland hospitals and vaccine research.

Tavisha, according to the Surrey school district, started sewing the masks about two months. She sells them through her website, tavishahelpinghands.com, and then ships the masks throughout Canada and the U.S.

So far, she has made roughly 600 masks, raising $2,700 for Surrey Memorial Hospital, BC Children’s Hospital, St. Paul’s Hospital and Vancouver General Hospital.

“I’ve always been fundraising,” said Tavisha, 14. “I kept on donating, making things, selling what I made and I would use the funds collected to donate to different charities and organizations.

With the pandemic, Tavisha said she decided to make affordable masks because she saw online “that many people were selling masks for unreasonable prices and it was just so unfair to the people who don’t have jobs anymore and lost family members.”

Tavisha took a textiles course in Grade 8, learning how to sew.

In 2017, she started Tavisha’s Helping Hands to help people suffering from the B.C. wildfires. According to her website, she raised $850 by selling artwork, making pencil holders, key chains, paper weights and magnets using recycled materials.

“The environment is a really big issue,” she said. “If we’re able to make reusable masks that you could wash and keep clean for longer, it’s just so much better for the environment.”

Through her website, people can buy masks off all different designs, ranging in price from $5 to $7, plus shipping.

Over the years, she has donated $5,000 to several charities.

36,surreynowleader,https://www.surreynowleader.com/community/south-surrey-crash-victim-honoured-by-kpu-for-determination-and-strength/,South Surrey crash victim honoured by KPU for ‘determination and strength’ – Surrey Now-Leader,['Nick Greenizan'],2020-07-08 12:30:00-07:00,"A South Surrey woman who overcame long odds – and spent three months in a coma after being involved in a horrific car crash – has been named the latest recipient of Kwantlen Polytechnic University’s Honorary Alumna Award.

In 2007, a then-18-year-old Harriet Ronaghan, recently graduated from Elgin Park Secondary, was preparing to start classes at KPU when she, along with her mom and brother, were in their car when it was hit by a dump truck.

The crash left Ronaghan with a traumatic brain injury and required emergency surgery which came with just a five per cent chance of survival.

The recovery was a gruelling process, she noted.

“I had to relearn everything – to stand up, walking, talking.”

After 10 months spent in hospital relearning basic motor skills, she was sent home in a wheelchair, although she only ever used it three times.

Ronaghan wrote a book about her recovery experience, You Are My Sunshine: The Journey Through My Recovery of a Traumatic Brain Injury, which was a logical extension of the notes she was already taking as she documented her thoughts and feelings as a way to help process all that she had gone through.

She was inspired to write the book after a return visit to Royal Columbian Hospital, where she met the father of a teenager who had been in a motorcycle accident and, like Ronaghan had been, was in a coma.

“The way he thanked me and called his wife right away and told her about me – that was the moment I decided I needed to write a book. The accident was awful, but my story can help people,” she said in a KPU news release.

“Harriet is the epitome of the word Kwantlen, which means ‘tireless runner’,” said Dr. Alan Davis, president and vice-chancellor of KPU.

“She has shown that despite the adversities she’s had to face and overcome, her determination and strength has prevailed. We are proud that the KPU Alumni Association has named her an Honorary Alumna.”

Ronaghan has now recovered, but her journey is not yet over. She has a different walking gait than she once did, and her speech is slower. As well, she becomes fatigued easily.

“At the beginning, I thought I was going back to school to pursue my writing, but I realized after years of recovery and therapies that I can’t do that,” she said.

“My fatigue is too severe and that’s something I’ve had to come to terms with.”

Ronaghan, who is married and has one son – with another child on the way – has been sharing her story with others at rehabilitation centres, and in 2019 she was the recipient of the Coast Mental Health Courage to Come Back Award.

“We are so proud to confer Harriet with an Honorary Alumni award and by so doing welcome her into our KPU alumni family. Her story of strength and tenacity in the face of great adversity is certainly an inspiration to students, alumni and the whole KPU community,” said David Dryden, chair of the KPU Alumni Association.

A new book penned by a local history group explores North Delta’s past, tracing the community’s roots from the site of Indigenous fishing camps, through early settlement by European (and other) pioneers and into modern times.

The recently released North Delta History and Heritage is a labour of love researched and written by a dozen members of the Delta Heritage Society’s North Delta Advisory Group. The 190-page book offers a first-of-its-kind look at the history of the various communities that now comprise North Delta, including numerous photographs — many seldom seen before — and both single-page and pull-out maps to help readers put the past into context today.

Local historian John Macdonald, who edited the book and contributed to its writing, said readers might be surprised to learn how far back the history of the area goes.

“[When] most people think of the history of North Delta they think … it started with Annieville, and it did in a way, but it started long, long before the Norwegians got there, and of course the First Nations people have been here for thousands of years,” said Macdonald, who has written several articles about local history and authored the book Kennedy’s Trail: Past to Present.

“There’s never been a book like this on North Delta, and because of the history of Delta a lot of things tend to be Ladner-centric. That’s why I think it’s been so well received.”

The book’s initial printing of 200 copies in May sold out in just 10 days, and fewer than 75 copies remain of the book’s 300-copy second printing in mid-June. A third printing of 300 copies will be coming soon.

“We’ve had people take one, get as far as their car and come back and get another one. So I’ve started saying to people, ‘Are you sure you don’t want more than one?’” Macdonald said.

The book features several maps and aerial photographs to help readers orient themselves with the North Delta that was, and navigate the past in the here-and-now.

“There’s so much you can miss. My wife and I have driven all over Delta exploring places, but some places you just don’t notice.”

For example, people may not realize the reason 112th Street takes a turn at 90th Avenue is because the land in the area was pre-empted by early settler James Kennedy before the government survey in 1873 that laid the groundwork for the orderly grid of streets seen elsewhere in North Delta and Surrey.

“In 1861, the provincial government allowed people to go out and pre-empt land, which means driving a stake in the ground — or four stakes in the ground — and that’s what happened in Annieville. That’s what James Kennedy did and others along there, all the way from 96th [Avenue] all the way to Burns Bog.”

“The back of Kennedy’s lot became 114th [Street] at an angle, and the same with a little piece of 90th [Avenue] that jogs down to River Road there. That was the edge of Kennedy’s property, and that was where Kennedy’s Trail came up.”

Copies of North Delta History and Heritage are available for $20 (tax included) by contacting John Macdonald at johnmac609@gmail.com.

“Welcome home.”

These are the first words anyone who attends a Rainbow Family of Living Light annual gathering will hear. It is both a greeting, and an affirmation that you found the right place and made it safely.

At a rest area near a remote north Vancouver Island river, colourful ribbons tied to branches of trees mark the way to the encampment, until you see several vehicles (some registered from out-of-province) parked alongside the trail.

Dread-locked hair, colourful attires, and smiling faces greet you along with the ‘welcome home’ chant at the entrance. Nobody asks who you are, or where you are coming from. Everyone here has come to escape ‘Babylon’ — a Rainbow term to describe the evils of modern life, such as technology and capitalism.

Members of the Rainbow Family of Living Light movement say they want to propagate a general ideology of acceptance and non-judgment. A deep sense of community and respect for individuals is fostered on these shared values.

“You can be comfortable being whoever you are and believing in whatever you want to,” said a man at the gathering who called himself Coco.

Another attendee, a young woman from Montreal, had flown in on Friday to be a part of the ‘celebration,’ her third. Several others are also returning attendees, some of whom have travelled around the globe to attend ‘world-gatherings’ of Rainbow Family. The gatherings are free and open to anyone as long as they have a “belly button,” said another attendee.

Rainbow Family — which originated in the U.S. sometime in the 1960s as a nondenominational, non-political counterculture group — has held annual gatherings all over the world since 1972. These gatherings attract a loosely-knit community of hippies, bohemians, nudists and itinerants, among others.

Based on Utopian ideals, Rainbow Family has no structure, no leadership, nor any spokesperson. Everything anyone says is expressed as ‘personal opinions’ and no one can tell anyone what to do.

Their gatherings usually takes place in July based on the lunar cycle, from full moon to new moon. There’s no end-date; people stay and leave at will. This year’s Vancouver Island edition has been in progress for more than two weeks.

It is taking place inside a remote forest area near Eve River in the vast, sparsely inhabited stretch of the Island between Campbell River and Port McNeill, where cellphone service ends and GPS coordinates are of no use.

A gas station employee at the Sayward junction is the best bet to ask for directions.

“I wish they wore shoes,” she says before pointing towards the direction in which she saw “many vans” heading over the past few weeks.

On Monday afternoon, at the gathering spot, colourful camping tents were spread across along the banks of a semi-dried-up pebbled river. Maybe two dozen people are visible. Children and pet dogs are playing by the stream of water outside their tents. A nude man practices yoga.

There’s a communal kitchen, featuring groceries that attendees packed in from farms or food banks. A sanitation spot with signage and a spray bottle has also been set up near a tree near the entrance.

“We’re practicing handwashing for COVID-19,” said Coco.

A small group of people have gathered around a fire pit where coffee is brewing. Full moon celebrations the previous evening went on from dusk until dawn. Musicians strum guitars softly and hum soft tunes as the smell of coffee and marijuana floats around. Everyone seems to be very relaxed or slowly waking up to the day.

The ‘sacred fire’ which was lit last week was still crackling in the afternoon. According to Coco, it will be kept “alive” throughout the duration of the gathering.

There are also ‘healing sessions’ that take place around the sacred fire before the evening gives way to music, dance and celebrations. A stick is passed from person to person around the circle and they are given the chance to speak and be heard. Some talk about their life journeys while others talk about traumatic, tough experiences. People also exchange and teach skills that they know to those who wish to learn.

Some were already packing to leave. A young woman from Vancouver who attended the gathering for the first time with her brother, said she will be back next year for the gathering as she found the experience of cutting away from technology and spending time in nature “personally uplifting.”

This year, the number of people who turned up was far less compared to previous gatherings, mostly because of the pandemic. While no one was wearing masks, people seemed to be cognizant of personal space.

A lot of people within the group have fluid beliefs when it comes to coronavirus. Some spoke about “preventive lifestyle” and the body’s capacity to self-heal and fight off any virus. Some dismissed the virus altogether as a conspiracy theory. None seemed to be overly perturbed by COVID-19.

Most learned about the gathering through informal Facebook announcements toward the end of June. Although there is no “leadership” for the Rainbow Family, a volunteer-based organizing council or “Seed Camp,” heads out to “scout” for a gathering place. The scout team also takes into account the ‘geopolitical’ nuances of the place, said Coco.

Over the years, the Rainbow gatherings have garnered controversy and an unfavourable reputation after incidences of violent behavior, drug abuse, murder and environmental littering in the U.S. was highlighted in the media.

In 2014, a news report by VICE highlighted the “dark side” of these gatherings, following a series of misadventures that took place at a gathering in Utah. A woman was arrested for stabbing a man and law enforcement also had to respond to drug overdose and people crashing a nearby wedding. The report also highlighted the group’s frequent clashes with forest authorities in U.S., saying “arrests and police run-ins have always been a hallmark of these gatherings.”

In 2013, Vancouver Island’s remote Raft Cove Provincial Park was shut down after authorities and locals found out that more than 2,000 people were looking to attend a planned Rainbow Family world gathering there.

Concerns of campfire bans, waste management and the fact that authorities had not been notified about the gathering were some reasons cited.

Rainbow Family members in this year’s Island gathering were quick to point out that a lot of people who attend are environmentally conscious. At the end of the gathering, groups of people volunteer to clean up, said one of the attendees. But without a structural hierarchy or ‘people-in-charge,’ it is difficult to say if the clean-up plan has been successfully implemented until after everyone has left the place.

Local authorities are aware of the Rainbow Family gathering. Constable Francios Veillette from the Sayward RCMP detachment, said that they are “monitoring the area” and there seems to be “no issues so far.”

People who have been attending the gathering for the past three or four years in B.C., have hardly noticed any problematic run-in with authorities.

“We’re peaceful people, we don’t incite violence or suport it and we respect everyone who comes to the gathering,” said an attendee.

For him, every year, coming to the gathering has been a pleasant experience almost like “coming home,” to familiar faces and new ones. His sense of belonging has never changed.

“Everyone is family here,” he said.

This summer, Surrey’s SuperChefs Cookery For Kids program has gone online with camps that teach kids about cooking, nutrition and sports activities.

The first virtual camps, free for children between 8 and 12 years of age, were launched on Monday (July 6).

Each camper will “attend” the camps for two weeks, and participate in cooking, nutrition and sports activities through mid-August, said Dr. Greg Chang, a local dentist and culinary educator who founded SuperChefs.

“Having been out of their regular school routine since March, campers and families appear eager to participate,” said Dr. Chang. “SuperChefs enrollment is nearing capacity – and those attending the ingredient pickup on July 5 (from outside Johnston Heights Secondary) were enthusiastic and anxious to get cooking.”

(Story continues below)

The COVID-19 pandemic prompted the shift online for the camps, now in their 12th year. Registration is done through the website superchefs.org.

The virtual format sticks to the program goal of promoting a healthier generation of youth, with added interactive polls, games and activities. It’s all based on the FACES acronym of making kids Food literate, Aware of food systems, Competent in cooking skills, Engaged in physical activity and able to Savour balanced food choices.

Former BC Lions receiver Geroy Simon, now the football club’s director of scouting, has gotten involved by creating a full-body, family-friendly workout video for the camps.

“As a former professional athlete and a father of two active children, I know the importance of keeping you and your family fit and healthy,” Simon said in a news release. “I am happy to provide tips to be a champion both on and off the field because a fit family is a happy family.”

Chang created the online program with the help of local university students, many of whom are keen to have careers in dietetics, healthcare, education and business. Two of the SuperChefs co-ordinators — Hannah Bailey and Skye Moore — have been accepted into the UBC Dietetics program in September, he said.

Dr. Greg’s SuperChefs Cookery For Kids is a non-profit arm of SuperChefs, described as an entertainment lifestyle private company.

The program receives funding from several community and corporate partners, in addition to federal agencies including the Canada Summer Job program and the federal Emergency Community Support Fund administered by the SurreyCares Community Foundation.

“SurreyCares helps facilitate that strengthening of community capacity, and we can’t say enough about the initiatives of SuperChefs Cookery for Kids,” said Michael Bose, chair of SurreyCares’ grants committee.

A Southridge School student and a group of her classmates raised more than $5,000 for frontline health-care workers this spring, with the money helping fund a meal program at Peace Arch Hospital.

Back in late March, as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was just coming into focus, 16-year-old Nora Zhu was speaking with her aunt, who works at a large hospital in China. From that conversation, she learned about how overworked the frontline workers there were, and was spurred into action closer to home.

“My aunt said doctors there were working so many hours a day, and were so tired. And in addition to self-quarantining in the hospitals, just had no time or energy to make themselves proper meals,” Zhu said.

“The conditions seemed really horrible, so I did some research and talked to some of my friends who have parents or family members working in hospitals here to see if the conditions in B.C. hospitals were similar.

“I found out that (working conditions) weren’t as bad as in China… but there were still many doctors and nurses who were self-quarantining (away from their families), they were working a lot of overtime, they were tired.”

As a way to help, Zhu decided she wanted to try to set up a meal-delivery program for front-line workers at Peace Arch Hospital, raising money and partnering with local restaurants to deliver food to busy, overworked staff.

The teen was inspired to help at PAH “on account of my family members and I have visited many times.”

After contacting the hospital, she found out that such a program had already been started by the Peace Arch Hospital Foundation, so she changed course, and decided to gather up some friends and raise money for the already-running initiative instead.

After a handful of Zoom calls with her fellow organizers, a GoFundMe account was launched, and over the next few months raised $5,605.

They were also able to bring one more restaurant on board with the hospital’s program, Zhu said.

The GoFundMe campaign officially closed June 1, and the money was sent to the meal-delivery organizers. With each meal costing between $8-$13, Zhu said their efforts were able to pay for more than 500 meals.

“About seven or eight weeks’ worth,” she said.

While the core group of fundraisers included Zhu and seven friends – Jonathan Hilton, Stanford Guo, Tatum Byrne, Alyssai Hai, Edward Cui, Coco Li, and Aerin Brown – she said there were dozens more who helped get the word out behind the scenes.

“In the end, my team and I were very proud… we were able to give back to our community,” Zhu said.

(submitted photo)

A Surrey Crime Prevention Society program that helped Melvyn Mani become an award-winning volunteer has been relaunched with funding of $150,000 through grants, sponsorships and private donations.

The organization’s Community Safety Mentorship Program pairs mentors with vulnerable youth who may be experiencing bullying or isolation.

Mani was one such teen five years ago when he first met Jerry Gunadasa, a volunteer and trained mentor with SCPS who was studying criminal justice at the time.

Both mentor and mentee sought careers in policing.

Back in 2015, Mani was struggling to fit in at high school. He ended up valedictorian of his grad class and today, at age 23, works at an electronics company and studies at Kwantlen Polytechnic University.

“Jerry was there through the rough patches,” Mani recalled. “Jerry motivated me to prepare for a career in policing and worked with me to secure a spot in the prestigious RCMP Youth Citizens Academy.”

(Story continues below video)

Mani was recently given the Pursuit of Excellence Award by Surrey Crime Prevention Society for his volunteer work in the Citizens Community Safety Watch Program.

“He’s come a long way,” Gunadasa said of Mani. “When he started off in the program he was pretty shy and timid and really closed off. It took a while for him to open up to me, and I was able to share a lot of my knowledge about policing with him.”

Surrey Crime Prevention Society announced the relaunch of its mentorship program on Tuesday (July 7).

“We are profoundly grateful for the generosity of our donors and sponsors,” said Karen Reid Sidhu, executive director of SCPS. “This program will support vulnerable youth while engaging them in activities that help them develop a sense of civic pride in their community.”

Since 1984, the volunteer-based Surrey Crime Prevention Society has backed community safety programs in Surrey. Today, SCPS has 350 volunteers, most of them university and high school students. Over the past five years, 1,600 volunteers contributed 145,000 hours toward the enhancement of community safety. More details are posted to preventcrime.ca, or call 604-502-8555.

The organization’s annual awards event for 2020 has been cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

This year’s Volunteer of the Year is Darren Brierley, who joined Surrey Crime Prevention Society in March of 2019. Since then, he has volunteered close to 350 hours of his time. “He participates in multiple programs including Citizens Community Safety Watch, Special Events and Traffic Safety,” according to a bio.

“Darren continues to demonstrate strong leadership, professionalism and has a can do attitude. He is reliable and always here to support programs above and beyond his program requirements. Darren leads new volunteers providing them with mentorship ensuring they are following proper procedures. His problem solving skills are superior and is capable of handling difficult situations that arise in his roles. SCPS is very fortunate to have such a dedicated volunteer.”

Other SCPS volunteer awards have been given to Samantha Mitchell, Kushal Patel, Amandeep Brar, Rob Gelderman, Gazaldeep Cheema, Anny Zhang, Amritvir Singh, Jasjot Sandhu, Manveer Rai and Simone Saini.

Last month, long-time Langley resident Pastor Brad Sumner was taking in a show with his teenagers at the Twilight Drive-In theatre in Aldergrove when the thought struck him: “why couldn’t a church do this?”

So under his toutage, the team at Jericho Ridge Community Church got to work, bringing the drive-in church concept to life this past Sunday, July 5 at a church on the Langley-Surrey border.

Part of the challenge of COVID-19 is social isolation, so the idea was born to have a drive-in church gathering where people could come and be together in the safety and privacy of their own vehicles while also experiencing a sense of community and connection with other people, Sumner explained.

RELATED: B.C. church services resume with public health limits

“The event connected well with the senior adults in our community,” added the lead pastor at Jericho Ridge.

“Many of them have been looking for a sense of meaningful connection with others, but have been unsure as to how to do this safely and wisely,” Sumner said.

Through the use of an app that is normally used for assisted listening devices, those who attended were able to hear the live music, as well as a message on managing complex emotions – all the while abiding by local health authority orders such as social distancing, number of cars at an event (50 or less), and not creating unnecessary noise for neighbours.

The drive-in church was such a “success,” Sumner said, that it will be repeated on the long weekend in August in the church parking lot at 19533 64th Ave., from 10:30 to 11:30 a.m.

“We look forward to welcoming more guests to our parking lot safely on Aug. 2 with the assistance of some very new technology that mirrors a very old concept,” he explained. “Young and old are welcome to join us!”

(Submitted photo)

It was with grit, enthusiasm and a little help from family and friends that helped Helen Horn summit the Lone Butte near 100 Mile House at 96 years of age on June 21.

Helen made the ascent with the help of a group of friends and her son Gus to celebrate a year since suffering a stroke. She’s no stranger to the Lone Butte as she used to climb if often in her younger years.

Born on her parents’ homestead in Lone Butte 96 years ago, Helen was born the daughter of a farmer-rancher who went on to marry a farmer-rancher. She worked the farm all her life until retirement and when asked what she enjoyed the most about it, joked there wasn’t time to think of joy in those days and instead she would simply wake up with a job that needed doing and she’d set herself to doing it, as simple as that.

“Time went by quickly and every year had a spring, a fall, winter and a summer and we did the best we could with what we had,” Helen said.

Since retiring Helen, with the help of her friends and family, has done her best to keep her mind and body active to keep herself healthy, happy and independent as possible. While she knows that everyone’s time comes for them eventually, she’s intent on keeping her own time as far away as she can as long as she’s able.

It’s thank to the people in her life, Helen said, that she’s still alive to this day as many people don’t reach her age and those that do often have serious physical or mental health issues limiting them in some way. It was this same group of people who pushed her and encouraged her to join them in hiking and climbing up the Lone Butte in mid-June.

The last time Helen had done it prior to this year was when she was 91, five years ago, and was able to make it up on “her own two feet.” This time, however, due in part to her advanced age and in part because of the difficult terrain, which she thinks has gotten rougher since her youth, she had to be assisted up via the use of rappelling equipment and at one point by getting a piggyback ride from young Dawson Schroevers.

“I did as I was told and I enjoyed every minute of it,” Helen said. “(At the top) we toasted the day, the people and the encouragement of everybody cause without that I could never have made the journey.”

Helen said they brought out some chairs to just enjoy the view and share a drink and some food together as for many of her companions, it was their first time on the Butte including that of young Ben who, at one year of age, was the youngest person on the rock. Helen added that they were blessed by the weather that day as, while it looked like it was going to storm, it held off and they instead were treated with sun and mild wind. She also quipped even the mosquitoes seemed to take the day off, which was a welcome relief.

“I was just so happy to see so many people,” Helen said, adding that everyone who lives in the 100 Mile House area should consider climbing the Lone Butte at least once in their lives.

Helen appreciates the support of everyone who came with her on this climb and the encouragement they gave her throughout the climb. It was an experience she greatly enjoyed and cherishes.

To the community of 100 Mile House as a whole, she’d like to encourage them to carry on the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic because she believes that without the community’s diligence the virus would not have bypassed the town. She’s hopeful that we can continue to hold ranks until this epidemic settles down, as she’s sure the world will never be the same after it.

Vancouver Whitecaps players including Patrick Metcalfe (centre) work out in a gym in Lake Buena Vista, Fla. on Monday, July 13, 2020. Vancouver’s wait ended at the MLS is Back Tournament against the San Jose Earthquakes on July 15. Vancouver, the last team to see action, was originally slated to open July 9 against FC Dallas but the game was scrapped when Dallas withdrew due to a rash of COVID-19 positive tests. THE CANADIAN PRESS/HO-MLS Mandatory Credit

LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. — Substitute Shea Salinas scored in the 98th minute as the San Jose Earthquakes rallied from 2-0 and 3-1 deficits to defeat the Vancouver Whitecaps in a wild 4-3 win Wednesday at the MLS is Back Tournament.

Goals by substitute Chris Wondolowski, in the 72nd minute, and Oswaldo Alanis, in the 81st, tied the game at 3-3.

Vancouver was reeling during the nine minutes of stoppage time before Salinas administered the coup de grace. The former Whitecap dribbled through the Vancouver defence, got a fortunate bounce and knocked the ball past goalkeeper Maxime Crepeau.

The Earthquakes dominated possession and had eight corners in the first 30 minutes but found themselves down 2-0 to the opportunistic Whitecaps, who led by two despite having just one shot on target.

Ali Adnan and Cristian Dajome scored for Vancouver, which also benefited from an own goal.

Andy Rios also scored for San Jose, which had plenty of the ball but lacked clinical finishing most of the night against a depleted Whitecaps side. Still, Crepeau had a busy night.

Adnan, Vancouver’s Iraqi international left back, opened the scoring in the seventh minute, curling a shot past a diving Daniel Vega from just inside the penalty box.

Vancouver made it 2-0 in the 22nd minute on an own goal when Dajome, after a San Jose corner went horribly awry, stole the ball from Brazil’s Judson and fed Yordy Reyna behind the Quakes defence. Reyna tried to slip the ball back to Dajome in the box but instead it bounced off Judson’s leg into the goal.

San Jose came on in waves and Rios cut the lead to 2-1 in first-half stoppage time off the Quakes’ 12th corner of the half, deflecting the ball in with a delightful flick of his foot with his back to goal.

Dajome capitalized in the 59th minute when a dreadful pass from Vega went straight to David Milinkovic, who found the Colombian alone in front for his first MLS goal.

The 37-year-old Wondolowski made an impact off the bench, flicking in a header to cut the lead to 3-2. The goal was the 160th of his career, adding to his MLS-record regular-season total, and his 14th against Vancouver.

Alanis then rose high to score off San Jose’s 19th corner, which tied a league record, to tie the game.

The Quakes outshot Vancouver 31-7 and also led the Whitecaps 11-2 in shots on target. San Jose also set a league mark with 22 corners and had 67.9 per cent possession. The Whitecaps lived dangerously on defence but made the most of their few chances at the other end, helped by San Jose blunders.

Vancouver was the last team to see action at the tournament, taking the field at ESPN’s Wide World of Sports complex after Orlando City and Philadelphia had already qualified for the knockout rounds.

The Whitecaps were originally slated to open July 9 against FC Dallas but the game was scrapped when Dallas withdrew due to a rash of COVID-19 positive tests.

San Jose opened the tournament last Friday with a 0-0 tie with the Seattle Sounders.

It was 26 C at the 9 p.m. ET kickoff after showers swept through the area.

After Vancouver went ahead, Crepeau made a fine save in the ninth minute to deny Jackson Yueill. Crepeau then had to deal with a powerful Cristian Espinoza shot.

Crepeau had to be sharp again in the 26th minute, clawing away a looping long ball from Espinoza that was destined for the top corner. The Whitecaps ‘keeper was fortunate in the 41st minute when a deflection off a defender following a corner went right at him.

San Jose outshot Vancouver 17-4 in the first half and had 73.4 percent possession.

Espinoza was yellow-carded in the 56th minute when he returned the ball for Vancouver throw-in head-high, hitting Adnan who tumbled theatrically to the turf. The card remained yellow after video review.

The Whitecaps are missing some key pieces at the tournament.

Forwards Lucas Cavallini, Fredy Montero and Tosaint Ricketts, defender Andy Rose and defender/midfielder Georges Mukumbilwa did not make the trip to the Florida tournament for personal or medical reasons.

Cavallini, Ricketts and Rose all started in Vancouver’s last league outing — a 1-0 win at the Los Angeles Galaxy on March 7 — while Montero came off the bench.

Wednesday’s starting 11 came into the game with a combined 29 MLS regular-season goals with Reyna accounting for 19 of those.

Backup goalkeeper Bryan Meredith left the team Tuesday to be with his family in New Jersey after the death of his mother Beth. Whitecaps player wore black armbands with B.M. on them with fullback Jake Nerwinski walking out holding Meredith’s jersey with Beth Meredith’s name written under the number.

Janio Bikel (adductor strain), who started at right back against the Galaxy, and defender Eric Godoy (quadricep strain) were injured in training Sunday.

Whitecaps midfielder Leonard Owusu, 23, made his first start while centre back Ranko Veselinovic, 21, made his MLS debut.

Captain Russell Teibert made his 200th first-team appearance. Whitecaps midfielder Patrick Metcalfe, a 21-year-old from Richmond, made his MLS debut off the bench.

45,surreynowleader,https://www.surreynowleader.com/sports/bayside-sharks-getting-creative-as-rugby-players-get-set-for-return-to-pitch/,Bayside Sharks ‘getting creative’ as rugby players get set for return to pitch – Surrey Now-Leader,"['Nick Greenizan', 'Local Sports']",2020-07-16 06:30:00-07:00,"BC Rugby has green lit the sports return across the province, but full contact is not yet permitted, nor is the touch version of the sport. (Don Wright photo)

Rugby officially received the green light to return to the pitch earlier this month, but real games – or something resembling them – are still a long way off.

That’s the message Bayside Rugby Club president Kevin Whitmarsh took from BC Rugby’s return-to-play policy, which was released July 7 and lists a number of new rules and regulations for rugby clubs to follow as they re-engage after a months-long COVID-19-related shutdown.

Any form of tackle rugby is currently still not allowed, and even touch rugby is still forbidden, Whitmarsh said, adding that he wasn’t surprised by much in the return-to-play plan.

“Essentially, we definitely won’t be playing any sort of contact rugby until next year, and that’s what we were expecting to hear.”

Surrey Beavers’ player Paul Kelly echoed Whitmarsh’s feelings in an interview with Black Press Media earlier this month.

“It’s nice to see a plan,” he said. “But it won’t look like the sport we know until probably the fall of 2021.”

In the meantime, Whitmarsh said they’ll “make lemonade out of these lemons” and are forming a plan that would see Bayside players – at both the youth and senior levels – return to action in new formats.

One of the new regulations is a ban on activities between different clubs, which rules out games even if touch rugby was allowed. However, Whitmarsh said the junior/youth levels will focus on skill development and practice when programs return later this summer, while plans for senior teams are still being considered, but “we’re getting creative.”

Return to Rugby information for players, coaches and referees is online now. Prepare to Re-Engage. https://t.co/8CJuTURCdC pic.twitter.com/9G7SSJIg7H — BC Rugby (@bcrugbyunion) July 13, 2020

One likely option for Bayside’s adult players, Whitmarsh said, would be an in-house touch rugby league, with player drafts, weekly standings and “anything else we can do to make it feel like a real product even though you’re not playing other teams.”

BC Rugby’s plan includes five phases, and Whitmarsh is hopeful touch rugby could be allowed possibly by late August, with something near contact – perhaps tackling, but without scrums – allowed to go ahead in 2021, though he admits that is “an optimistic guess” at this point.

According to the plan, full-contact rugby would only return in Phase 5 – when a vaccine or treatment for COVID-19 is available.

“Rugby is coming back but it’s up to all of us to make sure it’s brought back in a safe and responsible manner,” Annabel Kehoe, B.C. Rugby CEO, said in a news release.

“While we won’t be returning to full-contact rugby for the foreseeable future, we’re excited to support clubs delivering modified training before progressing to non-contact rugby.”

Kelly suggested that “it’s gonna be a challenge to keep players interested” without traditional games, and while Whitmarsh agreed that some players may continue to sit out – and some longtime senior players may retire altogether – he’s also optimistic that a casual fall program will bring new players out of the woodwork.

He always expects that some players will be itching to come back, and will return with vigor and renewed excitement.

“Our guess is it’ll be kind of a wash,” he said. “You can see that (enthusiasm) on our internal Facebook pages – people are itching to get back. So we think a lot of people will come back revitalized. But at the same time, there will be some people who were maybe just hanging on at the end (before the pandemic) and this may have been the last straw for them to say ‘OK, time to hang ‘em up,’” he said.

“Sometimes if you have a forced break, you fill your time with other activities and maybe you realize you like those other activities. So we’re prepared for that, but we’d love to supplement some of that lose with this trial period here in the fall that will hopefully bring out new bodies.

“Because you can’t run a successful rugby club with the same 15 people every year.”

With competitive action – touch or tackle – pushed to 2021 at the earlier, Whitmarsh also noted that it could be a good opportunity for local clubs, and the BC Rugby Union league as a whole, to adjust its competitive senior schedule permanently, moving from a fall-to-spring setup to one that begins in the spring and wraps up in the summer.

Bayside’s senior men’s coach Andy Blackburn first floated the idea in an interview with PAN back in April, citing numerous benefits, including better weather.

Whitmarsh admitted it might be difficult to get every B.C. club on board.

“This new (reality) kind of aligns with what we’ve wanted for awhile now… but it seems split 50-50 – a lot of clubs say, ‘No way, there’s no way we’ll get field space in the summer.’ So I don’t know what will happen.”

Whitmarsh was also hopeful that football – which also recently received the go-ahead to return, with a bevy of new safety guidelines – could provide a road map for rugby, considering minor football will be returning, with full contact, when the season begins on Labour Day weekend.

“Maybe football will be a great example for us. Maybe that will be the test case that makes BC and Canada Rugby happy with a full-contact product come spring. Maybe they see that there was no (virus) transfer through football and we can (return to full contact).”

All seven Canadian Elite Basketball League teams, including Abbotsford’s Fraser Valley Bandits, have descended onto St. Catharines, Ont. this week to begin preparation for the Summer Series event, which runs from July 25 to Aug. 9.

It’s the first semblance of pro sports in Canada and in the COVID-19 era that means safety, precautions and testing.

Bandits management told The News they are bringing a total of 15 people to the tournament, which includes players, coaches and other staff. They stated that ordinarily that number is usually over 20, but medical support is being sourced from the St. Catharines region so the team is not bringing a doctor, athletic therapist or a physiotherapist.

It’s a similar case for the other six teams in the league, as Bandits management said it is a very exclusive list of essential people that will be arriving and participating in the tournament.

Bandits vice president Dylan Kular said the tournament came to be after much consultation with Ontario health officials.

“All of our plans have been subject to the measures put in place by provincial, federal, and local public health and government officials,” he said. “Without their blessing we cannot move forward. We have been fully compliant with every requirement and will continue to be. Public health officials have worked closely with us to put in place exceptionally detailed medical protocols designed to keep our players, coaches, staff, local public and tournament officials safe.”

Every player and staff member at the tournament was tested for COVID-19 on Monday (July 13) after arriving. The test involves inserting a six-inch long swab into the cavity between your nose and mouth for approximately 15 seconds and rotating it several times. The swab is then inserted into a container and sent to a lab for testing. Niagara health authorities will then analyze the findings.

Anyone being tested will remain self-isolated until they receive word that they have tested negative and after receiving a negative test the individual will be allowed to train or work in the approved areas. A positive test will force the person to immediately adhere to the rules and supervision of local health authorities.

All players and staff who had arrived from outside of Canada for the tournament have been quarantined for two weeks as per the federal policy.

Kular said that testing and screening will be ongoing throughout the tournament.

“There will be daily screening and frequent testing of all individuals participating in the Summer Series,” he said. “There will be exhaustive cleaning measures at all times and in all areas of the arena, training facility and hotel. Also, each team will have someone designated to monitor their social distancing practices to make sure they conform to the six-foot rule. People will wear masks unless they are involved in the actual game or practice session. If an individual shows symptoms of COVID then they are given to the Niagara region health authorities for testing and contact tracing. Prior to round robin games commencing there will be another test administered.”

Players who test positive during the tournament will be immediately removed and provided a course of action by local medical officials. The CEBL has also created three safe zones: the Meridian Centre (where games are being played), a local training facility and a nearby hotel that is not open to the public during the tournament. The names of the hotel and the training facility will not be made public by the league.

“There will be very tight restrictions around who can enter the parameters of where we will live and work for the four weeks,” Kular said.

The names of those testing positive will not be made public, but the league may reveal the amount of players or staff that tested positive.

Oilers fans pack the square during the Edmonton Oilers’ Orange Crush community rally in Sir Winston Churchill Square in Edmonton on Thursday, April 20, 2017. Hockey fans in Canadian cities with NHL teams have a reputation for expressing their exhuberance in the streets during the playoffs, and some admit the temptation to ignore physical-distancing guidlines may prove too great as the pandemic-postponed season resumes next month. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Codie McLachlan

As hockey fans gear up for a truncated season to begin next month, some in Canada’s two “hub cities” say the temptation to celebrate — and flout physical distancing guidelines — may prove too great.

“I can’t say no to a good time,” said Edmonton Oilers fan Jeet Jermana. “I’d be hard-pressed not to jump into a big party.”

On Friday, the NHL board of governors and NHL Players’ Association said they had ratified the return-to-play plan, paving the way for the league to resume its pandemic-hit season later this summer.

Toronto and Edmonton were also officially unveiled as hub cities where all games will be played, beginning Aug. 1. Training camps start Monday in the 24 cities with teams still in the running for the Stanley Cup, including six in Canada.

In 2017, when the Oilers nearly advanced to the Western Conference final, Jermana was among the thousands of fans who partied in Ford Hall at Rogers Place arena and in bars along the popular Whyte Avenue district.

But with COVID-19 this year, where teams will play in empty arenas, Jermana said he’ll likely watch more games at home, maybe with just a few friends.

That is, he said, until the Oilers advance and he and other fans won’t be able to resist going out.

“Once it becomes the ‘real playoffs’ I think more and more the momentum will grab,” he said.

Matt Black of Hotel X Toronto, located west of the city centre where multiple media outlets have reported that several teams will be based, said the prospect of any accommodation for celebratory fan gatherings, even outdoors, seems unlikely.

Nevertheless, Black said he expects citywide excitement will be palpable, even with empty arenas.

“You look back to those scenes of Jurassic Park and Maple Leaf Square and all of that … it would be great for people to be able to get together again but you just need to make sure that you’re doing it in a safe manner,” said Black.

The players themselves aren’t to have any contact with the general public.

Dr. Vinita Dubey, Toronto’s associate medical health officer, said in an emailed statement that players and staff arriving from abroad will also have to serve a modified 14-day quarantine as well as undergo rigorous screening and daily testing protocols, wear masks in indoor settings, physically distance and wash hands often.

An Edmonton police spokesperson said the service wouldn’t be able to comment over the weekend on what sorts of preparations they might make for crowds when the season resumes.

Geoff Grimble with the City of Edmonton said the city’s civic events management team would likely discuss the issue during a scheduled meeting on Monday.

“The City of Edmonton’s first priority is public safety and we’ll continue to follow the advice and requirements of the Chief Medical Officer of Health to ensure fans, players, coaches and staff remain healthy,” Grimble said.

Oilers fan Brendan McLeod admitted he may be lured to a street celebration when — not if — his team advances, but said he still wants to maintain physical distancing.

“We have to get through this together or else it’s not going to change,” said McLeod.

But Shadi Merhej, who said he enjoys both hockey and the Oilers, noted the sport doesn’t have quite as strong attraction for him in the summer.

“It’s daylight ‘til 11 o’clock. You don’t want to spend half your day watching hockey,” Merhej explained.

“I’d rather go for a bike ride, or rollerblade or golf.”

Signs for the Washington Redskins are displayed outside FedEx Field in Landover, Md., Monday, July 13, 2020.

The Washington NFL franchise announced Monday it is dropping the “Redskins” name and Indian head logo, bowing to recent pressure from sponsors and decades of criticism that they are offensive to Native Americans.

A new name must still be selected for one of the oldest and most storied teams in the National Football League, and it was unclear how soon that will happen. But for now, arguably the most polarizing name in North American professional sports is gone at a time of reckoning over racial injustice, iconography and racism in the U.S.

The move came less than two weeks after owner Dan Snyder, a boyhood fan of the team who once declared he would never get rid of the name, launched a “thorough review” amid pressure from sponsors. FedEx, Nike, Pepsi and Bank of America all lined up against the name, which was given to the franchise in 1933 when the team was still based in Boston.

The team said it is “retiring” the name and logo and that Snyder and coach Ron Rivera are working closely to develop a new moniker and design. The announcement came on the old letterhead with the Redskins name because the team technically retains it until a new one is chosen and approved.

Native American advocates and experts have long criticized the name they call a “dictionary-defined racial slur.” Over a dozen Native leaders and organizations wrote to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell last week demanding an immediate end to Washington’s use of the name. Goodell, who has fielded questions on the topic for years, said he supported the review.

Protests against the name predate Snyder buying the team in 1999, and, until now, he had shown no willingness to consider a change. Strong words from sponsors — including a company run by a minority stakeholder of the team — changed the equation.

FedEx earlier this month became the first sponsor to announce it had asked the organization to change the name, particularly important because CEO Frederick Smith owns part of the team. FedEx paid $205 million for the long-term naming rights to the team’s stadium in Landover, Maryland.

The lease at FedEx Field expires in 2027, and dropping the name keeps open various possibilities in Maryland, Virginia and Washington for the team’s new stadium and headquarters. District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser has said the name was an “obstacle” to Snyder building on the old RFK Stadium site, which is believed to be his preference.

The team recently started cutting ties with racist founder George Preston Marshall, removing his name from the Ring of Fame and renaming the lower bowl at FedEx Field for the team’s first Black player, late Hall of Famer Bobby Mitchell. Marshall, who renamed the Boston Braves the Redskins in 1933 and moved the team to D.C. four years later, was a segregationist and the last NFL owner to integrate his team. The current logo shows the profile of a red-faced Native American with feathers in his hair.

Major League Baseball’s Atlanta Braves and the National Hockey League’s Chicago Blackhawks have said they have no inclination to change their names. Some advocates would like to see all Native American names, mascots and imagery out of sports.

Long removed from the glory days of winning Super Bowl titles in the 1982, 1987 and 1991 seasons under coach Joe Gibbs, Washington’s NFL team has just five playoff appearances in 21 years and no postseason victories since 2005. The team has lacked a nationally marketable player since Robert Griffin III’s short-lived stardom, and the 2020 schedule features zero prime-time games for a franchise that used to be a draw.

Re-branding with a new name and logo — and perhaps the same burgundy and gold colours — coupled with turning football operations over to Rivera could be a boon for Snyder on and off the field. Even if a segment of the fan base opposes the change in the name of tradition, winning would more than make up for those losses.

Given the gravity of the new coronavirus pandemic and the abrupt decision to place the NHL season on pause in March, it didn’t take commissioner Gary Bettman and union chief Don Fehr long to realize they were going to have to work together if play was to resume any time soon.

Nearly four months to the day since the last puck dropped, the two sides put aside past differences to have a return-to-play plan in place, and the assurance of labour peace through September 2026 to go with it.

“When we got to March 12 and decided to take the pause, that began a period of perhaps unprecedented collaboration and problem solving,” Bettman said during a Zoom conference call with reporters Saturday, a day after the league and players ratified a 24-team expanded playoff, set to begin Aug. 1, and a four-year extension of the collective bargaining agreement.

“It was a recognition by both sides that we were being confronted with an incredibly difficult, a novel, unprecedented situation. I believed we would get to this point because it was the right thing to do for the game and for everybody involved in the game.”

Fehr, the NHL Players’ Association executive director, not only agreed with Bettman, but went out of his way to credit the owners for the approach.

“I was persuaded well before the end of March that not only was this different, but it was being approached in a fundamentally different way. I always thought we would find a way to reach an agreement,” Fehr said.

The bond established between the two was apparent during the 55-minute session, with Fehr agreeing with Bettman and then acknowledging how unusual that was by by saying: “I think that indicates something about the approach that was taken in these talks.”

Training camps are set to open Monday, which also represents the deadline for players to determine whether to opt out without penalty. If all goes as planned, teams will depart for their two respective hub cities, Toronto and Edmonton, Alberta, on July 26 to open a two-month playoff leading to the awarding of the Stanley Cup.

Many uncertainties remain, with Bettman and Fehr unable to provide definitive answers.

While acknowledging the likelihood of players testing positive for COVID-19, deputy commissioner Bill Daly was unable to say how many players would have to do so for the league to postpone or cancel the playoffs altogether.

Though conference playoffs and Stanley Cup Final are scheduled to be held in Edmonton, a person with direct knowledge of the plans told The Associated Press the site might change if the pandemic spikes in Alberta’s capital. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because it is an alternate plan that’s not been discussed publicly.

Bettman and Daly, who are based in New York, weren’t even sure if or when they could cross the border to personally attend games because those entering Canada are required to self-isolate for a 14-day period.

The only certainty is the NHL became North America’s latest professional sport to forge a path back to playing, but minus the public hiccups experienced by its counterparts.

Major League Baseball’s season was nearly scuttled before the two sides agreed to a 60-game format. Less than three weeks before NFL training camps are set to open, the league is experiencing push-back from its players on whether to play preseason games next month. Major League Soccer has had two teams already withdrawing from competition because of the number of players testing positive for the coronavirus.

And not only is hockey on the verge of returning, the CBA extension assures 12 straight years of labour peace, the NHL’s longest stretch since Bettman took over in 1993. During that time, play has been halted three times by lockouts, the last in 2012-13, when the season was shortened to 48 games.

“I think Don and I both recognize labour peace was something we couldn’t even quantify how important it was,” Bettman said. “But we both knew that for the business of the game to come back strong, there was enough disruption going on in the world that we didn’t have to add to it.”

Fehr said the months-long talks to reach a solution were a matter of perseverance.

“This is a very bad analogy, but you have to sort of navigate the kayak in a storm until the storm’s over, and then make sure the kayak isn’t full of holes so that you can go on and sail it in calmer seas,” Fehr said in a separate interview with The AP. “Or to put it another way there was never any pretense that this was business as usual.”

Owners benefit because they can generate much-needed revenue through sponsorships and advertising, even though games will be played in empty arenas.

Though players will likely lose a portion of their salaries for seasons to come to make up for 50-50 split of revenue, they benefit from a CBA that includes the possibility of returning to the Olympics, after the NHL opted out from the 2018 Winter Games in South Korea. The new labour agreement also addressed players’ demands to gain a post-career subsidy for health care.

The CFL has sent Canadian Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault a revised financial request.

A CFL source said Friday the league is seeking roughly $42.5 million in aid. In April, it asked the federal government for up to $150 million in financial assistance in the event of a cancelled 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

At the time, CFL commissioner Randy Ambrosie said the league was anxious “to be accountable to taxpayers,’ and would attempt to repay a portion of government assistance through ”community programs, tourism promotion, the Grey Cup, our digital channels.”

The source added the new request is to cover operating costs and player salaries for a shortened 2020 season. The proposal also includes a letter of support from the CFL Players’ Association.

The source spoke on the condition of anonymity because neither the government nor CFL have confirmed the request.

Last month, the CFL and CFLPA began talks to amend the current collective bargaining agreement to allow for an abbreviated season. The two sides must sign off on any changes for any games to be played.

But prior to the start of negotiations, the CFL presented the union with a memo outlining the conditions it wanted and a completion deadline of July 23.

When asked about the revised financial request, the CFL said, “We continue discussions with the federal government including discussions on our possible return to play.”

While the revision is for substantially less money, the CFL’s situation hasn’t changed much. It still requires financial assistance with revenues having dropped drastically due to the COVID-19 pandemic and expenses expected to continue to rise if it tries to play a season with no fans

The CFL’s initial request of Ottawa consisted of three tiers: It called for $30 million immediately to manage the impact the outbreak has had on league business; additional assistance for an abbreviated regular season; and up to another $120 million in the event of a lost 2020 campaign.

When Ambrosie spoke to a federal standing committee on finance in May, he was roundly criticized for failing to stipulate where the funds would go and not involving the CFLPA in the process. But the source said the revised proposal mirrors an authentic financial offer and contains more specific details than the original one did.

The earliest an abbreviated ‘20 season will begin is September, but Ambrosie has stated a cancelled campaign also remains possible.

If the CFL holds a shortened season, it’s expected to do so in a hub city. Winnipeg has been mentioned as a strong hub candidate, but the source said Regina also is under consideration.

Curling Canada has been forced to re-think qualification for the Olympic team and mixed doubles trials after cancellations and postponements due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Teams and mixed doubles duos ultimately must win events or collect enough points at events to earn berths in the 2021 Tim Hortons Roar of the Rings and the national mixed doubles trials in early 2022.

The Roar of the Rings men’s and women’s champions and the victorious mixed doubles duo will represent Canada at the 2022 Olympic Games in Beijing.

The trimming of the Grand Slam of Curling from six events to two next season impacts teams’ opportunities to earn Olympic qualification points.

So Curling Canada declared the qualifying process on “hold” on Friday.

“The safety of our athletes is our prime consideration and we don’t want to put them under any kind of duress to be trying to participate in events to pursue qualifying points until we know they can do so safely,” Curling Canada high-performance director Gerry Peckham said in a statement.

“Until that time comes, we will look closely at the qualifying process and consult with our athletes to fine-tune the system to make sure it identifies Canada’s most deserving nine men’s and women’s four-player teams and 16 mixed doubles teams.”

Teams and duos with trials berths already in hand will keep them.

Teams skipped by John Epping, Brad Gushue, Rachel Homan and Kerri Einarson have qualified for the Roar of the Rings in Saskatoon from Nov. 27 to Dec. 5, 2021.

The pairings of Jennifer Jones and Brent Laing, and Jocelyn Peterman and Brett Gallant own berths in the mixed doubles trials Jan. 3-6, 2022, in a city yet to be named.

A plan to operate NHL game hubs in Edmonton and Toronto could draw hundreds of hockey players and staff to both Canadian cities, but business experts say their presence won’t give a huge boost to local economies.

While hundreds of people could be employed in positions relating to the games and hubs — such as security jobs, rink staff, food services and hotel housekeeping — the financial benefit of two bubble communities under tight seal would be “modest” at best, suggested Bank of Montreal chief economist Douglas Porter.

“When you think of how many tourists would normally be in Toronto during peak tourist season, I’m quite sure this is less than one per cent,” he said.

“The reality is, it’s not going to move the needle.”

But Porter, a lifelong hockey fan, said he anticipates a “reasonably meaningful positive” morale boost to Canadian sports fans who’ve been eagerly anticipating players returning to the ice in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The games are slated to start Aug. 1 with six Canadian teams qualifying for the 24-team resumption of play. No fans will be in the seats.

Edmonton and Toronto were confirmed as the NHL’s hub cities on Friday night.

“The fact that part of our world is getting back to some kind of normal will help reinforce the sense that things, generally, are moving in that direction and could help support the recovery,” Porter said.

The gradual comeback of major sporting events has drawn plenty of interest in recent weeks, with debates raging over the risks of putting players back into the games, even if spectators aren’t allowed in the facilities.

Further questions have been raised over whether rigorous testing is enough to prevent outbreaks within the isolated community, which could potentially throw the whole plan into a costly disarray.

Many of these factors make placing a value on hockey’s return especially difficult.

Michael Naraine, a professor at Brock University in St. Catharines, Ont., said the largest amount of money is on the line at large corporations, which he said is driving the return of major sporting events.

“The primary revenue driver for sports is broadcasting,” said the assistant professor of digital sport management and marketing.

“They need television advertisers come back. The league itself needs to gain its revenue from NBC and Sportsnet here in Canada.”

Politicians have preferred to emphasize the positive aspects of a deal with the NHL.

Alberta Premier Jason Kenney eagerly promoted Edmonton as the ultimate hub city for the hockey league, posting videos on Twitter that prominently featured the Rocky Mountains and other popular destinations in the province.

Naraine said those public expressions by leaders are more an attempt to “pander” to their constituents than actually drive any meaningful economic impact. He said this is especially the case in Edmonton.

“Having major events come to town allows them to beat their chests and say, ‘We exist. We’re on the map. Come look at us,’” he said.

“But the fact that the hub city will be in Edmonton is no different than whether the hub city would be in Toronto or Vancouver or elsewhere. It’s not going to significantly drive tourism all of a sudden.”

Patrick Rishe, a sports professor at Washington University in St. Louis, said he sees value in showcasing a lesser known Canadian city on broadcast television with “beauty shots” of the locale. He said it may also sit well with NHL executives.

“You never know,” he said. “Doing and serving a good deed for the league now, this could pay dividends down the road.”

Any semblance of a regular hockey season would be welcomed by Dana Parris, owner of the Lockeroom sports bar in Barrie, Ont.

Even though her business is over 100 kilometres away from downtown Toronto, she anticipates the excitement would reverberate to her customers.

“If we could have sports come back and we hit Stage 3 (of Ontario’s COVID reopening plan) around the same time, I will probably stop crying myself to sleep,” she said.

“If those two come together it’s just going to be the most beautiful thing.”

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)

The NHL’s plan appears robust and detailed.

Once players enter so-called “bubbles” in two hub cities later this month as part of the league’s blueprint to resuscitate its pandemic-halted season, teams should — at least in theory — be fairly well-protected from the threat of COVID-19.

A 28-page document released earlier this week outlines a grocery list of health and safety measures where no stones seem left unturned, including mandatory daily testing and the wearing of masks whenever possible, all the way down to banning high-fives and advising against talking in elevators.

Getting to the bubbles largely unscathed by the coronavirus, however, could be the biggest challenge of all.

There will be strict rules once the 24 clubs set to compete in the league’s return-to-play plan head to the hubs and are quarantined from the general public — Toronto and Edmonton are the expected destinations — but players will be free to come and go as they please during training camps slated to begin early next week.

And while the league touched on the need to be prudent with regards to physical distancing outside team activities during camps in a separate document, it’s potentially a soft underbelly players, coaches and executives know could pose a risk.

“The rink is the safe spot, it’s clean,” Calgary Flames general manager Brad Treliving said. ”You’ve got the protocol that really is enforceable.

“The recommendation and the messaging to the players is going to be, ‘You’ve got to keep that (personal circle) as tight as you can.’”

The NHL plans to test players every 48 hours during camps, and Penguins head coach Mike Sullivan said there have already been conversations amongst his group about the possible pitfalls of the next 2 1/2 weeks as the league looks to kickstart a campaign that was suspended in March as the coronavirus swept across North America.

“Exercise common sense,” Sullivan said. ”It’s to everyone’s benefit, whether it be our players or the public in general.”

Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist at Toronto General Hospital, said that message will be crucial for the league during this upcoming period of vulnerability.

“You’re not in a bubble, and players, just like everyone else in the world, are susceptible to this infection,” he said. “People have to be very careful to avoid going out and mingling with others in the world around them.”

While the virus is relatively under control in Canada, the explosion of cases south of the border, including hot spots like Florida, Texas and Arizona, represent a red flag. Of the 24 franchises tabbed for the restart, 18 are located in the United States and won’t head north until the end of the month.

“I’m not going to put words in anyone’s mouth,” Bogoch added. ”But you can be sure teams will be reading the riot act to their players on the importance of ensuring they stay safe and healthy.”

Canucks defenceman Quinn Hughes has been holed up in a Vancouver hotel since arriving back in Canada from the U.S. in late June as part of the cohort quarantine plan approved by health officials. He’s able to skate with a few teammates, but has otherwise mostly been confined to his room and is looking forward to a level of freedom.

“At a certain point we’re going to have to live our lives and we’re going to have to go to the restaurants and do these things,” he said. ”But I think you can be calculated and smart staying away from people and doing the best you can wearing a mask and washing your hands.”

And although British Columbia has been commended for its response and control of the virus, risks remain just like anywhere else.

“It’s on the players,” Hughes added. ”The players have to be responsible.”

Montreal Canadiens head coach Claude Julien, who’s 60 years old and in a high-risk age group for COVID-19, said his team will do whatever it can to assist players during camp, including getting groceries delivered.

“They’re taking this very seriously,” he said. ”They know the danger of it for them, for their teammates, for their families.

“We all have to do our jobs as far as being diligent.”

Of the 396 NHLers tested at team facilities between June 8 and Monday during small, voluntary workouts as part of Phase 2 protocols, 23 results — in the neighbourhood of six per cent — came back positive. The league said it’s also aware of 12 other positive tests for players not taking part in Phase 2.

Phase 3, which represents the start of camps, will see roughly 750 players report to team facilities next week, as long as the NHL’s return-to-play protocol and extension to the collective bargaining agreement are approved in the coming days.

That means nearly half of players set to compete had yet to be tested by the league as of earlier this week.

An outbreak within a team or teams could wreak havoc on the league’s return-to-play plans. Major League Soccer, which started its summer tournament this week, has seen both FC Dallas and Nashville SC pull out due to 20 combined cases of COVID-19.

Bogoch, who commended the NHL for its attention to detail inside what should be tightly-controlled bubbles, said even if every precaution is taken during camps, there’s a chance the virus will find a way through.

“You’re relying on people’s good judgment,” he said. “That might work out the vast majority of time, but it might not work out 100 per cent of the time.

“One case can certainly beget more cases.”

Exactly what the NHL is hoping to avoid.

Surrey-area minor hockey associations are aiming to hit the ice again later this summer, as always.

Registration has opened for play in the Surrey, Cloverdale, Semiahmoo and North Delta associations that comprise the Valley West zone in B.C.

The regional Pacific Coast Amateur Hockey Association said it is “well positioned for a successful season start in September, following prescribed return-to-play protocols from our sport governing bodies, the public health authorities and provincial government.

“It is our intention to have both recreational and rep hockey,” the association said in a July 3 statement. “This includes preparing game schedules for various return-to-play scenarios. We are pleased that we are now in Phase 3 of B.C’s Restart Plan, and we are beginning to see some of our municipal arenas reopen with programming run by our member associations.”

Local minor hockey associations are looking to start on-ice sessions in mid-August, as in previous seasons, but in Surrey it’s not yet clear when city-operated rinks and rec centres will reopen during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The city is looking at a “phased” re-opening of rec centres starting in the fall “if conditions stay the same,” City Manager Vincent Lalonde told Surrey council at its June 29 meeting.

Meantime, hockey practices organized by individuals have been held at private rinks including Langley Sportsplex and Delta Planet Ice. No Hockey Canada-sanctioned events are currently allowed.

The PCAHA says it has been working with its member associations on plans for a safe return to hockey. Regular meetings with all parties “have been occurring since April to plan and prepare for next season.”

• RELATED STORY: New PJHL boss is game for the return of hockey this fall, if green light given.

The Now-Leader was on a recent Zoom conference with executives from Valley West minor hockey associations, including Surrey president Harbs Bains, Cloverdale president Deanna Cox, North Delta president Robert Reid and Semiahmoo executive director Dave Newson.

“We know we have to work together to make this game come back this fall, and also make it comfortable and seamless for our members,” Bains said.

In early June, Hockey Canada said the best approach for a return to hockey in Canada is to allow each of its 13 provincial organizations “the opportunity to work with authorities in their respective regions to determine when it is safe to return to the ice in areas that fall under their jurisdiction.”

Minor hockey registration has since begun, and pre-season camps planned.

“With our registration patterns,” Newson said, “we’re getting good numbers and very little negative feedback about plans to return – just a couple of emails from people wondering what the season’s going to look like and if it’s a good time to register, that type of thing. But I think people are sensing that there will be some hockey in some form, and that it might look different but they want to be part of it when the time comes.”

Reid said “the rumour mill kind of took over for a few weeks there, with people saying there’d be no hockey, no games, nothing,” due to the pandemic.

“Unless we hear otherwise, our game is going ahead the way it always has. If we have to modify it once we do get direction, we have a contingency plan in place.

“We spend so much time chasing our kids off the XBoxes,” Reid added, “and for a couple months there’s been nothing but that, but I get the impression that parents are itching, absolutely itching to get back to what we know and love.”

Cox, who was elected president in Cloverdale in the spring, said the issues include tournaments and how they would be played.

“I had one of my rep coaches asking about registering for a fall tournament in the States, and we agreed that that’s a bad idea,” Cox said. “It’s about finding something local, and hopefully by the spring they can go back into the U.S. for tournaments, places out of town.”

For associations across Canada starting this coming season, divisions of minor hockey will no longer be known as Peewee, Bantam, Midget and similar names. In a change announced last November, Hockey Canada has moved to U7, U9 and other alpha-numeric, age-specific division names.

“We just have to keep getting the message out with the new branding, and be consistent,” Bains said. “The kids will get used to it right away, but it might take longer for the parents.”

COVID or no COVID, Newson said all of the local associations are interested in gaining more access to city-operated rinks and using private facilities less, for financial reasons.

New to Surrey at the start of last hockey season was North Surrey Sport & Ice Complex, a three-sheet arena built near Pattullo Bridge as a replacement for the two-sheet North Surrey Recreation Centre.

“For us,” Bains said, “it was a great new building and the anticipation and excitement was there. Some found it a long ways to travel because they got used to the other rink location, but as the season progressed it was fine. The kids loved playing there.”

For those in Cloverdale, the new rink provided some relief in an area where the city cancelled plans to build a two-sheet arena.

“We found that we could do more practices closer to home, and didn’t have to buy as much ice in Langley, for example, that early-morning ice,” Cox said.

“We found this past year that they expanded their adult hockey even more (at Surrey Sport and Leisure, in Fleetwood), and I get that the city has to make their arenas profitable, but we get complaints every single week about kids having such bad ice times,” Cox continued.

“It’s hard on the kids when they’re practicing at 10:30, 10:45 at night, or 5:30 in the morning, just to get on the ice here in Surrey. We could get better times in Langley but then we’d be paying three times the rate we’d pay in Surrey. We have kids at the Bantam and Midget ages who quit because the ice times are so bad.”

In other hockey news, BC Hockey says it will be operating a zone program for the 2020-2021 season, putting to rest rumours that the program would be scrapped during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The BC Hockey Zone AAA/AA Program provides elite-level development for players aged 13 to 18. The focus of this program is to prepare them for the next level of hockey through expanded draw zones.

B.C. Rugby recently released its return to play plan, but it looks like games may not be played before September 2021. (Photo: Malin Jordan)

Rugby is coming back.

B.C. Rugby announced it’s Return to Rugby plan July 7. But one local rugger says despite the road map, it’s not going to be an easy journey for rugby in British Columbia.

“It’s nice to see a plan,” said Paul Kelly, the captain for the Surrey Beavers. “But it won’t look like the sport we know until probably the fall of 2021.”

That interim “look” is one of small practices leading up to touch rugby and possibly a flag-style type of rugby game. B.C. Rugby’s return plan (see graphic below) consists of five phases with players currently slotted into phase two—a maximum of 50 people, a maximum of 60 minutes, all while maintaining a two-metre gap between players.

“Rugby is coming back but it’s up to all of us to make sure it’s brought back in a safe and responsible manner,” Annabel Kehoe, B.C. Rugby CEO, said in a press release. “While we won’t be returning to full-contact rugby for the foreseeable future, we’re excited to support clubs delivering modified training before progressing to non-contact rugby.”

With regular rugby only returning in phase five—when a vaccine or treatment for COVID-19 is available—Kelly said it’s going to be hard for clubs to survive.

“It’s good to see some training sessions will be allowed in the fall, but it’s gonna be a challenge to keep players interested.”

Kelly said his club, like many others in the province, are facing the same two challenges: lost revenue and keeping up that player interest. He said one feeds the other.

“It’s a little discouraging overall,” he explained. “We’ve had our doors closed for the last three months and we’ve missed out on a lot of revenue.”

Revenue keeps the clubs afloat, but that only comes with a full rugby season (which, in turn, creates that much-needed player interest, which generates that much-needed revenue).

He said rugby players’ interest will be hard to maintain without games. He added people don’t play rugby to run around in light, non-contact training sessions for weeks or months on end. They play to smash each other on the pitch.

“There is zero interest right now. Until we see light at the end of the tunnel, I don’t see many players hanging around hoping that something will change.”

SEE ALSO: OPINION: Should BC Rugby change the structure of their season?

B.C. Rugby’s restart plan offers no hope either. In phase four—scheduled to start in January of 2021—it notes that only “small-sided” training games can be played at clubs and that only “B.C. Rugby administered inter-club games” will be allowed.

Kelly said the outlook’s even worse for B.C. rugby clubs if you factor in the loss of the high school rugby season—a pipeline for rugby clubs to gain new players.

“We get a lot of high school players,” Kelly explained. “Unless they go away for university, they usually come out and play for us. But now those players are already out of the regular loop of playing rugby. Are they going to pick it up in the fall of 2021? For some, that could be nearly two and half years since they played their last rugby game.”

SEE ALSO: Cloverdale rugby team returns home from U.K. after tour was cut short by COVID-19 crisis

Kelly noted some older players may retire rather than wait until the fall of 2021 to resume playing.

“Your body takes a beating in this game. Some older players might say, ‘I haven’t played for 18 months.’ It’s gonna be interesting, but I think a lot of clubs will suffer.”

Kelly explained the Beavers’ Cloverdale clubhouse, the Beaverlodge, has been sitting idle so he’s been trying to organize a few social-distanced events in an effort to gain some revenue and open a connective conduit between players and their club. “We’re trying to do smaller functions at the club to keep revenue coming in.”

Kelly added, “This is the biggest challenge we’ve faced since our clubs’ inception [in 1970]. Our clubhouse burned down about 10 years ago and we rebuilt. It’s going to be challenging, but we’ll rebuild from this too.”

The new commissioner of Pacific Junior Hockey League says he’s confident its teams could be playing games sooner than other local junior circuits.

White Rock-raised Trevor Alto took the reigns of the PJHL at the start of May, in the midst of a COVID-19 pandemic that put an end to sports competitions of all kinds, including the mid-March league final between North Vancouver and Aldergrove.

The 13-team league includes Surrey Knights and White Rock Whalers.

As rinks begin to reopen for skills sessions this summer, Alto said the fall months could feature PJHL league games – if and when a green light is given by health and hockey authorities in the province.

“With a long-term view, I’m very positive about us being able to operate a game in a safe manner,” Alto told the Now-Leader.

He said the PJHL is pretty well structured for a return to play.

“We don’t have to deal with things like the WHL does, of going across provincial boundaries and into the States to play,” Alto said. “Our players travel on their own, in their own vehicles, to games, so there’s no bus situation, and no hotel stays in our league either, so there’s no issue there, and no buffets, team meals, that other leagues will have to deal with, in order just to operate.

“We’re lucky enough to deal with just the arrival at the arena and how we go about conducting a game, and then how we exit the arena,” Alto added. “Possibly we’d also have to look at how fans can attend in a safe manner, so our focus is on each of the individual facilities. They’re coming back online with various speeds and various expectations. I think we have to be very flexible with how each team comes back.”

Registration for Main – Prospect Camp is open!! Click this link to register;https://t.co/yXcpSFPQMB pic.twitter.com/LMyooPaR8o — Knights Hockey (@SurreyKnights) June 24, 2020

The Knights’ pre-season training camp is planned to start Aug. 24 at Langley Sportsplex, and the Whalers have word of “identification skates” posted to the club’s website, as a way of “building our future pod.”

In mid-May the PJHL announced the arrival of the Chilliwack Jets as the league’s latest expansion franchise. Majority owner Clayton Robinson will also serve as the club’s first head coach and general manager.

“We’re excited about that franchise joining the league,” Alto said. “The league was making some big moves and a time when other leagues weren’t, so that’s very much a positive for our league and what it has been able to accomplish in recent years under Ray Stonehouse’s leadership.”

Stonehouse, the outgoing league commissioner, will stay with the PJHL in a senior advisor role for the next two seasons. Earlier this year he was named an inductee to the BC Hockey Hall of Fame, Class of 2020, as a builder.

During Alto’s first couple of months on the job, his work has involved a good number of conference calls as opposed to in-person meetings.

“This has all been a shock to the system for everyone,” he said. “It’s been really good to see the hockey community come together at all levels. Being involved in junior hockey for awhile, we kind of live in our own bubble sometimes, but it’s been great to collaborate with some of the minor hockey associations. I’ve been on quite a few calls, including with Pacific Coast Amateur Hockey Association.

“As hockey administrators it’s our duty to get these kids back on the ice as soon as possible,” Alto added. “What that’s going to look like, we’re still working on that. There are lots of ideas. At the end of the day we’re all just following orders of the health authorities and Dr. Bonnie Henry, and also Hockey Canada. And the end of the day it’s a huge collaborative effort.”

The 2019-20 season was another difficult one for Surrey Knights, who finished with a single win in 44 games, well behind other teams in the PJHL standings.

Alto says he’s confident the team can rebound with the guidance of Gerry Leiper, head coach and general manager.

“He has done an excellent job,” Alto said. “Gerry’s passion for building that program is second to none, in my opinion, and it’s been a breath of fresh air in a time that’s been difficult. So I think the Knights have a coach and GM there who is doing a great job and I look forward to where he can take the team.”

If it seems like it’s been harder to get a tee time this summer, it’s not just your imagination.

Golf Canada reports that there were 17 per cent more scores registered with the national sport body this June compared to the same month last year.

A total of 1,483,506 scores were submitted to Golf Canada’s handicap calculator last month compared to 1,271,782 in June 2019.

That ended a streak of three months when recreational rounds played in Canada dropped precipitously due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

As restrictions were lifted across the country in May, the number of scores registered increased.

In May, 165,026 people registered their scores between the 1st and the 15th but 265,480 submitted scores in the final two weeks of that month.

The May 1-15 numbers are a nearly 40 per cent drop from the same period in 2019 (211,809) but the May 16-30 numbers are just five per cent lower than last year (269,266).

The upward trend comes even as Golf Canada had to cancel all of its amateur and professional championships due to travel restrictions put in place to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.

A shift in how scores are registered has also been seen, with most recreational players entering their scores online instead of in the course’s clubhouse or pro shop, which have largely been closed this summer because of physical distancing protocols.

Golf Canada plans to launch an updated version of its scoring app later this month, helping to keep players physically distant and improve their game.

(Photo: Tom Zillich)

A new walking track at Bear Creek Park is designed to separate those who like to walk from athletes in training.

The main track at the Surrey park is now reserved for track athletes from Monday to Friday, 5 to 8 p.m.

“It’s a safety issue,” said Jessie Dosanjh, a track coach with Universal Athletics.

“It’s a really good thing that the walkers can use the new track. It’s important to separate the walkers from the track athletes, for safety concerns. There used to be a big argument about it, but now the (walking) track is there for them. I have not heard anybody have a concern about it, but maybe a few are going to be upset. And with social distance, it’s good too, to have people separated a little bit more.”

The new walking track “provides a casual drop-in amenity that is essential during busy periods at Bear Creek Park to ensure a safe training facility at the existing athletics track to support the competitive development of world-class athletes,” according to Neal Aven, Surrey’s manager of parks.

The four-lane walking track, located around the perimeter of the upper grass soccer field parallel with 88th Avenue, is 400 metres long and five metres wide.

“It’s wonderful,” said walker Camilla Greene on a recent Tuesday afternoon. “The rubberized surface makes it bouncy, so it’s great for walking. It’s not too busy, either – just a few people out here right now.”

Construction was completed in the spring, although the rectangular track has been open to the public since last fall. Installation of pedestrian lighting is planned this fall, Aven said. The total project budget is around $500,000.

Dosanjh said he has witnessed many accidents and injuries on the main track in recent years, including the time when star athlete Katarina Vlahovic was hurt in a run-in with a walker.

“She just took off from the blocks and someone came in front, and to avoid that she hit the hurdles and broke three of her teeth,” Dosanjh said last fall. “I had a couple athletes get injured, and the people, it’s not their fault. They want to walk, and they can use the track if nobody is there, but at least they can respect the place for what it’s built for. It’s not for a stroller or dress shoes, not a bike on it. If they really want to walk or roll around, they need a safe place, and the other (track) will be for that.”

The walking track is part of Phase 1 of the Bear Creek Park Athletics Centre project identified in the city’s 2020 five-year Capital Financial Plan, Aven noted.

The “destination sports facility” would be home to a 2,200-seat covered grandstand and artificial turf field by 2023. The complex is designed to host national track and field meets, games of football, soccer and other sports, and also community events such as fundraising walks/runs and possibly concerts. The plan calls for a “creative” increase in the number of parking stalls in the park.

With a price tag of around $21 million, the project would include upgrading the track and sports field to “international standards” with a rubberized surface, and replacing the 500-seat wooden bleachers with a modern grandstand that would feature both individual plastic seats and “relaxed” seating, a concession, change rooms and a sheltered “warmup track” that would double as training space during the winter months.

Details of the project were revealed to the public last October during an open house held at the adjacent Surrey Arts Centre.

For now, Dosanjh said the Universal club’s athletes are keen to be back on the track, after months of down time during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“We got our permit and it was beautiful to see our athletes back at the track,” he said in late June.

“We don’t have any competitions for the athletes yet, but it’s important for them to keep fit,” he said. “This is a tough time for them. They are excited to come (to the track) but they don’t see anything to acheive this year. Not yet. The rule is, no more than 10 (athletes) in a group, to make things safe, and not more than 50 athletes in total on the field at one time.”

The Fraser Valley Bandits have filled out the team’s coaching staff for the 2020 Canadian Elite Basketball League season.

Joining new head coach and general manager Kyle Julius will be Rob Damiani as assistant general manager, David Singleton as assistant coach, K.J. Smith as an advance scout, as well as Julius’ father, Stu, who will serve as a senior advisor.

The news also means 2019 Bandits assistant coaches Virgil Hill and Kyle Graves will not be returning.

Julius was hired as Bandits head coach and general manager back in December.

Damiani brings more than five years of basketball operations experience from the NBLC. He first worked under Julius with the Mississauga Power in 2014-15 and then joined the Kitchener-Waterloo (KW) Titans as the club’s assistant general manager in 2016-17. Damiani spent three total seasons with the Titans before joining the Formosa Dreamers as an advance scout in the fall of 2019 to support Julius’ basketball operations staff in the ASEAN Basketball League (ABL).

Singleton has coached professionally in New Zealand, Vietnam and Indonesia. In particular, Singleton served as the Head Coach and General Manager of the Cantho Catfish in the Vietnam Basketball Association (VBA) during the 2016 campaign. Singleton then joined the Saigon Heat as the lead assistant coach on Julius’ staff in the ABL for two seasons from 2017-2019. Specializing in video coordination and player development, Singleton became the Heat’s head coach for its 2019 campaign and led the team to its first VBA championship with recently signed Bandit Tavarion Nix at the Heat’s helm.

Smith is currently an assistant coach for Basquete Unifacisa in Novo Basquete Brasil, the first division league of Brazil’s Liga Nacional de Basquete. The 2018-19 season was Smith’s first year with the club and he helped the team win its first Liga Ouro (second division) championship thanks to a top four offensive and defensive ranking. Following the championship, the team was promoted to the first division where they were preparing for the playoffs prior to the outbreak of COVID-19 and the cancellation of the season.

He is the eighth basketball coach in a family that has dedicated itself to the game for generations. The members of his family’s coaching lineage extend from the high school level to the WNBA. Smith’s grandfather, Fred Smith, was drafted in 1968 to the Milwaukee Bucks. Smith specializes in both player development and scouting. He got his start coaching Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball with the North Bay Basketball Academy (California) and the Erik Spoelstra Basketball Academy. He has also worked as a scout for PrepHoops Northern California, evaluating youth basketball talent with prospective collegiate potential.

Stu Julius will serve as a senior advisor on his son Kyle’s staff. Stu has a decorated basketball lineage that spans various levels of Canadian professional basketball. Stu joined the Lakehead Thunderwolves program in 1981 and served as head coach of the women’s basketball team for 18 years. He was named coach of the year twice during his tenure as head coach at Lakehead.

Lakehead missed the playoffs just once under Julius’ watch as he amassed an impressive coaching record of 311- 250 with the Thunderwolves.

He led the Thunderwolves to nationals twice and took the mantle as athletic director in 1991. Over the course of eight years as athletic director, the Thunderwolves hosted nationals four times between 1995 and 1997-1999. Julius was inducted onto the Lakehead athletics department’s wall of fame in 2013.

Following his time at Lakehead, Julius joined Wilfrid Laurier University’s women’s basketball program in 1999 as the team’s head coach. He led the Golden Hawks for nine seasons. Under Julius’ guidance, the Golden Hawks won a provincial silver medal and advanced to the Canadian Interuniversity Sport (CIS, now known as U Sports) championships in 2002-03 and 2003-04. For his efforts, Julius was named Ontario University Athletics (OUA) West Division Coach of the Year in 2002-03.

Since moving on from Canadian university sport, Julius has worked in the NBLC, both as an assistant coach with the Mississauga Power during the 2014-15 season, as general manager of the KW Titans in 2016-17, and as a performance consultant for the St. John’s Edge in 2018-19.

With a regional return-to-play plan now approval, the White Rock-South Surrey Titans minor football association has turned its attention to the next step – getting players signed up to play.

The organization – which includes players from five to 18 years old – has opened registration for the coming season, and practices will begin next week.

Teams in all divisions – from flag to midget – are expected to be set by Aug. 1, with games beginning on Labour Day weekend. Flag division is for players aged five to seven years old; atom flag is for eight and nine year olds; peewee is 10-11 year-olds; junior bantam is for those 12 and 13 years old; bantam is for 14-15 year olds and midget is for players 16-18.

Currently, special ‘early bird’ fees are in place until July 15, association registrar Tina Giustino added.

When football does resume later this summer, it will look quite different than in past seasons. For starters, at all levels of the Vancouver Mainland Football League, games will features nine players per side, as opposed to the traditional 12, and coaching staffs will also be limited on the sidelines.

With smaller rosters, available spots are expected to fill quickly, Giustino noted.

Even pre-pandemic, nine-per-side football has been popular in the VMFL, with White Rock being “famous for its nine-on-nine football” success, VMFL president Kevin Parks noted to Peace Arch News last month.

Other COVID-19 safety protocols include new face shields for players, frequent cleaning and sterilization of in-game footballs, and the requirement for players to wear gloves and long sleeves, among other new regulations.

The VMFL’s in-depth return-to-play guidelines were first designed by Parks, and then adjusted in consultation with other minor-football executive members before ultimately being approved by B.C. regulatory body ViaSport, Football Canada and the various health authorities involved.

The Canadian Elite Basketball League will be the first professional sports league to return to action in Canada, with games occurring later this month.

The stage has also been set for the Abbotsford-based Fraser Valley Bandits, as the league released its Summer Series schedule earlier this week.

Games tip-off in St. Catharines, Ont. starting on July 25, with the Bandits opening the six-game initial round robin against the Edmonton Stingers on July 26 at 1 p.m. local time.

The Bandits schedule then sees the club challenge the Saskatchewan Rattlers on July 28 at 4:30 p.m., the expansion Ottawa Blackjacks on July 30 at 4 p.m., the Hamilton Honey Badgers on Aug. 1 at 10:30 a.m., the Niagara River Lions on Aug. 2 at 1 p.m. and then finish with the Guelph Nighthawks on Aug. 5 at 2 p.m.

The CEBL team with the worst record will then be eliminated and and a six-team playoff will begin. The top two teams will receive byes, with the third ranked team taking on sixth and four and five squaring off. The CEBL championship game is set for Aug. 9.

Games will not be played in front of fans and teams will be separated from the general public with screening and COVID-19 protocols under the supervision of medical officials in place. Health and safety measures will be maintained for the participants, including social distancing and other specialized practices designed to limit interactions amongst participants.

A handful of games will be broadcast on CBC television, with the Bandits lone TV appearance occurring on Aug. 1 against Hamilton. All other games can be viewed on the CBC Gem streaming service.

“We are excited to bring live sports back to audiences in local communities across the country, who are just as hungry for the return to play as we are,” stated Chris Wilson, Executive Director, Sports & Olympics, CBC. “Our partners at the CEBL have come up with a plan that not only adheres to health and safety restrictions, but takes the competition to the next level. The condensed season means each game means that much more, and we are thrilled to be able to provide a national stage for these athletes and the league. This tournament will be exciting summer entertainment for Canadians at just the right time.”

The 2020 CEBL season has been on delay since mid-April with its originally scheduled tipoff date of May 7. Each club had been scheduled to play a 20-game schedule leading to a final four CEBL Championship Weekend in Edmonton, August 14 to 16.

Gary Longhi, a four-time Paralympian and Canada’s flag-bearer for the opening ceremonies of the 2000 Sydney Paralympics, has died at the age of 56.

The Canadian Paralympic Committee announced Longhi’s death Friday.

The road cyclist competed in the 1988, 1992, 1996 and 2000 Games, winning gold and bronze in ‘96 in Atlanta and silver in ‘92 in Barcelona.

The Montreal native was the first Paralympic athlete to be inducted into the Canadian Cycling Hall of Fame in 2017.

Ahead of his induction Longhi said that he cherished the camaraderie of cycling for the Canadian team.

“Sometimes in society I feel like an outsider,” he said. “On the bike I’m normal. Everything is smooth, not as harsh as usual. It’s freedom for me.”

Longhi took up elite-level cycling as part of his rehabilitation following a 1983 motorcycle crash that nearly claimed his life and left him in a coma for three months. His brain injury qualified him for Para cerebral palsy category of competition.

The NHL says 35 players have tested positive for the novel coronavirus over roughly the past month.

The league says 23 of 396 players checked for COVID-19 at team facilities have tested positive since voluntary Phase 2 workouts began June 8 — a rate of just under six per cent. In that same time period, the NHL added it is aware of 12 additional positive test results.

That’s an increase of eight players in Phase 2, and one from outside the NHL’s testing system, over the last week.

The NHL says it has administered more than 2,900 tests at team facilities.

READ MORE: NHL says 26 players have tested positive for COVID-19 since June 8

Ten additional players were confirmed to have tested positive in the spring — five from the Ottawa Senators, three from the Colorado Avalanche and one each from the Pittsburgh Penguins and Boston Bruins. That brings the total number of NHLers with confirmed positive tests to 45 since the schedule was suspended in mid-March.

The league is no longer providing details on the players or clubs with positive tests. There was no word on the health status of the 35 players in question, including whether or not they experienced symptoms or have recovered.

“All players who have tested positive have been self-isolated and are following (government) protocols,” the NHL said in a statement released on Twitter.

The league and NHL Players’ Association on Sunday night agreed on protocols to start training camps and resume the season. That includes daily testing once games get under way for players, coaches and staff.

Resuming is contingent on each side approving an extension of the collective bargaining agreement and the return-to-play protocol.

A new study suggests eight times as many people in Metro Vancouver have been infected by the novel coronavirus than the rate of reported cases.

The joint study by researchers at the B.C. Centre for Disease Control, University of B.C., LifeLabs and public health scientists is posted on the health research website medRxiv and a news conference on the findings is scheduled for Thursday morning.

The authors say the findings indicate successful suppression of community transmission in B.C., with an estimated overall infection rate of less than one per cent.

The study looked at anonymous blood samples collected for reasons unrelated to COVID-19 by LifeLabs in March and May, before and after public health measures were introduced.

The first samples in March found two of 869 specimens were positive, for a prevalence of 0.28 per cent, while the May sample found a prevalence of 0.55 per cent.

Health Minister Adrian Dix described the estimated infection rate as “very low” and says it shows the effectiveness of British Columbia’s public health measures and co-operation of the public.

“It reinforces the fact that we’re on the right track,” Dix says.

“Of course, this is as the study suggests a dual-edged question, a low level of transmission but also very few people with antibodies to deal with potential future spikes of COVID-19.”

If the study’s prevalence rate is applied to the whole provincial population, it could mean about 28,000 people have had the novel coronavirus, while 3,149 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed to date, however Dix noted the results are specific to the Vancouver area.

Health officials have repeatedly said that more people have been infected with the virus than have tested positive and Dix calls the estimated prevalence rate in B.C. “encouraging.”

“Overall the level of infection in B.C. was low and that’s due to the actions of people in B.C. That said, there are more people who were infected with COVID-19 than tested positive and that’s something we’ve said clearly, especially in the period of March and April when we were focusing our testing program particularly on specific groups including health-care workers,” Dix says.

The study is the first of its kind in Canada, he says.

The study is also important because it involved people who did not self-select for COVID-19 testing, so they likely didn’t believe they had the virus, Dix says.

The study was authorized by provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and approved by the clinical research ethics board of the university. It has not yet been peer reviewed.

British Columbia recorded 21 new cases Wednesday and no new deaths. There are 207 active cases while 2,753 people who tested positive have recovered, the government said in a news release.

The Conservatives say they want a criminal investigation into the Liberal government’s decision to award a $900-million contract to the WE organization. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Christopher Katsarov

By Walter van Halst

Special to the Cloverdale Reporter

In 2012, a student named Dayton Campbell-Harris asked me if I would buy a $10 Me to We water bottle so he could attend one of their upcoming events. Dayton was a good student as well as a good rugby player and since this charity professed to support student empowerment, how could I say no?

Eight years later, this charity, its fundraising arm and Justin Trudeau have all become embroiled in a scandal which has prompted federal Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion to launch the third investigation of the PM who appointed him. You can’t make this stuff up.

But beyond the nearly $1 billion “sole source” contract offered to this organization to run Canada’s summer jobs program and the $300,000 in speaking fees it paid to the Trudeau family, there is potentially a much darker side to this controversy which parents, teachers, principals and school board officials all across this country need to pay attention to. Teachers were paid as much as $12,000 each to recruit their own students by the We Charity, which raises enormous ethical issues in education.

Should teachers be recruiters, or benefit financially from their position of trust with the students whom they teach? The obvious answer is no, because doing so could create both real and apparent conflicts of interest, much like a politician or his family making extra money on the side.

SEE ALSO: Cloverdale Strong: our town in a pandemic

However, since education is a provincial responsibility and each of the 60 school districts in B.C. also set important policies within their jurisdictions, it would be prudent at this time for those in senior local and provincial leadership positions to review what safeguards they have in place.

For example, if teachers own or manage a business instead of a charity, is it appropriate for them to hire current students whom they might still be teaching? Similarly, if a teacher either owns or is paid by a club sports team, is it ethical for that teacher to either recruit or financially benefit from their own students? Clearly, in both situations either a real or apparent conflict of interest would take place.

In addition to the practice of recruiting for money, the We Charity may also have involved a more subtle but equally questionable practice: recruiting for partisan purposes or ideology.

For example, if the founders of We, Marc and Craig Kielburger, have close political ties to Justin Trudeau and the Liberal Party, that is their right, but did anyone tell the kids before they joined? And if teachers start encouraging or recruiting students to join politically active organizations, even if they aren’t paid to do this recruiting, is this really an appropriate thing to do with minors who aren’t even old enough to vote?

Of course teachers have as much right to be active in politics as any citizen, but you would think a former teacher now serving as prime minister would know better than to hold giant pep rallies full of students who might not be able to realize that a charitable event has now become a partisan one too—unless all the party leaders were invited to take part equally, which they weren’t.

Teachers should encourage students to get involved in their community, including in civic, provincial, and national campaigns, as long as the students are pursuing their own causes or parties and not their teacher’s interests or ideology and above all else, both these students and their parents have made informed consent.

Classrooms must be centres for education, not indoctrination, or in the case of the We Charity scandal, both indoctrination and renumeration.

Last year, Ranj Singh performed close to 220 gigs.

“And this year started off fantastic,” the Surrey-based musician said, “but then this (pandemic) came in and closed everything down.”

No question, 2020 has been a bleak year for the city’s performing artists, due to COVID-19 and the resulting lack of events to play.

In response, Surrey Civic Theatres has rolled out a series of “Digital Stage” online concerts that offer local musicians paid gigs at a time when few are available to them.

The next one, set for Friday, July 24, will feature Singh and fellow player Sami Ghawi in an hour-long showcase starting at 7 p.m. on Surrey Civic Theatres’ Facebook page and also the city’s Youtube channel.

Ghawi has performed a few of the Digital Stage concerts in recent weeks, under the banner of his FUSIONpresents brand, but for Singh it’s pretty much a new adventure in the online-gig world.

“I’ve done a few (concerts) from home, trial and error, trying to get the sound right and things working properly,” Singh said of recent attempts to enter the virtual world of concerts. “Then with Sami’s help he got me set up and I got a bit more gear for that, and now it’s pretty good.

“I type with one finger so I’m not a technical guy at all,” he added with a laugh, “so it’s been a good learning experience for me.”

• RELATED STORY, from 2016: Melodic memories for brain-injury survivors in song by Surrey’s Ranj Singh.

On July 24 the duo will perform together in the same room at Surrey Arts Centre, for an online audience only.

“We’ve been rehearsing outdoors in a park over the last month or so, with social distancing and everything, and it will be the same setup that night,” Singh explained. “It will be mostly covers, but when I do covers I usually do them quite different, and as you know Sami is a great musician so he adds a whole new flavour to it as well, so it’s been a lot of fun to play with him. It’s going to be his style mixed with my style, with a couple of originals in there too.”

(Story continues below video)

Singh and Ghawi first met in 2018 at the Surrey Arts and Business Awards, although they’d been Facebook friends prior to that. Ghawi’s FUSIONpresents company later began booking Singh at the Sheraton Vancouver Guildford Hotel’s MIXT Lounge; the upcoming showcase will mark the first time they’ll gig together.

Ghawi, who has hosted the Sunday-night jam at White Rock’s West Beach bar for more than a decade, said he’s thrilled to be a part of the Digital Stage initiative.

“I’m so grateful for this opportunity from the City of Surrey that gives artists the chance to perform and entertain the public,” he said. “Being offered a platform to perform and get paid when all our scheduled shows have been cancelled overnight is a huge blessing.”

• RELATED STORY: B.C.’s virtual ‘SoundON’ concerts kick off with sounds of Surrey festival.

Singh is currently performing five or six gigs a month, mostly outdoors.

“I’m at Krause Berry Farms (in Langley) every weekend, booked there until September, which is nice of them,” Singh explained. “And I have a few weddings to do, which have been scaled down to 20 or 30 people, pretty much, and those were booked last year. And I’ve been offered other gigs where I’m like, “nope,” where I’m just not comfortable doing them. Like, when we’re singing, you’re spitting 20 feet in front of you, so you have to have nobody near you. We have to be careful.”

Looking ahead, in a show called “Write the Future,” the Digital Stage concert on Aug. 7 will feature Devon More and her “humble, humorous and harmonious take on the human condition in 2020,” according to an event post on surrey.ca. “Building musical arrangements for her indie rock/pop tunes from scratch, she uses a loop pedal to live-mix the electric guitar, flute, glockenspiel, and whatever else is in her long arm’s reach.”

B.C.’s police watchdog has been called in to investigate after a man was left with serious injuries during an arrest in Vancouver.

In a statement on Thursday (July 16), the Integrated Homicide Investigators said that the incident happened between 3 to 3:30 a.m. that morning.

Police were searching for a man who was allegedly involved in a prior incident when they saw him on a bicycle near the intersection of Dunsmuir and Howe Streets. The man rode away so officers followed him, the IIO said.

He was taken into custody in the 1000 block of Robson Street and during the arrest sustained serious but non-life threatening injuries.

The watchdog is asking anyone who saw the incident to contact the Witness Line toll free at 1-855-446-8477.

Black Press Media has reached out to the Vancouver Police Department for comment.

(Photo from Paranormal North Coast British Columbia’s Facebook page)

Northern B.C. paranormal researchers aren’t sure if strange goings on at a Kitimat-area bistro are tied to a 1975 attempted robbery at the same location, but what they did find left them intrigued.

Paranormal North Coast British Columbia is a Kitimat-based team that has, over the past three years, investigated different places around Kitimat, Terrace, and Prince Rupert, looking to try to explain the seemingly unexplainable.

Recently, they conducted an investigation of PF Pizzeria & Bistro at City Centre Mall, after employees reported strange goings-on in and around the establishment.

The team, made up of Danny Nunes, John Powell, Roy Lawson, and Keenan Mosdell, had received a call from employees at PF Bistro that there were weekly occurrences of things that shouldn’t be happening, such as weird noises, dishes flying off kitchen shelves, and something the Bistro staff call “Shadowman,” a shadowy apparition that many would see behind them out of the corner of their eyes.

So, the team decided to come in and investigate.

“The idea is that, if there are ghosts, they are composed of different energies, so the idea is that they can transmit different energy waves to hit different technologies and communicate with you,” Nunes said.

The team uses video cameras, audio equipment, and an app called Spirit Box that emits a loud, white noise that different energies can interact with to try to communicate with humans.

They also use temperature readings to try to document energies, as well.

“Humans emit heat signatures, yeah? So, you know, if you see something on a device shaped like a human, but it’s emitting a cold signature, then it’s like, oh my God, you’re going to freak out because that doesn’t make sense,” Nunes said.

“And even sometimes a heat signature, it’s like, there’s nothing there on the other cameras, but why are we getting this heat signature then?” Powell added.

Nunes and Powell said investigating is often boring and tedious and they’re not finding ghosts around every corner, like the TV shows would have people believe.

“You’re lucky if you get, like, audio evidence, so…you’re setting up cameras, you’re setting up audio devices,” Nunes said. “We document what’s going on, and try to put a face to what the witnesses are telling us.”

Nunes and Powell said the process involves setting up the equipment, then asking a series of basic questions, such as the spirit’s name, if they’re even there, etc., to try to get an intelligent response in return.

“You’re asking questions, like, out of thin air,” Nunes said. “You’re trying to guess whether there’s maybe something there or not.”

READ MORE: VIDEO: Can you believe it? This B.C. hill pulls cars backwards up a slope

The team starts by interviewing witnesses to get a sense of the situation and try to find out if there’s any relevant history. From there, they try to recreate the witness testimonies to see if they can find out if there’s validity to their experiences.

In the case of The Bistro, Nunes said they talked to the employees and went to the Kitimat Northern Sentinel archives at the Kitimat Public Library to try to validate the stories and get a sense of the restaurant’s history.

They found out that in 1975, there was an attempted robbery at a sporting goods store on the lower level. The man had ended up in a shoot-out with the police. Police chased him to the second level, where the man reportedly later died due to a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.

The location of this incident? Right outside The Bistro where they’d been experiencing the strange activity.

Throughout the investigation, which happened near the end of June, the team saw an orb in the bathroom, heard a response that sounded like “Nathan” when they asked the spirit’s name, had a broom fall unprovoked in the kitchen, and got a vocal response to questions posed just outside of the staff bathroom, in the kitchen, and in main dining area.

Nunes and Powell said that they never saw the “Shadowman” the employees had spoken of, and they can’t confirm that the audio and video they got was the man from the 1975 robbery, but they said the footage they got validated the employees’ testimonies that something strange was going on.

“There’s a lot of different theories about what constitutes the paranormal,” Nunes said. “We’re not busting ghosts, we’re documentarians, really.”

Going forward, they said the team’s goal is to try to document occurrences all around Northwest B.C.

“The idea is to go up the road, from Kitimat to Prince George, and basically document these stories,” Nunes said. “If you can [document] something with a human form, that’s the gold at the end of the rainbow…[but] like I said, [we’re] not Ghostbusters, nothing we see is for certain, we’re just doing [our] best.”

Canadian, British and U.S. security services say hackers they believe are working for Russian intelligence have been trying to steal research on COVID-19 vaccines from organizations in all three countries and around the world.

Canada’s Communications Security Establishment says the malicious cyberactivities were very likely undertaken to pilfer information and intellectual property relating to the development and testing of vaccines for the novel coronavirus.

The cyberspy agency says the clandestine activity is hindering response efforts at a time when health-care experts and medical researchers need every available resource to help fight the pandemic.

The CSE’s Centre for Cyber Security assesses that APT29, also known as ”the Dukes” or “Cozy Bear,” was responsible, and almost certainly operates as part of Russian intelligence services.

“The group uses a variety of tools and techniques to predominantly target governmental, diplomatic, think-tank, health-care and energy targets for intelligence gain,” says a joint advisory from the CSE and its allies.

“APT29 is likely to continue to target organizations involved in COVID-19 vaccine research and development, as they seek to answer additional intelligence questions relating to the pandemic.”

This assessment is supported by partners at Britain’s Government Communications Headquarters’ National Cyber Security Centre, the U.S. National Security Agency, and the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.

The CSE is urging Canadian health organizations to review a technical advisory on the threat and to take any necessary actions to protect themselves. “We encourage them as well to contact the Cyber Centre if they suspect they have been targeted by cyberactors.”

The joint advisory says APT29 targeted COVID-19 vaccine research and development by scanning specific computer IP addresses of interest for vulnerabilities, a tactic that can help the group obtain login credentials to systems.

“This broad targeting potentially gives the group access to a large number of systems globally, many of which are unlikely to be of immediate intelligence value,” the advisory says.

“The group may maintain a store of stolen credentials in order to access these systems in the event that they become more relevant to their requirements in the future.”

As Twitter Inc. grapples with the worst security breach in its 14-year history, it must now uncover whether its employees were victims of sophisticated phishing schemes or if they deliberately allowed hackers to access high-profile accounts.

On Wednesday, some of the world’s most prominent names, including former president Barack Obama and Democratic candidate and his former vice president Joe Biden, along with Bill Gates, Elon Musk and Warren Buffett, had their Twitter accounts post invitations for an apparent Bitcoin scam. Twitter reacted by blocking further posts from all verified accounts on the service and said it had detected “a coordinated social engineering attack by people who successfully targeted some of our employees with access to internal systems and tools.”

The company’s explanation has ignited speculation over the identity of the perpetrators and what they were actually targeting in the attack. The scale of the endeavor and its timing —months before the November U.S. elections —have given rise among cybersecurity experts to theories that the attack masked a more nefarious campaign to seize sensitive data.

In its investigation of the incident, Twitter will now likely focus on employee logs, email and phone records. At question will be any failures in authentication processes that might have allowed hackers to hijack verified accounts, and also what other information, such as direct messages, might have been compromised in the breach. The Bitcoin wallets promoted in the tweets collected around $120,000 in cryptocurrency.

Twitter shares were down about 6% in pre-market trading on Thursday.

A social engineering attack means “leveraging the human element of security” and there are many different ways to do that, said Rachel Tobac, Chief Executive Officer of San Francisco-based SocialProof Security.

“I can phish someone who has administrative access and try and gain access to their credentials and log into their account,” she said, or the less technical method would be to develop “a relationship with someone who works on those panels and convincing them to do your bidding for you.”

Security awareness at companies like Twitter would be mandatory, but ultimately it’s hard to track insider attacks when it’s the employees rather than the technology who fall under the microscope, Tobac said.

“It used to be the Nigerian prince letter with a bunch of spelling mistakes, and now it’s something that almost looks legitimate, but it always starts with a person,” said Frances Dewing, the CEO of cybersecurity firm Rubica Inc., based in Seattle.

“There’s a playbook for doing this, there are cybercriminal organizations that make millions of dollars. It’s the fastest growing business in the world,” she said.

And there is no accounting for disaffected workers, as Twitter learned in 2017 when an employee deactivated President Donald Trump’s account before it was quickly restored.

Identifying potential Twitter employees to target wouldn’t be difficult for the hackers, given the way most smartphone apps hungrily vacuum up location and other contextual data from users —data which is often then sold on to marketing companies. Anyone frequenting the same coffee shops and businesses or entering and leaving a workplace at particular hours can give away clues about themselves.

Cybersecurity experts can only speculate until Twitter itself reveals what happened and where the failures occurred, but even this kind of show of force —a demonstration by hackers to earn credibility or gain infamy —isn’t convincing them that a Bitcoin scam was all there was to the operation.

With U.S. elections looming, the cyber landscape is ripe for a major attack. Stas Protassov, co-founder and president of global technology firm Acronis said the attack was “too prepared to be just a cryptocurrency scam.”

“We don’t believe that’s all the hackers went into once they got access,” he said in an email. “The attack is too big and too noisy and likely covering a bigger play. We’ve yet to see the full impact of what this was about.”

Tobac also raised the possibility that the attack could have been a distraction while hackers harvested private direct messages and any other confidential data to be able to deploy at a more critical time. So while the initial disruption to Twitter’s service appears to have been patched over and the company is gradually restoring normal operation, the lingering effects of this breach might have much wider effects than Wednesday’s spectacle.

“Maybe they were doing something insidious and this was just a cover up,” she said. “There’s no way for us to know, we can just speculate.”

Whatever happened, Twitter must be completely candid about the cause of attack once it’s established, Tobac said. “This was such a public meltdown that if they’re not completely transparent it would damage their brand further.”

British Columbia’s minister of advanced education has announced new supports for post-secondary students, including expanded online resources and funding to help students with disabilities.

Melanie Mark says $1.5 million will be distributed equally between 20 public post-secondary schools to strengthen supports for students with cognitive, mental health or physical disabilities.

She says the province is investing $275,000 in the new BCcampus website to further develop online resources and tools focused on well-being for students, staff and faculty.

The resources include videos and webinars on topics such as adapting to online learning, stress management and navigating financial supports.

Mark says the province is also providing another $400,000 to support the development of more resources covering a wide range of courses and subjects in B.C.’s growing open textbook collection.

The minister says students may also now apply to StudentAid BC to be automatically considered for a free access grant announced in this year’s provincial budget.

She says the grant means more than 40,000 eligible low- and middle-income students could receive up to $4,000 per year to help with costs associated with degree, diploma and certificate programs.

“This is double the funding and the number of students who were supported through grants under the former government,” Mark said at Camosun College on Wednesday.

The B.C. access grant is open to part-time students, she added.

The amount students receive would depend on their family income, the length of their program and whether it’s full or part time.

See familiar places with fresh eyes: book a foraging tour in Vancouver, hike to hidden lakes in Squamish, or take an Indigenous cultural tour in Whistler, for example.

Head on a Culinary Journey

Expand your repertoire of restaurants on a foodie quest. Richmond’s Dumpling Trail is a must-do for fans of juicy dumplings, wontons, and bao. Revisit your favourite Italian eateries on Commercial Drive, or cross the bridge to the North Shore’s Shipyards District and hop between up-and-coming breweries.

Plan a getaway in the Sea-to-Sky Corridor. Stop in Squamish for craft cider and casual al fresco dining. Whistler – celebrated for its lively après scene – is also a foodie haven. You can do it all: sip BC wines and slurp local oysters; tuck into decadent goodies at an artisan bakery; or sip hand-crafted cocktails. Take a food tasting tour for the full experience.

Pemberton’s farms-with-a-view offer a chance to get closer to your food than ever before. Pick fresh berries (don’t forget to snag the homemade pies and preserves), and stop by a local eatery for ingredient-driven fare.

Celebrate Art and Culture

Indigenous people have lived on this land since time immemorial and their influences are deeply woven into the cultural fabric, from sea to sky. Learn about the living culture through an Indigenous-led walking tour through Stanley Park.

There are many ways to discover (or rediscover) the rich culture and thriving art scene. Cycle through historic neighbourhoods like Gastown, hunt for colourful urban art in Mount Pleasant, and find secret coffee shops along South Granville. Or, visit one of many museums, galleries, and gardens for a moment of quiet reflection.

Gear Up for Adventure

Though Vancouver’s glittering skyscrapers inspired the nickname “City of Glass,” nature is still just around the bend. For every delicious meal savoured, there’s a bike trail to explore. For every art gallery visited, there’s a mountain to summit.

You’ve probably driven the winding Sea-to-Sky Highway to visit communities between West Vancouver and Pemberton before, but there are always new ways to experience old favourites. View the Sea-to-Sky’s volcanic peaks with a flightseeing tour, take a gondola to great heights in Squamish or Whistler, raft through voracious glacier-fed rivers, or trot through Pemberton meadows by horseback.

Squamish – typically known for mountain activities like rock climbing, hiking, and biking – is also a steppingstone to Howe Sound. Book a guided paddleboard tour or kiteboarding lesson to spend time in the fjord. Meanwhile, adventure-filled Whistler needs no introduction. BC residents and visitors alike enjoy alpine sightseeing, lift-accessed downhill riding, and lake exploration, among other activities.

BC’s West Coast is known the world over for its colourful patchwork of land- and seascapes, but how often do we experience this wild beauty for ourselves? This summer, rediscover the seaside communities you love and the reasons you love them — places like Gibsons and Telegraph Cove, with their laid-back culture, raw nature, ocean adventures, and wildlife sightings. You may just rediscover yourself along the way.

Whether you travel by floatplane or a ferry, a stunning journey is the icing on a decadent (coastal) cake.

Rugged Coastal Landscapes

No matter how many times you experience it, the dramatic coastal scenery stirs the soul. Capture a collage of moments: misty mornings overlooking rocky shores, dewy strolls through ancient rainforest, and sunset beach strolls, to name a few.

Depending on where you choose to explore, find the tranquility of protected waters or the energy of untamed surf beaches. The remote inlets and plunging fjords of the Sunshine Coast beckon to be explored by kayak, boat, or paddleboard. Tip: take a guided ocean tour to access little-known areas. Or, hop on the ferry to Campbell River on Vancouver Island, where you can head out with an experienced fishing charter and find out why it’s known as “the salmon capital of the world.”

On the mainland, enjoy peek-a-boo views of the ocean as you hike along the Sunshine Coast Trail among towering giants shrouded in lichen. On Vancouver Island, explore the coast along the Juan de Fuca Provincial Park in the south or stroll the eastern shores of Rathtrevor Beach Provincial Park near Parksville.

Laid-back West Coast Culture

Celebrate a world of contrast, from sleepy seaside towns to buzzing cities. With every visit to the coast, you’ll discover a new gem — a funky coffee shop, a new brewery, a colourful art gallery, or a beachy boutique selling locally-made artisan goods.

The burgeoning coastal culinary scene isn’t just reserved for cities like Victoria and Nanaimo. Head on a foodie adventure to the Cowichan Valley or Salt Spring Island to sample farm-fresh ingredients and craft provisions. Or, try Indigenous-inspired cuisine in Port Hardy.

Lively Resident Wildlife

If you haven’t had a chance to experience the wilder side of BC’s coast, there’s still time. Take a whale-watching tour to see orcas surge through calm waters and listen to the cacophony of sea lions shouting from their rocky perches. On shore, you might glimpse grizzlies, black bears, wolves, and deer as they slink across the land.

Venture on a cultural wildlife tour with an Indigenous guide to gain a deeper connection to the coast and the First Nations people who have been stewards of this land for thousands of years.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darryl Dyck

Twenty-one British Columbians have tested positive for COVID-19 in the last 24 hours, health officials have confirmed.

In a joint-statement released Wednesday afternoon (July 15), provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix said that two of the new test-positive cases are epi-linked, which means the person did not test positive for the virus but displayed some symptoms after being in close contact with an infected person or work in a facility with a known outbreak.

This brings the total number of active confirmed infections to 207. Fourteen people remain in hospital, five of those in intensive care. No new deaths have been reported since Monday, leaving the total at 189 fatalities.

ALSO READ: COVID-19 cases at Oliver farm likely linked to Kelowna outbreak, says Interior Health

Most of the new cases in the past several days – which fall within the incubation period correlating to the start of Phase Three in B.C.’s reopening plan – have been linked to exposures within the broader community. That’s compared to the beginning of the pandemic, when much of the cases were linked to health-care facility outbreaks.

On Tuesday, Henry said that while it is somewhat expected that daily case totals increase as people venture into public spaces more frequently, she is concerned with how many new cases are being recorded as the virus “silently circulates.”

Similar messaging was reiterated Wednesday.

“No one wants to get sick with COVID-19, nor do we want to inadvertently pass it onto others. While the symptoms can be mild, it is a complex illness that has serious consequences,” the statement reads.

“Let’s enjoy the summer safely and continue to do all we can to protect our neighbours, our friends and our loved ones.”

More to come.

Jennifer Kuiken, with husband Eric, has started a petition urging the provincial government to assist with coverage for in vitro fertilization. (Submitted photo)

An Abbotsford woman has started a petition to get in vitro fertilization (IVF) covered – at least in part – by the provincial government.

Jennifer Kuiken said she started the petition due to the prohibitive costs of IVF – around $20,000 each time – for couples who are having difficulty conceiving.

She said she and her husband began trying to conceive a family in 2016, but due to abnormalities with the embryos/fetuses, they have suffered through six miscarriages.

“Recently, we’ve had to explore other avenues in hopes of becoming parents,” Kuiken said.

She said this has had led to them considering private IVF. The couple are both employed, but neither of their extended medical plans nor the provincial Medical Services Plan cover any of the costs.

ALSO READ: In limbo: Leftover embryos challenge clinics, couples

Kuiken’s petition on change.org has so far reached almost 1,800 signatures towards her goal of 2,500.

Her petition states that one in six couples experience difficulties conceiving, and most are not financially able to consider IVF.

“Because of the lack of support from our government, IVF has become big business, and B.C. couples like us are travelling to find access to affordable IFV solutions every day,” the petition states.

Kuiken said the World Health Organization recognizes infertility as a medical condition, and four other provinces – Manitoba, New Brunswick, Ontario and Quebec – offer government support for IVF.

She would like coverage to extend to B.C. and, eventually, all of Canada.

“Not everyone wants to be a parent, but those who do should have access and options available,” Kuiken states.

Summerland mayor Toni Boot hopes the community will be able to have conversations about racism after graffiti containing racist symbols was spray painted on a local residence.

The vandalism, left at the home of an Indo-Canadian family on the evening of July 13, included swastikas. Racist graffiti was also left at the bandshell in Memorial Park.

“It will forever be a fact that this family had to endure this violation and this vandalism,” she said.

READ ALSO: RCMP to investigate hate-motivated vandalism in Summerland

Boot, Summerland’s first Black mayor, said the incident is a hate crime and is being treated as such by the Summerland RCMP.

While the graffiti was left on the home of one family, Boot said its message goes much farther.

“It was also targeting all Indo-Canadians and all people of colour. It has impacted everyone in our town.”

This is not the first-time expressions of racism have occurred in Summerland.

In October 2014, when Boot was running for a seat on Summerland’s municipal council, her business sign was defaced with racist and sexist slurs.

There have also been comments targeting visible minorities, as well as other incidents of racist symbols. One of the most recent was that of a vehicle sporting a Confederate battle flag. The flag is often associated with anti-Black racism.

“We need to stop feeling shocked every time it happens,” Boot said of expressions of racism and hate.

“Summerland, just like every other town, has underlying racism. We all have biases. Let’s all do a self-check. We are part of the solution in this not happening again.”

She is asking for a community conversation, not led by the municipal council, to address racism and hate within the community.

At the same time, many in the community have offered to help the family repaint their home following the incident.

Boot, who has been in contact with the family, said they appreciate the gesture.

However, they, their family and members of the Indo-Canadian community in Summerland have chosen to repair the damage and paint over the graffiti themselves.

The province has reached a proposed settlement with more than 100 alleged victims of a former Kelowna social worker that could cost up to $15 million.

B.C. Supreme Court documents filed Tuesday, July 15, identified 107 potential victims who were overseen by Robert Riley Saunders while he was in a guardianship role with the Ministry of Children and Family Development. Ninety of those alleged victims are believed to be Indigenous. Two are dead and four have settled in separation actions.

Saunders was hired by the ministry in 1996 and transferred to Kelowna in 2001. He was fired in 2018.

Dozens of allegations against Saunders have come to light in the past few years through various civil claims. He is accused of misappropriating funds of children in his care through the use of joint bank accounts and plunging several of his clients into lives of addiction, homelessness and abuse.

READ MORE: More allegations against second social worker accused of abusing the trust of Okanagan youth

The settlement will see each of the 102 class members receive $25,000, with an additional $44,000 provided to Indigenous clients. On top of that, clients could apply for additional funds if they suffered sexual exploitation ($75,000), psychological harm ($45,000), homelessness ($25,000), educational delay ($50,000 over 3 years; $20,000 1-3 years) and bodily harm ($15,000). The maximum settlement any one of Saunders’ former clients could receive is $250,000.

Jason Gratl, the lawyer for the plaintiff, said the total compensation could come out between $12 million and $15 million. Gratl also mentioned the allegations date back to 2001 and there may be more children involved. But poor or false records were kept.

“The records created by Riley Sanders tended to be false and self-serving because Riley Saunders was known to be a con-artist and a self-serving fraudster,” Gratl said in an interview Wednesday.

He said employment records show that Saunders was insensitive to Aboriginal culture and history, yet he was assigned to work with high-risk Indigenous children by the ministry.

The ministry wasn’t immediately available for comment and Saunders has never commented on the allegations or filed a statement of defence in court.

In its reply to the lawsuit filed in court, the ministry admitted to “vicarious liability” for the acts and omissions of Saunders.

The reply said the ministry detected financial irregularities involving Saunders in December 2017 and he was suspended a month later.

“Steps were taken under the direction of the local (ministry) office to ensure the immediate safety and well-being of the children, youth and young adults on the caseload of Mr. Saunders,” stated the response to the civil claim.

The prosecution service said it has received a report on Saunders from the RCMP and possible charges are being assessed.

Two lawsuits filed against the province and Saunders in 2018, alleged Saunders moved the children from their homes in order to make them eligible for financial benefits from the ministry, then opened joint bank accounts for each youth.

“Saunders stole the funds deposited by the ministry into joint bank accounts by moving them to his own individual account at Interior Savings and by paying his personal expenses by electronic transfer from the joint bank account,” the statements said.

They also alleged Saunders was aware of the youths’ vulnerability and aware that he exercised parental control over them

After the allegations against Saunders became public, he disappeared from Kelowna. He has never been served with any of the dozens of civil suits he is facing.

Gratl said Saunders was recently believed to be working at a golf resort in Alberta.

A certification hearing for the class action is scheduled for July 28. If approved, it would allow an individual’s case to stand in for all the class members.

A decision from the court on approval of the settlement is expected after the certification hearing.

The province has launched its own suit against Saunders to recuperate some of its lost funds.

A former Canadian Football League player was sentenced Wednesday to three months in prison for hiring someone take the SATs in place of his two sons, while a California mother got five weeks behind bars for paying $9,000 to have online classes taken on her son’s behalf.

David Sidoo, who played professional football for the Saskatchewan Roughriders and BC Lions, lowered his head into his hands and cried as U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton chided him for his actions. Sidoo told the judge he’s “deeply ashamed.”

“I make no excuses. I broke the law. I pled guilty to a crime and now I must pay for my actions,” Sidoo said.

Earlier Wednesday, Karen Littlefair of Newport Beach, California, asked U.S District Judge Allison Burroughs for leniency before being sentenced to more than a month in prison for the online course scam. Littlefair said she was “truly sorry” and called the experience a “nightmare” for her family.

“I acted out of love for my son but I ended up hurting my son greatly,” said Littlefair, 57.

Both Sidoo and Littlefair appeared before the Boston federal court judges via videoconference because of the coronavirus pandemic.

They are among more than 50 people charged in the college cheating scheme involving wealthy parents and athletic coaches at elite universities across the country. Authorities say the parents worked with the admissions consultant at the centre of the scam, Rick Singer, to have someone cheat on their kids’ exams or get them admitted to selective schools with fake athletic credentials.

Sidoo was CEO of mining firm Advantage Lithium Corp. when he was arrested last year. He was also a founding shareholder of an oil and gas company that was sold in 2010 for more than $600 million.

The Vancouver businessman paid Singer $200,000 to have someone pose as his sons using a fake ID to secure higher scores on their SATs, prosecutors said. Sidoo also worked with Singer to craft an admission essay for his son with a bogus story about the teen being held at gunpoint by Los Angeles gang members and saved by a rival gang member named “Nugget,” prosecutors said.

After Littlefair’s son was put on academic probation by Georgetown University, she hired Singer’s company to take four online classes on his behalf so he could graduate in 2018, prosecutors said. Three of the courses were taken through Georgetown, prosecutors said, while one was taken online at Arizona State University and then transferred to Georgetown.

Littlefair demanded a discount on the cheating after the person earned a C in one of the courses, authorities said.

“Kind of thought there would have been a discount on that one. The grade was a C and the experience was a nightmare,” she told Singer’s accountant in an email, according to court documents.

Burroughs told Littlefair she taught her son “it’s OK to cheat, it’s OK to take shortcuts.”

“You’re supposed to get more by earning it and working for it and I think that’s a lesson your son needs to learn and sadly he’s going to learn it the hard way here,” the judge said.

Nearly 30 parents have pleaded guilty in the case.

Others include “Full House” actor Lori Loughlin and her fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli, who admitted to paying half a million dollars to get their two daughters into the University of Southern California as fake crew recruits.

They are scheduled to be sentenced next month. If the judge accepts their plea deals, Loughlin will be sentenced to two months in prison and Giannulli will be sentenced to five months.

RCMP are searching for the culprit behind needle-filled lemons left on Coquitlam-area trails in June and July 2020. (RCMP handout)

Two lemons full of sewing needles have been found alongside trails in Port Coquitlam, sparking an investigation by RCMP.

Local Mounties are urging anyone who walks in the area around Gates Park and the Coquitlam River to stay alert, call police directly if they find another lemon and avoid throwing the evidence in the garbage.

According to a news release on Wednesday (July 15), the first lemon was found hung from a branch in Gates Park on June 22.

The second lemon was found on July 14 tied near a trail by the Coquitlam River at Whyte Avenue.

Both instances were reported through emails to the city and RCMP.

“If you see something that could be a deliberate attempt at harm, you must call police on the phone rather than send an email,” said Cpl. Michael McLaughlin.

“Both of these lemons were thrown into the garbage by the people who found them. By the time police received the emails, the evidence was gone and an investigation was virtually impossible.”

Police aren’t entirely sure if the lemons were left to intentionally hurt someone, as its believed by some that citrus can act as a repellant of mosquitoes.

ALSO READ: ‘Perfect storm’ led to bad year for mosquitos in Fraser Valley

McLaughlin also had a message for the culprit: “If you are leaving these lemons full of needles in public, we ask that you stop, and then talk to us to explain what you were doing.”

Anyone with information is asked to call Coquitlam RCMP at 604-945-1550, or call 911 if someone is placing needle-laden lemons right in front of you.

B.C.’s SoundON initiative aims to “celebrate the power of live music” and assist those in an industry hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Billed as the first project of its kind in Canada, SoundON “brings together industry members from across the province with one common goal – to bring the province’s vibrant music industry back to life,” according to an announcement June 29.

First up is a Blueprint company-presented “FVDED Broadcast” on Saturday (July 18) from Celebrities nightclub in Vancouver, featuring music by BBNO$, Felix Cartal & Lights, Snotty Nose Rez Kids and others, with both in-person and online viewing from 6 to 10 p.m.

“All funds raised will go to supporting Hogan’s Alley, the BC Civil Liberties Association, Urban Native Youth Association (UNYA), the Greater Vancouver & Surrey Food Banks, and future SoundON shows,” notes a post at soundon.ca/fvded.

There will be a limited number of RSVP tickets available, and donations will be collected at the door. Groups of no more than six people will be admitted.

“Between the shows, you’ll be able to watch interviews and stories, with and by charity and community leaders, to raise awareness on the impact and issues around racism, civil liberties and mental health on our industry.”

Blueprint and Live Nation say they will donate $15,000 to the charity drive, with a goal of an additional $25,000 in audience donations.

The music industry in B.C. was among the first sectors to shut down due to COVID, and will be among the last to reopen.

The scenario is predicted to create “devastating consequences for the industry,” according to SoundOn planners. “Without immediate action, more than 90 per cent of Canadian independent music venues are anticipated to permanently close within the next six months.”

In early July, this year’s FVDED in the Park festival was to feature Flume, G-Eazy and Illenium as headliners at Holland Park, but the event was cancelled for 2020 and shifted to dates in 2021.

The website SoundON.ca will fund and stream “uniquely curated content through the lens of festivals and presenters,” with the help of public funding, corporate sponsors and individual donors.

The goal is to put economic flow back into the industry.

“This will allow people to return to work as soon as possible,” organizers of the initiative say, “while sparking hope for those affected by the pandemic. The website also provides music lovers worldwide a whole new way to discover music in B.C. Amazing shows from across our province will be featured, all on one free website.”

Bands and solo artists can apply to curate shows that will be streamed on SoundON.ca.

Upcoming events include a New Forms Digital showcase on July 26, a Lightning Dust performance from Vancouver Island on July 24 and a “Symphonic Pride” concert featuring Vancouver Symphony Orchestra on July 31.

An anticipated 100 shows will be produced. While shows will be free to watch on SoundON.ca, donations will be encouraged to help fund the project.

SoundOn is presented in part with initial funding from Creative BC, the Province of British Columbia, corporate sponsors and private funders.

“This is a tale of resiliency and one we’re excited to share with British Columbia,” said Eduardo Ottoni, Producer of SoundON. “Music and gathering are at the heart of every vibrant culture, and something that gives joy to so many people. The pandemic has not only had a devastating economic impact, but an emotional one. Our aim is to be a beacon of resilience during the pandemic and beyond.”

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on the once effervescent music industry in B.C., says Lindsay MacPherson, executive director of Music BC.

“It is a pain that has been felt by so many, especially those working in arts and culture,” MacPherson said. “A group of leaders from across the industry have come together to collaborate on a way to bring back life to the sector. We have everyone from city officials, promoters, presenters, venues, production, and artists working on the project. Our aim is to be highly collaborative, in an unprecedented way, to bring our beloved industry back.”

Backers include Vancouver-based musician Dan Mangan, co-founder of Side Door.

“The open-minded and intersectional approach that SoundON is undertaking is innovative and inspiring — bridging public, private, and philanthropic stakeholders, building community and keeping the creative community afloat.

“At Side Door, we are beyond proud to have paid out nearly $250K to artists for their online shows since the pandemic started, and even more proud to witness the human connection our interactive online approach has provided to artists and audiences alike. We are thrilled to help SoundON fulfill their mission and keep art thriving during the pandemic.”

(GoFundMe)

A GoFundMe campaign has been started for a man who was found dead along a popular hiking trail in Lake Country on June 16.

The man in his 30s has since been identified as actor Josiah Black, best known for his role in Jigsaw – a 2017 Hollywood film in the Saw franchise.

“It is with a heavy heart that I write, on Monday, June 15, 2020, Josiah Black passed away suddenly and unexpectedly,” fundraiser organizer Jeremiah Black wrote, of the man found at Spion Kop Summit just after 9 a.m., June 16.

He leaves behind his wife, Alicia, and 16-month-old daughter “with another little boy or girl on the way,” the campaign reads.

“Josiah was loved and remembered by many as being a caring, loving father, husband, brother, son and friend to everyone who he came across,” the fundraiser reads. “During Josiah’s final days, he loved spending time outdoors, gardening, reflecting on the words of God, playing with his family, working on his classic VW Westfalia vans and writing through many facets.”

Black had a successful career in acting and stand-up comedy that brought him across North America from Vancouver to Los Angeles.

The GoFundMe campaign, launched June 22, has a $250,000 goal to “offer support, show love and offer encouragement to Josiah’s wife, baby and baby on the way during this difficult and uncertain time.”

“All of the funds dedicated in his name through this page will be offered directly to his family to help them with living expenses in the coming days, weeks, months and years,” Jeremiah Black wrote. “It’s my hope that they will be able to afford a safe home near to family if needed and have enough to put into a college fund for his kids.”

So far, nearly $20,000 has been raised in honour of Black.

Matty Vu says he’s in no rush to again perform comedy in a club or other venue, given COVID-19 concerns, and that’s fine because his latest endeavour seems like a perfect fit for the pandemic.

The Surrey-raised Vu is among 12 up-and-coming Canadian comics featured in The New Wave of Standup series launching Friday, July 17 on the free CBC Gem streaming service.

The 10-minute sets were filmed last February during JFL NorthWest, Vancouver’s Just for Laughs comedy festival.

“I haven’t seen the footage yet, so I might be terrible and have no idea,” said the soft-spoken Vu. “I’m not even sure I’ll watch it, because I hate watching videos of myself. But I hope people watch it, and when the time comes I hope they come out to live shows because there’s no better experience than a live comedy show.”

CLICK HERE to see the show trailer.

The Edmonton-born Vu, 34, grew up in Whalley and went to Holy Cross Regional High School before studying criminology at Kwantlen Polytechnic University. He now lives in East Vancouver.

“Lover of cross stitching and the Fast and the Furious movie franchise, Matty’s ‘comedy’ style is just as indiscriminate,” a bio proclaims. “Honestly, he’s just trying his best, and hopes you are happy with it.”

Vu said he discovered a passion for performing comedy about five years ago, and has since collected video and audio clips to post at themattyvu.com.

“I signed up for a standup class one night when I was, like, drinking and online shopping, and then I just advanced from there,” he recalled. “I had fun in the class and kept going. I had full intent of just doing the class, and that’d be it… It was something I’d never felt or experienced before. Like, I never did drama in school or anything. My friends weren’t really surprised because I always joked around a lot, but they were more surprised that I was OK in front of a crowd. That’s scary for a lot of people, public speaking.”

Comedy is a side gig for Vu, who is employed in a job related to his criminology studies.

“It’s one of those things I never talk about in comedy,” Vu said. “It’s very separate. And at work I didn’t tell people about my comedy for years. They know now, now that more public things have been happening.”

(Story continues below video)

Last summer, Vu was a semi-finalist in SiriusXM’s Top Comic competition. He didn’t earn enough online votes to win, but the experience validated his decision to enter the world of comedy.

“Sometimes I feel like I don’t belong in comedy, don’t know why – it’s like that fraud complex,” he admitted.

“I love it, it’s great,” Vu added. “I get to interact with a bunch of people, make them laugh and bring joy, hopefully.”

Vu produces the comedy shows “Bloodfeud: Standup vs. Improv” and “Craft and the Furious” at Little Mountain Gallery, and also “Yellow Fever: A Comedy Show,” described as “Vancouver’s only comedy show by Asians for non-Asians (and also Asians). The show aims to break stereotypes and highlight comedy and culture.

“I’ve done shows for five years and the majority of the audiences have not been very diverse,” Vu said. “In a city that has a lot of Asian people in it, it’s weird to see audiences with just white people. There really aren’t a lot of comedy performers of colour, of Asian background, so I kind of wanted to highlight those people. I didn’t expect a lot of Asian people to come out, but it was very nice for that to happen.”

Like with other performing arts, comedy shows have been put on hold during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“There are a couple (venues) doing comedy shows again, but I am still very uncomfortable being in a crowded room, so I have no interest in doing that right now,” Vu explained. “I’ve done a few online shows — not Zoom shows but more like a friend recording me in a park and me performing to my one friend recording. That’s still fun.

“I’m OK not performing until the fall, and even if there’s a second wave or whatever, I’m OK taking a step back for even a year,” Vu added. “I’m cool with that. Maybe there’s some Catholic guilt too, about not wanting to get other people sick.”

For now, online showcases like the CBC Gem series will have to do for Vu.

“It’s a diverse group of people, which I love,” he said about the series. “That night was so much fun. There were two shows back to back. I was first in the lineup and I was very nervous, I remember that.”

In addition to Vu, the series also features Salma Hindy (“a Muslim comic from Toronto who also happens to be a biomedical engineer,” according to a news release), Yumi Nagashima (“who arrived in Vancouver by way of Tokyo”), Paul Rabliauskus (“from Poplar River First Nation Reserve in Manitoba”), Al Val (“a bold transgender comic from Toronto”), Ola Dada (“a Nigerian-Canadian raised in Fort McMurray, Alberta”), Toronto’s Cassie Cao (“a former economist turned stand-up comedian”), Vancouver’s Aaron Read (“who won JFL NorthWest’s ‘Breakout Artist of the Year’”), Calgary’s Brett Forte (“who is upset with his Millennial generation…and thinks audiences should be too”), Calgary’s Brittany Lyseng (“who swapped her elevator mechanic job for the comedy spotlight”), Vancouver standup and cartoonist Jacob Samuel and Toronto’s Kyle Brownrigg (“who was the first gay male to be awarded ‘Best Breakout Artist’ at the Canadian Comedy Awards”).

(Photo: facebook.com/GreaterVanFoodTruckFest)

A “Drive Thru Food Truck Festival” is coming to Cloverdale Fairgrounds.

The two-day event will be hosted by Greater Vancouver Food Truck Festival on the weekend of July 18-19, from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily. Admission is free.

“We’re featuring seven of your favourite food trucks and one heck of a good time,” event organizers say in a Facebook post.

The venue is on 62A Avenue, under the wooden arches by the rec centre, off 176th Street.

The Saturday lineup of vendors will include Tin Lizzy Concessions (mini doughnuts), Mo-Bacon, Holi Masala, Lenny’s Lemons, Next Gen. Concessions (“street dogs,” fries and poutine), Ford Concessions (Steve O’s Fried Chicken) and Betty’s Greek Honey Ballz (loukoumades).

On the Sunday, vendors are Rocky Point Ice Cream, REEL Mac And Cheese, Wings Tap And Grill, Next Gen. Concessions (funnel cakes), The Truckin’ BBQ, Ford Concessions (Los Tacos Hermanos) and Lenny’s Lemons Less.

Presented by Coast Capital Savings, similar drive-through events were held at sites in Abbotsford and Langley in June, and another is planned in Chilliwack.

(Story continues below)

Festival owner/operator Jason Faria said signage directs guests to the main parking lots on site, and are then directed to the lineup of their choice. Patrons order from the food truck, and a person wearing personal protective equipment will collect their payment.

Customers will then exit the parking lot. There will not be any on-site seating, and tailgate parties aren’t permitted.

Menus and more details are posted to greatervanfoodtruckfest.com.

The Greater Vancouver Food Truck Festival (GVFTF) is billed as “the largest roaming food truck festival in Canada.”

A Thanksgiving tradition that draws tens of thousands of Lower Mainland residents to Fort Langley every fall has been cancelled due to COVID.

Fort Langley’s 25th annual Cranberry Festival – always held on the Saturday of the Thanksgiving Day weekend in October – will not happen as a direct result of the pandemic, said Meghan Neufeld, the former festival coordinator and Fort Langley Business Improvement Area board member.

RELATED – VIDEO: Fort Langley Cranberry Festival rated a ‘huge success’

“This year’s Fort Langley Cranberry Festival was to take place on Saturday, Oct. 10 and would have been the festival’s 25th annual celebration,” she explained.

“Unfortunately, the desire to host the festival, even in an alternate-capacity, did not outweigh the need for public safety and regulatory compliance,” Neufeld said, acknowledging that the streets of Fort Langley are usually packed, shoulder to shoulder with festival goers for the one-day event.

Due to the restrictions on gathering sizes limiting both the number of people and number of vehicles, the BIA directors made what she described as “the difficult decision to not proceed with the festival this year.”

The Fort Langley Cranberry Festival has been running since 1996 and has grown into a highly anticipated event of significant size – with more than 60,000 people visiting the village each year for the scheduled festivities.

“While it is disappointing that the event cannot happen this year, the Fort Langley BIA has high hopes that the village will celebrate the festival’s 25th anniversary in 2021,” Neufeld said, encouraging the public to still visit Fort Langley and “explore all it has to offer.”

A controversial mega-mansion in Richmond could be yours – for the price of nearly $22 million, or $1 million per thousand square feet.

The mansion, which was officially listed on Friday (July 10), features nine bedrooms and 11 bathrooms and is located on a 10-acre property at 9431 No. 6 Road.

The extremely large home is one of the last mega-mansions legally built in B.C. In 2018, the provincial government passed legislation that bans the building of houses larger than 20,000 square feet on Agricultural Land Reserve, instead capping homes to less than about 5,400 square feet.

Inside, the home includes a series of chandeliers, a media room and gym. In the back yard, it also features a large chess board and seating area surrounded by a fountain pond.

On Wednesday, the Bank of Canada said in a monthly outlook report that the pandemic is expected to slow housing activity over the next few years with the ripple effects of the country’s economic downturn, as well as lower immigration.

In B.C., home sales and prices have started to rise in the face of the pandemic. BCREA chief economist Brendon Ogmundson said in a news release on Tuesday that the average price for a single-detached home was roughly $748,000 – up slightly from the $729,000 in May and a 9.1 per cent increase from June of last year.

“Sales around the province surged back to pre-COVID-19 levels in June,” Ogmundson said.

“While there are some temporary factors that may have pushed demand forward, we are cautiously optimistic that market activity will remain firm.”

A portrait by Pablo Picasso is among the artworks on offer at Heffel Fine Art Auction House’s virtual sale tonight.

Heffel says “Tete de femme,” an oil-on-canvas painted by Picasso in 1939, could fetch between $1.2 million and $1.6 million.

It’s one of 112 lots open for bids at the Toronto auction house’s spring sale, which was originally scheduled for May, but was postponed because of COVID-19 concerns.

Heffel says it’s recreating the real-time excitement of an in-person auction with its new live online bidding system. Prospective buyers can also place bids by phone, or can submit their offers before the sale starts.

Highlights include Canadian artist Alex Colville’s 1976 painting “Dog and Bridge,” which is expected to hammer down for between $800,000 and $1.2 million.

A triptych from abstract expressionist Joan Mitchell will also hit the auction block with an estimated price tag of $400,000 to $600,000.

The catalogue also features seven works from Quebec automatiste painter Jean-Paul Riopelle, including the nine-foot canvas “Le reveil,” which is estimated to be worth $1 million to $1.5 million.

Heffel is also selling several works from the Group of Seven and associated artists.

Lawren Harris’s ”North Shore, Lake Superior III” was stowed away among a late Canadian-born painter’s possessions for decades, says Heffel. But after being uncovered by relatives earlier this year, the sketch is on sale for a pre-auction estimate of $125,000 to $175,000.

Among three works on offer from Emily Carr is the 1929 canvas “Forest Interior,” which has been valued at $150,000 to $200,000.

Heffel says buyers will also have a rare chance to bid on one of Yvonne Housser’s portrayals of Cobalt, Ont. The auction house pegs the painting’s pricetag at $30,000 to $50,000.

(YouTube capture)

Alex Johnson wants to give someone $1,000.

The Langley resident and W.J. Mouat Secondary School grad revealed his plans to create a treasure hunt to find the money spanning throughout the Lower Mainland and Fraser Valley earlier this month.

Clues will be presented on his social media channels weekly before hopefully someone cracks the case.

Johnson, known as “mrtoucan2” online, said he simply wants to help someone out and give people something fun to do during the pandemic.

“I haven’t actually lost my job due to the pandemic and my wife just got an internship and she’s making money so we just wanted to share some of that because we’re so fortunate right now,” he said, noting he works in construction. “And I wanted to give the money away in a fun and creative way.”

He said he and his wife have been saving up for many months to put this plan into effect.

But he admitted part of the plan is to help build his social media following. His Twitch channel, where he will be announcing clues live on Saturday, currently has 67 followers. Johnson said he’s hoping to build a fun and interactive community on his channel for people who enjoy video games and being interactive.

Those who are unable to catch his Twitch stream for the clue can also visit his YouTube, Twitter, or Facebook accounts to receive the clue. Those will be shared on those social media platforms on Monday. The location of the money is an unknown location in either the Lower Mainland or the Fraser Valley.

Johnson said the clues will continue for the next three weeks, with some lucky person hopefully figuring out the location of the money by then. He said if the contest is a success there will be other treasure hunts with possibly more money to be found.

“If my Twitch stream and YouTube channel grow then I’ll be able to do more events like this where I can potentially give away more money,” he said.

He added that he is proud that all his content is family friendly and people of all ages can watch all of his streams and also participate in the treasure hunt for $1,000.

A coastal haven owned by the family of ’90s TV star is up for grabs on Vancouver Island.

Terrace Beach Resort, a commercial offering of 21 suites and cabins next to Ucluelet’s world-famous Wild Pacific Trail, was recently listed for $4,495,000.

The Priestley Family — Norma, Lorne and son Jason of Beverly Hills 90210 fame — have been welcoming guests to their vacationer’s oasis for the past 20 years.

“We are selling for simple reasons. We are getting older. Retirement age of 65 is long past,” said Lorne and Norma Priestley in an email to the VI Free Daily.

RELATED: West Coast resorts cautiously prepare to welcome tourists again

Port Alberni-based realtor Dave Koszegi is working with the Priestleys to find the right buyer.

“There is nothing available like it. It’s super unique and it has an interesting storyline with celebrity ownership and stuff,” said Koszegi. Jason Priestley became a teen heart-throb playing the character Brandon Walsh on Beverly Hills 90210.

Koszegi says he’s had a fair bit of interest in the property despite the challenges presented by COVID-19.

“It’s well-priced,” he said. “The inquiries that we’ve had, there have been a few investor/developer type people where normally they’d buy a resort and then strata title it and then split it up and sell it off, well [Terrace Beach Resort] is already strata titled.”

BC Assessment as of July 1, 2020 shows an increase to the value of each strata unit. ‘Unit One’ was valued at $510,000—previous year value was $463,000—for example, and ‘Unit Two’ was valued at $123,000—previous year value was $112,500.

Constructed in 1999, Terrace Beach Resort is designed to resemble a 1920 fishing village: the central building that houses the main office is built on pilings, with boardwalks that meander the majestic trees to adjoining beachfront cottages. Suites are fully-equipped kitchenettes and many have private decks with hot tubs.

Koszegi said the vacation property has been a popular and well-enjoyed spot.

“Anything on the West Coast, it feels like the day you build it nature is taking it back. I mean, it could use some upgrades,” he said.

Nonetheless, Koszegi adds that owning a resort in Ucluelet is a “world-class opportunity”.

“It’s so international. Europeans will come in the offseason. It’s a small little hideaway place with international draw and that’s the magic there. It’s unlike anywhere else on the Island,” he said.

Randy Small photo.

A weather photographer captured Comet NEOWISE soaring across Abbotsford’s early-morning sky on July 11.

Randy Small was just north of Lynden in Washington State when he was able to photograph the comet heading northeast over the Abbotsford around 3:30 a.m.

Small, who said he had woken up a little before 3 a.m. hoping to witness the once-in-a-lifetime comet. He said he was almost next to the border when he spotted it.

“I didn’t see it at first with the naked eye, but I just shot northeast,” Small said. “As soon as I shot, my camera picked it up.”

The comet, formally known as C/2020 F3 (NEOWISE), was discovered this year on March 27 by the NEOWISE Space Telescope.

Comet NEOWISE is a retrograde comet, meaning it orbits around our solar system in the opposite direction of the rotational axis of the Sun and planets.

NASA says the comet is about five kilometres across, and its tail is caused by its very close orbit around the Sun, heating its outer-ice layers and releasing gas and dust in a tail of debris.

Comet NEOWISE is expected to remain visible to eyesight throughout July, and orbit closest to Earth on July 23 at a distance of 103 million kilometres away, according to NASA.

Small – a part-time landscape and weather photographer, and part-time storm-chasing news stringer – said he’s frequently up at dawn and dusk hours.

“I’ve shot probably 80 per cent of the sunrises and sunsets [since 2016]” he said. “I’m willing to get up early, or get up at midnight and do crazy stuff if something special like this is happening.”

Blue Grouse’s winemaker led the initiative, but it would not have been possible without the enthusiastic co-operation of every winery and grape grower in the valley (Citizen file)

Buyers across the province will soon be able to pick up a bottle of wine marked as from the Cowichan Valley thanks to a new sub-geographical designation now officially being recognized under B.C. law.

“Officially recognizing the Cowichan Valley as a distinct and unique wine grape-growing region in B.C. is a testament to the hard work, passion and dedication of the many local entrepreneurs and staff in the wine industry,” said Sonia Furstenau, MLA for Cowichan Valley. “This is a well-deserved accomplishment for all those involved in producing exceptional wines and memorable winery experiences.”

According to a press release issued Friday morning, “defining geographic zones on wine labels connects consumers with the unique geographic area the grapes are grown and the wine is made in and increases exposure to the region for both wine and tourism businesses.”

The Cowichan Valley sub-GI is roughly defined as the area between the Cowichan watershed, the eastern coastline from Mill Bay to Maple Bay and the western area of Cowichan Lake.

“The Cowichan is home to family-owned and operated wineries and grape growers who have been part of the valley for generations,” said Lana Popham, Minister of Agriculture. “They take pride in the wines they produce and recognizing their hard work, skills and growing reputation on the B.C. and international stage is overdue. They make great wine in the Cowichan from the grapes grown in the valley, and the designation both respects and promotes that.”

The Cowichan Valley has the honour of being the first sub-GI outside of the Okanagan and joins the Golden Mile Bench, Naramata Bench, Okanagan Falls and Skaha Bench in the Okanagan Valley.

“The newly announced Cowichan Valley sub-GI recognizes our unique terroir and solidifies Vancouver Island’s position as an up-and-coming wine destination,” said Blue Grouse Estate Winery owner Paul Brunner. “Bailey Williamson, Blue Grouse’s winemaker, led the initiative, but it would not have been possible without the enthusiastic co-operation of every winery and grape grower in the valley. We are proud to be part of such a cohesive group of wine lovers and look forward to being part of an exciting future.”

Tourism Cowichan’s Jill Nessell said now Cowichan can rightfully recognized as a top-quality wine-producing region.

“Wine enthusiasts can now add Cowichan as an area to explore wines produced with this unique terroir. While the award-winning wines and beautiful vineyards draw thousands of visitors to Cowichan every year, it is the extraordinary people behind the wines that create memorable wine-tasting and tour experiences for locals and visitors from across the globe,” she said.

It’s about time Cowichan is recognized for its efforts, said Miles Prodan, president of the BC Wine Institute.

“Having Cowichan Valley officially recognized as a distinct and unique wine grape growing region in B.C. is testament to the maturity of the wine growers and producers in the region,” he said. “To put it simply, when you now see Vancouver Island, Cowichan Valley, BC VQA (Vintners Quality Alliance) on a bottle, it is your guarantee that you’re sipping a wine that is 100% grown and made in this particular terroir of British Columbia.”

Brett Bacon says he was just trying to prove to his son that he’s cool.

The father from Calgary is turning heads online after saving a baby eagle from drowning in the middle of a lake in Windermere, roughly 125 kilometres north of Cranbrook.

The shocking incident happened on July 4, according to a video posted by Bacon on July 4.

The video – which has been viewed 10,000 times as of Friday afternoon – shows Bacon hanging over the side of the boat trying to pull the eagle from the water. After grabbing it, the bird attempts to fly away a few times but appears to be caught on Bacon’s shirt.

Bacon’s infant son is seen lying safely on a seat nearby.

In an interview with the New York Post, the father said he brought the eagle to dry land where it flew away and has since been taken to a wildlife rehabilitation facility.

Black Press Media has reached out to nearby conservation societies for an update on the eagle.

Eagles are known to be fairly good swimmers and have thick down feathers which allow for them to float, according to biologists. However, occassionally juvenile or older eagles can drown if they’re too far from shore or get caught on something.

When long-time chef Nicholas Waters first started Toque Catering in 2013, he never expected it to take off.

“To be honest, I thought I’d be doing one function a weekend,” he says with a laugh. “I didn’t think anything of it. Then all of a sudden, it turned into an animal.”

Toque grew from just five full-timers three years ago to a staff almost 30 strong today, and the wealth of talent in Nick’s kitchen is enviable.

“We run with 10 to 12 executive chefs full time in the kitchen,” he says. “It’s one of the best teams I’ve ever worked with.”

About the same time Toque took off, Nick relocated to Metchosin, and the locale has been ideal both personally and professionally.

“The bigger we’ve gotten, the more local we’ve become,” he says.

Toque is booked at least a year in advance, so Nick and his team have been able to approach local farmers well ahead of season to plan out orders, translating to reliable income for the small agriculture sector, as well as premium ingredients.

And though Nick says he doesn’t want to grow too big too fast, there are definitely some new and exciting directions coming down the pipe.

“Stay tuned!”

The 7 Sins

Envy:

Whose shoes would you like to walk in?

I am on my own journey in life and wouldn’t change a thing, good or bad, but I would love to be Michel Bras in Normandy, France for a day. He has been my favourite chef in the world since I was 18! His book is still better than most out there and it’s almost 20 years old.

Gluttony:

What is the food you could eat over and over again?

That is definitely a hard one, but I would say gyoza. No matter whether I’m at a pub, home or a high-end restaurant, 10 out of 10 times I will order it if it’s on the menu.

Greed:

You’re given $1 million that you have to spend selfishly. What would you spend it on?

I would travel all through Europe and eat and drink and just eat and drink until it was gone. Spain, Portugal, France, Italy — let’s face it, the money would be gone by then!

wrath:

Pet Peeves?

Everything, almost … but the freezers and coolers being a mess has to be the one that makes me think I’m going to have a heart attack.

sloth:

Where would you spend a long time doing nothing?

Spain.

Pride:

What is the one thing you’re secretly proud of?

It won’t be a secret anymore if I say this, but it would be the team — chefs, dishwashers, operations, planners, on-site service staff, rentals and anyone else I’m missing — and the culture we’ve been able to create at Toque. I am grateful every day that I get to work alongside a very, very talented group. I actually like working with them all and don’t have a bad thing to say. They’ve all become my family.

Lust:

What makes your heart beat faster?

Being on-site when shit hits the fan — like a barbecue falls off the top and an oven doesn’t work, etc. That shit turns me on when you come out of it unscathed and everything went perfectly, except your soul becomes a little darker!

I love the unknown and being able to make something out of nothing. The best was four or five years ago when the guys got me an Easy-Bake Oven for Christmas. They said, “Well, it’s on. Let’s see what you can do with this!’”

Discover glacial valleys, soaring mountain peaks, and wildlife parks – the kind of sweeping landscapes that adventurers aspire to witness.

Regardless of how far from home or enormous these parts may appear, the wilderness in BC’s north is as inviting as it is untamed. You’ll feel right at home when you arrive, and will leave with a new understanding of just how deep BC’s beautiful backyard goes.

Ways to Explore the Vast, Wild North

Tour by car or RV along key corridors like the scenic Route 16 through Smithers and Terrace, forest-lined Highway 37, or the historic Alaska Highway. Or, link them all for the ultimate northern circle route.

Edged by jaw-dropping scenery, Prince George is a great place to stay a few days and get a taste of life in the north. Meet the locals and enjoy a glass of fruit wine at BC’s northernmost winery; walk amongst 300-year-old black cottonwoods and view tree bark carvings in Cottonwood Island Park. Discover secluded waterways of the Omineca with a guided fishing charter.

For a more direct route from the south, fly direct to Terrace or Prince George.

Enjoy Heart-Pumping Adventures Along Route 16

Give your northern adventure a theme and go on a fishing, rafting, mountain biking, or hiking road trip along Route 16. Head west from Prince George and spend a few days in towns like Terrace, BC’s up-and-coming mountain biking hotspot. Set up a home base in Burns Lake or Smithers and explore the dozens of lakes and rivers in the area – full of healthy populations of rainbow trout and char, so don’t forget your fishing licence! Visit the Hazeltons and the ‘Ksan Historical Village, Campground and Museum to honour generations, past and present, and immerse yourself in 8,000-year-old Indigenous history.

Explore Big Nature East of the Rockies in “The Peace”

Carved by water and wind over thousands of years, mountain ranges give way to valleys and prairie skies east of the Rockies along the Alaska Highway (Highway 97) – an area affectionately dubbed “The Peace” by locals.

This historic route leads you to old settlements like Fort St. John and “Mile 0” of the Alaska Highway at Dawson Creek. Tumbler Ridge, one of only three Global Geoparks in North America, is another must-visit; see dinosaur trackways and fossils and appreciate just how far travel in BC can take us, in both space and through time. Continue onward to Fort Nelson and explore Stone Mountain and Northern Rocky Mountains provincial parks and make a stop at the picturesque Muncho Lake.

And that’s just the landscape. There is a rich history here, too, from the Indigenous peoples whose stories, traditions, and stewardship of the land span millennia, to the ranchers, gold prospectors, and adventurers who braved unknown wilderness to traverse rough terrain and uncharted waterways.

Challenge yourself to try something new and experience some of BC’s history this summer through guest ranch stays, cultural tours, museum visits, guided trips into the backcountry, and more.

Drive Through Historic Gold Rush Country

Follow in the footsteps of 1860s Gold Rush prospectors and see how the mighty Fraser River shaped life in these parts. From Kamloops, head west toward Lillooet and “Mile 0” of the historic Cariboo Wagon Road. Visit sites ranging from preserved road houses to ghost towns and connect with locals in small towns along the way. Travel as far as Barkerville Historic Town, which brings this era to life with a restored townsite and costumed interpreters, and en route discover a vital Indigenous culture that dates back thousands of years.

Stay at a Guest Ranch

If you’ve dreamed of long trail rides through peaceful pastures or into meadows bursting with wildflowers, consider a stay at one of BC’s many guest ranches, most of which are found in the Cariboo and Chilcotin. The quintessential guest ranch experience is, of course, riding the range, but when you need a break from the saddle, the possibilities are many. Whether you’re looking for a true cowboy experience (think: corralling livestock or mucking out stalls) or something a little less rugged (a day at the onsite spa, anyone?), you’ll find freedom and adventure in the wide-open spaces.

Cast a line in calm lakes and fast-moving rivers, hike into the mountains for expansive views, or stick close to the ranch – and to the cowboy theme – with wagon rides, lasso throwing, and, of course, tall tales around a campfire under a clear, starry sky.

Find Adventure in the Wild

With wide-open spaces come wide-open opportunities for adventure. The lakes and rivers of BC’s interior beckon with more places to fish than you can experience in a lifetime. There are calm waters for paddling – including multi-day wilderness canoe routes – and there are stretches of thrilling whitewater for adrenaline junkies. You can fly into the backcountry for some hardcore hiking and mountain biking from an alpine basecamp or saddle up for an off-the-grid horse-packing trip. Whichever option you choose, keep your camera close as you’re very likely to spot some of BC’s four-legged residents along the way.

Andrew Strain photo.

On the West Coast, we know that the province’s fertile valleys are ripe with, well, food and wine. But did you know that the area that stretches from the fields of the Fraser Valley to the vineyards of the Okanagan is also an ideal spot for outdoor play?

For every fresh peach that’s devoured, there’s an orchard to cycle through. For every Pinot that’s sipped, there’s a paddle that first needs to be dipped in a cool lake. So, embrace this delectable yin and yang, and rediscover your next great BC adventure.

Explore the Fraser Valley

In British Columbia, we’re blessed with natural settings that are as fruitful as they are beautiful. Rolling fields, vineyards, and wide-open spaces are all ready for exploration – and adventure.

A trip just east of the city to the Fraser Valley is the quickest way to immerse in farm life. Beginning in Langley, you can nibble your way from farm to farm to Abbotsford and beyond – all family-run operations that boast everything from fresh-from-the-garden fruits and vegetables to homemade waffles, ice creams, and ciders. Among the pretty landscapes and grazing cattle, you can ride the rapids during a river-rafting excursion or try your hand at catch-and-release sturgeon fishing near Chilliwack. To understand more about local Indigenous culture, opt for a guided tour of the area’s significant sites.

Road Trip to the Okanagan

There are many ways to journey to the Okanagan, and we know them all: the oft-travelled Highway 1; scenic Highway 7; Highway 5/Highway 97, a.k.a. “the fast route”; and Highway 3/Highway 97. But don’t rush along these corridors.

Fuel up at coffee shops and dig into some of the best home cooking anywhere at famed roadside diners in Hope. With bellies full, test your mettle on winding trails or seek out quiet spots at local green spaces. Pedal fast and furious at bike parks or visit historic ranches and outdoorsy resorts, and consider staying awhile.

Valley summers were made for places like Vaseux Lake. Grant Harder photo.

Enjoy Lakeside Adventure

Spend more than five minutes in BC’s sun-kissed Okanagan, and you know that wine touring, craft breweries, cideries, and meaderies are prime for summer visits. Also prime for warmer months? Hours spent on a boat, swims in hidden coves, and long, leisurely paddles with your pod.

Beyond the shorelines, explore the bucolic valleys and the sustainable agritourism that fuel this lakeside lifestyle. Try two-wheeling among the vineyards – a novel way to visit local wineries near Penticton. Hike the Okanagan’s many trails, discover local Indigenous culture near Osoyoos, or visit a family farm for homegrown treats. Another option? Take it all in from a patio at one of the region’s premier winery restaurants. Cheers to that!

As British Columbians, we seek solace in the mountains, humbled and exhilarated by their magnitude. In eastern BC, dramatic landscapes – with their towering peaks, plunging falls, and charming towns – help us connect with nature on a grand scale. This summer, discover larger-than-life mountains and outdoor adventure in places like Fernie, Revelstoke, and Valemount. While the journey may take longer, the experience will leave you awestruck.

Explore Dramatic Mountain Landscapes

Once you’ve been, you know. Mountain ranges in this part of BC are on a different scale. Even the most seasoned adventurist is speechless at the sight of the Rocky Mountains. Mount Robson Provincial Park, home to the largest peak in the Canadian Rockies, is a must-see.

This area is home to seven UNESCO-designated parks, including Mount Assiniboine Provincial Park. Explore the mountain ranges with a lift-accessed alpine hike, or plan a stay in a backcountry lodge surrounded by ancient peaks.

Tee time is served with spectacular mountain views from 25 championship courses in the Kootenays. Kari Medig photo. Kari Medig photo.

Enjoy Outdoor Adventures

If you love the outdoors, you may have already paid a visit to the Kootenays or Valemount for the abundance of activities. But, once is never enough. From hiking to biking, paddling to golfing, there’s plenty to keep you entertained.

With four lift-accessed bike parks (including Golden’s Kicking Horse Mountain Resort) and 600-plus trails, the Kootenays are a mountain biker’s paradise. Whether your ascent is lift- or leg-powered, you can conquer some of BC’s best-known bike trails, maneuvring through tight singletrack and wheeling through alpine wildflowers.

Paddle the calm waterways or navigate raging rapids. Kootenay Lake, home to the world’s largest trout species, is prime for fishing. Tip: hire a guide for insider knowledge. Meanwhile, tee time is served with spectacular mountain views when you golf at one of the 25 championship courses in the Kootenays.

Experience Authentic Mountain Culture

A trip to BC’s mountain towns, as wild and vibrant as the nature surrounding them, is a rite of passage for every British Columbian. Tucked into valleys, on shores of rivers, and along old railway routes, communities like Fernie and Cranbrook are pulsing with energy and entrepreneurial spirit. Spoiler alert: the vibe is infectious, if you haven’t already been.

As you may have observed, a feverish pursuit of outdoor activities and great coffee are common traits, but each town has its own personality and charm. Swing by a java joint, like Nelson’s Oso Negro, to find friendly faces and a laid-back vibe. Absorb the ethos of each place by visiting Indigenous-owned businesses, exploring historic attractions, popping into boutiques, and meeting interesting characters.

In the mountains, a day of adventure almost always ends with an après. Sip craft beer on a sun-drenched patio, and live like the locals do – if only for a short while.

If you love the style and colour of your kitchen cabinets, but hate their worn appearance, the solution may be easier and more affordable than you think!

Cabinet refinishing can return the look you love at a fraction of the time and cost of new cabinets, explains Tracy Booth, who has been professionally refinishing cabinets for more than 30 years.

“Are you wanting to spend $30,000 or are you wanting to spend $2,000?” asks Booth, owner of Gleam Guard Cabinet Refinishing, serving Greater Victoria and Vancouver Island.

While cabinets can go slightly lighter or darker, Booth emphasizes that his focus is on returning the cabinets to their original appearance, not changing their appearance.

“Wood has character and we want to preserve that character. Our goal is to restore, not change,” Booth says.“If areas have gotten dull or worn, we can fix that. That’s what makes us cabinet refinishers. A Gleam Guard trained professional can tint and make them look like new, which is a very technical skill.”

Technique and experience matters

The distinction is important, as refinishing – compared to simply painting or staining – takes a unique skillset. “It’s important people know that the person who is in their kitchen has the training to do the perfect matching,” notes Booth, whose Gleam Guard is BBB-accredited with an A+ rating.

“While we repaint painted cabinets; we do not paint brown cabinets white.”

To ensure the perfect, long-lasting finish, preparation is key. A Gleam Guard trained professional begins by prepping the surface with a vigorous clean, then professionally matching and applying the new colour. To complete the process, a wood floor finish is applied for a long-wearing result, protecting your cabinets from hazards such as water damage, grease and dust (with the added benefit of being easier to clean and maintain).

The entire dust-free process takes only a day or two, and there’s no need to unload your cabinets – easy!

Not just for kitchen cabinets … or wood

For those who’ve chosen a different material for their cabinets, you’ll find help here, too!

“We also do laminate refinishing – any product that your cabinets are made of, we can clean it and put a fresh finish on it,” Booth says.

In fact, all interior millwork can be refinished, so think beyond the kitchen to your built-in bookshelves, doors, windowsills, furniture and more.

To learn more, visit gleamguardcabinetrefinishing.ca. The Gleam Guard team is working during the current COVID precautions, taking steps to keep staff and clients safe, but for those who are self-isolating, Booth is happy to make appointments for later this summer.

The Sugar Lake Recreational Properties is your waterfront base for year-round adventures. The 66-lot shared interest lakefront development features 45 fully serviced RV lots and 20 cabin sites, all just steps from the beach and lake.

Summer is all about experiences we’ll share for years to come: Paddles on the lake, forest trails to explore and tall tales told around the campfire – maybe about the fish that got away that very afternoon!

The chance to write your summer story is here.

(And even better, you can add to it come fall and winter!)

Your story starts at Sugar Lake, just an hour east of Vernon and less than two hours’ drive from Kelowna – so easy to get to, but what a difference once you get here.

The Sugar Lake Recreational Properties is at the heart of lake life – your waterfront base for the adventures yet to come. The 66-lot shared interest lakefront development features 45 fully serviced RV lots and 20 cabin sites, all just steps from the beach and lake.

While other regions in the Okanagan and Shuswap can quickly get busy with boats, swimmers and other recreation enthusiasts, here you’ll enjoy many of the same opportunities, but away from the crowds, in your own piece of paradise. And if you simply want to share the sun with your go-to beach read, that’s just fine too!

Rounding out the amenities onsite are a new dock with boat slips available for lease, group picnic areas to share a meal with family and friends, and even an on-site guest lodge, with its own licensed, full-service bistro.

Of course, not all experiences are focused around the lake, so from Sugar Lake, it’s easy to turn the page and choose your own adventure.

Outdoor recreation opportunities take you off the lake and into thousands of hectares of forest begging to be explored. Cast your rod into nearby rivers and streams, or head to the hills of Silver Star, where summer and fall mountain biking gives way to winter skiing and snowshoeing.

Just 14 kilometres north, explore Cherryville, where recreation opportunities include bird watching, horseback tours, fishing and more in the foothills of the Monashee Mountains. Continue east to Monashee Provincial Park to enjoy spring wildflowers, hiking, fishing and some of the oldest rock formations in Western Canada.

And a little farther afield to Nakusp, experiences include inviting hot springs, a thriving local arts community and the waterfront walkway overlooking Upper Arrow Lake.

Ready to write your next chapter at Sugar Lake? Learn about vendor financing for your own carefully selected RV site or cabin, and about maximizing your investment with the option of renting out your site or cabin when you’re not using it. The management team can oversee all the details, and if you change your mind, withdrawing from the rental pool is just as easy.

COVID-19 continues to be tough on people. But it might be doing good things for the grizzly bears of B.C.’s central coast.

A positive outcome of the COVID-19 shutdown for the Klemtu-based Kitasoo-Xai’Xais First Nation, was the opportunity to study tourism’s impact on the grizzly bears in their region.

The Kitasoo-Xai’Xais reserve has maintained a shutdown since the pandemic began and will continue to do so until further notice. This gave the community the perfect chance to invest in a research program that could be conducted only in the absence of tourists.

Dr. Christina Service, the lead scientist in charge of the project with the Resource Stewardship Department of the Kitasoo-Xai’Xai Nation, was glad that they mobilized really quickly when the situation presented itself and deployed 40 infrared cameras which are triggered when the animals walk by.

“Since we’re not going to have tourism in the territory this year, it provided a remarkably unique situation where we could essentially study and take baseline conditions to see what these bears will do in the absence of tourism.”

The cameras will be taken down in October and the recordings will be used to analyze behaviour patterns and to get a sense of how the bears choose to spend their time in the absence of humans. The process will be repeated and cameras will be re-installed again in spring 2021, when hopefully tourism activity will have resumed again.

The results will then be compared to arrive at a sustainable management plan for a conservation-based economy for the community, said Service.

“So we’re looking at factors like ‘what areas should humans be restricted to that have the least impact on bears?’ Or, ‘what time of the day does tourism heavily impact bears?’ There will definitely be some interesting patterns to see.”

Since the research is spread over two years, Service said it will be a while before they have concrete answers. But the study will help provide the “best available information” to formulate a management plan.

The First Nation has seen increased pressure from tourism since the Great Bear Rainforest was established and visitors started coming to the territory to learn more. And though tourism opportunities are welcomed, the First Nation also indicated its desire to conserve the bears in their region.

Service commended the Kitasoo-Xai’Xais First Nation for their “interest, capacity and desire” to invest in such a research program, especially at a time when there’s so much uncertainty with the pandemic.

The province’s police watchdog is investigating after a man was seriously injured in late June after Abbotsford police officers shot him with a “less lethal firearm” and deployed a police dog.

The incident took place around 7:30 p.m. in the evening of June 28. Officers were called to a report of a man with a gun at a home in the 2000 block of West Railway Street, the APD told the Independent Investigations Office (IIO) – the public body tasked with probing police incidents in which someone is seriously hurt.

According to a release from the IIO: “Upon arrival, officers contained the area and engaged with the man. During the interaction, a less lethal firearm and police service dog were deployed, and the man was taken into custody.”

The IIO says the man was taken to hospital, where he was found to have sustained “serious but not life-threatening injuries.”

Anyone with information on the incident is asked to contact the IIO Witness Line at 1-855-446-8477.

The incident came a little more than a month after a second arrest that resulted in the IIO’s involvement. Police had injured a man during a takedown on May 21. The IIO were called into investigate, but in late June declared that it was dropping the matter because he did not suffer “serious harm.” The IIO only investigates incidents resulting in serious harm or death, regardless of wrongdoing. Other complaints or cases of potential wrongdoing are handled by the Office of the Police Complaints Commissioner (OPCC).

In a letter sent to BC Liberal leader Andrew Wilkinson Wednesday morning, NDP MLA Spencer Chandra Herbert said if Throness is not removed from caucus, at the very least he should be removed from his role as opposition critic for the Ministry of Children and Family Development.

“Your Critic for the Ministry of Children and Families Laurie Throness went to media and insisted he will not stop advertising in this homophobic magazine,” Chandra Herbert wrote to Wilkinson. “He then defended an article supporting conversion therapy, as long as it didn’t include kidnapping or wasn’t too ‘coercive.’

“Sit with that for a second: the MLA you’ve put in charge of child care and supporting vulnerable children believes there is a place for conversion therapy.”

He went on to explain how conversion therapy has no basis in science and can be quite destructive as a homophobic and transphobic practice, something Wilkinson himself did not deny.

BC Liberal ad in the Oct. 4, 2019 edition of The Light Magazine.

Chandra Herbert says it’s been 12 days since the leader tweeted that such views had no place in the BC Liberal party, yet Throness has defied that directive.

“If there is no room for homophobia and transphobia in your party, you will eject Laurie Throness from your caucus. Failing that, you will act and remove this MLA from his role as Children’s critic.”

See below for the full letter.

The controversy started when it came to light that Throness and several other MLAs, including Wilkinson, used taxpayer dollars to advertise in “The Light Magazine,” a Langley-based Christian publication that frequently runs articles that express antipathy towards the LGBTQ community in various ways.

• READ MORE: Controversy over MLAs buying ads in B.C. magazine that opposes trans rights

At least three MLAs expressed dismay and apologized when they were asked about the advertising in the religious publication. Party leader Wilkinson similarly backed away from the advertising, suggesting in a Tweet there was no room for homophobia, transphobia, or any discrimination in the BC Liberal Party.

There is no room in the BC Liberal Party for homophobia, transphobia, or any other form of discrimination.

Going forward, we are taking immediate steps to ensure our advertising decisions reflect those values at all times. — Andrew Wilkinson (@Wilkinson4BC) June 30, 2020

BC Liberal MLA Todd Stone apologized for his constituency office’s connection to the magazine, and made it clear he did not support its messaging.

Several others, including Chilliwack MLA John Martin, who advertised in the publication, have been silent.

Throness, however, doubled down and told CTV News Vancouver that he will continue to advertise in the magazine as it aligns with his “Biblical Christian” values.

“Biblical Christians follow their Lord in their sexual practice. They don’t attack other people, they don’t condemn other people, because Jesus did not condemn other people,” Throness said.

“They withdraw from sex outside of a marriage between a man and a woman. That has nothing to do with intolerance, it has everything to do with following their conscience and following their Lord.”

And while he said one article in the magazine he supports is against “coercive conversion therapy” – kidnapping LGBTQ individuals to make them straight – he opposes a bill that would prevent conversion therapy because it “infringes upon Canadian freedoms” such as the “freedom of religion.”

Wilkinson did not immediately respond to Chandra Herbert’s letter.

Throness declined to comment on the matter when contacted by The Chilliwack Progress.

NDP MLA Spencer Chandra Herbert’s full letter to BC Liberal leader Andrew Wilkinson on July 15, 2020:

Leader of the Official Opposition,

Two weeks ago, we learned that the BC Liberal caucus spent thousands of public dollars advertising in Light Magazine, a publication that promotes homophobic, transphobic, and extreme anti-abortion views.

On behalf of my colleagues in the BC NDP caucus, I am writing first to thank you for your new commitment to ensure ‘there is no room in the BC Liberal Party for homophobia, transphobia, or any other form of discrimination.’

As you know, in the past I have expressed deep concern about anti-LGBTQ views from MLAs in your caucus. I remain concerned, and am writing to ask you for action.

Since your statement, some of the BC Liberal MLAs who placed ads apologized, and I thank them for acknowledging the harm caused by homophobic and transphobic practices like conversion therapy. Most did not. You committed that none of your MLAs would support this magazine again. But words are easy. Action is what counts.

Your Critic for the Ministry of Children and Families Laurie Throness went to media and insisted he will not stop advertising in this homophobic magazine. He then defended an article supporting conversion therapy, as long as it didn’t include kidnapping or wasn’t too ‘coercive.’

Sit with that for a second: the MLA you’ve put in charge of child care and supporting vulnerable children believes there is a place for conversion therapy.

Again – conversion therapy is a discredited, abusive practice where LGBTQ people are taught to hate themselves and convert to something they are not. It leads to self-harm, depression, and suicide. It is discriminatory. It is homophobic. It is transphobic. No science supports this abuse, and neither should the BC Liberal party’s lead on children and family issues.

It’s just the latest in a series of anti-LGBTQ views your MLA has shared:

– He refused to support adding gender identity or expression to the list of protections in the B.C. Human Rights Code.

– He has criticized SOGI 123 and claimed it would cause ‘mental health issues’ and ‘self-harm.’

– He defended Chilliwack School Trustee Barry Neufeld, calling him ‘a really great and good person’ after he was widely criticized for comparing gender transitioning to child abuse.

Beliefs like this should have no place in a political party – but even less so in the MLA you have entrusted with the well-being of vulnerable children.

It has been 12 days since your MLA defended conversion therapy and indicated that he will defy your direction. I have been disappointed to see no action from you during that time.

If there is no room for homophobia and transphobia in your party, you will eject Laurie Throness from your caucus. Failing that, you will act and remove this MLA from his role as Children’s critic.

I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,

Spencer Chandra Herbert

MLA, Vancouver-West End

Health officials in B.C. say they’re pleased the Canada-U.S. border is expected to remain closed to non-essential travel until at least late August.

However, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said B.C. residents should not be quick to judge anyone driving a vehicle with an American licence plate because some Canadians living south of the border may have returned to care for family.

Henry said it’s not surprising anyone in that situation would be coming to B.C. given the sharp rise in COVID-19 cases in the United States, but it’s important they quarantine themselves for 14 days to prevent any risk of transmitting the virus.

“I’m happy it’s going till August and we’ll need to, of course, make sure that we watch carefully and monitor what’s going on,” Henry said Tuesday of the expected fourth extension of the border closure.

“We’ll need to look at people like students who contribute to our research programs and our universities,” she said of possible considerations involving those allowed across the border, provided anyone who becomes ill in B.C. is monitored.

However, she said there shouldn’t be any changes for tourists and short-term visitors.

Health Minister Adrian Dix echoed Henry’s sentiments, adding the situation is “very serious in the United States” as well as in other countries, meaning anyone coming to B.C. from those areas could put residents at risk.

Henry announced 13 new COVID-19 cases, bringing the total number diagnosed to 3,128. That was followed by 62 cases announced on Monday over a three-day period.

She said the recent rise in cases is due to more people socializing when they need to recommit to the basics of keeping transmission low, including washing hands and gathering in small numbers.

“This is what is going to get us through the next year,” she said, adding she’s spoken with restaurant owners and employees who say some people are arriving in groups of 20, which would increase the risk of the virus spreading.

“People need to be on their best behaviour,” she said. “It’s for your safety as well as the people who work there.”

Anyone concerned about the high number of visitors to bars or restaurants should contact public health officials, Henry said.

The number of positive COVID-19 tests linked to an outbreak in Kelowna has grown to 17, she said, referring to activities linked to events that occurred in Kelowna’s waterfront district between June 25 and July 9.

Those are in addition to seven people who visited the city earlier this month and later tested positive for COVID-19, triggering the health authority’s alert.

Dix has said possible exposures that occurred in the waterfront district are believed to stem from private parties held around Canada Day.

That has prompted a statement from Kelowna Mayor Colin Basran urging visitors to respect Henry’s advice and use appropriate “travel manners.”

In today’s issue of the Now-Leader (Thursday, July 9, 2020), we published an editorial that argued for the inclusion of certain councillors on the Surrey Police Board. In fact, councillors are ineligible to be on the board, according to the BC Police Act.

Legislation exists regarding appointments to police boards and is entirely under the purview of the provincial government. The BC Police Act prescribes police board appointments which includes the mayor as chair (ex officio or non-voting), up to seven provincial appointees and one municipal appointee. All seven board members were appointed on June 29 by a provincial Order in Council.

Additionally, according to Section 24 (1) of the Act:

A person who is a councillor or is ineligible to be elected as a councillor must not be appointed to a municipal police board.

This structure is designed to ensure independence of the police board and insulation of the Service (SPS) from local politics.

Dangling carelessly 12 inches above our dining room floor, the still-connected electrical outlet seemed to revel in my frustration.

As a single bead of sweat dripped from my brow onto the newly installed vinyl floor, the outlet’s two three-pronged “faces” seemed to mock me, as if they were a couple of anguished emojis.

“Oh my God, we can’t believe you are struggling so much with this,” they seemed to be saying.

And they would be right.

All I was trying to do was replace the plastic outlet cover.

How hard can it be?

I had just replaced four others, including a dimmer switch, but as seems to be the rule of thumb in any project, it’s always the last one that gives you the most grief.

My inner frustration with the problem outlet took a turn for the worse when my screwdriver missed its mark, leaving a small indentation on the freshly painted wall.

It was at this point that I did what any self-respecting dad who is all thumbs around the house.

I blamed someone else.

“You see kids, this is what happens when you don’t do something right the first time,” I told my two bemused teens. “If the builder had just installed this properly, this wouldn’t be an issue.”

My wife arrived home and my rant continued, this time with a few colourful adjectives thrown in for good measure.

“Why can’t anything be built properly these days,” I vented. “You spend all this money on a townhouse and they can’t even install a (blank) wall outlet properly.”

With a simple, “I’m sure you’ll figure it out” verbal pat on the head, my wife went upstairs.

It was then that I realized what the problem was. I was simply doing it wrong. I was using the wrong holes for the screws.

Thirty seconds later, the outlet cover was replaced and I offered a silent apology to the builders who had installed the outlet properly way back in 2005.

As I meekly put my tools away, I was reminded of an angry reader, who only last week made a similar faux pas.

We had just published a special section congratulating Surrey’s grads and she was furious that we omitted her granddaughter.

“What a horrendous mistake to make. I cried when I saw that,” she wrote in a scathing email. “In the midst of a pandemic and all the ugly that is happening right now to not print her name is very cruel.

“This is a very painful experience for her, I’m sure, as it is for me as her grandmother. It is a terrible oversight on your part.”

Concerned about the omission, we looked into it and contacted the school district, who submitted the list for publication.

It turns out the grad’s name was published with her class after all – her grandmother just missed it.

“My apologies to you for my mistake,” she wrote in another email to us. “I read through the list twice and still missed it. I’m the one who needs better glasses.”

It seems we both learned a similar lesson – before lashing out and blaming others, take a deep breath and make sure the problem doesn’t lie with you.

But admitting that to your wife – well, that’s a different story.

“How did it go with the outlet?” my wife asked as she came down the stairs.

“All good,” I said, proudly pointing at my hard-earned victory.

“I figured it out.”

Some life lessons are best kept to yourself, right?

The editorial below was published in today’s issue of the Now-Leader (Thursday, July 9, 2020). In fact, councillors are ineligible to be on the board, according to the BC Police Act.

Legislation exists regarding appointments to police boards and is entirely under the purview of the provincial government.

The Now-Leader apologizes for any confusion our editorial may have caused.

– – –

Who will be the lone Surrey councillor to join Mayor Doug McCallum on the city’s new police board?

Will it be the naturopath, the environmental protection officer, the realtor/yoga instructor, or the meat shop owner?

Or will it be the former Block Watch captain, the former MLA, the long-time executive director of Crime Stoppers, or the retired veteran police officer?

Last week, the Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General revealed who will be the seven community members on Surrey’s new police board, with McCallum to serve as its chairman. That leaves the appointment of a councillor to complete the circle.

By any objective standard, it should be a shortlist of two: Either the councillor with 25 years’ experience as a police officer, or the councillor who has served as executive director of Crime Stoppers since 2004. Both candidates are steeped in policing and crime-related issues and their presence at that table would undoubtedly be a boon to Surrey residents, especially given that this is a fledgling board that will oversee a fledgling city police force.

The hitch is, both of these obviously superior candidates are rivals to McCallum and his Safe Surrey Coalition – whose members the mayor exclusively appointed in 2019 to the interim Police Transitory Advisory Committee.

The mark of a statesman, and not just a mere politician, is to know when to set aside political advantage to do what’s best for the citizenry.

We hope that’s what happens here, with this council member appointment to Surrey’s new police board.

The city’s residents deserve nothing less.

123,surreynowleader,https://www.surreynowleader.com/opinion/column-timing-just-right-for-raising-minimum-wage/,COLUMN: Timing just right for raising minimum wage – Surrey Now-Leader,['Malin Jordan'],2020-07-02 16:00:00-07:00,"The minimum wage in B.C. jumped by 75 cents to $14.60 an hour on Monday, June 1. Stephany Garber Black writes the timing of the increase “couldn’t be better.” (Black Press File Photo)

By Stephany Garber Black

Special to the Cloverdale Reporter

I disagree with Jock Finlayson’s conclusions that when it comes to increasing the minimum wage, the timing couldn’t be worse.

The timing couldn’t be better. I say this because raising the minimum wage will protect human life and reduce poverty.

(Finlayson’s piece “Minister should look at financial carnage amid min. wage increase” ran in the June 4 issue of the Cloverdale Reporter.)

The minimum wage increased 75 cents to $14.60 per hour on June 1, an extra $6 for eight hours of work. These minimum wage employees are often working in restaurants and customer service where their interactions with the public make them more vulnerable to being exposed to COVID-19 than those in different industries. We need to trust these people to stay home when they feel ill to protect the rest of us.

Fighting poverty is part of protecting us collectively because minimum wage workers should not be forced to choose between working sick or being able to pay rent and eat. The increased minimum wage will help those workers protect themselves and others in the coming months.

The minimum wage historically has always been about protecting the vulnerable. According to our federal labour standards, the government has put minimum wage in place to protect non-unionized workers, reduce the number of low-paying jobs, alleviate poverty, create incentives to work and address inequality.

It is apparent the business community has organized and has advocates like Finlayson to protect their interests. Still, labour is discouraged from organizing to defend their wages because businesses can take away those coveted jobs.

SEE ALSO: COLUMN: B.C.’s labour minister should look at COVID-19 financial carnage amid minimum wage increase

Instead of mentioning that the minimum wage is in place to protect the vulnerable and reduce poverty, we have Finlayson reducing labour to a business expense. Talking about labour as a cost of production is problematic, because if working people are reduced to a business expense, what is a human life worth? I would argue that human life is precious and can’t just be looked at only in economic terms. This principle that human life is more than just a production expense is why we have a minimum wage in the first place.

Raising the minimum wage is not as bad as Finlayson makes it seem. Studies have shown that while raising the minimum wage may slightly increase unemployment; it also increases job stability. That means that it may be harder to find a job at first, but it is more likely to be a job you keep after you do. It also has a ripple effect of increasing other people’s wages, especially those close to minimum wage. If there is a time when we should protect the poorest and create more stable jobs, shouldn’t it be during a global health crisis?

Finlayson makes mention of the “calamity” and “carnage” the COVID-19 crisis has caused businesses. Perhaps we should remind ourselves why businesses closed in the first place—to protect human lives while we prepared and restructured our society during the pandemic. We chose to put the collective good before our individual needs as we listened to experts, voluntarily closed businesses, stayed home, and practiced social distancing.

As we look at the struggles of businesses, we must not forget the minimum wage workers and the working poor. The poor and the vulnerable need our help during a global pandemic when unemployment rates are rising and they have an increased chance of exposure to COVID-19.

Therefore, in the fight to protect human lives and decrease poverty, I politely disagree with Finlayson by saying that increasing the minimum wage could not have come at a better time.

124,surreynowleader,https://www.surreynowleader.com/opinion/column-some-more-appropriate-names-for-washington-nfl-team/,COLUMN: Some more appropriate names for Washington NFL team – Surrey Now-Leader,['Associated Press'],2020-07-04 11:30:00-07:00,"Finally, Washington’s NFL team would have a name everyone could cheer with pride

Now that Washington’s NFL team has taken a long-overdue step toward changing its name, it’s time to start lining up some possible replacements.

Washington Generals, anyone?

After defiantly resisting all calls to change its offensive moniker, the Washington NFLers finally bowed to the only thing that really matters.

The bottom line.

With the nation embroiled in social turmoil and economic upheaval, Nike stopped selling merchandise with the Washington nickname. For good measure, stadium title sponsor FedEx called on the team to come up with a moniker that would be more in tune with the current times rather than, say, the 1800s.

So, while Washington’s NFL team conducts what it calls a “thorough review” that almost will surely lead to a replacement by 2021 at the latest, let’s explore a few possibilities:

GENERALS — This would be a nod to the lovable losers who spent decades serving as the Harlem Globetrotters’ nightly pushovers, compiling a record of one win and somewhere north of 16,000 losses before they went out of business in 2015. Washington’s NFL team hasn’t been quite that bad in recent years, but it did go 3-13 a year ago and last won a playoff game in 2005. If Generals doesn’t work out, how about the Federals? They were Washington’s entry in the USFL during the 1980s, going 7-29 over two seasons in the ill-fated spring football league. A seamless transition, that would be.

GRIDLOCK — The District of Columbia has some of the worst traffic congestion in the nation, so this would seem fitting to all those commuters who’ve been spent roughly the time it takes to play an NFL game just trying to get to work. Also, it sums up our current political climate.

BLAZE — During the War of 1812, the British invaded Washington and set fire to numerous government buildings including the White House and the Capitol. Not necessarily a proud moment in the nation’s history, but probably a notch above Dan Snyder’s embarrassing tenure as team owner.

BUREAUCRATS — The team could pay tribute to all those nameless workers who keep the wheels of government droning along through turbulent times. They’ve certainly shown more imagination than some of Washington’s offensive schemes over the past couple of decades.

FOGGY BOTTOM BOYS — Foggy Bottom is one of the city’s oldest neighbourhoods, which would give Washington’s NFL team a chance to play off the fictional band created for the Coen Brothers’ classic movie “O Brother, Where Art Thou?” The Soggy Bottom Boys were fronted by a lip-syncing George Clooney, who hopefully could be persuaded to cut a video for the team’s new right song, “I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow.” It’s a catchier tune (and certainly more appropriate for the long-suffering fan base) than the hokey “Hail to the ….”

BLOSSOMS — While perhaps lacking the machismo of other potential monikers, the city’s famed cherry blossoms are in full bloom for roughly as long as the hopes of a Washington NFL fan each season. About two weeks.

SENATORS — Washington’s longtime baseball franchise was so horrible most years that its derisive motto became, “First in war, first in peace, last in the American League.” Hmm, that sounds familiar. Other names that were once used by pro sports franchises in the district include the Diplomats (a long-forgotten soccer team from the 1970s) and the Ambassadors (a team that never got off the ground in the World Football League). But forget about the Bullets, the NBA Wizards’ former name. That one was dropped because of its association with gun violence. It ain’t coming back.

HOGS — This name hearkens back to the team’s most glorious era, when a group of down-and-dirty behemoths dominated the offensive line of scrimmage and bullied Washington to three Super Bowl titles under Joe Gibbs. This might be the best way to appease those fans who are sure to object to changing the offensive moniker.

MONUMENTS — C’mon, how can you not like the Washington Monuments! A worthy tribute to the city’s stunning array of marble and granite remembrances, which honour everyone from the first president to Martin Luther King Jr. to the veterans of the Vietnam War. Some great logo possibilities, for sure.

RED TAILS — This is our pick. It maintains a link to the team’s current abomination of a name but also salutes the famed Tuskegee Airmen, the group of African American fighter pilots who broke down racial stereotypes during World War II.

Finally, Washington’s NFL team would have a name everyone could cheer with pride.

Section 90 of the Community Charter provides that a city council can hold a meeting that’s closed to the public if it concerns “personal” information about an “identifiable” individual, concerns labour or other employee relations, or the “acquisition, disposition or expropriation” of land if council thinks such disclosure could harm the city’s interests.

The Charter also allows city councils to do business inside a closed meeting if the information they are considering is prohibited from disclosure under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, or the matter involves “the consideration of information received and held in confidence” concerning negotiations between the city and higher levels of government.

This is quite cut-and-dried. It is therefore not to be used as a vehicle by council majorities, on matters not captured by the aforementioned provisions set out in the Community Charter, to sneak one by the electorate they purport to serve.

Moreover, it is certainly not to be used as an excuse for politicians to duck accountability, when asked why an item was dealt with in a closed meeting when the matter did not fall under any of these provisions.

City councillors revealed this week that council decided to disband the Surrey Housing and Homelessness Society’s board during a closed meeting last Thursday apparently because the mayor wanted to bring its governance “in-house.”

Mayor Doug McCallum would then not comment on the matter as it had been dealt with in a closed meeting.

Expedient for politicians, unfair for the public they were elected to serve.

This is not the stuff of transparency. Rather, it is opaque and anti-democratic.

In its June 2020 Monetary Policy Report, the U.S. Federal Reserve – America’s central bank — observed that the COVID-19 pandemic “poses acute risks to the survival of many small businesses,” adding that widespread failures among such firms “would adversely alter the economic landscape of local communities and potentially slow the economic recovery and future labor productivity growth.”

The B.C. government would be wise to take this message to heart. Small businesses, as defined by the government’s statisticians, account for 98 per cent of all enterprises and approximately half of private sector jobs.

In the current challenging and uncertain economic climate, policy-makers should be acutely sensitive to the financial health of the overall business sector, including smaller firms.

Many of these companies are in sectors that have been hard-hit by pandemic-related social distancing, outright business closures, dwindling consumer demand, and reduced investment – for example, food services, accommodation, recreation, non-essential retail, travel, arts and entertainment, construction, and personal services.

Compounding the risks for small firms, they also tend to be more financially fragile than larger companies, with most having limited cash reserves and lines of credit.

Although B.C. has done a good job flattening the curve of COVID-19, the province’s economy has been devastated by the pandemic and the measures taken to contain it. For 2020, the Business Council forecasts that economic output (GDP) in the province will drop by almost 8 per cent, which is far greater than the GDP losses experienced in previous recessions.

As of mid-June, B.C. is down 350,000 jobs compared to early 2020 — a catastrophic fall in employment. While the worst of the COVID-19 economic downturn may be over, the consequences of steep declines in GDP, employment and business activity since February are expected to be felt for years to come. And much of the pain will be visited upon smaller and mid-sized enterprises in every sector and region of B.C.

The dramatic slide in consumer spending and business activity triggered by mandated closures across large segments of the economy, coupled with the virtual cessation of travel, border closures, and the onset of a global recession, has already led to casualties among B.C. firms.

Under the government’s staged economic reopening plan, many formerly shuttered businesses are – or soon will be — open again.

However, in sectors like retail, restaurants and bars, leisure, recreation, hotels and motels, and personal services, businesses are now required to maintain strict social distancing for customers and staff, to limit the number of people on-site, and to devote more resources to cleaning and sanitation.

This amounts to a significant change in the operating environment for many businesses, one that is likely to translate into both lower revenues and higher costs.

Looking ahead, a substantial number of businesses will not last through the end of 2021. We estimate that at least 10 per cent of the 200,000 B.C. businesses with paid employees could be gone in the next 6-18 months.

Some will make the difficult decision to cease operations, while others will be forced into insolvency because they are no longer able to cover their bills or service their debts.

The impact of a shrinking private sector will not be limited to business owners/operators. Fewer firms also mean lost jobs for B.C. workers, less vibrant communities, and greater economic hardship for families.

Faced with this alarming prospect, the provincial government must do what it can to minimize mortality among locally-based companies. Equally important, it should focus on creating an environment that supports business start-ups to help fill the gap that will open up as thousands of existing companies fail.

Despite a few positive steps, to date the NDP government has come up short in supporting the business community and in encouraging new business formation.

In fact, the government has largely carried on with its pre-pandemic policy agenda, which paved the way for increased tax and regulatory burdens for most businesses and higher payroll costs for employers.

A change of direction is necessary if policy-makers are interested in kick starting economic recovery and making British Columbia a top-ranked jurisdiction for new private sector investment and entrepreneurial activity.

Germany has launched a coronavirus tracing app that officials say is so secure even government ministers can use it. Smartphone apps have been touted as a high-tech tool in the effort to track down potential COVID-19 infections. (Hannibal Hanschke/Pool Photo via AP)

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau recently announced the release of a nationwide contact tracing app. He remarked that it would be “something you can just download and forget about.”

In the wake of demonstrations in response to the killing of George Floyd, the Minneapolis Public Safety Commissioner stated that the police had begun tracking down protesters through a process he analogized to “contact tracing.” Whether or not contact tracing apps are or will be used to locate demonstrators, it is clear that the barrier between public health officers and police officers is permeable.

Blurring these lines is dangerous on multiple fronts. New surveillance technologies aimed at combating COVID-19 could be co-opted as a foothold to strengthen the surveillance state. In turn, skepticism of state-promoted contact tracing technologies may lead to insufficient adoption of them by the public, undermining their effectiveness and taking away a potentially important tool to fight the pandemic.

Legal precedents

This situation is not the first time that public health, privacy and law enforcement have collided. In the case of Vancouver Police Department vs. BC Centre for Excellence (BC-CfE) in HIV/AIDS, the Vancouver Police Department demanded private medical records from the BC-CfE in connection to an aggravated sexual assault case.

The implications of this request were massive. The BC-CfE has records on almost all known HIV-positive people in the province that include personal, demographic and even genetic information. Understandably, the BC-CfE resisted the request.

The B.C. provincial court held that society’s interest in protecting the confidentiality of the records outweighed the objectives of the police investigation as disclosure of patient and research information in furtherance of a criminal investigation would “erode the Centre’s ability to maintain a comprehensive program for HIV-Aids research and treatment. The benefits to society from that research are immeasurable.”

A similar argument could be made of any request to access data collected to fight COVID-19, such as data collected through contact tracing. It is not difficult to conclude that many people would refuse to voluntarily enrol in contact tracing apps like Alberta’s TraceTogether if they believed their information was not safe, as polling has suggested that privacy is a a significant concern with respect to such apps. Without buy-in from a critical mass of users, a contact tracing app would likely fail.

Structural framework

Yet legal arguments to protect our privacy through court proceedings are not enough in the post-COVID era. A broader structural framework to ensure privacy for health information is required.

Former Ontario Privacy Commissioner Dr. Ann Cavoukian developed a concept known as “privacy by design” in the late 1990s. Though many of the principles of this concept are geared toward the creation of information systems, they could well be applied to a data framework. The most pertinent foundational principles are as follows: the approach to privacy should be proactive rather than reactive; privacy should be the default setting and; transparency.

If properly crafted, a statute could make the government’s COVID-19 tracking efforts achieve privacy by design; it could ensure that any information collected for the purposes of COVID-19 surveillance be used only for health purposes, precluding use for any other purpose.

This would not only make privacy the default setting, but would also be a proactive approach, acting to prevent the state from engaging in violations of privacy, rather than attempting to reverse the damage in court after it has been done. Furthermore, a statute could ensure improved transparency by mandating that users be asked for permission each time before any identifiable data about them is used, informing them of the purpose of that use and then notifying them again once that information has been used.

New crisis solutions

The COVID-19 crisis is unprecedented, as are the measures we have collectively taken in response. We are all understandably keen to take whatever action is necessary to bring this virus to heel. Yet we must also remain vigilant.

Temporary impingement on rights and liberties all too often become permanent. As many have pointed out, this is not the last global pandemic nor, given the climate crisis, the last major catastrophe that will occur in our lifetimes.

The demand for increased bio-surveillance will grow in order to prevent this, and future pandemics. The Charter of Rights and Freedoms, of course, contains provisions protecting our privacy as well as our right to life, liberty and security of person. However, it is clear that in order to realize these rights, further action is needed to keep the realm of public health officers and police officers separate. Privacy and transparency need to become the default, not something that must be fought for in a courtroom after the fact.

The barrier between public health officers and police officers must stay intact. The challenges we face in the months and years ahead will not be easy to overcome, but we must face them with open eyes and to ensure we avoid an Orwellian pandemic in which we entirely lose control of our right to privacy.

It is comforting to know that, in cases of personal tragedy and extreme adversity, not only family and friends but also complete strangers are more than willing to help you.

Three recent local tragedies come to mind.

On June 1, Jasvinder Singh Riar, age 31, died at work, at the Canadian National Railway’s Thornton Yard in North Surrey, leaving behind his wife, his nine-month-old son, and his mother, paternal grandmother and sister. That was one mighty responsibility he shouldered, being the sole provider for his family.

But at this time of writing, 866 donors have contributed $96,959 through a GoFundMe campaign online, toward helping his family.

This past Sunday, which happened to be Father’s Day, tragedy struck another local family when Surrey realtor Kashif Sheikh, 46, drowned while trying to save his daughter who had slipped into a creek near a waterfall in the Okanagan.

Sheikh leaves behind a wife and four children.

By Wednesday morning, 939 donors to a GoFundMe campaign had raised $95,230 to help Sheikh’s family.

Of course, no amount of money will ever replace these two men. But the money being raised in their memory will surely help take some of the burden off their survivors, who are undoubtedly suffering from the shock, confusion and grief that is particular to sudden and unexpected deaths.

Now, a third local fundraising initiative has been launched to help a Surrey family of seven whose home was destroyed in a fire on Tuesday in Whalley.

The fact that strangers, some of whom can ill afford it, will help others in times of need serves to remind us that ultimately none of us are really alone.

And we can all take some comfort in that.

Submitted photos taken from March 23 to May 1 in Surrey show dog owners allowing their dogs to roam and play – and even do their business on – using sports fields, despite signs clearly stating dogs are prohibited.

The Editor,

Dogs are prohibited on athletic fields everywhere to protect the health and welfare of the athletes who use the fields. Why do dog owners purposefully disregard the welfare of those athletes and others who use the fields for their intended purpose?

It’s shocking that during the COVID-19 crisis, when people are expected to raise their social consciousness and take actions to protect the health of other people, that dog owners carry on as usual, disregarding laws that don’t suit them.

Dog owners who use athletic fields for their own private off-leash dog park and dog toilet, are breaking municipal laws. I see more than 35 dogs a week on the South Surrey Athletic fields at 20th and 148 Street. Things are as bad or worse at Sunnyside Park. Thirty-five dogs equal 35 piles of defecated excrement on the fields and and urine everywhere.

I know people think it is convenient to use the local sports field, that driving to the dog park adds unnecessary carbon to global warming, and that their dog is perfect. But owning a dog carries responsibilities to the environment, to your city and to other people.

We don’t spread human waste on sports fields or send it to the landfill for obvious reasons. Dog turds are worse.

Obey the laws and leave the athletic fields to the athletes.

It’s getting easier to access a swab test for COVID-19, but you still need a referral from a doctor, and a little courage. (Jessica Peters/ The Progress)

First of all, I need to sincerely apologize to the health nurse who performed my COVID-19 test.

I don’t always act like the melting Wicked Witch of the West, growling and pawing at my own face. Then again, who knew that swabs were half-a-foot long and could reach around to scratch your brains.

For the rest of you, I’ll back up a bit. It all started last week, with a post-workday nap that turned into a deep sleep.

Then there was the dry cough, the runny and tender nose, the pain in my forehead. Ultimately, there was the fact that all of the above didn’t disappear with a good dose of allergy medications.

I called in sick, because clearly I had caught a cold. And in addition to the ultimate cure of hot soups and daytime television, I had to go for a COVID-19 test. If we’ve learned anything from COVID-19 it’s that distancing works. And even the slightest chance that I may have spread the novel coronavirus around the office in the preceding days sent a flu-like shiver up my spine.

The first part was the easiest. I called up my family doctor’s office and told them I was sick. The doctor called back the next day and agreed I needed a test. A family member picked up the requisition and I was on my way to the Chilliwack Public Health Unit.

READ MORE: VIDEO: New COVID-19 testing machine takes load off B.C.’s virologists and labs

I ran through the raindrops to the front door, only to be turned around to the side of the building I had sprinted past.

Around the corner, signs on the building and markings on the ground direct you where to stand and what to do. A nurse was waiting at the doorway, ready to screen me for my symptoms. With that out of the way, I was in the building, which has been temporarily turned into a make-shift COVID-19 testing ward. The first thing I noticed is that the windows are all sealed off with poly and tape.

A few wide rows of spaced apart chairs face away from the entrance, and a few testing areas have been curtained off along one wall.

Distancing is in place that is well above the suggested two metres, and it made me feel safe. It also reminded me that this is a serious threat to some people’s health. It underscored why I was standing there, requisition in hand, sniffles in my nostrils, and a fear of what’s about to happen. I would have preferred to be back at the office, writing. Prior to COVID-19, I wouldn’t even have blinked twice at going to work with a dripping nose. A bit of cold medication, some strong coffee and tissues and I would have been on my way.

But we know more now, don’t we? If anything, staying home when sick should be adopted as the new normal.

I’m sent to a curtained off area, and we run through the list of questions. As my ‘yes’ answers pile up faster than the ‘no’ answers, the hypochondriac within me feels like maybe I do have the virus.

When it was time to tilt the head back, and let the nurse do her thing, I felt immensely brave. But as brave as I am in my heart, my body always has other plans. I felt my eyes widen as the swab entered my nose and quickly jammed up. My eyes teared. I gagged. I grabbed my chin, for some unknown reason, coughed and snorted and began to make those aforementioned witchy noises.

With no luck on the right, she moved to the left. I felt the swab glide up easily and for a slice of a second, I thought this would be easier. Of course, I was wrong and I was once again writhing in the chair.

So the bad news is, I’m utterly ridiculous. The good news is, it was over very quickly and shouldn’t be avoided for any reason. Results are quick, available on myehealth.com within 24 hours, and if you test positive they will call in the same time frame.

Also good news? My COVID-19 test that day was negative and it was likely just that regular ‘old’ coronavirus — the common cold. As of today, I’m one of more than 171,000 people who have been tested for COVID-19 in B.C. To date, there have been 2,775 cases in this province, and 168 deaths. Eleven people are in the hospital today with COVID-19, and five of those are in an ICU.

And so, despite the temporary discomfort, I would do it again.

For more information on how and when to get a COVID-19 test, visit www.bccdc.ca, call 8-1-1, or contact your physician’s office.

Many restaurants have closed in response to COVID-19. (Ashley Wadhwani/Black Press Media)

The latest survey of businesses in British Columbia reveals few are confident the province’s $1.5-billion recovery plan will help them survive or succeed.

The survey of 1,401 member businesses from groups including the BC Chamber of Commerce, Greater Vancouver Board of Trade and Business Council of B.C. indicates owners want a bold, long-term recovery plan.

Only 16 per cent of businesses were confident in B.C.’s restart plan and 47 per cent were not.

Two-thirds of those surveyed were relying on some form of government support and owners were braced for a “second wave” of shutdowns or other problems if programs expire too quickly.

Some 28 per cent believed they’ll return to normal once programs end, 32 per cent expected to cut workers’ hours, 27 per cent anticipated layoffs, and one business in every 10 forecast either temporary or permanent closure.

Owners say payroll and wage supports must remain key components of B.C.’s recovery plan, along with fee and tax cuts.

The survey also identified expectations that the province must create better investment conditions.

Bridgitte Anderson, president and CEO of the Greater Vancouver Board of Trade, says business viability hinges on those measures.

Val Litwin with the BC Chamber of Commerce urges policy-makers to ”stay sensitive” to the vulnerability of the business sector.

“A bold economic recovery plan that helps small businesses compete is non-negotiable for a prosperous B.C., and when small businesses thrive so do communities and people,” Litwin said in a statement.

“Governments must keep focused on delivering their recovery plans swiftly.”

The survey, conducted with the Mustel Group, is the fourth in a series examining the effects on B.C. businesses since the pandemic flared in March.

(Tom Fletcher/Black Press)

The B.C. government reports farm product revenues hit a record in 2019, up to $3.9 billion, with increases in dairy, beef, eggs, chicken, blueberries, grapes and nursery plants.

Agriculture Minister Lana Popham credits the improved revenues to the province’s work in “helping farmers farm and strengthening food security,” as well as promotion through the Buy BC program in stores. But two thirds of the revenue increase over 2018 is from cannabis sales, which rose $300 million as legal retail expanded.

Dairy sales were up $47 million, beef up $25 million and field vegetables increased $17.5 million, with egg and nursery sales both up $14 million. But farmers note those are gross sales, not net earnings. And a chronic labour shortage has been sharply increased by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has followed a 28-per-cent increase in the minimum wage rate since 2017.

Like Vancouver Island and Fraser Valley berry and vegetable growers, tree fruit farmers are struggling to find enough workers for the labour-intensive picking of cherries and apples, the staple crops for the Okanagan and other fruit growing areas. Despite the B.C. government’s nation-leading effort to support agriculture by providing quarantine for foreign workers coming in from Mexico. A recent survey by the B.C. Fruit Growers Association found that more than 80 per cent of growers expect to reduce production this year due to COVID-19, labour market conditions and a slump in price for apples, by far B.C.’s biggest crop.

B.C. apple prices have been below cost of production for the last three years, after staging a recovery with the popularity of new made-in-B.C. varieties such as Gala and Ambrosia, said Glen Lucas, general manager of the BCFGA. Washington state’s apple production has grown rapidly to 50 times as big as B.C.’s, and harvest costs are rising.

“In the very short term, and the survey was asking about this year, that means just walking away from blocks, just leaving the apples and the cherries hanging,” Lucas said in an interview. “And that will most likely happen with some of the apple varieties that have been impacted by low prices the most.”

In the longer term, the B.C. industry expects continued reduction in apple acreage that has been seen over 50 years, as vineyards and other crops take their place.

“With this three-year hit on prices and increased costs, lots of regulatory costs, lots of actual cash costs going up, we’ll start seeing apple acres being pulled out,” Lucas said. “We’re concerned about food security and what that means, and I guess that gets back to the cannabis and the wine grape production.”

B.C.’s cherry crop is a smaller but profitable segment, which has struggled for the second straight year with frequent rains and this year, frost. Wet conditions mean using helicopters and large mobile fans to dry cherry trees, and reduced yield.

“There are fewer cherries, but what I’ve seen have been phenomenal,” Lucas said. “And I hear the apple crop is looking good. We are expecting good quality.”

The province’s Vancouver quarantine facility for foreign farm workers has prevented the kind of virus outbreaks seen in Ontario, where 14-day isolation takes place at farms. But even with that, the association expects to get through 2020 with only 60 to 70 per cent of the usual mostly Mexican workforce.

Mexico is having its own struggle with COVID-19, where widespread outbreaks have shut the government’s visa application centre and the labour ministry recruiting office.

“Buses aren’t running because of restrictions, or borders between states in Mexico will be closed and people can’t get past them,” Lucas said. “It’s just been one thing after another.”

138,surreynowleader,https://www.surreynowleader.com/business/bank-of-canada-holds-rate-forecasts-decline-in-gdp-of-7-8-this-year/,"Bank of Canada holds rate, forecasts decline in GDP of 7.8% this year – Surrey Now-Leader",['The Canadian Press'],2020-07-15 09:30:00-07:00,"The report pegs the annual inflation rate at 0.6 per cent this year

The Bank of Canada is holding its key interest rate at 0.25 per cent in response to what it calls the “extremely uncertain” economic outlook from the COVID-19 pandemic, and plans to keep it there until the picture improves.

In its updated outlook, the bank said Wednesday it expects the economy to contract by 7.8 per cent this year, driven downward by a year-over-year contraction of 14.6 per cent in the second quarter.

The report pegs the annual inflation rate at 0.6 per cent this year, rising to 1.2 per cent in 2021 and 1.7 per cent in 2022.

Its inflation target is 2 per cent, and the bank said in its policy statement it will maintain the current rate until that target is achieved.

The rate will have to stay low to provide “extraordinary monetary policy support” to help recuperate from the economic impact of COVID-19, it said.

The forecasts included in the Bank of Canada’s monetary policy report also come with a caution that the numbers could be thrown off.

The bank’s outlook is based on the assumption that there won’t be a broad-based second wave of the pandemic, that lockdowns will be gradually lifted, and the pandemic will have run its course by mid-2022 thanks to a vaccine or effective treatment.

The monetary policy report said there isn’t enough information to forecast how deep the economic scarring will be from business closures or widespread job losses.

It’s also unclear how quickly consumer demand will recover through changes in spending habits, work patterns and social behaviour, the report said.

Still, the central bank said it appears the country has avoided a worst-case scenario envisioned by the bank in its last report in April.

The central bank’s key interest rate has been at 0.25 per cent since March when it was rapidly dropped in response to the economic fallout from COVID-19.

Governor Tiff Macklem has seemingly ruled out any further drops and has said that the central bank doesn’t plan to raise the rate until well into an economic recovery.

The Bank of Canada’s June interest rate announcement came on Macklem’s first day on the job as the country’s top central banker. Though he was only observer during the June round of deliberations by the bank’s governing council, he endorsed the decision to keep the rate on hold.

The report Wednesday said growth will pick up beginning in this quarter, the third of the year, with the country recouping about 40 per cent of the drop in output from the first half of 2020.

Much of that will be driven by the reopening of businesses and partial rebound in spending, the bank says.

But after an initial, quick bounceback, Canada will enter what the bank calls a “recuperation phase” where the pace of recovery will slow.

“As reopening progresses, many people will probably continue to fear contracting the virus, and uncertainty about job security is likely to persist,” the report said.

“Both consumer and business confidence are therefore expected to remain subdued, restraining spending and employment, particularly in activities that involve in-person interaction.”

The bank said the pandemic will continue to affect consumer and business confidence during this phase amid widespread changes in the economy, including the energy sector where low prices and reduced demand have put production well below its pre-pandemic path.

As well, the shock facing the oil sector has “renewed questions about the likelihood of pipelines being developed,” the report said.

Some lower-income workers, disproportionately affected by job losses or cuts in earnings, “will face prolonged income losses” and push more households to the financial brink, the bank warns.

While higher income households may have excess savings to spend during this phase, some households will prioritize paying down debts, or padding rainy-day funds due to the uncertain economic environment, the report said.

Heavy discounts on unwanted inventory and smaller-than-planned price increases for firms will also act as a drag on inflation, which the bank expects to remain weak before gradually getting back to its two per cent target.

Housing activity is also expected to slow over the next few years with the ripple effects of the downturn, and lower immigration, the report said.

The central bank said it will provide a more detailed analysis of its long-run assumptions for the domestic economy when it updates it outlook in October.

NDP changing WorkSafeBC regulations to respond to COVID-19 – Surrey Now-Leader,['Tom Fletcher'],2020-07-14 15:40:00-07:00,"The B.C. government is pushing ahead with changes to increase insurable earnings under WorkSafeBC rules, and to give the insurer the ability to accept COVID-19 and other viral ailments as work-related without the current 90-day waiting period and investigation.

Labour Minister Harry Bains introduced amendments in the B.C. legislature July 14, emphasizing an increase in maximum disability benefits from $87,000 to $100,000, and authorizing WorkSafeBC to provide preventive medical treatment before a claim is accepted.

Changes to the Workers Compensation Act would also affect the rules for COVID-19 and other viral illness claims, which WorkSafeBC is already reviewing by the hundreds. Between 50 and 60 per cent of those claims are being accepted, Bains said.

A labour ministry statement on the changes puts it this way: “The legislation will fast-track the effective date of presumptions if established by WorkSafeBC board of directors for occupational diseases caused by viral pathogens. The presumption would simplify the process for workers who make a workers’ compensation claim if they contract viruses on the job. This would ensure that people who are at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 at work are able to access benefits more quickly.”

Employers have strongly opposed the change in “presumptions” that a coronavirus infection came from exposure at work. In a submission to WorkSafeBC, the Employers’ Forum argues that a better remedy is the national sick pay program proposed by Premier John Horgan and other premiers to deal with work lost due to pandemic rules and effects.

“Insufficient scientific information and the nature of this pandemic means the workers’ compensation system can only effectively address claims on a case-by-case basis, much as public health officials are currently doing win the contact tracing process,” the organization representing large and small employers said in its submission. “This pandemic – like all pandemics – is a public health crisis, not a workplace health crisis.

“Embedding public health costs in WorkSafeBC premiums could be ruinous for businesses who are unable to absorb any further fixed or variable cost increases because of the ongoing fallout from COVID-19, and could undermine the long-term financial stability of WorkSafeBC.”

Bains said the increase in insurable earnings represents a cost to employers, who fund the no-fault compensation system through payroll assessments. The government’s planned changes allow for “stability in premiums” for this year and the next two, Bains said.

In an economic update July 14, James released projections of a $6.3 billion drop in sales and income taxes, natural resource revenues and Crown corporation income. Spending adds the rest to what started 2020 as a balanced budget with a $227 million surplus, adding a $6 billion more to the deficit.

James said the remaining $1.5 billion of the $5 billion emergency fund voted by the B.C. legislature will be allocated for economic recovery in September, after the government completes a public survey and continues meeting with business sectors on how to proceed.

Beyond the emergency spending for business and personal financial relief, more than $1 billion of the additional spending is in health care, including lab testing, supports for long-term care facilities, health prevention and contact tracing for COVID-19, and mental health supports. Another $250 million has been directed to maintain child care services.

Nearly $90 million has been directed to temporary housing, meal and health supports, in addition to $110 million to buy hotels to move people living in encampments.

Crown corporation income is projected to be down $882 million from the February budget forecast, which James said is mostly due to the shutdown of B.C. Lottery Corp. casinos due to the pandemic. ICBC costs have declined in the early part of the 2020-21 fiscal year due to a reduction in travel, but that could change as pandemic restrictions on travel are lifted and more people return to work, she said.

B.C. Liberal leader Andrew Wilkinson warned of the impact of B.C. tax deferrals that are expected to run out this fall.

“Back in May we suggested a 90-day break on employer health tax, sales tax and hotel tax to get the economy rolling again,” Wilkinson told reporters after the update. “And instead what we saw the NDP do is say, no, they’re just going to let it pile up until September, October and send a huge bill to all these businesses when they’re least able to pay it.”

Bids for close to 300 cardio machines will be sought for an online-only auction held at the Newton location of Able Auctions, at 13557 77th Ave.

Masks are mandatory for a preview on Wednesday, July 22, with the auction set for July 23 at 9:30 a.m. Details are posted at ableauctions.ca.

The commercial-grade equipment is from closed locations of Steve Nash Fitness World, Able Auctions president Jeremy Dodd confirmed.

Under new ownership, the fitness company is being restructured.

“There are somewhere between 250 and 300 pieces of equipment (for auction),” Dodd said. “Right now it’s all cardio. Strength (equipment) is going to come but not quite yet. There are different owners of the equipment, different leasing companies that owned all this.

“I’ve never seen this much (equipment) like this before, it’s an awful lot,” Dodd added.

(Story continues below video)

During the pandemic, Able Auctions encourages people to bid and make payments online.

“It’s gone really smoothly,” Dodd said. “It’s definitely a buyer’s market, you know, so there are good buys right now. As far as the process goes, it’s quite seamless and smooth doing it this way. People sign up and register ahead of time, we get going at usually 9:30 in the morning on a given day, and we go through the items one at a time and sell it all off – just like a live auction but with no auctioneer.”

(Story continues below)

Meantime, the company’s Langley location is where dozens of animatronic dinosaurs will be auctioned. On Aug. 6, Able Auctions will be selling off more than 50 life-sized animatronic dinosaurs, along with hundreds of fossils, more animatronic equipment, lighting, and speakers.

The animatronic dinosaurs include famous species such as Tyrannosaurus rex, Triceratops, and velociraptors, but also more obscure species, such as ouranosaurus, kentrosaurus, dilophosaurus, amargasaurus and a flying pterosaur, which was related to dinosaurs but part of a different lineage.

A display of all the items is scheduled for Wednesday, Aug. 5 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., with masks mandatory, at Able Auctions’ Langley location, 19757 92A Ave.

This weekend, wash your car for a good cause.

On Sunday (June 19), South Surrey auto-detailing business, Splashes, will host a fundraising car wash in support of a Vancouver family whose infant daughter Lucy is in need of urgent medical care – and one of the world’s most expensive drugs – to help stop the progression of the four-month-old’s spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).

SMA is a rare, progressive genetic disorder – Lucy Van Doormaal was diagnosed at just five weeks old – that leads to trouble breathing, feeding and swallowing, and other issues. Without treatment, SMA is likely to be fatal within the first two years of life, a news release issued by Lucy’s family states.

Lucy, the release adds, is a good candidate for a “ground-breaking new gene therapy” drug called Zolgensma, however, the one-time-only dose is not yet approved in Canada and costs a whopping $3 million.

So far, more than 41,000 people – including Vancouver-born actor Ryan Reynolds – have donated to a ‘Life for Lucy’ GoFundMe campaign, raising more than $1.8 million.

“The amount of support we have been getting is unbelievable – we are so full of hope that we will be able to reach what, at one point, seemed like an impossible goal. The momentum of the past few days has been incredible,” Lucy’s parents Laura and Scott Van Doormaal said.

Research has shown that the longer a child waits for treatment, the more irreversible the damage from this neuromuscular disorder.

“It is overwhelming to know that there is something out there that could change Lucy’s life,” said Laura.

“When you have a child, you would do anything for them. We are working around the clock to reach our $3 million goal.”

Sunday’s fundraiser at Splashes was spurred by the suggestion of a customer, who is a family friend of the Van Doormaals, car wash officials said.

“Our business gives back to a local charity each month, however, we saw this as an opportunity to host a one-day fundraiser to raise as much money as possible for this family,” explains an email detailing the event.

It’s to take place at 103-3050 King George Blvd., from 10 a.m. until 5 p.m. and will include free touchless car washes, though donations will be collected on site.

Cash, debit and credit-card donations will be accepted, with 100 per cent of the proceeds going to the family.

COVID-19 safety precautions will also be followed, Splashes staff said.

From noon until 4 p.m., Tacofino will also be on site, serving food, with a portion of those proceeds also being donated to the cause.

A survey by Statistics Canada suggests that almost one in five businesses will look to further staffing cuts, bankruptcy or closing their doors if present COVID-19 conditions last for six months or more.

According to the survey released on Tuesday, 19.3 per cent of businesses could operate at their current level of sales and spending for less than six months but would have to take additional action if it lasts for a longer duration. Nearly 35 per cent of hotels and restaurants only have the runway for six more months of lockdown measures, says the survey conducted May 29 to July 3.

The results come as many businesses are looking at government programs or credit to remain afloat.

Almost 64 per cent of survey respondents said they were approved for outside credit or government funding programs such as Canada Emergency Business Account loans or wage subsidies. Less than 24 per cent of businesses said in the survey that their rent or mortgage payments were deferred during the pandemic.

While working from home has increased during the pandemic, only about a quarter of survey respondents indicated they would likely offer teleworking as an option going forward after COVID-19 spread is contained.

The version released on Tuesday was a follow-up to a crowd-sourced questionnaire on the Statistics Canada website, a collaboration launched in April, with the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, that surveyed 12,600 businesses. The sample was not designed to reflect the overall Canadian economy.

Finance Minister Carole James expects to lay out the extent of the COVID-19 impact on the province’s economy this week, but how she will deploy a $1.5 billion relief fund will likely have to wait until August.

James is preparing to provide an update on the coronavirus pandemic’s effects on B.C. July 14. It will set out the progress of the province’s relief efforts for individuals and businesses, and include a range of financial forecasts about what the future holds for the B.C. economy.

But the $1.5 billion in borrowed money held in reserve for a recovery plan will not be finalized until after a six-week public consultation that runs until July 21, with analysis after that.

“Yes, we will have additional measures that will come later, after our consultation occurs,” James told reporters at the B.C. legislature July 13.

Many of the government’s measures are already in place, such as tax payment deferrals and reduced business school tax, plus the gradual lifting of pandemic restrictions on business and public activities. With the $1.5 billion recovery fund left from the $5 billion emergency appropriation voted by MLAs, the cost will be enormous.

“I’ve tabled legislation that says for the next three years we will not balance the budget. We will in fact have deficits,” James said. “But each and every year that’s going to have to be looked at. We’re going to have to see where the economic recovery is occurring. I’m afraid it’s a challenging time, and you’ll see that in some of the statistics tomorrow, when it comes to economic forecasters who have a wide range of what they anticipate could be coming, because of the uncertainty that’s there for, not British Columbia but in fact for Canada and the world.”

B.C. Liberal MLAs have called for faster action, and leader Andrew Wilkinson has sent a series of letters to Premier John Horgan with possible ways to use the relief money. Among those was declaring a sales tax holiday for struggling businesses, rather than just allowing them to defer sending in the sales tax they collect on transactions.

(Williams Lake Tribune)

With an estimated 7,000 people planting trees across Canada, the federal government has committed up to $30 million in emergency funding to help contractors cover the extra costs of COVID-19 protection.

The funds are aimed at keeping the Justin Trudeau government’s reforestation commitment to plant 600 million trees on schedule, covering costs such as sanitizing stations, additional accommodation and transportation space and personal protective equipment, Natural Resources Canada said in a statement.

B.C.’s annual program had more than 300 million of those seedlings scheduled to be planted in 10 weeks this summer, but the start was delayed to develop coronavirus pandemic plans. It got underway in May.

Measures ordered for industrial camps include spaced seating in trucks and buses, and physical spacing measures for camps.

“Faced with the challenges of both maintaining the manufacturing of essential products and ensuring seedlings are planted on schedule amid COVID-19, federal, provincial and territorial governments, together with industry, work collaboratively to quickly put in place measures to protect workers and communities,” the statement said. “The government intends to work with the provinces and territories to deliver this funding, which will preserve jobs for forest sector workers, including approximately 7,000 tree planters this year.”

In April, B.C.’s chief forester requested that any tree planting in B.C. that hadn’t started be delayed until May. Contractors imposed two-week isolation for employees before they went out to work

The B.C. government is carrying on its program through the Forest Enhancement Society of B.C., including fire prevention by removing fire-killed trees for fuel pellet production. Among them is a $1.25 million grant to the Cheslatta Carrier Nation, to rehabilitate forest areas severely damaged by wildfires in 2018.

Work started in May on the south side of Francois Lake between Grassy Plains, Ootsa and Cheslatta Lakes, 65 km south of Burns Lake.

“The wildfires of 2018 burned 75 per cent of the Cheslatta Community Forest and even more overall on the territory,” said Ben Wilson, forestry coordinator for the Cheslatta Carrier Nation.

The official unemployment rate for B.C. remains at 13 per cent based on Statistics Canada totals for June, but that is partly due to more people having the confidence to look for work as the B.C. economy reopens, James said July 10. Youth unemployment is up slightly to 29 per cent, another sign of job seekers coming back in the hardest-hit areas of the economy.

Statistics show 118,000 additional jobs in B.C. from May to June, with half of those in the accommodation and food service industries that were directly affected by COVID-19 health orders. It’s an encouraging start, but net job losses for B.C. since the pandemic restrictions began remain at 235,000, James said.

“I think it’s a good sign that you’re seeing that 50 per cent increase in jobs coming from those sectors,” James told reporters in a broadcast from the B.C. legislature. “We’re starting to see, as we encourage British Columbians to safely and cautiously travel within the province … They’re providing support to accommodation. I know that the Okanagan is talking about how busy they are this summer.”

Ken Peacock, chief economist for the Business Council of B.C., said the June employment numbers are a pleasant surprise, with the first full month of the province’s restart bringing almost triple the employment increase seen in May. But of the 118,000 new jobs, 102,000 were part-time.

“Now it’s not surprising that companies are rehiring people on a part-time basis rather than jumping into full-time hours,” Peacock said in an interview with Black Press Media. “And also when you look at the sectors that were hit, you see more part-time in food services, accommodation services, some of the tourism activities.”

The one area that continues to see declines is manufacturing, which Peacock said is an indication of B.C.’s export economy in a global pandemic.

“We know our forest products sector is hurting, mining activity is probably being dampened as we speak because of the global slowdown, so I’m going to be watching that manufacturing number and some of the export elements closely in the next few months,” Peacock said.

Statistics Canada says the economy added nearly one million jobs in June as businesses forced closed by the pandemic began to reopen.

The agency says 953,000 jobs were added last month, including 488,000 full-time and 465,000 part-time positions.

The unemployment rate fell to 12.3 per cent in June after hitting a record-high of 13.7 per cent in May.

As in May, even though more people found jobs, more people were also looking for work.

The average economist estimate for June had been for an addition of 700,000 jobs and the unemployment rate to fall to 12.0 per cent, according to financial data firm Refinitiv.

Statistics Canada says the unemployment rate would have been 16.3 per cent had it included in unemployment counts those who wanted to work, but did not look for a job.

The jobs report this morning says there are still some 3.1 million people affected by the shutdowns of March and April when public health restrictions forced businesses to close and workers to stay at home to slow the spread of COVID-19.

About 2.5 million didn’t have jobs in June, either due to temporary or permanent layoffs, while the remainder are working less than half their usual hours.

As restrictions eased, the number of people participating in the labour force grew by about 786,000 after May’s 491,000 gain, bringing those considered in the labour force to within 443,000 of its pre-pandemic level.

The gains, though, have not been shared equally between men and women, with the former gaining back jobs at a faster pace than the latter.

The unemployment rate for women was 12.7 per cent in June compared to 12.1 per cent for men. Similarly, the participation rate for core-aged men was less than one percentage point below the February level, while for women it was 1.4 percentage points short.

The underutilization rate — which counts those who are unemployed, those who want a job but didn’t look for one, and those working less than half their usual hours — was 28.3 for women and 25.5 per cent for men.

The Bank of Canada and federal government say the worst of the economic pain from the pandemic is behind the country, but Canada will face high unemployment and low growth until 2021.

The economic outlook released by the Liberal government Wednesday forecast the unemployment rate to be 9.8 per cent for the calendar year, dropping to 7.8 per cent next year based on forecasts by 13 private sector economists.

Another ridesharing company has moved further east into Pitt Meadows, Maple Ridge, and new sections of Langley today.

On Thursday, July 9, Lyft announced the expansion of service, claiming to hear from both riders and drivers that there’s a “significant appetite” for the service not only in these communities, but also in eastern Langley, the Belcarra area, Lions Bay, and Bowen Island.

Pitt Meadows Mayor Bill Dingwall and Maple Ridge Mayor Mike Morden both said they’re keen to see the additional transportation option available for local residents.

“Pitt Meadows residents have been eagerly awaiting ridesharing in our community, and I’m pleased to say that day has come with Lyft now launching here,” Dingwall said.

“Ridesharing helps to reduce impaired driving by providing a safe and convenient way home. It is also yet another transportation option for residents to travel and a welcomed service to our city,” added the retired Mountie turned mayor.

As B.C. continues to re-open amid COVID, Metro Vancouverites are more inclined to explore the area again, believes Ted Lee of Tourism Vancouver.

And that’s been substantiated, Lyft’s B.C. general manager Peter Lukomskyj.

Since the beginning of Phase 2, he said the company has seen rides to restaurants and bars increase by more than 500 per cent and trips to public transport and ferry terminals double, indicating people are looking to move around the region, Lukomskyj said.

“At Lyft, we’re thrilled to become the first rideshare company to serve all of Metro Vancouver. While we’re all staying closer to home this summer, we have an opportunity to really explore what our region has to offer. We’re looking forward to being a reliable, responsible, and convenient way for all Metro Vancouverites to move around our beautiful backyard,” he added.

“It’s great to see another transportation option for our citizens being launched today,” Morden said.

“Our council has been committed to ensuring that rideshare companies are able to operate with the collaborative regional approach to licensing. Congratulations to Lyft for this exciting announcement.”

Changing the risk assessment of vehicle insurance rates took effect in September 2019, shifting the cost from vehicles to individual drivers. That includes a declaration of household members, employees and others who use the insured owner’s vehicle 12 or more days in a calendar year. When that’s not disclosed, an accident triggers an additional charge on top of the deductible and premium impact of a crash claim.

This one-time “financial charge” is not a fine, ICBC clarifies in a statement July 9. ICBC calls it the UDAP, or Unlisted Driver Accident Premium. Its rate varies depending how bad the undeclared driver’s accident record is, and can go as high as $5,000 added to basic insurance, plus twice the optional insurance premium.

RELATED: Lawyers out, ICBC rates down next year, Eby says

RELATED: New B.C. drivers pay most for optional insurance

ICBC gives an actual example of how the UDAP is much more costly than what insurance would cost a bad driver:

Description: Married couple, in their 50’s, living together in Metro Vancouver. One person has no crashes, and the other has caused three at-fault crashes in 2018. The one who has caused three previous crashes isn’t listed on the policy but drives the car anyway and causes a crash this year.

What they paid for their insurance: $2,800/year

What they should have paid if both people were listed properly: $3,900/year, a difference of $1,100/year.

Unlisted Driver Accident Premium (UDAP):

Total: $8,140

Optional portion waived by ICBC: $3,140

Adjusted total: $5,000

Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. says the annual pace of housing starts rose in June as starts of multi-family projects rose, offsetting a decline in single-detached homes.

The federal housing agency says the seasonally adjusted annual rate of housing starts came in at 211,681 units in June, up from 195,453 in May.

Economists on average had expected an annual pace of 198,000 starts, according to financial markets data firm Refinitiv.

The result came as urban starts of apartments, condos and other types of multiple-unit housing projects rose 13.0 per cent to 154,602 units in June, while urban starts of single-detached homes fell 4.5 per cent to 42,073.

Rural starts were estimated at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 15,006 units.

The six-month moving average of the monthly seasonally adjusted annual rates of housing starts rose to 199,655 in June, up from 197,063 in May.

As governments roll out plans to reopen the economy in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, experts say individual Canadians need to update their own financial plan to move forward too.

The stock market crash in March and the plunge in interest rates left many investors feeling uncertain and vulnerable, while still more have been left without work.

Tina Cheung, a wealth adviser at Vancity, says it is always important to review your financial plan on a regular basis, but a review can be especially important during times like these.

“During these times of uncertainty it is important to have peace of mind, and to have that peace of mind, to achieve it, is to get a financial check up,” she said.

Investors who were shocked at the state of their investment portfolios at the end of the first quarter might breathe a sigh of relief when checking their statements for the second quarter as stock markets have rallied off their lows seen near the end of March.

However, Canada’s main stock index is still down from where it was a year ago and well off the highs it hit in February before the pandemic struck the markets.

“The effects of the pandemic on the market will eventually pass, like the global financial crisis did, but if these few months created any stress or loss of sleep, we need to go back and talk about your risk appetite,” Cheung says.

But she says if your risk appetite has not changed and your goal hasn’t changed, then it is critical to think long term and stick to your plan.

Before heading into a meeting with your adviser, it is important to have a firm grip of your budget and what your goals are for the meeting.

Cheung says you need to be prepared to have an open discussion and be ready with information like your monthly income and expenses.

For some, reviewing their financial plan may mean difficult decisions, facing depleted emergency funds due to the loss of a job and little prospect for a return to work at a level seen before the pandemic.

A poll done for TD Bank found that 38 per cent of those surveyed identified as financially vulnerable in April 2020 compared with 15 per cent in November last year. The poll also found that 13 per cent of those asked in April felt confident in their financial future compared with 20 per cent in November 2019.

If you have taken advantage of the payment deferrals offered by many lenders, you need to have a clear plan for when those deferral periods come to an end and you need to resume making payments.

Gio Bazile, a district vice-president at TD Bank, says some borrowers may start to struggle once the deferrals come to an end if their income hasn’t picked back up again.

“Part of what is going to be really critical is understanding what your future cash flow is going to look like and how do you work with your financial adviser with an impending financial hardship, how do you best balance your wants and needs,” he said.

Bazile says everyone is going to face their own situation, but it’s key to have a candid conversation with your partner or family to understand where you are financially.

“If your cash flow is low or if you are kind of over-leveraged from a debt perspective, then that’s probably a time to actually spend some time with your financial adviser,” he said.

“If you’re looking at your savings account and realizing, wait a minute, I may not be able to get through this next two, three months and beyond, that’s probably another really big trigger.”

The B.C. Services Card mobile app now allows card holders to send a picture and a short video of themselves to the Service B.C. office for verification. The new option is added to the live video call verification that was launched in June 2019, so people can apply at any time of the day or night. For submitted video, an email will be sent back once the verification is complete.

As might be expected, the citizens’ services ministry has created a how-to video showing the options for online verification of the mobile app. (See video below.)

The most popular use for video verification of the mobile app is student aid, with more than 53,000 post-secondary students having used the live video option to apply for loans through StudentAidBC in the past year. The mobile app can also be used to pay students loans and health-related bills, get access to personal health information, and view and manage personal income tax and benefit information.

The mobile app can also be used to submit a personal freedom of information request and receive records electronically.

Opposition MLAs are highlighting the crisis of some strata property owners, facing double or triple rate increases, huge jumps in deductible amounts and in some cases refusal to insure at all. Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister Selina Robinson says a bill before the B.C. legislature tightens rules for depreciation reports and allows the use of reserve funds to pay skyrocketing insurance costs.

The impact of construction and maintenance issues on strata insurance was highlighted in a report June 16 by the newly established B.C. Financial Services Authority. But examples from B.C. tell a different story, of new buildings with no water or other damage claim history facing huge increases.

Langley MLA Mary Polak said she can identify “row upon row of brand-new townhomes” that are facing huge increases. “This isn’t about depreciation reports,” Polak told the legislature July 7. “It’s not about maintenance.”

One of those is the Prestwick townhouse complex in Langley, where the strata president was informed three days before the insurance came due that the premium was rising from $88,000 to $250,000. The complex is two years old and has no insurance claims, the president told the Langley Advance Times.

Robinson said the problem arose last fall and the government is moving as quickly as possible. But the COVID-19 pandemic has added enormous costs to the provincial budget, leaving few options to provide the immediate relief that opposition MLAs are calling for.

RELATED: Insurance shock for Langley townhouse owners

RELATED: Insurance up 40% province-wide, water claims cited

Surrey-Cloverdale MLA Marvin Hunt described a constituent named Diana, faced with a 280 per cent jump in premiums that forced the strata to dip into their capital reserve funds to pay for it.

“But that’s not any kind of a solution,” Hunt said. “As Diana says, ‘we can’t do that every year. We’ll run out of our funds’.”

Abbotsford West MLA Mike de Jong said there are thousands of property owners across the province who face the same situation, with monthly strata fees growing larger than mortgage payments. Using capital reserves to cover insurance depletes the savings accumulated to keep up with necessary maintenance like replacing roofs, de Jong said.

(B.C. transportation ministry)

The B.C. NDP government’s union-restricted road construction program is sparking new questions about a steep increase in costs, even as a section of Trans-Canada Highway widening work has been significantly scaled back.

Widening the Trans Canada Highway east of Kamloops is one of three major projects the NDP government designated for what it describes as “community benefits agreements.” They restrict the workforce to 19 mostly U.S.-based construction trade unions under a 336-page agreement with a new Crown corporation created to administer it. The others are replacement of the Pattullo Bridge at Surrey, and the Broadway subway extension in Vancouver.

The latest contract to be let under the agreement is for a section of Highway 1 at Salmon Arm, announced in June at a budget of $185 million, including $31 million from Ottawa. The announcement by Transportation Minister Claire Trevena explained the reduced size, three-year delay and $61 million increase in costs was because the 2016 project was completed without sufficient engineering and local engagement work.

Kamloops-South Thompson MLA Todd Stone, the former B.C. Liberal transportation minister, said the work was done by 2017, including consulting the Neskonlith Band. Questioned on the project by Stone and Shuswap MLA Greg Kyllo, Trevena said there is still no agreement with Neskonlith to proceed with a large portion of the widening.

Stone said the 9.9 km project has been reduced to 4.9 km, “with a two-lane section stuck in the middle between Hoffman’s Bluff and Chase West,” and elimination of an underpass.

“These massive cost overruns and project scope reductions are the direct result of the NDP delaying these projects for upwards of three years, on top of additional costs in the millions of dollars resulting from the NDP’s imposition of community benefit agreements requiring projects to utilize labour of one of 19 NDP approved unions,” Stone told Black Press July 6.

Trevena said agreement with Neskonlith is needed for the federal share of the money to be provided, and other costs were affected by a “hot market” for construction, up until the COVID-19 pandemic had broad effects on the economy.

“I think what we have now is the realistic budget,” Trevena said.

A tight construction labour market and high prices for steel and asphalt were also cited in the 35-per cent jump in cost for the first contract awarded under the union agreement, east of Revelstoke.

Trevena noted the first Salmon Arm contract went to a Kamloops-based company, and said the new union structure ensures more local, female and Indigenous people being hired as apprentices. That claim has been a source of bitter dispute with newer unions and non-union construction companies, who say they employ 85 per cent of people currently working in construction trades.

Premier John Horgan and the B.C. and Yukon Building Trades say it’s the completion of apprenticeships that is most important, and traditional building trades have an edge there.

RELATED: Contractors picked for Pattullo Bridge replacement

RELATED: Cost jumps 35% for Revelstoke widening section

The new Crown corporation, B.C. Infrastructure Benefits, controls payroll, union dues and benefits for designated public projects. It diverts an additional 25 cents per hour worked to a new union organization called the Allied Infrastructure and Related Construction Council of B.C., and another seven cents per hour to building trades union funds for health and safety.

Non-union or independent union-affiliated companies can still bid on projects, but their employees are required to join one of the designated international unions within 30 days of starting work.

When the $1.38 billion contract to build a new Pattullo Bridge was awarded in January, Trevena acknowledged that the union-only deal would add about seven per cent to the cost. The 83-year-old four-lane bridge is being replaced with another four-lane bridge with added pedestrian and bicycle lanes, and a new off-ramp to Highway 17, the South Fraser Perimeter Road.

Who doesn’t love adorable fluffy kittens?

Their playful and firey like charm makes them irresistible, and let’s not get started on their giant like eyes and paws they have yet to grow into.

With that said, July 10, of every year marks National Kitten Day, a day intended to remind us that while kittens are well equipped to find their way into our hearts, many don’t find homes. Often kittens are either abandoned on the road, left wild and feral, or forgotten at a shelter.

National Kitten Day was founded by Colleen Paige, pet and family lifestyle expert, author and animal advocate. Paige wanted a day to highlight the fight kittens face in shelters and to encourage safe adoption. In light of the recent restrictions the pandemic has sprung on the world, more people are spending longer hours at home making it the perfect or should we say ‘purr-fect’ time to gain a companion which would make a difference in a kitten’s life.

READ MORE: Box of kittens found on median of busy B.C. street

Instead of purchasing a kitten from the pet store this year, adopt from a shelter.

How to get started:

Call your local shelter or animal welfare organization and complete necessary forms and background checks. Some organizations may provide financial support for foster parents, while others may not be offering support at this time due to COVID-19.

Before:

Involve the whole family in the fostering conversation. Will kids be responsible for feeding the new ‘roommate’? How will your family tolerate future adoption? Do your current pets tolerate other animals OK? The new pet is a big change for everyone, so allow everyone to weigh in, and suggest how they would like to help care for the pet. Adjusting to a new environment can be a daunting task for new pets. Many animals can jump onto high surfaces or squeeze into the smallest of spaces. To protect foster pets in a new environment and to safeguard your belongings, it’s recommended to animal-proof your entire house. Pay attention to any small or dangerous objects, such as pins, needles, paper clips, nails, staples, thread, string, rubber bands, caustic/toxic chemicals, mothballs, plants, and any other potentialy dangerous items.

After:

Make sure your pet is up-to-date on vaccinations. Many infectious diseases for pets are preventable through vaccinations, including Canine Influenza, Leptospirosis (which can be transmitted to people) and Lyme. Pets at varying ages have different nutrient requirements, so consider assessing your pet’s food and adjust accordingly. It is recommended to professionally groom your pet every four to six weeks. While that may not be possible at the moment, between salon appointments, use at-home grooming tools such as a cat or dog-specific toothbrush and specially formulated toothpaste, a nice rubber brush to help de-shed and invigorate the skin and coat, ear cleaner and cotton balls to gently cleanse the ears, and wipes for cleaning around the face, mouth and eyes.

The bear likely roamed Kitsumkalum Valley north of Terrace for many years prior to being relocated. (B.C. Conservation Officer Service photo)

Terrace conservation officers relocated a Spirit bear far into the wilderness to keep it away from human residential areas.

The bear got into a freezer situated outside a cabin in Rosswood, a small rural community north of Terrace, said Tracy Walbauer of the Terrace Conservation Officer Service.

“I’m not sure if he actually fed on anything in the freezer, but there was fish in the freezer and then we intervened immediately,” he said.

Conservation officers moved the bear about 50 km further into the wilderness.

“It’s still within its home range, so it could work its way back, but its got a big home range,” Walbauer said.

Walbauer said the bear is about 15 years old and has likely roamed the area for years.

“We believe it’s probably a 15-year-old bear, maybe 16 years old, based on his size, his teeth, and reports of a big Kermode bear in the area for that long,” he said, noting that the bear was large. “It was a big bear for sure. Probably 350 lbs. to 400 lbs.”

Spirit bears, also known as Kermode bears, are black bears with white fur resulting from a rare genetic mutation. They are primarily found in northern B.C.

Because Spirit bears are rare, conservation officers are far more likely to relocate them instead of killing them when they become too close to humans.

“When we catch them, we immobilize them, we look at them, make sure they’re in good shape, there’s no injuries, there’s no abscessed teeth or anything like that, and if they’re a candidate for being moved … that’s what we do,” Walbauer said. “Especially with Kermodes. We don’t do that with black bears. Conflict black bears we typically dispatch.”

Rowling drew outrage on Twitter, in a story on June 6, 2020. (File photo by THE ASSOCIATED PRESS)

Dozens of artists, writers and academics have signed an open letter decrying the weakening of public debate and warning that the free exchange of information and ideas is in jeopardy amid a rise in what they call “illiberalism.”

J.K. Rowling, Salman Rushdie and Margaret Atwood are among dozens of writers, artists and academics to argue against ideological conformity in an open letter in Harper’s Magazine. The letter comes amid a debate over so-called cancel culture — where prominent people face attack for sharing controversial opinions.

“The forces of illiberalism are gaining strength throughout the world and have a powerful ally in Donald Trump, who represents a real threat to democracy,’’ the letter said. “But resistance must not be allowed to harden into its own brand of dogma or coercion—which right-wing demagogues are already exploiting. The democratic inclusion we want can be achieved only if we speak out against the intolerant climate that has set in on all sides.’’

Rowling, for example, has attracted criticism over her views on transgender issues, which have angered many activists. In a series of tweets, Rowling said she supported transgender rights but did not believe in “erasing” the concept of biological sex.

The comments prompted Daniel Radcliffe and other cast members of the Potter films to publicly disagree with her. Rowling was unmoved, but was attacked for weeks online.

The letter criticized the state of public debate and the “swift and severe retribution” dealt out to any perceived wrongs. It decried an “intolerance of opposing views, a vogue for public shaming and ostracism, and the tendency to dissolve complex policy issues in a blinding moral certainty.’’

“The way to defeat bad ideas is by exposure, argument, and persuasion, not by trying to silence or wish them away,” the letter said. “We refuse any false choice between justice and freedom, which cannot exist without each other.

Other signatories included Noam Chomsky, Gloria Steinem and Malcolm Gladwell.

A Great Pyrenees dog has been reunited with his family after spending three days lost around Castlegar and swimming back and forth across the Columbia River.

Mary Hummel first noticed her dog Jasper was missing from their South Castlegar home early in the morning on Friday, July 3. She immediately began searching the neighbourhood and posting on social media.

“He is hard to miss, since he is white and weighs 140 pounds,” said Hummel.

The first report of a sighting came in from a boater later that day. He had seen Jasper on the banks of the Columbia River across from Genelle. Hummel searched the area, but was not able to find the dog.

The next sighting was reported Saturday morning, this time back on the other side of the river in Genelle. Once again Hummell rushed to find the dog, but without success. The scenario repeated itself several times throughout Saturday.

“He is a three year old that had never been away from home and he was really scared, so when he was approached by people, he fled,” she explained.

Later Saturday, Hummel was called by some campers who had seen Jasper floating down the river, once again on the opposite side from Genelle. They coaxed him to shore and he remained at their camp site for a while. But by the time a boater from Genelle took the owners across the river to rescue him, Jasper had disappeared again. The campers reported Jasper was weak, and had refused the food they had offered.

“We searched for a long time, but the country is so rugged, we did not find him,” said Hummel.

Sunday was a long day for Hummel as sighting of Jasper stopped coming in.

“We both thought he maybe succumbed to the river,” she said.

“We prayed and cried for a miracle.”

Finally, two more calls came in, both near the campsite where Jasper was last seen on Saturday. Hummel’s husband Brent bushwhacked looking for him, again all to no avail.

A Genelle resident then approached the Hummels, offering the use of his drone to search for the dog.

“We knew this might be Jasper’s last chance, so we came back with a guy that could report GPS coordinates,” said Hummel.

But the search was unsuccessful.

With plans to go back out the next day, the Hummels headed back towards Castlegar.

One of them said, “This isn’t like Hollywood, where your dog just comes out of the woods running toward you.”

But, that is exactly what happened.

“A miracle happened,” said Hummel. “Right in the middle of the road — there was Jasper.”

Hummel says Jasper is very weak, has lost weight and has sore paws, but otherwise is doing fine.

She says the real heroes of the story are the residents of Genelle, who along with other boaters and campers continued to help search and try to rescue Jasper.

“They shone as a community,” said Hummel.

“The community of Genelle came alive. I am so thankful.”

A polyphemus moth, usually active at night, was spotted in broad daylight in Victoria on Friday, June 26. (Chantal Contorines photo)

Chantel Contorines was walking with her daughter, Sofia, when the nine-year-old spotted an unusually large insect lying the ground in a Victoria parking lot.

“I did a double-take because I couldn’t believe my eyes,” said the Victoria resident. Sitting on the ground was a moth the size of her hand, fluttering its wings. “It looked like a tarantula had mated with a moth.”

After quickly snapping a photo, the pair went back to their car outside HomeSense along Cloverdale Avenue and took a closer look. Immediately, they squirmed at the sight of the fuzzy antennae, plump body and large legs.

Royal BC Museum confirmed the duo spotted a polyphemus moth, one of the largest insects in B.C. According to entomology researcher Claudia Copley, it was clearly a male, as the feathery antennae are used to pick up pheromones from females.

“[They’re] not often seen because they are active as adult moths at night,” Copley explained. “Sometimes they turn up at people’s porch light and then are reported to me here at the museum. The wings are beautiful, especially the top view.”

Polyphemus moths are known for the fake eye spots on their wings that can startle predators with their owl-like facade. Most larvae eat foliage from broad-leaved trees and shrubs, including birch, hickory, maple, oak, willow, grape and a handful of rose-type bushes. By the time they become adults, they only mate.

Notably, Copley said these moths are completely harmless.

“As long as it lands on my child and not on me, I’ll be alright,” joked Contorines. “It’s a beautifully ugly creature.”

Jill McDevitt watched the conversation about face masks evolve over the last couple of months and realized it looked familiar.

This isn’t the first time public health officials have needed to convince people to wear something they didn’t want to wear in an effort to slow the spread of a serious virus, she says.

As a sexologist, McDevitt hopes the lessons from society’s approach to condom usage since the 1980s can be applied to face masks today.

“I was hearing about people getting very angry at others not wearing masks and it reminded me a lot of the conversation with not wanting to wear condoms,” said McDevitt, a San Diego-based sexuality educator, wellness coach and University of Waterloo graduate.

“Health organizations years ago were getting very angry and shame-based with the way they tried to make people use condoms. But we have gotten better at delivering the message in an effective manner over the last 40 years.

“So we’ve already done this work. We’ve already learned these lessons.”

ALSO READ: Should non-medical masks be mandatory in Canada?

McDevitt posted a widely shared list on her Facebook page last week highlighting ways to help convince people to wear face masks.

Among them was avoiding guilt-based methods, like shaming people online when they don’t wear masks in public; making sure face masks are accessible; and educating people on the risks of not wearing them.

But the biggest positive change, McDevitt says, needs to be making sure leaders and public health officials are on the same page with their messaging.

“We’ve all heard: wear the condom, wear the condom. But with masks, at first it was ‘don’t wear a mask,’ and now it’s ‘wear a mask,’ and every place has different policies,” she said.

“But as far as what happens on an individual level, I think normalizing it, learning how to have the tough conversations with people in our lives who don’t want to wear masks — not shaming people. I think those things are in our control.”

Hilary Bergsieker, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Waterloo, agrees that messaging needs to be consistent in order to get people to comply. She said some non-mask wearers in Canada may be dealing with a lack of trust in public officials who stressed early in the pandemic that masks weren’t effective but have since changed their tune.

Some of those people won’t have a choice anymore though. Cities like Toronto and Ottawa have bylaws taking effect Tuesday for face coverings in enclosed public spaces.

Other Canadian cities or provinces have also implemented face-covering rules in various settings. Quebec recently extended its face-mask rule province-wide on all public transit, coming into effect mid-July.

Canada’s public health officials say a non-medical mask or face covering can reduce the spread of a person’s own infectious respiratory droplets. This matches the advice of other health agencies including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, which say face coverings help reduce the spread of COVID-19 in public settings, especially when physical distancing is not possible to maintain.

Despite the medical advice, Bergsieker says there are numerous reasons why people take issue with mask-wearing mandates.

Social media has shown us plenty of examples, like a video shared on Twitter of a woman screaming at a 7-11 employee in Texas after being asked to wear a mask in the store. Last week a Toronto woman posted a video of herself refusing to wear a mask in a hospital.

“Some of it is ideological. Whenever you tell people to do something you can engender a psychological state called reactance, which is basically this resistance to having freedom curtailed,” Bergsieker said. “As soon as somebody says ‘do this’ that makes you automatically at some level not want to do this.

“That’s particularly true if there are inconveniences and minor costs associated with the behaviour in question.”

Bergsieker says mask-wearing mandates will be effective — especially “if they have teeth” in the form of a fine or citation. People will comply with laws, she added, but that doesn’t mean they’ll be “psychologically convinced” the behaviour is necessary.

Harris Ali, a sociology professor at York University, says changing peoples’ behaviour takes time. But it can be done.

He likened mask-wearing to seatbelts, pointing to initial skepticism from citizens when provinces began enacting those laws too.

“At first everyone was like, ‘Oh, I don’t like this, this feels uncomfortable.’ And now we’re so used to it that we actually feel uncomfortable not wearing the seatbelt,” he said. “So slowly, gradually, there was a transformation in our thoughts.

“Right now it could be that people are feeling uncomfortable wearing masks, but you become more comfortable as it becomes more prevalent and it loses its novelty, and therefore it’s stigma.”

But how do we get to that point?

Ali says one way is in seeing the leaders, politicians and celebrities we respect and admire — “whoever the influential people in the society are” — wearing masks.

Bergsieker agrees role models can be effective in changing peoples’ attitudes. And like McDevitt, she doesn’t believe online shaming to be a strong influencer.

In fact, it can have the opposite effect.

“Online shaming can motivate people only if there’s a sense that the people whose opinion you value are going to see what you’ve done and disapprove,” Bergsieker said. “So if people who are refusing to wear masks think that their peers, the audience they care about, will actually think they’re being bold or brave or standing up for their principles, then public shaming like that will backfire.”

McDevitt says people need to be honest about the realities of COVID-19 when trying to convince others to wear face masks, but not rely on a fear-based approach.

She recalled a video she was shown in the 1980s that insinuated anyone who had sex would die by contracting HIV.

“We can talk about (COVID) like, ‘hey, this is a deadly virus,’ but when we’re honest about the whole thing, people are more apt to listen,” she said. ”A whole generation of people in the ’80s were told ’you’re gonna get AIDS and die if you have sex,’ and when that didn’t happen they stopped believing anything sex educators said for a while.”

McDevitt also says we need to allow for adaptations for those who can’t wear masks.

Things like face shields might be a suitable solution for an asthmatic, just as those with latex allergies have other options for condoms now.

“Whenever you’re just like: ‘you’re a jerk, wear a mask,’ we’re missing opportunities to have conversations,” she said.

“But of course there is also a flagrant disregard for others that has been common (among) some people who don’t want to wear masks, and that comes from a lack of empathy in a lot of spaces. … So I think the whole conversation is missing a lot of compassion.”

A hiker pauses on Chairback Mountain overlooking Long Pond on the 100-Mile Wilderness section of the Appalachian Trail north of Monson, Maine, in this September 2004 file photo. COVID-19 restrictions on camping site reservation and other forms of travel have led to increased demand and system bottlenecking, so when reservations opened across British Columbia on June 1, they went quickly. THE CANADIAN PRESS/AP/Robert F. Bukaty

On her first camping trip of the summer, hiker and adventure blogger Taryn Eyton was surrounded by more company than usual.

The Vancouverite, who works as a volunteer trainer with Leave No Trace Canada, normally spends large chunks of each summer outdoors. But COVID-19 restrictions on site reservation and other forms of travel led to increased demand and system bottlenecking, so when reservations opened across B.C. on June 1, they went quickly. She and her sister were lucky to snag a few June days in a provincial park just outside of Whistler.

As an experienced camper, the packing list is something she has down pat. But for many first-timers, knowing what to bring can be a challenge — one that quickly becomes expensive if you’re not careful when shopping for gear.

“A lot of people get intimidated by the idea of camping being all this gear that you need, all this special stuff,” she says. “If you go to a popular provincial park on a long weekend you’ll see people with just incredible camp setups. All power to them … [but] you really don’t need all that stuff.”

Eyton says campers on a budget should prioritize covering the necessities: Warmth and shelter.

If there’s anything to spend money on, she says, it’s a well-made tent. “The bare bones tent is probably going to leak or fall apart,” Eyton notes. While a high-quality tent may set you back a few hundred dollars, it’s likely to last two to three times as long as one that costs closer to 50 (but if the former is outside your price range, a tarp can serve as a suitable backup to cover holes in the event of a leak.)

The same rule applies to sleeping bags, with slightly more flexibility, Eyton says. A warm, well-made sleeping bag (at a few hundred dollars) is a plus if you’re planning to camp into the colder seasons, but for summer camping alone, a lighter, less expensive bag should suffice. If you’re worried about getting cold, pack a few fleece or wool blankets from home as an addition.

And air mattresses, while comfortable, are not always worth it, Eyton says: Foam sleeping pads typically offer more insulation from the ground and run at a similar price point. If any piece of gear is too expensive to justify buying at all, check your local gear outfitter or MEC branch for rentals, a short-term alternative to purchasing equipment you may never use again.

Shane Devenish, executive director of the Burlington, Ontario-based Canadian Camping and RV Council, says demand for both tent and RV camping has been at an all-time high since the start of June.

“It’s being perceived as one of the safest ways to go on vacation and take a road trip,” Devenish says.

Devenish notes that the budget-conscious should also take mileage into account when calculating the cost of a trip, especially in an RV or larger rental vehicle. “It’s better to have the expectations before you go,” he says, “rather than disappointment, or you’re pretty upset when you’ve got to go to the gas station so much.”

Beyond these upfront costs, camping remains one of the most affordable ways to spend a summer, Devenish adds. Eyton echoes the sentiment, and notes that an open-minded attitude and respect for nature are the only other essentials to take with you.

“It might rain, it might be cold, there might be bugs,” she says. “[Have] a plan for those things and how you’re going to deal with it and still have fun.”

A new poll suggests turbulence ahead when it comes to the airlines winning public support for their current COVID-19 plans. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darryl Dyck

A new poll suggests turbulence ahead for airlines seeking public support for their current COVID-19 plans.

Seventy-two per cent of Canadians surveyed by Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies say they’re not comfortable flying since a decision by some airlines to relax their own in-flight physical distancing requirements.

As of July 1, Air Canada and WestJet both ended policies blocking the sale of adjacent seats.

The measure was seen to align with a guidance document for the aviation industry issued by Transport Canada in April to help curb the spread of COVID-19.

Among other things, the department had suggested passengers should be widely spaced when possible, though they did not make it mandatory.

Airlines, however, are required to make passengers and air crews wear masks.

Only 22 per cent of those surveyed said they’re comfortable getting aboard with no in-flight physical distancing and a requirement to wear masks.

There’s more to it to keep flights safe, WestJet said in a statement last week after critics attacked its plan.

“What makes an airplane, and the entire journey, safe is the layers of enhanced cleaning, the wearing of masks and the hospital-grade HEPA filters that remove 99.999 per cent of all airborne particles,” the airline said.

“The hygiene standards we have now are world-class and backed by industry experts.”

Critics have also previously pounced on the airlines for another move: refusing to fully refund tickets for flights cancelled due to the pandemic.

Thousands of people have beseeched Transport Minister Marc Garneau to compel airlines to issue refunds, but he has refused, arguing that mandating reimbursements from a sector that’s lost more than 90 per cent of its revenue would cripple the industry.

But 72 per cent of those polled say they totally oppose his decision.

In lieu of refunds, the airlines have offered vouchers but the poll suggests that it may take a while before people will rebook previously cancelled trips: 85 per cent of those surveyed told pollsters they have no plans to travel outside the country by the end of the year.

The survey polled 1,517 people and can’t be assigned a margin of error because online polls are not considered truly random.

Pollsters were in the field between July 3 and 5, a historically popular few days for Canadians and Americans to be on the move between the two countries, given the July 1 Canada Day holiday and the U.S.’s July 4 Independence Day.

But the border remains closed to non-essential traffic, and the majority of Canadians surveyed said they feel it needs to stay that way. The current mutual closure agreement is due to expire July 21.

Of Canadians polled, 86 per cent said they totally disagreed with re-opening the border at the end of July, allowing Americans back into the country.

Americans seem more eager both to head north and to welcome Canadians south; 50 per cent agreed the border should re-open and 36 per cent disagreed.

The potential for cross-border transmission of the virus has been a key factor in the decision to keep the border closed. Currently, rates of COVID-19 infection in the U.S. continue to climb, while in Canada the curve appears to be on a downward trajectory nearly everywhere.

Still, the survey suggests Canadians don’t feel they are out of the woods. Thirty-nine per cent believe the worst is yet to come, while 35 per cent believe the worst of the crisis has passed.

In the U.S., 42 per cent of those surveyed felt the darkest days are ahead, 25 per cent believe the U.S. is in the middle of the worst part now while 21 per cent think that’s already passed.

Animals in their natural habits are known to amaze the human eye, and bald eagles are no exception – but it’s not every day their magnificence is caught on a cellphone camera.

Grant, who took to Twitter to share slow-motion footage Sparrow captured of a bald eagle snatching a fish up from the water, said his uncle “was out doing what our ancestors did and caught something that will make you smile.”

No surprise, the captivating video was already viewed nearly 500,000 times as of Saturday morning (July 4).

Bringing in young, new talent can be vital to helping companies meet their evolving needs.

For BC businesses of all sizes, the Innovator Skills Initiative grant program, administered by New Ventures BC, can help make that happen.

“We love that the grant is flexible, encompasses lots of roles and has few restrictions. Even the whole application process is online,” says Craig Marsden, from the Lower Mainland-based Traction on Demand, which used the program to hire a finance intern who took on day-to-day financial tasks during her three terms.

“After our interns go back to school and graduate, we often have a full-time job lined up for them. In fact, 70 per cent of our interns come back as full-time employees. When we recognize talented workers we try to help them stick around,” Marsden says.

The non-profit New Ventures BC works to recognize, encourage and develop entrepreneurship and innovation in B.C.’s start-up technology sector, explains Rachel Burns, New Ventures’ ISI Grant Program Manager.

Results of these initiatives have included thousands of new jobs, enhanced entrepreneurial skills, increased investment, technology commercialization and economic growth for B.C.

Through the Innovator Skills Initiative grant program, tech companies, startups, businesses and non-profit organizations receive up to $10,000 a year to hire a BC post-secondary student.

Applications are open to all BC companies, with grants available for May 1, 2020 to April 30, 2021.

Here’s how it works:

Applications are accepted on first-come, first-served, rolling basis. During the current COVID-19 concerns, staff are evaluating grants remotely and processing as usual. For companies facing hardship due to COVID-19 that can’t meet certain eligibility requirements, Burns encourages them to check in. “We are here to support you and will provide exceptions on a case-by-case basis,” she says.

The program provides flexibility regarding start times, end dates and payouts, and can include hiring a student who is working from home or remotely.

Businesses provide students with entrepreneurial and business training, and match grant funding.

Students must be enrolled or returning to an accredited BC-based post-secondary school and cannot be in co-op.

The grant can potentially be stacked with other funding and can be stacked with Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS).

Funding is provided by Innovate BC and the Province of BC

When you’re ready, we’re here for you.

That’s the message Black Press Media shares with the businesses and organizations in their communities throughout BC, Central Alberta and Yukon.

“We are living in unprecedented times brought about by the implications of COVID-19, but just as our journalists work tirelessly to bring you timely, accurate news as it happens, your Black Press Media team is also here to help local businesses successfully move though this crisis,” says Randy Blair, Black Press Media Chief Operating Officer.

With concerns about how COVID-19 is affecting all aspects of our lives, people are turning to their trusted local community news source more than ever before:

Reach 7 out of 10 adults in your local community

Canadians are consuming more than 1 million page views per day across our digital news platforms

1 million social media followers are highly active and engaged

4.1 million monthly unique views

79%+ increase in visits to our news platforms compared to the same period last year

To aid businesses in their recovery, innovations are needed, and for that, Black Press Media is offering advertisers a new Business Continuity Communication Plan that will be rolled out based on the timetable and needs of each individual business.

Your Communication Plan

Designed for local businesses experiencing difficulties during these challenging times, this multimedia campaign offers three packages, priced in keeping with the promise ‘We’re in This Together.’

You’ll receive comprehensive web, social and print options, based on your selected communication package.

Our team of expert marketing consultants can arrange for a one-on-one webinar to review your marketing needs and business objectives.

Options include:

Social media advertising across Facebook and Instagram

Targeted online advertising to a defined audience

Print advertising in your local community newspaper

Carousel gallery-style ads highlighting individual products

Storytelling; featured articles on your business engaging consumers in your brand, products and service

Providing both flexibility and our proven ability to reach your customers, the two-month campaigns begin with the date of your first ad. So, if your first ad runs May 2, your two-month campaign ends on July 1. This approach puts the decision on when to start the campaign in your hands.

“We appreciate that these are equally challenging times for you, your employees and your families. Our role, as your community partner, is to be there for you as soon as you’re ready to go to market,” Blair says.

When you’re ready, Black Press Media is ready

The Choice is yours! – Surrey Now-Leader,[],2020-03-16 06:00:00-07:00,"Lottery spokesperson Erin Cebula shows off the Vancouver Grand Prize condo, located at Pinnacle on the Park near False Creek – part of a $2.5-million Grand Prize package.

Live where you love.

That’s the theme of this year’s Grand Prizes in BC Children’s Hospital’s Choices Lottery: win the draw and you can choose your very own dream home in your favourite location – South Surrey (Morgan Creek), Tsawwassen, downtown Kelowna, Squamish, Vancouver (Olympic Village), Courtenay (Crown Isle), or downtown Victoria.

Or, you can choose $2.2 million tax-free cash.

“This year’s grand prize packages are the best yet!” says Erin Cebula, Choices Lottery spokesperson. “The home located in Morgan Creek, South Surrey, is truly one of a kid. It is 6,225 square feet, with four bedrooms, two guests suites, seven bathrooms, and a double-car garage.”

And there’s more to this year’s biggest biggest prize, built by Red Tree Creative Homes, in one of the province’s finest and most serene golf course communities: it features a gym and yoga room, high-tech features, and elegant styling and design, a main floor bar and even a personal library office – plus a jaw-dropping walk-in closet. And it comes in a $2.9 million Grand Prize package.

So, it’s a true suburban oasis. Or live in the heart of outdoor recreation – in a 3,656 square-foot ‘Sea-to-Sky’ home in Squamish – or in sunny Tsawwassen, with a modern home steps away from Centennial Beach. There’s also the downtown Kelowna option, with a brand-new condo at ONE Water Street, an exciting luxury development with views spanning Okanagan Lake.

And there are two Vancouver Island options – a home at Crown Isle golf and resort community in Courtenay, or a unique townhome in downtown Victoria, steps form the Legislature and James Bay!

And last but not least, one of this year’s most popular Grand Prize homes is a 3-bedroom condo at Pinnacle on the Park – a terrific chance to own Vancouver real estate in the heart of Olympic Village, False Creek:

Help Kids Shine: By purchasing a Choices Lottery ticket, you’re helping shape the future of child health. As the only hospital in the province devoted exclusively to kids, over a million count on BC Children’s for care they often can’t get anywhere else. And thanks to your support, the hospital can improve their lives today and define the future of children’s health care for generations to come.

“Funds from Choices Lottery will make it possible for BC Children’s Hospital to expand and expedite critical research that will ultimately help to improve care of children, from babies to teens, across B.C. and the Yukon,” said Teri Nicholas, president and CEO of BC Children’s Hospital Foundation.

“Beyond treating sick and injured children, our ultimate vision is to keep them healthy through new treatments and enhanced care made possible through research. Lottery proceeds provide our research team with the support it needs to take its initiatives to the next level.”

You can order your Choices Lottery tickets at bcchildren.com – and if you order before Midnight, Thursday, March 26, you’ll get in the Early Bird Draw to win $350,000 in prizes!

Tickets start at 3 for $100, 6 for $175, 9 for $250, and 20 for $500. You can also order tickets for the 50/50 PLUS and Daily Cash PLUS extra games.",[]

Gaining confidence in yourself can have a positive effect in every area of your life.

Toastmasters International, which has nearly 30 clubs between Surrey and Langley, can take credit for creating its fair share of confident people, through its programs teaching public speaking, communication and leadership skills, says Michael Bown, a District Director in B.C. for the organization.

“We support people with a number of things, but communications and leadership are the bread and butter, all resulting in greater confidence,” he says.

Nervous? Don’t worry, you’re supported

If you’re feeling uneasy about being in a space where speaking to others is a central element, you’ll be glad to learn guests are not required to speak at their first meeting. “We want people to sit back, listen, observe and enjoy the meeting,” Bown says. “They can speak when they’re ready as it’s a self-paced program. The clubs provide a supportive and positive learning experience, and everyone is trying to improve each other.”

Modern education tools available online

If you haven’t investigated Toastmasters in a while or are just starting to get curious, its Pathways educational program may be new to you. Its 11 project-based categories range from dynamic leadership and effective coaching to innovative planning and visionary communication. Using an online assessment tool that helps determine a Path, you pick the area you’d like to improve on and follow the steps. “Pathways uses modern methods to cater to people’s specific needs and learning styles,” Bown says. “If someone wants to grow in public speaking, there’s a focus on that, or communication, management skills and more.”

Plenty of experience to draw from

Not only has ToastmastersInternational been around since 1924, the organization today has nearly 300 clubs in British Columbia alone. Within them you’ll find a mix of in-house corporate programs and community clubs, and a lot of wisdom and expertise from longtime members who have helped others achieve their public speaking, communication and leadership goals.

Get your message across in a big way

One of the exciting things happening right now within Toastmasters, Bown says, is the International Speech Contest. Individual clubs are in the process of holding in-house competitions, and winners advance through various local, District and International levels, ultimately competing in the World Championship of Public Speaking in Paris this August! Not everyone is expected to compete, but Bown says the competitions offer a good opportunity for members and their guests to hear some inspirational speaking.

Are you prepared?

Regardless of your income, learning how to prepare for tax season is key to ensuring you’re getting the most from your return.

Get organized: Your tax filing deadline may still be a way off, but there’s no time like now to start collecting everything you’ll need, starting with your income statements, such as T4s, self-employed income and investment income.

Sort your receipts: Particularly applicable for those who own their own business, with any luck, you’ve been sorting receipts throughout the year. But if busy schedules – or procrastination – has got the best of your best-laid plans, you still have time to get prepared! Try to keep all receipts in one place, ideally separated into different types of expenses, such as office equipment, utilities, meals and transportation. As an added bonus of your early organization, you’ll have lots of time to chase down missing receipts!

Decide how you’ll file: So, do you tackle your taxes on your own, or hire a tax professional? For those with a straightforward tax situation without a lot of deductions, today’s software can make it pretty simple. Employers will have already factored your taxes into your paycheques, so you’re unlikely to have huge surprises. But for a more complicated return, a tax professional can help make sense of those deductions.

Know the rules for claiming dependents: Claiming children and other dependents can be tricky, especially if you welcomed your first child in 2019 – thinking about claiming your child on your taxes is likely the last thing on your mind! This might be a good opportunity to consult a tax professional to ensure you’re claiming dependents properly, and hopefully get a little financial relief to make the cost of kids a little more manageable.

Don’t forget your deadlines: Your deadline to file as a Canadian taxpayer is April 30, or June 15 if you or your spouse is self-employed. Simple enough, right? It’s surprisingly easy to forget to file your taxes, but that can bring significant consequences, especially if you owe money on your return. Make it impossible for you to forget your tax filing deadline by:

Marking it on your calendar

Setting a reminder alarm on your phone

Writing your deadline on a notecard and putting it on the fridge, bathroom mirror, or anywhere you’ll see it every day

Setting mini goals and deadlines for each step of the tax preparation process

Options if you owe

Avoiding filing your taxes because you may not have enough money to pay what you owe? Options to cover your tax bill include a repayment plan with the government or a short-term option like an online payday loan from MyCanadaPayday.com – easy and secure.

“Our one-page online loan application will have you on your way in minutes, while our team takes care of the rest,” says Sundeep Thind, manager of MyCanadaPayday’s Surrey office. “We are Canada’s fully licensed, online payday loan specialists, and we’re happy to help you take care of that unexpected bill, so you can get back on track.”

Say you’ve undergone Physiotherapy in Surrey, but you work downtown and need a followup appointment.

Value-added services – No matter what type of service you’ve received at painPRO, if you’re needing extra elements to complement that treatment, such as exercise bands or door anchors for stretching, shockwave therapy or intramuscular stimulation (IMS or dry needling, similar to acupuncture), it’s all included in the price of the main treatment. Keeping your employees healthy and pain-free – If you’re a business owner who understands the value of keeping your staff healthy and productive, painPRO can work with you on personalized programs that do just that. It’s a great benefit that can help you attract and retain top talent!

The five-day event features an exciting offering of over 250 exhibitors, informative seminars and more. But where does one find their sea legs at such a show?

For starters, this year’s showcase of boats features a the widest range and best selection of vessels, and watercraft accessories. From canoes, kayaks and paddles boards, to run-abouts, fishing boats, surf, wake and water sport boats, to the ultra-luxurious mega yachts, there’s something for recreational boaters, professionals and hobbyists to appreciate.

The 2020 Show also features an aquatic athlete unlike any you’ve ever seen before. Twiggy, the word famous water-skiing squirrel promises to dazzle spectators during daily live performances at the event. But Twiggy is much more than just a superior athlete, she’s also a safety advocate. As a proud partner of the Canadian Safe Boating Council (CSBC), Twiggy helps to promote boating and life jacket safety. Show-goers can enjoy Twiggy’s performance on the water, while also coming away from the fun having learned some important water safety tips.

For those eager to hear about the ups and downs of a life at sea, there’s no better place to start than with the Shaw Family. Embarking on an epic, seven-year adventure around the Pacific Ocean, the Shaws began their journey as a family of four but added a fifth crew member along the way. Raising children on dry land can be tough enough as is, but when you have a raging ocean to contend with, that’s enough to leave any parent feeling seasick. Guests will be able to hear the Shaws’ story firsthand on Saturday, Feb. 8 at 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. and Sunday, Feb. 9 at 1 p.m. in the seminar rooms on the main field level of BC Place.

As in previous years, an important highlight of the Vancouver International Boat Show is Women’s Day on Saturday, Feb. 8. Featuring an experienced roster of professional mariners, the program includes a full day of informative boating seminars and guest speakers designed to educate and inspire women who are looking to learn more about the boating lifestyle, while also expanding the existing on-board knowledge of those who already have an active interest.

The Vancouver International Boat Show will be hosted in two locations, indoors at BC Place and the floating show at Granville Island. Free shuttle buses and water ferries will also be operating continuously between the two venues.

Anyone who’s soaked in the scenery of southern Vancouver Island’s rugged West Coast understands the region’s draw.

Add the temperate climate, the welcoming Sooke community and numerous outdoor adventures on your doorstep – a doorstep just 45 minutes from downtown Victoria – and it’s no wonder that buyers from across the Island and Lower Mainland are looking forward to calling the Residences on Sooke Harbour home!

In fact, “buyers from across Canada are looking to Sooke and the Residences as a place to enjoy their retirement or a fantastic vacation home,” says Jesse Fitzpatrick, who is developing the Residences with brother John and father Daniel.

Many are enjoying the opportunity to downsize from areas like Victoria and the Lower Mainland into a luxurious, waterfront residence the smaller Sooke community affords.

“It’s a great opportunity to buy new waterfront real estate and live the active lifestyle that Sooke has to offer,” Jesse reflects. “And being a condominium, the Residences also offer the freedom of locking up and travelling without having to worry about the maintenance of a larger single-family home.”

And when those destinations beckon, you can connect to the BC Ferries and Victoria International Airport in just over an hour.

Here’s why you’ll love coming home to the Residences on Sooke Harbour!

• With more than 50 per cent of the Residences sold, the limited collection of 27 luxurious homes offers spacious one, two-bedrooms and three-bedroom suites, plus liveable outdoor space on expansive decks complete with natural gas hookups.

• Boasting inviting interiors from renowned West Coast designer JC Scott, choose from two finish levels for your West Coast retreat – Harbourside, positioned to capture sweeping 180-degree ocean vistas through soaring windows, and Residences, which all enjoy views of this gateway to the Pacific Ocean. Durable oak engineered hardwood flooring, quartz countertops and wood veneer cabinets with stainless steel kitchen appliance package, roller blinds and natural gas fireplace ensure your home is as comfortable as it is beautiful.

• Stroll to town for a java at the local coffeehouse before choosing delicious dinner ingredients from the farmer’s market, complemented by selections from neighbouring craft brewery or distillery! Prefer to let someone else do the cooking? While you won’t find a lot of chain restaurants here, you’ll love the thriving, unique-to-Sooke dining options – some of the best in the region.

• How will you spend your afternoon? From an easy cycle along a former rail trail, to a challenging hike through coastal forest, both are just minutes away. Prefer paddles to pedals? Launch your kayak from the dock or load up the fishing gear – freshwater or saltwater, it’s all right here!

“One of the fastest-growing areas in B.C., Sooke offers all the benefits of an up-and-coming community with an abundance of natural amenities, all just a short way from the city.”

Built by Victoria’s well-known Homewood Constructors, construction of the Residences on Sooke Harbour is well underway with completion expected in early 2021. In addition to a small ground-floor commercial area, amenities include a private harbourside fitness studio, secure vehicle and bicycle parking and kayak storage.

Performed behind a clear plastic curtain, live music returned to Whalley Legion on Canada Day (July 1).

As part of COVID-19 control measures, the screen separated the Springsteen/Orbison tribute band from the audience during the daytime gig.

The two-piece act features Daniel Yard (as Bruce Springsteen) and Gord Rebelato (Roy Orbison), with special guest Janice Anderson as Patsy Cline.

“It was interesting playing behind a plastic curtain at Whalley legion for Canada Day yesterday, but it was a packed house,” Yard posted to the Facebook page Live Music in Surrey BC.

“First legion in the Lower Mainland to have live music. Thanks to everyone who came out for the Springsteen/Orbison show.”

During the pandemic, with capacity capped at 50 people including patrons and staff, the Legion hall will host live bands for special events only, at a temporary location at 10767 King George Blvd.

In Newton, Brewster’s Pub is advertising a “BBQ & Band” night Saturday, July 18, featuring the acoustic sounds of Sally Melo and Jay Patterson. Tickets are $12 per person for the “Customer Appreciation Day” promo.

The pub calendar also includes a Flashback! show on July 11 and The Rhythm Method band July 25.

Elsewhere, White Hart Public House continues to showcase bands on stage at the former Hook and Ladder space, including Long Run (July 11), the AC/DC tribute band Bonnie Scott (July 18) and The Gemtones (July 24), among others.

“We want to remind everyone that we have set floor plans for all shows due to covid restrictions,” pub operators posted to Facebook. “We also have curtains between some tables for safety measures, although we will always try to give everyone the best spot — we do have to follow protocol. Safety first.”

Meantime, Surrey’s online Canada Day celebration earned 45,000 views on Facebook and YouTube Live, according to city hall.

The event marked the nation’s 153rd birthday with performances by Colin James, 54-40, Bif Naked, Alex Cuba and more, in a four-hour virtual party. Canadian hockey legend Hayley Wickenheiser hosted the two-part event, which featured a morning “Family Hour” and evening concert.

The Easter Seals Drop Zone event is returning to Surrey this September.

The annual event, which raises funds for Canadians living with disabilities, is still on despite the COVID-19 pandemic.

Easter Seals describes it as a “great no-contact event” that people can still participate in during the pandemic.

“Be a superhero to persons with diverse abilities – one of the most vulnerable groups of COVID-19,” reads the website.

“Because of people like you, we can continue to provide our community with much needed programs and services: a switch to online virtual summer camps, city adventure day camps and the reopening of Easter Seals House, now that our community is returning to Vancouver for medical appointments and treatments.”

Health and safety for participants “has and always will be a top priority at Easter Seals,” and planning for the events will be moving forward following guidelines in place by local health authorities, the provincial government and WorkSafeBC.

The Surrey drop zone event is Tuesday, Sept. 15 at Central City Office Tower, with a fundraising goal of $100,000.

People can sign up at eastersealsbcy.akaraisin.com as either a team or individual.

There is also a Vancouver drop zone on Sept. 10.

Since the first drop zone in Halifax in 2003, roughly $16 million has been raised for Easter Seals programs and services.

Cordero, who was born in Hamilton, Ont., died Sunday at Cedars-Sinai hospital after more than 90 days in the hospital, according to his wife, Amanda Kloots. “God has another angel in heaven now,” she posted on Instagram. “Nick was such a bright light. He was everyone’s friend, loved to listen, help and especially talk. He was an incredible actor and musician. He loved his family and loved being a father and husband.”

Cordero entered the emergency room on March 30 and had a succession of health setbacks, including mini-strokes, blood clots, septic infections, a tracheostomy and a temporary pacemaker implanted. He had been on a ventilator and unconscious and had his right leg amputated. A double lung transplant was being explored.

The Broadway and acting community was in anguish after news of Cordero’s death, with Lin-Manuel Miranda tweeting “What a loss, what a light” and Bernadette Peters “sending love” to his widow and infant son. Many asked people to wear masks in his honour.

Viola Davis was also among those in mourning, writing to his family that “my heart is with you all.” Fellow Broadway actress and president of Actors’ Equity Association Kate Shindle wrote on Twitter that she was “heartbroken for his family and deeply saddened by the loss of this talented and widely loved actor.”

During Cordero’s hospitalization, Kloots sent him daily videos of her and their 1-year-old son, Elvis, so he could see them if he woke up, and urged friends and fans to join a daily sing-a-long. A GoFundMe page to pay for medical expenses has raised over $600,000.

“I tell him, I say, ‘You’re gonna walk out of this hospital, honey. I believe it. I know you can,’” she told “CBS This Morning” this summer. ”‘We’re gonna dance again. You’re gonna hold your son again.’ My line is, ‘Don’t get lost. Get focused.’”

The lanky Cordero originated the menacing role of husband Earl opposite his estranged wife, played by Jessie Mueller, in “Waitress” as well as the role of Sonny in Chazz Palminteri’s “A Bronx Tale.” It was at “Bullets Over Broadway” where Cordero met his wife. The two married in 2017.

Castmembers from “Waitress” — Jessie Mueller, Keala Settle, Kimik Glenn and songwriter Sara Bareilles — helped raise money for Cordero by covering his song “Live Your Life.” Sylvester Stallone sent a video with best wishes.

Kloots had said that it was difficult to tell whether Cordero understood happened to him, but said he could respond to commands by looking up and down when he was alert.

Her husband played a mob soldier with a flare for the dramatic in Broadway’s Woody Allen 1994 film adaptation of “Bullets Over Broadway,” for which he received a Tony nomination for best-featured actor in a musical. He and his family moved to Los Angeles to star in “Rock of Ages.”

On the small screen, Cordero appeared in several episodes of “Blue Bloods” and “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit” and he had a role in the film “Going in Style.”

Actor and guitarist for Bruce Springsteen Stevie Van Zandt offered Cordero his first TV acting gig in the final episode of “Lilyhammer.” After he was hospitalized, Van Zandt teamed up with Constantine Maroulis and Vincent Pastore to make a video performing “Live Your Life.”

Cordero was last onstage in a Kennedy Center presentation of “Little Shop of Horrors.” His off-Broadway credits include “The Toxic Avenger” and “Brooklynite.”

The virus has sickened other Broadway veterans, including the actors Danny Burstein, Tony Shalhoub, Brian Stokes Mitchell, Gavin Creel, Aaron Tveit and Laura Bell Bundy as well as composer David Bryan. It has also claimed the life of Tony-winning playwright Terrence McNally.

To start, the Landmark Theatre in Guildford will screen a mix of new and old movies, including Deadpool, Back to the Future, Jaws, Batman Begins, Sonic the Hedgehog, Bloodshot and Harry Potter & the Sorcerer’s Stone, among others.

A “Welcome Back” deal offers seats at $5 per movie, in all formats, via landmarkcinemas.com.

The website details new health and safety protocols at the theatre, including reduced seating capacity, a reduced number of showtimes and increased time between screenings to reduce congestion in the lobby and auditorium.

New at Landmark is a Laser Ultra “experience” that offers enhanced sight, sound and comfort for screenings of Deadpool and Star Wars: The Force Awakens.

Cineplex Cinemas Strawberry Hill will also reopen Friday with screenings of Bloodshot, Sonic The Hedgehog, The Invisible Man, The Hunt, My Spy and the Punjabi-language titles Sufna, Ik Sandhu Hunda Si and Jora: The Second Chapter. Showtimes and others details are posted to cineplex.com. The chain is also offering a $5-a-seat deal.

The Strawberry Hill theatre in Surrey is among eight to be reopened Friday by Cineplex, along with others in Burnaby, Kelowna, Langley, Nanaimo, Richmond, Vancouver and Victoria.

In early June, the independent Hollywood 3 Cinemas chain reopened theatres in Surrey and two other B.C. cities, including the Hollywood 3 in Newton, the Caprice in South Surrey, the Caprice Duncan and the Hollywood 3 Pitt Meadows.

Cineplex Inc., in this undated photo. (The Canadian Press)

B.C.’s two major theatre companies, Cineplex Inc. and Landmark Cinemas, are reopening some theatres in B.C. as the province enters Phase Three of its restart plan.

The Toronto-based movie theatre company, Cineplex, has made ticket purchases available online for a number of locations through the province, according to its website on Tuesday (June 30). Theatres which appear to be opening for viewings on Friday include locations in Nanaimo, Vancouver, Langley, Victoria and Burnaby.

There will be some changes for movie goers, however, to ensure physical distancing. This includes a staggered seating reservation system and contactless ticket purchases. Guests will not be able to use cash, except for the purchase of a gift card and will have to have exact change.

Concession options will be limited, as well.

Guests are being asked to arrive no more than 15 minutes prior to the movie start time. While masks are not mandatory, they are being recommended and those who don’t have a mask will be supplied one at no extra cost.

Behind the scenes, the movie theatre company has confirmed that seats, handrails and children’s booster seats will be wiped down with industrial-grade cleaning products between each showtime, followed by a deep-clean of the entire auditorium and lobby each evening.

The reopenings come as Cineplex vows to sue U.K.-based chain Cineworld PLC for calling off a $2.8-billion takeover of the company. On Monday, Cineplex said the COVID-19 pandemic had a “material negative effect” on its operations and resulted in a $178.4-million loss in the first quarter.

Theatre locations set to open Friday include:

Burnaby

Kelowna

Langley

Nanaimo

Richmond

Surrey

Vancouver

Victoria

Meanwhile, Landmark Cinemas will also be reopening its doors Friday, with similar safety measures.

“We ask movie lovers join us in doing their part to protect members of their community, including our employees, by staying home if they are experiencing any symptoms,” a statement from the company reads.

There, classic movies will be screened such as Jurassic Park, Jaws, The Empire Strikes Back, Wonder Woman, and ET: The Extra-Terrestrial. Tickets will be $5 through the week and $2.99 on Tuesdays.

Landmark theatres screening movies include:

Campbell River

Courtenay

Cranbrook

Dawson Creek

Fort St. John

Kelowna, Grand 10

Nanaimo

New Westminster

Penticton

Port Alberni

Surrey, Guildford

West Kelowna, Encore

Alessia Cara emerged the top winner at this year’s Juno Awards, scooping up three trophies in a pre-recorded ceremony that paired celebration with an acknowledgment that more needs to be done to represent the diverse voices of Canadian artists.

While the Junos usually mark the biggest night for the country’s music industry, the Monday event, which streamed online, took on a noticeably different tone in isolation. Missing were those euphoric acceptance speeches inside a massive venue filled with adoring fans, replaced with a handful of intimate performances and some serious reflection on the future.

Running a bit over 90 minutes, the Junos were handed out at historic speed, with 42 categories announced by presenters that included “Stranger Things” actor Finn Wolfhard and singer Jessie Reyez, who also pocketed her third career Juno during the event.

But it was the 23-year-old Cara who shone brightest as her deeply personal 2018 “The Pains of Growing” picked up both album and pop album of the year, while she also won songwriter of the year for her work on several of its tracks.

It was an uplifting finish for the Brampton, Ont.-raised pop singer after her dreams of hosting the awards show were dashed in the wake of COVID-19. She was originally lined up to be MC for the televised event in Saskatoon last March before organizers pulled the plug in response to the pandemic.

Cara was quick to jump onto Twitter after she came out on top, posting a characteristically humble “um whaaaaaaat” before retweeting congratulatory messages from a couple of her followers.

Aside from the big wins, Monday’s ceremony took on a sense of social urgency as greater awareness surrounding representation of Black, Indigenous and other artists of colour became a topic some of the presenters addressed.

CBC Radio host Odario Williams, who’s also a member of hip-hop collective Grand Analog, opened the show with a candid acknowledgment of the many shortfalls of Juno Awards past.

He noted that it took 15 years after the first ceremony in 1970 before soul and reggae artists were included in the list of categories, while it wasn’t until 1991 when the first rap recording award was given to Maestro Fresh Wes.

“I’ve got to give a shout out to the Black and Indigenous Canadian artists of the ’70s, the ’80s, the ’90s that are true pioneers in the growth of our musical landscape,” he said, pointing to Liberty Silver, who was the first Black woman to win a Juno in 1985.

While Juno organizers have made efforts to improve diversity among its nominees in recent years, president Allan Reid recognized that much work still needs to be done.

“We are committed to the long-term inclusion and amplification of Black voices and a more equitable industry for all,” he said at the outset of the show.

“We are working on an action plan with specific commitments that we will reveal this July. We must do better for our BIPOC members of the music community, and we welcome you to hold us accountable.”

A number of the night’s music performances also put the subject of racism in Canada at the forefront.

Halifax alt-pop duo Neon Dreams, who were selected as breakthrough group this year, gave a sombre performance of “We Were Kings.” The coming-of-age reflection was co-written by lead singer Frank Kadillac about his own experiences rising above stereotypes, racism and high school bullying.

Indigenous singer Iskwe went outdoors to play ”Little Star,” a song paying tribute to Colten Boushie, Tina Fontaine and the lives of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, filmed within the Mississaugas Of Scugog Island First Nation territory.

Other highlights included two-time winner Shawn Mendes, who was selected as artist of the year. “Senorita,” his duet with girlfriend Camila Cabello, won single of the year, making him the first artist to pick up that award for three consecutive years.

Breakthrough artist went to Oshawa, Ont.-born pop singer Lennon Stella, who’s already established herself as an actress on the primetime musical-drama series “Nashville.”

Avril Lavigne pocketed the fan choice award, which is voted on by viewers, for the second year in a row, and the third time in her career.

Among this year’s most surprising winners is Governor General Julie Payette, who’s a member of the Ottawa Bach Choir that won best classical album, vocal or choral.

Bryan Adams’ “Shine a Light” won adult contemporary album, giving the musician his 17th Juno win and putting him behind only Celine Dion and Anne Murray as the artist with the most Junos.

(photo courtesy Ric Wallace – WhiteRockBeach.ca)

White Rock’s promenade and pier may be open, but one popular waterfront element – the artists walk – is still missing.

And it’s not likely to reappear until plans can be worked out to allow it to operate safely under COVID-19 restrictions, according to city cultural development manager Elizabeth Keurvorst.

In a brief verbal presentation and written memo to council on June 15, Keurvorst was responding to a question to council from local artist/photographer Ric Wallace.

Wallace had asked whether the artists walk was to re-open, with physical distancing measures.

He noted that the White Rock Farmers Market is currently accepting non-food vendors; that council is taking measures – including providing picnic tables – to help support waterfront restaurants; and that even some buskers have returned to designated outdoor areas in the city.

But Keurvorst pointed out that resuming the artists walk – which in pre-pandemic times provided space on the grassy area just west of the museum to some 14 exhibiting artists – would create challenges under current provincial restrictions.

Ordinarily, individuals pay a $150 annual fee to participate in the artists walk, which enables each to set up, display and sell their artwork in a six square-metre space, and keep 100 per cent of the proceeds of sales.

“In looking at how we can restart, we look to the provincial health office, and there are two considerations that we would want to look at before re-opening the artists walk,” Keurvorst said.

“One would be physical distancing…as people walk the promenade they tend to veer onto the grass to allow for that six-foot distancing, that two-metre distancing,” she added.

“As well, the public health order has put out guidelines for farmers markets, when it comes to including artisans, but there is a market manager present to monitor that – we wouldn’t have that at the artists walk. We would need to look to the provincial health authorities’ cross-departmental team in order to look at reopening the artists walk, so there is a lot of work to do before we can open it again.”

Coun. Christopher Trevelyan asked whether there had been any consideration given to alternative locations for the artists walk.

“The short answer is no, but the same principles would apply; looking to the provincial health officer to help us with any guidance on both buskers and artists,” Keurvorst said.

Trevelyan sought, and received, assurances from Keurvorst and chief administrative officer Guillermo Ferrero, that staff is actively studying ways to bring back the artists walk.

“In concert with all the other services we’re doing, we’re looking at the Pop-Uptown Gallery, we’re looking at the artists walk, buskers and all the services we offer,” Keurvorst said.

In her memorandum, she noted that artists who exhibited in 2019, but could not this year, have been encouraged to participate in online marketing in association with the city’s Virtual Canada Day event on July 1, and also online art shows offered in partnership with Semiahmoo Arts.

“Re-thinking how the tents are set back and how walkers are able to walk between or behind to maintain physical distancing, where artwork is stored, and how far down the beach, we want to stretch, will be important for us to comply with the provincial health distancing requirements,” she wrote.

With concert venues closed and most performers staying at home without gigs, Allan Reid said he’s focused on giving this year’s Juno nominees the recognition they missed after the pandemic sidelined a weekend of accolades in Saskatoon several months ago.

But he said this year’s show, which is skipping broadcast TV and going directly to CBC Gem, will look undeniably different than ones in the past.

“This is not the Juno broadcast that you would see on television — it’s not 12 performances and six awards,” explained Reid, who serves as president of the Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (CARAS).

Instead, the show is cramming two nights of trophies into a brisk ceremony recorded in isolation.

Winners in a dizzying 42 categories will be announced over 90 minutes, putting the marquee nominees for single and album of the year in the same spotlight as more obscure ones, such as world music and children’s album.

Presenters include Toronto Raptors’ Chris Boucher and two-time Juno winner Jessie Reyez, while songs will be performed by Iskwe, Neon Dreams, the Dead South, and Alessia Cara, who was originally supposed to host the cancelled television event.

The Junos will stream on CBC Gem, and CBC’s Facebook, YouTube and Twitter pages on Monday at 7 p.m. ET.

Reid spoke with The Canadian Press about making a different sort of Junos show, how the virus is slamming the music industry, and what it all means for the 50th anniversary of the awards set for next March.

CP: There are a number of significant changes to this year’s Junos, including that Alessia Cara stepped away from hosting duties. But she’s also this year’s top nominee with six nods. How will she be involved in the show?

Reid: Alessia is going to have a one-time performance of “Rooting for You” (a song that helped her pick up the songwriter of the year nomination). It’s an exclusive premiere from her new EP called “This Summer: Live Off The Floor,” which is coming out in July. She recorded it pre-pandemic.

CP: How about Jann Arden, who was originally supposed to be inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame by Anne Murray on the broadcast? Those plans have been sidelined, but is something going to materialize later?

Reid: We felt this was not the time… those are lifetime moments. So we haven’t finalized details. We are trying to figure out how to accomplish that, whether it’s around the 50th anniversary, or another way, we’re not sure. (There were) so many disappointments with the show not happening and that was definitely one of them.

CP: Speaking of the 50th anniversary, the Junos are slated for Toronto next year to mark the momentous occasion. The celebration would be the first time in a decade that the awards have taken place in the city. But considering the virus, is that still on?

Reid: Obviously, COVID is has changed everything. As a music event that is a mass gathering — from all of our events to the broadcast — we have to be taking into consideration: What if there is a second wave? Things are still relatively unknown about what the future will hold, so we need to make plans, and alternate plans, to make sure that we can still do a celebration. But what exactly that’s going to be, right now we’re still working through. I don’t think there’s anybody who can say for sure if we’re going to be able to gather 15,000 people in the Scotiabank Arena next March.

CP: After the last-minute cancellation of the 2020 Junos, do you plan to return to Saskatoon?

Reid: We’re working on a three- to five-year plan at all times with future cities. The challenge for Saskatoon is that everything was spent — it wasn’t like we cancelled a month before the event, (it was) 48 to 72 hours. And so all the food had been delivered to the convention centre for the gala dinner, the stage was fully built, we were starting rehearsals. The whole machine was rolling. So, from an investment standpoint, it requires new investment to make that happen again. Hopefully we’ll get a chance to go back.

CP: What about the Canadian music industry as a whole? Since the country effectively shut down live entertainment, we’ve seen musicians rally for financial support from the federal government, but there’s a more uncertain road ahead for live music. You’re head of CARAS, a non-profit that supports performers, so how do you see this shaping up?

Reid: The music industry — like sports, like restaurants — has been hit incredibly hard. It’s devastating to see artists lose their livelihoods who can’t tour. Yes, we’re very fortunate to have a government that’s providing (assistance) to try to make ends meet, but I’ve had so many conversations with artists who are just going, “I don’t know much how longer I can go. I’ve got to find another way to make a living.” If they’re not on the radio and not generating that kind of performance income, it comes from performing live. And I’m extremely worried of what’s going to happen to the venues across this country. If this is prolonged from three-and-a-half months into next year, how do those venues survive? And if they go away then where do the bands go to play?

The Dixie Chicks, now The Chicks. (The Associated Press)

Grammy-winning country group The Dixie Chicks have dropped the word Dixie from their name, now going by The Chicks.

The band’s social media accounts and website were changed on Thursday to the refer to the new name for the band, which is made up of Martie Maguire, Natalie Maines and Emily Strayer. The band also recognized that the name was already in use by a band in New Zealand.

“A sincere and heartfelt thank you goes out to ‘The Chicks’ of NZ for their gracious gesture in allowing us to share their name. We are honoured to co-exist together in the world with these exceptionally talented sisters,” the band said in a statement.

The move follows a decision by country group Lady Antebellum to change to Lady A after acknowledging the word’s association to slavery. A statement on The Chicks’ website said “We want to meet this moment.” The term Dixie refers to Southern U.S. states, especially those that belonged to the Confederacy.

The Chicks, who are releasing their first new album in 14 years next month, also released a new video for their new song, “March March” that features videos and images from the recent Black Lives Matter rallies.

Lady A received criticism with their name switch after a Black singer revealed she’d been performing as Lady A for years.

The Chicks are the best selling female group in America with more than 33 million albums sold in the United States, according to the Recording Industry Association of America. Formed originally in Texas as a bluegrass group, the band hit commercial fame with their breakthrough album “Wide Open Spaces.” The band has won 13 Grammys.

The band was shunned by country radio over an incident in 2003 when lead singer Maines criticized then-President George W. Bush because of the Iraq War. They responded to the backlash with their song “Not Ready to Make Nice,” and swept the Grammys in 2007 winning three of the top all-genre categories.

It is with great sadness that we share that Robert (Rob) has passed away on April 25, 2020 due to the damage caused by the COVID-19 Virus. Rob fought valiantly after being hospitalized for over a month on a ventilator. His family sincerely appreciates the efforts of his Medical Team at Surrey Memorial Hospital, that cared for Rob and supported his family at this difficult time.

Rob, in his 75th year, is the beloved husband of Shirley Giesbrecht (Wittenberg). He is survived and deeply loved by his three children, Michael (Elaine), Dean (Candy), and daughter Kelly (Trevor) and four grandchildren Karissa, Erin, Paige and Cole, whom he cherished. He is also survived by his brothers: John (Elsie), Ralph (Shirley), Vic (Bonnie), Gerry (Rene), Philip (Heidi), and Harold (Nancy). As well as sisters in law and brothers in law: Betty and Bert, Margaret and Ken, Lynn and Wayne, Jo Ann, Bob and Laura, and numerous nieces and nephews.

Rob was born and raised in Yarrow, BC to his late parents David and Lydia Giesbrecht. He moved to the Vancouver area to attend Barber school and started his career in Surrey, BC in 1966. That same year, he met and married Shirley after a short courtship, and they were happily married for 53 years. He opened Rob’s Barber Shop in Surrey, BC shortly after, and was proud to operate the Barber Shop in the same location for over 50 years.

Rob continued to work as a Barber prior to his illness and had many loyal customers whom he considered as friends. They appreciated his friendly banter and a good haircut. Rob was also a loyal BC Lions Football Fan and long-time season ticket holder. Rob and Shirley enjoyed many games and were happy to be special guests of the Team at the 2003 Grey Cup celebrations.

Together Rob and Shirley enjoyed travelling and spending time with their family, and their home has always been a welcome and supportive place for many family and friends. He enjoyed a close relationship with all his children and grandchildren and shared with them his kindness and to not take life too seriously. Rob’s good nature was welcomed and appreciated by his many friends, co-workers, and customers.

In lieu of flowers donations can be made to the Surrey Memorial Hospital Foundation COVID-19 fund. Funeral arrangements entrusted to Valley View Funeral Home in Surrey, BC. A Celebration of Rob’s Life will be held at a later date when it is safe to do so.

We love you and will always miss you.",[]

Don Denton/Boulevard Dining area and kitchen in Ingrid Jarisz condo. Don Denton/Boulevard Couch in front room area in Ingrid Jarisz condo. Don Denton/Boulevard Dining bar and kitchen in Ingrid Jarisz condo.

Despite being on my first home tour in a long time, stepping into this Sayward Hill condo feels like slipping on a favourite pair of shoes.

I take in the compass rose laid out in the bricked pathway outside and the oversize nature photos in the tidy lobby. I make a note of the territorial hummingbird that buzzes past and the light feel of ocean in the wind. And when Ingrid, the homeowner, meets me at the front door to lead me down to her unit, I’m thrilled that she’s as warm and lovely as I’d expected by her emails.

We walk into the condo, past a home office and a den with a spectacular ‘70s-era couch, both lulling me into a “condo” mentality, and then, I stop in my socked feet, utterly surprised.

The kitchen, beautifully balanced with white and oak cabinetry and stainless steel appliances, is large and open enough to accommodate a tightly turned Viennese waltz, if the dancers are sure-footed.

The unit is just over 2,000 square feet, she tells me, a perfect middle ground between downsizing from house living and not sacrificing space and storage for something easier to manage.

But this kitchen. Oh, this kitchen. It’s bright and airy, with oodles of natural light. The quartz countertops are smooth while still adding texture, and the marble honeycomb tile lining the wall beneath the cupboards is warm with gorgeous colour variations. It all comes together in a very chateau feel, and it’s just wonderful.

For Ingrid’s “foodie” daughter and son-in-law, there’s a six-burner gas range and double wall oven, as well as the double-door fridge and walk-in pantry. There’s also an extra built-in beverage centre with a bar fridge and a built-in coffee machine, an upgrade that Ingrid and her husband took immediate advantage of.

“We’re coffee snobs!” she admits with a laugh. “Waking up to the sunrise and turning on the coffee machine — it’s my favourite thing!”

On the other side of the counter sits a fantastic dining table with black accents and clawed feet in the open dining area, ready to expand in the event of company, and the living room sets up a surprisingly expansive view of Cordova Bay, given that the development borders the thick trees of Sayward Hill Park.

The master bedroom comfortably fits a king bed and dresser and comes with its own larger-than-life view, where Mount Baker is currently peeking up above a thin line of clouds. Ingrid disappears behind me as I take in the view, and after a moment I follow, thinking we’ll have a quick look at the closet and pocket en suite before returning to the tour.

What I’m not expecting is to come around the corner into a long, luxurious master en suite complete with double sinks, beautiful soaker tub, roomy glassed-in shower, heated tile floors and so much cupboard and drawer space I think I actually go a little green with envy.

“There’s so much storage. I haven’t even filled up all the space yet,” she says, opening a few of the cupboard doors.

Just on the other side of the bathroom door is a walk-in closet that could rival most of the other Hot Properties closets I’ve seen over the years. I’m so surprised by the size that I don’t notice it’s also a walk-through until Ingrid points out the laundry room at the other end.

“It’s a really efficient design,” she says, and adds that the connection from the walk-in closet to the laundry room was an element that was brought in after talking to residents of other buildings in the development.

The entire Sayward Hill project spanned almost 20 years, Ingrid tells me, with the first development finished in 2001. Amazingly, the entire development team stayed consistent from the first ground breaking to the completion of the last condo building. The same builders, the same architects, the same plumbing contractors, the same designer, everyone stayed involved, making for an almost unheard-of level of synergy throughout the build.

And not only that, but after each phase was complete, the team made a dedicated effort to get feedback from the people actually living in the spaces, and then sat down and round-tabled ideas to implement in the next stages.

“We would all sit together, including the architects, and we would design the light switches,” says Ingrid, smiling. It allowed for a natural evolution of the project, and a number of details that make this particular condo stand out.

As well as the double access to the laundry room, the guest bedroom is situated on the opposite side of the condo to add a sense of privacy for visitors, and there’s a pocket door that can close off the bedroom and bathroom for added separation. A barn door can separate the small home office tucked between the den and the kitchen. And one of my favourite features is at the front entrance: the hallway wall curves gently wide and away the further you come in, leading you into the rest of the house and creating an immediate and welcoming sense of space. The design is subtle and natural enough that I didn’t actually notice it at first, which makes sense the more time I spend here.

Compared to some of the houses featured in Boulevard, Ingrid’s condo is relatively compact, but it never feels cramped, or that anything was sacrificed in the name of efficiency. More than that, the design as a whole feels effortless. I’m instantly so comfortable, so at home, that I have to remember to look for the details.

“Kimberly has an elegance about her,” says Ingrid, quick to praise interior designer Kimberly Williams, also involved with the project since day one. “Her design is timeless.”

“All the projects on Sayward Hill were definitely designed with longevity in mind,” says Kimberly. “Durability and flexibility are extremely important in executing good design. We try to stay true to classic elements, which equates to timeless designs. I am so very proud of this project!”

“This is a development that’s near and dear to my heart,” adds Ingrid.

Having worked selling the units for the past 20 years, she’s seen their evolution and their unmatched quality.

“It felt like my second home. This is the last piece of the puzzle, and it feels right to be here now. This feels like the pinnacle of Sayward.”

194,surreynowleader,https://www.surreynowleader.com/life/a-whole-new-ball-game-you-can-feel-good-about-and-from-this-snack/,"A whole new ball game, you can feel good about (and from) this snack – Surrey Now-Leader",[],2020-04-28 09:00:00-07:00,"Snacking is often driven by convenience, cravings and the urge to quickly soothe those hunger pangs. By mid-afternoon, many of us are reaching for a little something to get us through a workout or tide us over until dinner — chocolate bar and coffee at 3 pm sound familiar?

But many of those convenient and accessible packaged and baked goods offer a short-lived energy boost, followed by the ever-dreaded sugar crash. And as we become more health-conscious and active, the demand for nutritious, guilt-free snack alternatives is on the rise.

With this in mind, Ann Conrod and Sean Wallbridge, founders of Victoria’s Ballsy Foods, have created a line of protein balls, a highly customizable snack alternative offered in a variety of flavour and dietary profiles to curb energy dips and boost nutrient consumption. (And, yes, the company has a lot of fun using various plays on the word “balls.”)

Ann, who is also the owner of a nutrition coaching company called Fettle + Food and a personal trainer at Innovative Fitness, began incorporating protein balls into her clients’ weekly diets.

“The biggest challenge for a lot of people is meal prep and finding healthy snacks. I started making up recipes for protein balls to fill this void. I’d make them weekly, [customized] specifically for my clients,” Ann explains.

One of those clients was Sean.

“Sean was one of the biggest supporters; he loved the protein balls right away. He is not one to sit down and have big meals during the day, preferring to eat something quick and small several times a day to keep his energy levels up,” says Ann.

During their personal training sessions at Innovative Fitness, Sean began putting the bug in Ann’s ear to start a protein ball company.

“These balls last seven to 10 days in the fridge, and I don’t feel guilty about eating them. I know I’m eating something healthy and I don’t crash,” Sean explains.

Operating as an online store, exclusively servicing Greater Victoria, the balls are handmade to order on Sundays.

“All weekly orders are made fresh on Sunday and are delivered free to your home that night or Monday morning,” says Sean, “We offer packs of 12 in glass containers which allow us to avoid waste.”

The store has two constant flavours — the Bl’ann’d Ball and the Blue Ball — and one rotating flavour that changes every four to eight weeks. All of the balls are gluten-free, and the Bl’ann’d Balls are also vegan.

“All of our balls are oat-based, so they are not keto. We are aiming to bring sugar levels down, so they are lightly sweetened with maple syrup or honey. Every ball is filled with healthy carbs, fibre and protein powder. The other flavours incorporated are based on the specific ball,” says Ann.

Every ball comes with directions for consumption. Some are anytime balls, and some are workout balls.

“You could eat all of the balls anytime, but some give you a bit more energy before or after a workout and sustain you until your next meal. The highest carb count is 15 grams, and protein ranges from four to six grams depending on the type of ball,” explains Ann.

With rotating flavours that have included chocolate and salted caramel, Ballsy Foods is making it easy for you to keep your hands off that secret desk drawer filled with sweet treats. It’s effectively ensuring that you can feel good about snacking and, more importantly, feel good from snacking.",[]

I meet Terry at her lakeshore boutique and, surrounded by beautiful things, we chat about life, style and what fires her up about her work. (“The people!” she says.)

Originally from Saskatchewan, Terry moved to Kelowna 12 years ago after realizing, she says, that life is too short to continue living in 40-degree-below weather. “In my late 40s I had a couple of acquaintances my own age pass away and I realized I had to make a change.”

Since she has been in the retail business for over 30 years, I wonder what innate quality has led to her success. She laughs. “I’m just an outgoing person, an effervescent person…although, last year I turned 60 so it’s petering off a bit.”

As we chat, the door opens and two women walk in. They are clearly regular customers, and as Terry’s effervescent personality comes to life, a conversation between them begins. I gather it is an ongoing dialogue that has been years in the making.

So I ask one of the women what she loves about the store, and she says, “It’s inspiring. When you walk in here it makes you think, ‘oh, I want that.’ It makes you want to do something with your house.”

Asked to describe the aesthetic of the store, Terry says, “Modern and current.” But she is quick to point out that she can’t take all the credit for the style of the shop.

“Barb is really the brains behind the operation,” Terry laughs as she talks about a woman who works for her. “I feel it’s good to have input from other people and Barb is an awesome merchandiser. I don’t buy anything for the store without running it by her first.”

Looking to the future, Terry’s vision is to continue to stay ahead of the curve on what Lexi & Lake brings to Kelowna. “I don’t follow trends; we set trends here.”

196,surreynowleader,https://www.surreynowleader.com/life/life-and-style-with-claudia-knoglinger/,Life and style with Claudia Knoglinger – Surrey Now-Leader,[],2020-04-06 07:30:00-07:00,"– Words and photographs by Lia Crowe

Claudia has always been someone I’ve gone to for fashion inspiration. When I have a nugget of an idea but need to distil it into a concrete concept, I’ve relied on her knowledge of fashion and trends and her passion for all things visual. She also has a strong sense of personal style and with her boutique Bernstein & Gold, she brings a fresh, current and bold aesthetic that has elevated this city to the category of fashion forward.

So, it is a real treat to meet Claudia for a chat about her life, style and inspiration, and what she holds as important. She’s owned a retail boutique in Victoria for close to 20 years, so I wonder what aspect of her work fires her up and keeps her going.

“It’s the customers and the fashion,” she says. “There’s a thrill in the buying for the next season: the trends, colours and fabrics, and what direction I’m going to take the store next. And that all comes from feedback I get from clients while working on the floor; being on the floor is everything.”

And what is Claudia most excited about for spring 2020? “There’s an interesting mix. The ’90s are definitely showing up again, and wild florals in big prairie poofs.”

Asked what innate quality has led to her success, Claudia says her strength lies in the buying. “Choosing out of the million things you see, sifting through countless amounts of pictures and fabric swatches, going to the showrooms, meeting designers and really paring it down. It’s about trusting your instincts and being able to take risks. It can’t be boring, it needs to be fresh but still wearable. That’s what I spend the most time fretting about — it has to be right.”

And what essential daily practice has she adopted in her work?

“Something that I try to show up with every morning is — listening to customers. They are coming through the door, they chose to spend their time with me and it has to be special, it has to be personal, it has to be meaningful to them in all aspects of the interaction. I have a great team and they all subscribe to that same philosophy.”

Since she is the mother of a toddler, I asked Claudia: what is the best life lesson she’s recently learned?

“One big thing I’m passionate about is self-care and wellness and making it a priority in my life. Going back to basics — from natural skincare to even the type of clothes and how much that you buy — incorporating the right things into your life, making better choices and honouring what matters to you. My self-care practice is focused on my garden because it’s something I can do with my son. It’s all about keeping your body well to preserve yourself, so you can be there for that person. You don’t think about that in your 20s very much, or at least I didn’t.”

When it comes to personal style, Claudia says she likes things pretty and casual.

“I’ve always liked flowing blouses, nice fabrics and patterns, but most days I’m in jeans and sneakers because I’m running around and I need to be able to move.”

So what does good style mean? “It has to feel like it’s you. And it’s a feeling; it’s the way your body responds in clothes, the way you move. It doesn’t have to be expensive or be designer, it just needs to feel like there has been some thought behind it. It has to work for the person and you can usually tell by the way they carry themselves in it.”

STYLE INSPIRATIONS & LIFE

Style icon: Stella McCartney.

Favourite artist: Mark Rothko.

Favourite piece of art: Jackson Pollock’s “Autumn Rhythm.”

A true entrepreneur, Tara Elston, owner of Foxy Box Nanaimo, has been in business since the age of 28. She quickly learned the basics of business at a young age from her parents.

“My dad was a commercial salmon troller and my mom was an independent business owner. I think the greatest quality I inherited from them is being a visionary,” says Tara.

After finishing her university education, Tara became a primary teacher on Vancouver Island. She did that for eight years until she had the urge to experience something more.

“I then met my husband and we started our first business together,” she says.

Tara and her husband have worked alongside each other for the past 20 years.

“He balances out my vision with his systemization and ability to create and learn anything necessary to get us where we need to be.”

Tara beams when describing her love of coming to work every day.

“It’s a beautiful place, so organized and stylistic. I think this house has a feminine energy in it. There’s something still here. When I walked in, I had to buy it.”

When it comes to fashion, Tara likes to keep it simple, and enjoys shopping in downtown Nanaimo.

“I love wearing black. It makes it an easy dress code for work. I enjoy accessorizing my neutral outfits too,” says Tara.

Since opening the Foxy Box Wax Bar business, Tara hopes to empower other women and give them confidence.

“I hope to bring women into this place of understanding and acceptance, and join them together. Everyone deserves to feel good. Energy is everything, humour is critical and you have to be able to laugh at yourself. We are stronger together. It’s a sisterhood,” says Tara.

Being a visionary and thinking about the future, Tara chats about what she hopes to pass on to her son and daughter.

“I tell them to always think outside of the box. Our society is inundated with what everyone thinks their life should look like. I want them to think beyond what you see on social media. Don’t follow the herd, and certainly do something that allows you the freedom and flexibility to travel, be in nature and spend time with family and friends,” she explains.

Outside of work you will find Tara recharging at home with a great book, spending time with her family, going for walks with her dog and brainstorming her next big idea!

198,surreynowleader,https://www.surreynowleader.com/life/that-day-i-was-a-life-model/,That day I was a life model – Surrey Now-Leader,[],2020-03-30 07:30:00-07:00,"I tell myself I feel okay about others seeing my naked body

– Illustration by Sierra Lundy

Should I shave? I flip this question over in my mind a dozen times. I know Zoe does, and he’s seen her before. Then again, she says he’s in his 70s, and a natural bush was a given back when he would have been around women my age. Also, a bit of hair might provide just the slightest means of protection, even if it’s only an illusion. I throw the razor in my bag just in case.

I’m heading to meet my stepsister, who is taking me to my first ever life-modelling gig. There, I will pose nude for the sake of art. Drawing me will be a single client, Charles, and Zoe, who I’ve insisted come along. She’s modelled for him before, and has arranged this session at my inclination of interest.

Nudity is a strangely loaded concept. The various attitudes and implications related to exposing one’s body are beyond contradictory, and the lines between empowerment, exploitation and exhibitionism are muddy at best. But nudity is universal! Everybody has a body and why shouldn’t we feel casual about seeing them and having them seen by others? Women’s figures are beautiful and deserve to occupy more than just sexual spaces. I tell myself I feel okay about others seeing my naked body, but I know that I am lying to some degree.

This is where Charles comes in. Charles participates in a weekly life-drawing class, where a group of people gather around a nude model and draw for two hours. I’m hoping that his interest in the human figure in a desexualized context, and my participation in this exchange, will be a way to confront my own internalized taboos and insecurities. I want to be confident in nakedness, I want to feel good about my body in a platonic “here I am, no big deal” kind of way.

So I set out, flipping between anxiety and confidence, excitement and dread. I meet up with Zoe and we debrief. She reassures me. She tells me that the hardest part is coming up with and holding new poses. I suddenly realize I haven’t considered the logistics of this. Shoot. I don’t know a single pose. But Zoe says it’ll be fine, that they just come naturally and there are no wrong positions. She says to twist; twists are interesting.

I mull over her advice as we hop into the car. In the back is a pile of clothes that she tells me to look over. I pull out a like-new super-soft sweater — high quality and in black. It’s like it was made for me.

“Have it!” she says. I stuff it in my bag, and am distracted from our destination just long enough to feel minor relief.

Eventually, we park at the base of Charles’s driveway and the moment of “is it too late to turn around?” hits. It is. The dread takes over and fills my feet as we trudge up the driveway. Charles’s door is bright red. I am pulsing with anxiety as Zoe knocks on it.

Charles opens the door. He is a small man with grey hair and a black beard. We head up to the kitchen and his wife, Sally, jumps right into the conversation. She offers us Girl Guide cookies. I can’t believe what we’re here for. I can’t believe I’m doing this.

The studio is impressive. There are work tables easels, shelves of materials, drawers of different paper sheets, toolboxes of charcoals, and jars of sketching pencils. A grey paper backdrop hangs from a roller on one wall and onto the floor, making a stage. It is illuminated by a menacing spotlight. I am thankful for the professionalism it portends. Also intimidated.

Charles says there’s a robe for me to wear in the bathroom whenever I decide to get ready. I follow his direction and head to “change.” This doesn’t seem like the right word when there’s nothing to change into — but “strip” is worse.

I begin undressing.

My body and I are on relatively amicable terms. I don’t fall too far outside of the desirable norm. But puberty brought large, heavy, wideset breasts to my otherwise petite frame. This is supposedly a good thing, according to almost everyone I complain to. To me, it has always been a source of deep insecurity.

I struggle to get the cuffs of my jeans over my ankles and realize I’ve left my socks on last. How unsexy. Is that a good thing? I avoid looking down at myself as I slip into the robe. It is silk. As I step back into the room, they are still setting up their things and I stand waiting, unsure of when to take the robe off. I’m anxious to get it over with.

Charles explains that we will start with a few one-minute poses, then move onto two minutes, then a couple of fives, and finish with one or two long holds. “Whenever you’re ready,” he prompts.

I slip the silk off and drop it in a pile to the side. Zoe is smiling at me. I feel surprisingly relaxed now that I’m actually just naked. Yet I am certainly aware of the shallowness of my breathing.

I move into the spotlight and decide to start facing backwards. I raise one arm over my head and twist my torso. They both remark that this is a great position.

So it begins. One minute seems longer than it usually does. Then it’s done and I twist a different way.

“You’re a natural!” Charles says. He is engaged in polite conversation with Zoe.

I listen to the scritch-scratch of their pencils. I examine Charles’s studio meticulously. It’s almost boring. Now the five minutes. Time ticks away ever so slowly. I realize that I am so focused on staying still that the whole naked thing isn’t really a thing. Finally Charles calls time and tells me I can take a break and stretch. I again become acutely aware of my nakedness and pull my arms across my chest. I feel my body’s awkward posture outside of a deliberate position. The break is the longest part yet. I am relieved when we start again.

We do a long pose and I read every single title on Charles’s bookshelf. They are organized by subject. Suddenly the session is over; I slip back into the robe and briskly head for the bathroom. Jeans have never felt so comforting.

When I emerge, Charles and Zoe are comparing drawings as Sally gushes over them. They all applaud me as well, and I don’t know how to take the compliments. We say our goodbyes and I run down the driveway.

“So, how did that feel?” Zoe asks excitedly.

“I don’t know. Fine, I think.” It’s the truth. I’m not quite sure how I feel. I’m glad I went through with it and I’m glad it’s done with. I still feel nothing as we part ways. But later, as I travel back home, I am suddenly struck with shame. I can’t quite place its source but I find myself pushing the memory of the day out of my mind, avoiding reflection, not ready to process it.

Was I expecting something bigger? I don’t feel empowered. I don’t feel exposed. I don’t feel a new confidence in my body. I just feel weird about requesting an arrangement to stand naked in a stranger’s basement.

I carry Zoe’s sketches, rolled up with two elastic bands, under my arm as I wait to transfer busses. It’s late. It’s cold now, and I remember the sweater Zoe has given me. I put it on under my bomber jacket and I’m instantly warm. I think of our relationship and how great it is to have a sister who knows me, who sees me, who reminds me I exist beyond skin. Our closeness has nothing to do with our physical bodies.

When I get home I unroll the three pages and show my girlfriend the drawings.

“Whoa. She got your tits perfectly,” she says.

Coming up on his 18th year in the auto industry, Tanner Caouette currently serves as general manager and managing partner of Jaguar, Land Rover and Volvo Kelowna, as well as being a partner at Vernon Hyundai. He joined the Wyant Group in 2016, several years after moving to the Okanagan.

“No two days are the same,” he says of why he’s stayed in the industry so long. “It doesn’t matter the brand, or the situation. It’s just that you’re always dealing with people, and you’re changing people’s lives. You’re providing one of the biggest purchases in their life, and I like being a part of that.”

Despite admitting to being a bit of a workaholic, Tanner makes time to enjoy the many amenities in the Okanagan. An avid golfer, he also spends much of his leisure time with his wife and their three dogs.

“We take them paddle boarding. My wife’s better than I am, but we get out a few times a month,” he says, laughing. “I like to spend as much time on the lake as possible.”

The pair also makes a point of travelling when they have the chance.

“Every couple of years we try to do something that’s really out there,” says Tanner. “We went to South Africa in 2016, and Dubai in 2018. Dubai was just absolutely incredible. It’s hard to put into words. Everything is so opulent. We went to one of the biggest mosques in the world, and it was built with marble and 24-karat gold, and it’s just so amazing and beautiful, and so different.”

The 7 Sins

envy:

Whose shoes would you like to walk in?

Tom Brady. He’s a winner. The greatest quarterback of all time. And what’s more impressive is he’s been able to be at the top of his game for two decades. He was an underdog when he entered the NFL and has been able to overcome any and all obstacles. He’s evolved to succeed in today’s game, and he’s also one of the greatest leaders in the sport.

gluttony:

What is the food you could eat over and over again?

Pizza. I grew up in a small town, and I worked at a mom-and-pop pizza place while going to school. We used to experiment with all sorts of ingredients and would come up with some of the best (and worst) recipes. It is definitely my guilty pleasure food.

greed:

You’re given $1 million that you have to spend selfishly. What would you spend it on?

I would take my wife on a lavish holiday. There is so much of the world we have not seen, so I would want to experience some of the amazing sites this world has to offer. If there was any left over, I’d buy a classic Land Rover Defender.

wrath:

Pet peeves?

Bad service.

sloth:

Where would you spend a long time doing nothing?

Here. There’s so much to do in the Okanagan Valley, between the beaches, parks, lake, mountains, etc. I have three dogs and the only thing I need more of is time to “do nothing” with them.

pride:

What is the one thing you’re secretly proud of?

My mom. She is the most powerful woman I have ever met. She is my inspiration.

lust:

What makes your heart beat faster?

I know it’s cliché, but my wife. She is the perfect combination of sexy and sophisticated. After 12 years together, she still gets me fired up.
