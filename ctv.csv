""I can't say no to a good time,"" said Edmonton Oilers fan Jeet Jermana. ""I'd be hard-pressed not to jump into a big party.""

On Friday, the NHL board of governors and NHL Players' Association said they had ratified the return-to-play plan, paving the way for the league to resume its pandemic-hit season later this summer.

Toronto and Edmonton were also officially unveiled as hub cities where all games will be played, beginning Aug. 1. Training camps start Monday in the 24 cities with teams still in the running for the Stanley Cup, including six in Canada.

In 2017, when the Oilers nearly advanced to the Western Conference final, Jermana was among the thousands of fans who partied in Ford Hall at Rogers Place arena and in bars along the popular Whyte Avenue district.

But with COVID-19 this year, where teams will play in empty arenas, Jermana said he'll likely watch more games at home, maybe with just a few friends.

That is, he said, until the Oilers advance and he and other fans won't be able to resist going out.

""Once it becomes the 'real playoffs' I think more and more the momentum will grab,"" he said.

Matt Black of Hotel X Toronto, located west of the city centre where multiple media outlets have reported that several teams will be based, said the prospect of any accommodation for celebratory fan gatherings, even outdoors, seems unlikely.

Nevertheless, Black said he expects citywide excitement will be palpable, even with empty arenas.

""You look back to those scenes of Jurassic Park and Maple Leaf Square and all of that ... it would be great for people to be able to get together again but you just need to make sure that you're doing it in a safe manner,"" said Black.

The players themselves aren't to have any contact with the general public.

Dr. Vinita Dubey, Toronto's associate medical health officer, said in an emailed statement that players and staff arriving from abroad will also have to serve a modified 14-day quarantine as well as undergo rigorous screening and daily testing protocols, wear masks in indoor settings, physically distance and wash hands often.

An Edmonton police spokesperson said the service wouldn't be able to comment over the weekend on what sorts of preparations they might make for crowds when the season resumes.

Geoff Grimble with the City of Edmonton said the city's civic events management team would likely discuss the issue during a scheduled meeting on Monday.

""The City of Edmonton's first priority is public safety and we'll continue to follow the advice and requirements of the Chief Medical Officer of Health to ensure fans, players, coaches and staff remain healthy,"" Grimble said.

Oilers fan Brendan McLeod admitted he may be lured to a street celebration when -- not if -- his team advances, but said he still wants to maintain physical distancing.

""We have to get through this together or else it's not going to change,"" said McLeod.

But Shadi Merhej, who said he enjoys both hockey and the Oilers, noted the sport doesn't have quite as strong attraction for him in the summer.

""It's daylight 'til 11 o'clock. You don't want to spend half your day watching hockey,"" Merhej explained.

""I'd rather go for a bike ride, or rollerblade or golf.""

The Court of Arbitration for Sport upheld City's appeal against the UEFA ban, but imposed a 10 million euro ($11.3 million) fine on the club for failing to co-operate with independent investigators.

Some UEFA allegations accusing City of finance rules violations dating back several years were not proven and others were “time-barred,” the court said.

CAS plans to publish a detailed written verdict within days. That could help explain why UEFA's case did not comply with its own internal rules, and show how other evidence was weighed.

Man City joins Paris Saint-Germain, AC Milan and Galatasaray in beating UEFA in appeal cases related to finance monitoring rules in the past two years.

The decision by the three CAS judges clears the team coached by Pep Guardiola to play in the group stage of the Champions League next season. The case does not affect City's place in this season's competition, which resumes next month.

City's win guarantees tens of millions of dollars in UEFA prize money next season. It also protects against players leaving to seek Champions League action with another club.

Guardiola had pledged to stay in Manchester “no matter what happens” in the courts.

“The club welcomes the implications of today's ruling as a validation of the club's position and the body of evidence that it was able to present,” City said in a statement.

UEFA punished Man City in February for “serious breaches” of finance monitoring rules and failing to co-operate with investigators. The allegations included that City, owned by Abu Dhabi's royal family, misled UEFA over several years to meet financial integrity rules - known as Financial Fair Play - required to enter European club competitions.

City denied wrongdoing, and said it had “irrefutable evidence” the claims were not true.

“The CAS award emphasized that most of the alleged breaches reported by the Adjudicatory Chamber of the (UEFA club finance panel) were either not established or time-barred,” the court said.

City's win will raise doubts about the future of the UEFA Financial Fair Play program, created in 2009 after the global financial crisis.

The system was used to ban several clubs, including Galatasaray in 2016, from one season of UEFA competitions. City was the first club to be banned for two years.

In a statement, UEFA pointed blame at its own club finance investigators and judges for “insufficient conclusive evidence to uphold all of the (panel's) conclusions” and not meeting a five-year statute of limitations.

UEFA could choose to challenge the CAS ruling at Switzerland's supreme court. Federal appeals in CAS cases rarely succeed and only consider narrow grounds of legal procedure.

The urgent ruling came one month after a three-day hearing held by video link between Switzerland and England. A full verdict detailing the evidence, expert witness testimony and the judges' reasons is due within days.

UEFA-appointed investigators opened a case after leaked club emails and documents from City officials were published by German magazine Der Spiegel in November 2018. They were likely obtained by a hacker from Portugal.

The published evidence appeared to show City deceived UEFA by overstating sponsorship deals from 2012-16 and hid the source of revenue linked to state-backed companies in Abu Dhabi.

City never disputed the documents were authentic, but argued the evidence was stolen and reported out of context. It was unclear Monday what part the leaked documents ultimately played in the case.

UEFA had previously signed off on City's submitted accounts since 2014. That year, UEFA fined City 20 million euros ($22.6 million) of its Champions League prize money in a first wave of assessments of European clubs' finances. French champion PSG got the same fine in a similar case.

UEFA decided to create the FFP system 11 years ago to stabilize the soccer economy by monitoring finances of 200-plus clubs which qualify each year for its competitions. Clubs must approach break-even on commercial income and spending on transfers and salaries. Sponsor deals linked to wealthy owners must be set at fair market rates.

Critics of FFP argue it protects storied clubs with a huge fan base from being challenged by ambitious rivals with state support, like Man City and Qatar-owned PSG.

UEFA said Monday it and the European Club Association “remain committed to its principles.”

The UEFA rules will be challenged again at CAS this week. Turkish title contender Trabzonspor is appealing against a one-year ban for failing to abide by an earlier settlement deal.

The fine to be paid to UEFA will benefit other clubs, including City rivals Liverpool and Manchester United. UEFA rules require that Financial Fair Play fines - in most cases, prize money deductions - must be redistributed among other clubs who play in the Champions League or Europa League that season.",[]

Westbrook made the revelation on social media. As recently as Sunday, the Rockets believed that Westbrook and James Harden - neither of whom travelled with the team to Walt Disney World near Orlando last week - would be with the team in the next few days.

In Westbrook's case, that now seems most unlikely.

“I tested positive for covid-19 prior to my teams departure to Orlando,” Westbrook wrote on his Instagram page. “I'm currently feeling well, quarantined, and looking forward to rejoining my teammates when I am cleared.”

Westbrook is averaging 27.5 points, eight rebounds and seven assists per game for the Rockets this season. Houston has clinched a playoff spot and resumes its season with the first of eight seeding games on July 31 against Dallas.

Westbrook also offered a word of caution in his post.

“Thank you for all the well wishes and continued support,” he wrote. “Please take this virus seriously. Be safe. Mask up!”

Westbrook's announcement came on another day where case numbers in Florida and Texas - two of the nation's coronavirus hotspots - keep rising to levels that have officials and residents deeply concerned.

At the NBA bubble, however, optimism that the rules established by the league and the players will work - even though some Disney parks reopened to visitors over the weekend and the MLS restart, also at the campus, has seen two teams leave after a spate of positive tests.

“Our protocols are unbelievable,” Toronto Raptors guard Kyle Lowry said Monday. “I think our protocols and our health and safety measures have been top-notch. I think this thing will work perfectly. ... We're doing everything that we can possibly do to make sure that we're healthy, we're safe and we're in an environment where we can be successful and do our jobs at a high level.”

Officials in Houston have called for that city to lock back down as area hospitals strain to accommodate patients sick with the coronavirus. And in Florida, more than 12,000 new coronavirus cases were confirmed Monday.",[]

James joined other NBA players in tweeting ""#FreeWoj"" on Sunday, two days after Wojnarowski himself posted an apology on Twitter for his comment to Missouri Senator Josh Hawley.

The New York Post reported that ESPN had called off their reporter's planned travel this week to the NBA's ""bubble"" site in Orlando, Florida, where they plan to resume the coronavirus-disrupted season at the end of the month.

The Washington Post reported that the suspension would last one to two weeks and Wojnarowski would travel to the bubble at a later date.

The trouble blew up on Friday, when Hawley wrote an open letter to NBA commissioner Adam Silver in which the senator criticized the league's relationship with China and called on the league to allow players to put messages in support of the military, police and Hong Kong protestors on the backs of jerseys.

The letter came after the NBA announced it would allow players to put certain phrases on their uniforms in support of the Black Lives Matter movement when the season resumes.

Wojnarowski responded to the email press release that Hawley's office sent to him, writing ""F--- you,"" but without barring out the expletive.

Hawley then shared that response on Twitter.

""I was disrespectful and I made a regrettable mistake,"" Wojnarowski said in a statement Friday. ""I'm sorry for the way I handled myself and I am reaching out immediately to Senator Hawley to apologize directly.

""I also need to apologize to my ESPN colleagues because I know my actions were unacceptable and should not reflect on any of them.""

ESPN said in its own statement Friday that the comments were ""completely unacceptable behavior"" and that they would address the matter internally.",[]

Matthews told reporters about the positive test as the Maple Leafs opened their training camp Monday, adding he was ""mostly asymptomatic.""

The Toronto Sun reported on June 19 that Matthews contracted the virus while at home in Scottsdale, Ariz., and was in quarantine to get healthy before the start of training camp.

The Maple Leafs declined to confirm the report at the time, citing the privacy of players' medical records.

Arizona is among the U.S. states that has seen a recent spike in positive tests for the novel coronavirus.

In a brief statement on the federation website, Yevgeny Yurchenko didn't give a reason for stepping down.

He said he wished his successor could “move forward to resolve the nearly five-year-long difficulties in relations with World Athletics and also make it possible to attract enough funding to develop the federation.”

The federation, known as RusAF, missed a July 1 deadline to pay the $5 million fine and $1.3 million in costs. Yurchenko said at the time it couldn't afford to pay.

When Russia missed the deadline to pay, World Athletics froze procedures allowing top Russian athletes to compete internationally as “authorized neutral athletes” during Russia's suspension, ahead of a July 29-30 council meeting. That could prevent some top Russians competing when the Diamond League restarts next month.

“We are aware of this news,” World Athletics said in a statement, “but this is obviously an internal matter and we will wait to hear from RusAF.”

The fine was imposed after Yurchenko admitted wrongdoing on behalf of RusAF under its previous leadership. The federation had been accused of providing forged documents to give an athlete an alibi for being unavailable for doping testing. RusAF has been suspended since 2015 for widespread doping.

Before Yurchenko was elected unopposed on Feb. 28, he was best known as a businessman with a seat on the board of a majority state-owned aircraft manufacturer. He also briefly served as a regional deputy governor.

Also on Monday, the president of the Russian Olympic Committee said in comments reported by state news agencies that an audit of the country's anti-doping agency's finances revealed irregularities.

The allegations could not immediately be verified, but ROC president Stanislav Pozdnyakov was quoted as saying the audit would be made public. The agency's supervisory board will consider the findings from the audit, Pozdnyakov said in comments reported by the RIA Novosti agency.

Russian Anti-Doping Agency CEO Yuri Ganus denied any financial misconduct on Friday. He was speaking in response to allegations published anonymously on the social media and messaging platform Telegram.

The Russian agency, known as RUSADA, is challenging the World Anti-Doping Agency over its decision to bar Russia's name and flag from major events including the Olympics. WADA ruled last year that Russia manipulated doping laboratory data to cover up past offences.",[]

A new name must still be selected for one of the oldest and most storied teams in the National Football League, and it was unclear how soon that will happen. But for now, arguably the most polarizing name in North American professional sports is gone at a time of reckoning over racial injustice, iconography and racism in the U.S.

The move came less than two weeks after owner Dan Snyder, a boyhood fan of the team who once declared he would never get rid of the name, launched a “thorough review” amid pressure from sponsors. FedEx, Nike, Pepsi and Bank of America all lined up against the name, which was given to the franchise in 1933 when the team was still based in Boston.

“The NFL and Dan Snyder, we have to commend them on making the right call to change the name,” said Oneida Indian Nation Representative Ray Halbritter, leader of the “Change the Mascot” campaign. “Dan Snyder won today because now he has a legacy that will be different from the racial slur that was the team name. I know that's not an easy thing to do, but it was the right thing to do.”

The team said it is “retiring” the name and logo and that Snyder and coach Ron Rivera are working closely to develop a new moniker and design. The announcement came on the old letterhead with the Redskins name because the team technically retains it until a new one is chosen and approved.

Native American advocates and experts have long criticized the name they call a “dictionary-defined racial slur.” Over a dozen Native leaders and organizations wrote to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell last week demanding an immediate end to Washington's use of the name. Goodell, who has fielded questions on the topic for years, said he supported the review.

Protests against the name predate Snyder buying the team in 1999, and, until now, he had shown no willingness to consider a change. Strong words from sponsors - including a company run by a minority stakeholder of the team - changed the equation.

FedEx earlier this month became the first sponsor to announce it had asked the organization to change the name, particularly important because CEO Frederick Smith owns part of the team. FedEx paid $205 million for the long-term naming rights to the team's stadium in Landover, Maryland.

The lease at FedEx Field expires in 2027, and dropping the name keeps open various possibilities in Maryland, Virginia and Washington for the team's new stadium and headquarters. District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser has said the name was an “obstacle” to Snyder building on the old RFK Stadium site, which is believed to be his preference.

The team recently started cutting ties with racist founder George Preston Marshall, removing his name from the Ring of Fame and renaming the lower bowl at FedEx Field for the team's first Black player, late Hall of Famer Bobby Mitchell. Marshall, who renamed the Boston Braves the Redskins in 1933 and moved the team to D.C. four years later, was a segregationist and the last NFL owner to integrate his team. The current logo shows the profile of a red-faced Native American with feathers in his hair.

Major League Baseball's Atlanta Braves and the National Hockey League's Chicago Blackhawks have said they have no inclination to change their names. Some advocates would like to see all Native American names, mascots and imagery out of sports.

“Our fight continues,” Crystal Echo Hawk of the Native American advocacy group IllumiNative said in a statement. “We will not rest until the offensive use of Native imagery, logos and names are eradicated from professional, collegiate and (other school) sports. The time is now to stand in solidarity and declare that racism will not be tolerated.”

Halbritter said it was important to note those other names are not a slur, but he hopes a “broader discussion” can be had. He pointed out that Florida State spoke with the Seminole tribe about its name, the same thing a minor league baseball team in Spokane, Washington, did with local Native Americans.

It was not immediately clear if the organization is consulting Native Americans on a new name or if any imagery will even be used.

“I think it's striking that the NFL and other owners of other sports teams don't have a conversation with Native America on these names,” Halbritter said. “It's about respect, and I don't understand why they just don't have a conversation with the affected people.”

Long removed from the glory days of winning Super Bowl titles in the 1982, 1987 and 1991 seasons under coach Joe Gibbs, Washington's NFL team has just five playoff appearances in 21 years and no postseason victories since 2005. The team has lacked a nationally marketable player since Robert Griffin III's short-lived stardom, and the 2020 schedule features zero prime-time games for a franchise that used to be a draw.

Re-branding with a new name and logo - and perhaps the same burgundy and gold colours - coupled with turning football operations over to Rivera could be a boon for Snyder on and off the field. Even if a segment of the fan base opposes the change in the name of tradition, winning would more than make up for those losses.",[]

15,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/sports/morikawa-clutch-in-finish-and-playoff-to-win-workday-open-1.5021208,Morikawa clutch in finish and playoff to win Workday Open,['Doug Ferguson'],2020-07-12 17:43:00-04:00,"DUBLIN, OHIO -- Collin Morikawa figured his tournament was over if he didn't make a 5-foot par putt on the 15th hole at Muirfield Village.

He couldn't have imagined all the fun was just starting.

Still three shots behind Justin Thomas with three holes to play, Morikawa made only one birdie and it was enough for a 6-under 66 to force a playoff.

The three times he played the 18th hole, he twice could only watch as Thomas had 10-foot putts for the win.

The other time, Morikawa had to make a 25-foot putt to keep playing.

The only dull moment Sunday at the Workday Charity Open was the end, when Morikawa took two putts for par from just inside 10 feet to beat Thomas on the third playoff hole and win for the second time in his career.

""Amazing,"" Morikawa said when asked how he would sum up the day to someone who only saw the result.

That covered a lot of territory.

Morikawa never looked like the winner until it was over.

Thomas had 10 straight one-putt greens, the last one a 25-foot eagle putt on the par-5 15th for the three-shot lead with three holes to play. And while he made two bogeys for a 69 that allowed for a playoff, he had reason to think it was over when he made a 50-foot birdie putt from the back of the 18th green.

""I never assumed it was over,"" Thomas said. ""Percentages would say that it heavily is close to being that way. ... I just tried to keep my head down and think he's going to make it, but hoping he's not, selfishly, but he did.""

Roger Sloan of Merritt, B.C., was the top Canadian, finishing in a tie for 27th at 7 under, 12 off the pace. Adam Hadwin of Abbotsford, B.C., tied for 35th at 5 under, Corey Conners of Listowel, Ont., tied for 39th at 4 under, and Abbotsford's Nick Taylor and Mackenzie Hughes of Dundas, Ont., tied for 48th at 3 under.

Thomas missed a 10-footer for par in regulation, and a putt close to that same line for birdie on the second extra hole. He was done in by a tee shot on No. 10 that wound up in the rough behind a tree, forcing him to pitch out 102 yards short of the green. He missed his 15-foot par putt, leading to Morikawa's two-putt par and the win.

It was a wild ride for Thomas, too. He started with a two-shot lead, trailed by three after just five holes, made four straight birdies and was ahead by three shots 10 holes later, and ultimately lost in a playoff.

""It's completely unacceptable to give up a three-shot lead with three to go,"" Thomas said. ""I'm upset, I'm disappointed in myself. But at the end of the day it's over with now, and I just need to take some time this afternoon and tonight to build on it and figure out what I can do better going into next week.""

They return in four days for the Memorial on a Muirfield Village course expected to be as fast as a U.S. Open.

This was a big win for the 23-year-old Morikawa, who in his 13 months since graduating from Cal already has established a reputation for a high level of consistency. His only victory was at an opposite-field event last summer. He beat a field at the Workday Charity Open that featured five of the top 10 in the world.

""This is a huge kind of stepping stone,"" said Morikawa, who goes to No. 13 in the world, one spot ahead of Tiger Woods. ""We got No. 1 out of the way. We got No. 2. Let the gates just open and let's keep going.""

It was his second playoff since the PGA Tour returned June 11 from the COVID-19 pandemic. Morikawa lost on the first extra hole at Colonial by missing a 3-foot putt. He had a 2-foot putt in regulation on Sunday that caught the left edge of the cup and swirled in. ""My heartbeat must have skipped a billion times,"" he said.

The only thing missing was a handshake from Jack Nicklaus. He'll be there next week for the Memorial, as the PGA Tour stays at Muirfield Village.

Viktor Hovland of Norway had a 71 and finished alone in third. He was in the final group of three young stars, all of whom had the lead at some point during the final round.

Hovland's hopes ended with two shots -- finding a bunker from the 10th fairway for bogey, and a driver on the reachable 14 that only missed by about 5 feet, enough to slowly tumble down the bank and into the water.

Morikawa also hit driver on the 14th that rolled 12 feet away. He narrowly missed the eagle putt, while Thomas hit a splendid wedge with side spin to 3 feet for birdie to stay one ahead. That's when it appeared the tournament turned in Thomas' favour.

Morikawa was in thick rough right of the fairway on the par-5 15th, unsure he could get over the slope to the next section of fairway. It came out heavy, just through the fairway into light rough 190 yards away. By then, Thomas hit 3-wood to 25 feet. Morikawa went through a bunker to the steep slope by the green, and did well to chop that chip high in the air to 5 feet. Thomas made his eagle putt. Morikawa made his par to stay alive.

""A three-shot cushion with three to go is a lot different than four with three to go,"" Morikawa said. ""And then him hitting somewhat of a poor tee shot on 16, I knew this was my window of opportunity.""

Thomas missed a 10-foot par putt. Morikawa caught a good bounce with an ordinary 8-iron to the 17th and made a 10-foot birdie. Thomas found the fairway bunker off the tee at the 18th, played short of the green and couldn't make his par.

The starting times were moved up to avoid a forecast of thunderstorms, so the final round was broadcast on a delay, available live only on streaming.

With no fans on the course, it was the wildest finish that hardly anyone saw.",[]

""My 'exercise' is playing, almost never during the week, a quick round of golf. Obama played more and much longer rounds, no problem,"" Trump tweeted.

CNN has previously fact-checked Trump's claim that he has played less golf than his predecessor; Trump has played more than twice as many rounds of golf than former president Barack Obama had at the same point in his presidency. Trump paid his 276th visit to one of his golf properties on Saturday.

Trump also defended his frequent golf-playing by arguing he often gets work done on the links.

""I play VERY fast, get a lot of work done on the golf course, and also get a 'tiny' bit of exercise. Not bad!"" he tweeted.

Before winning the presidency, Trump was a frequent critic of Obama for playing golf in office. But Trump has spent many weekends at his various golf properties in Florida, New Jersey and Virginia, sometimes bringing lawmakers or business leaders with him.

Trump has long reacted strongly to scrutiny of his physical or mental health, last week claiming to have ""aced"" a cognitive test without providing proof.

It was the president's latest attempt to dismiss questions about his mental capabilities and attempt to call into question those of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.

The White House would not provide details of the test or say whether he was referring to a more recent evaluation than the one he underwent in 2018.

Trump's general medical status has frequently been the source of speculation.

In June, the White House provided a positive look at an annual physical, saying the president's cholesterol was down from previous years, but it has never provided a complete explanation for an abrupt November 2019 trip to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center that the White House claimed was meant to get an early start on his yearly physical.

At the time, the White House said it was a ""routine checkup,"" though it was unannounced and wasn't on the President's internal schedule the morning he went there.

The team's news cycle followed a similar model Friday.

Infielder Travis Shaw got things rolling with a string of tweets about the team's closed environment at Rogers Centre and adjoining hotel. Manager Charlie Montoyo then dropped news that Vladimir Guerrero Jr., would be moving to first base. And finally there was word that players who spent the week in Florida had arrived in town.

There is no shortage of storylines in this one-of-a-kind summer that's only just beginning. Where things go from here is anyone's guess.

A main issue remains where the Blue Jays will play home games this season. The federal government granted the team approval to modify the 14-day quarantine rule during the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing training camp to begin this week at the domed stadium.

""I'm glad that we're here,"" Montoyo said on a conference call. ""I really am and we're going to follow all the guidelines. I promise you that.""

Earlier in the day, Shaw voiced his concern about the length of time players may need to stay in their current environment. He replied to a tweet from TSN reporter Scott Mitchell, who reported that multiple sources told him players could face a $750,000 fine and potential jail time if seen outside the ballpark -- which also are maximum punishments in the Quarantine Act.

""We were told two weeks... not all summer... all summer is a bit much,"" Shaw tweeted.

New York Mets pitcher Marcus Stroman, who spent five seasons with the Blue Jays, added more fuel to the social-media fire when he replied to Mitchell's tweet.

""This is absolutely ridiculous,"" Stroman tweeted, adding in a subsequent post: ""Guys are going to be walking around in full disguises. Lol.""

In an email reply, the club confirmed that before arriving in Toronto, players understood the maximum penalties for leaving the Rogers Centre footprint during camp.

The team has expressed its desire to play home games at the dome during the 60-game regular season. A decision is expected in the coming days.

Players are expected to be advised of specifics on the setup for the upcoming campaign once a finalized plan is in place.

Toronto will travel to Boston for pre-season games July 21 and 22 before the season opener July 24 at Tampa Bay. The Blue Jays' first home game is set for July 29 against Washington.

If Rogers Centre is ruled out for the season, the Blue Jays would likely play at TD Ballpark at their spring-training facility in Dunedin, Fla., but that backup plan has not been finalized.

Florida has been dealing with a spike in COVID-19 cases of late. The state reported 11,385 new cases on Friday while Ontario reported just 116 new cases.

Shaw, who signed with the Blue Jays last December, posted two additional tweets after his original reply but they were later deleted.

""1) Let me be clear. We are on board with the TWO week quarantine. I currently have a PAID for condo a block away from the stadium that I can't use. At no point would I risk public safety or not follow rules. Is it wrong to want to live in a place that I've already paid for...""

He added: ""2) to be able to go on a walk (WITH A MASK) to be able to get fresh air, walk to go get takeout food (not eat inside). We aren't looking to party, hit the patios, go out at night, anything like that. Public safety is priority number 1....""

As Major League Baseball's lone Canadian team, the Blue Jays face an additional hurdle because of the border and quarantine rules during the pandemic. Players and team staff have been isolating from the general public in the so-called 'bubble' of the stadium and hotel at the north end of the building.

""I wanna make it clear, we're not asking for special treatment,"" Blue Jays outfielder Randal Grichuk tweeted Friday. ""We understand that we need to stay in a ""quarantine bubble"". We wanna make sure everyone is safe.

""The toughest part is them not allowing our family to come with us. That's what makes it tough for a lot of guys.""

The Blue Jays have not commented on reports that a single player recently tested positive for COVID-19 in Florida. The positive result forced 12 players to remain in Dunedin, according to USA Today.

Most players -- about 46 in total, Montoyo said earlier in the week -- flew to Toronto on a charter last Sunday.

Without providing specifics, Montoyo said other players arrived in town Thursday and planned to work out before the team's intrasquad game Friday evening.

During his 15-minute video call with reporters, Montoyo confirmed that Guerrero would cross the diamond and focus on first base.

""It's all about a player having the best chance to compete,"" Montoyo said. ""It's going to be a short season. So for me, the best (plan) for Vlad is to play first, DH and also play third.""

Guerrero, who hit 15 homers and drove in 69 runs in his rookie season, said he was on board.

""Wherever the team needs me, I'm going to be ready,"" he said via translator Hector Lebron. ""So I'm OK with that.""

She was 57.

Travolta said in an Instagram post that his wife of 28 years died after a two-year battle with breast cancer.

""It is with a very heavy heart that I inform you that my beautiful wife Kelly has lost her two-year battle with breast cancer,"" Travolta said. ""She fought a courageous fight with the love and support of so many.""

The couple had three children together.

""Shocked by this sad news,"" Maria Shriver said on Twitter. ""Kelly was such a bright loving soul, a talented actress, and a loving mom and wife. My heart breaks for her family who have already known such sadness and grief.""

Born Kelly Kamalelehua Smith on Oct. 13, 1962, in Honolulu, Hawaii, Preston had a lengthy acting career in movies and television beginning in the 1980s, including the 1985 teen comedy ""Mischief,"" 1986's ""Space Camp"" and her breakthrough, 1988's ""Twins."" Preston played Marnie, the woman who marries Schwarzenegger's character.

Preston was first married to actor Kevin Gage. They divorced in 1987.

The year after, Preston met Travolta while shooting the 1989 film ""The Experts,"" a box-office flop about a Soviet KGB agent who hires hip New Yorkers to update the spy program's understanding of American society. They meet on the dance floor after Travolta asks, ""Does anyone here know how to dance."" Preston responds: ""I know how to dance.""

They were married in 1991 at a midnight ceremony in Paris while expecting their first son, Jett.

Preston starred opposite Kevin Costner in the 1999 film ""For the Love of the Game."" In 2003, she starred in ""What a Girl Wants"" and as the mom in the live-action adaptation of ""The Cat in the Hat."" The following year she appeared in the music video for Maroon 5's ""She Will Be Loved.""

Preston gave one of her most well-received performances in ""Jerry Maguire"" as the ex-fiancee of Cruise's sports agent who dumps him early in the movie. The Daily News called her ""icily effective.""

On Monday, Russell Crowe recalled knowing Preston in the '90s. He said he hadn't seen her much since, ""but when I did, she was always the same sparkly eyed gem.""

Preston occasionally appeared in films with her husband, though the results were seldom among either's best work. Among them: the box-office bomb ""Battlefield Earth"" in 2000 and the 2009 Disney comedy ""Old Dogs,"" also with their daughter, Ella Bleu.

In January 2009, Jett Travolta, 16, died after a seizure at the family's vacation home in the Bahamas. The death touched off a court case after an ambulance driver and his attorney were accused of trying to extort $25 million from the actors in exchange for not releasing sensitive information about their son's death.

Travolta testified during a criminal trial that ended in a mistrial and was prepared to testify a second time, but decided to stop pursuing the case and it was dismissed. He cited the severe strain the proceedings and his son's death had caused the family.

Both Preston and Travolta returned to acting, with Preston's first role back in the Nicholas Sparks adaptation, ""The Last Song,"" which starred Miley Cyrus and her future husband, Liam Hemsworth.

In addition to Jett and Ella Bleu, who was born in 2000, the couple had son Benjamin in 2010. Ella wrote on Instagram Sunday: ""I have never met anyone as courageous, strong, beautiful and loving as you. Anyone who is lucky enough to have known you or to have ever been in your presence will agree that you have a glow and a light that never ceases to shine and that makes anyone around you feel instantly happy.""

The couple last starred together in the 2018 film ""Gotti,"" with Travolta playing John Gotti and Preston playing the crime boss's wife, Victoria.

""Kelly's love and life will always be remembered,"" Travolta said on Instagram. ""I will be taking some time to be there for my children who have lost their mother, so forgive me in advance if you don't hear from us for a while. But please know that I will feel your outpouring of love in the weeks and months ahead as we heal.""

The body was discovered five days after the 33-year-old Rivera disappeared on Lake Piru, where her son was found July 8 alone a few hours later on a boat the two had rented, the Ventura County Sheriff's Office said.

Authorities would not immediately say if the person found was Rivera, but said the day after she disappeared that they believed she drowned in the lake northwest of Los Angeles. A 2 p.m. press conference was scheduled.

Search crews found the body floating in the northeast area of the lake, authorities said. The body would be flown 40 miles (64 kilometres) to the coroner's office in Ventura, Sheriff's Capt. Eric Buschow said. Rivera's family has been notified of the discovery.

The lake an hour's drive from Los Angeles was searched by dozens of divers working in waters with little visibility, with help from sonar and robotic devices combing the bottom and helicopters and drones searching above.

“I can't imagine what it's like for her parents, her family,” Buschow said. “It takes an emotional toll on the search teams too.”

Rivera played singing cheerleader Santana Lopez for six seasons on the Fox musical-comedy “Glee.”

If she is declared dead, she will become the third major cast member from the show to die in their 30s.

Cory Monteith, one of the show's leads, died at 31 in 2013 from a toxic mix of alcohol and heroin.

And co-star Mark Salling, who Rivera dated at one point, killed himself in 2018 at age 35 after pleading guilty to child pornography charges.

Rivera had experience boating on the lake in Los Padres National Forest, authorities said.

Surveillance video shows Rivera and her son, Josey Hollis Dorsey, leaving on the rented boat.

When the boat failed to return, its vendor found the vessel drifting in the northern end of the lake late Wednesday afternoon with the boy asleep on board. He told investigators that he and his mother had been swimming and he got back into the boat but she didn't, according to a sheriff's office statement.

The boy was wearing a life vest, and another life jacket was found in the boat along with Rivera's purse and identification.

Rivera is believed to have drowned “in what appears to be a tragic accident,” the statement said.

The boy, Rivera's son from her marriage to actor Ryan Dorsey, was safe and healthy and with family members, authorities said. The couple finalized their divorce in June 2018 after nearly four years of marriage.

The most recent tweet on Rivera's account, from July 7, read “just the two of us” along with a photo of her and her son.

The London-based influencer's family confirmed the news on Sunday in an Instagram post, stating that Thea's unborn son had also died.

""To all Nicole's friends and supporters it is with great sadness that I have to inform you that Nicole and her son she and Boga named Reign sadly passed away on Saturday morning,"" the statement read.

The message explained that Thea had pre-scheduled ""a few YouTube videos"" to upload on her channel before her death, and her boyfriend, Boga, had ""made the decision to allow them to be aired.""

The family asked for privacy, saying ""our hearts are truly broken and we are struggling to cope with what has happened.""

The cause of Thea's death is not yet known. The former dancer was around eight months pregnant.

Thea announced her pregnancy back in April with an Instagram video showing off her baby bump while dancing beside Boga.

""We can't hide this any longer, secrets out... GOD gave us the biggest blessing yet. I'm finally creating a beautiful little human inside of me,"" the accompanying caption read. ""Can't believe this bubba will be half of me and half of the loml. Honestly, @global_boga has been the best support EVER and GOD made no mistakes making him the father.""

She added: ""We are already obsessed with you our little miracle baby. Thank you for choosing us to be your parents and best friends.""

Thea had amassed more than 80,000 subscribers on her YouTube channel, where she often discussed her pregnancy journey and posted content featuring boyfriend Global Boga -- real name Jeffery Frimpong -- who is a street dancer.

Her most recent video, titled ""GOT IN A BATH FULL OF MILK! *BTS PREGNANCY SHOOT,"" was uploaded on Sunday.

In the 14-minute footage, Thea can be seen getting ready for her milk bath, while talking her followers through the process. She also showcased special moments from her maternity photoshoot.

On Saturday morning, Boga shared a video of himself dancing with a baby carriage and said in a post the week before that he believed his son was arriving ""on a Monday.""",[]
31,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/trudeau-morneau-apologize-for-not-recusing-themselves-from-we-decision-1.5021910,"Trudeau, Morneau apologize for not recusing themselves from WE decision",['Rachel Aiello'],2020-07-13 10:57:00-04:00,"OTTAWA -- Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Finance Minister Bill Morneau have issued apologizes for not removing themselves from conversations about granting WE Charity a sole-sourced contract to run the now-halted $900 million COVID-19 student volunteer program, given their personal connections to the organization.

""I made a mistake in not recusing myself immediately from the discussions, given our family's history, and I'm sincerely sorry about not having done that,"" Trudeau said.

Trudeau said he is sorry for how the rollout of the Canada Student Service Grant program went, and he regrets the “unnecessary controversy” it’s caused.

“The mistake that we made was on me, and I take responsibility for it. We will continue to work very, very hard to deliver the program,” Trudeau said, speaking about the ongoing controversy during his first national address on the federal government’s latest COVID-19 response plans from Rideau Cottage in two weeks.

Over the last two weeks, the controversy surrounding the government’s decision to allow the WE Charity to deliver a now-halted $900 million COVID-19 student grant program has grown considerably.

WE Charity backed away from administering the grants amid questions about Trudeau’s involvement, but also in light of a series of news stories about racialized former employees’ experiences with the organization.

The ethics commissioner also launched a probe into a potential conflict of interest with Trudeau’s decision to grant the organization the contract to administer the program, given the prime minister’s close personal ties to the charity.

“This was my mistake. This was me not stepping back from an organization that I should have known to not get involved with, even as prime minister, and allow the public service and non-connected ministers to move forward on delivering this program,” said Trudeau on Monday.

'I DIDN'T KNOW THE DETAILS'

Last week WE Charity confirmed that, over the years, Trudeau’s wife, mother, and brother have received a range of payments amounting to around $300,000 for speaking at WE events. Sophie Gregoire Trudeau is an ambassador with the organization and hosts a mental health podcast under its name. She received a ""one-time speaking honorarium"" of $1,400 for participating in a youth event in 2012, before Trudeau became leader of the Liberal Party.

On Monday, the prime minister faced a series of questions from reporters about whether he knew his family members got paid by WE, and said that, while he was aware of their professional speaking roles, he was unaware of just how much money his family members received.

""I have known, obviously, for many years that my mom has been an extraordinary advocate for mental health issues, a professional public speaker who works with a range of different organizations. Obviously I knew she worked with WE, I didn't know the details of how much she was getting paid by various organizations but I should have and I deeply regret that,” Trudeau said on Monday.

Trudeau said he also regrets bringing his mother, Margaret Trudeau, into the controversy, saying that it was “unfair.”

“I should have been thoughtful enough to recuse myself completely from any discussions around WE because of these connections from the very beginning, and I did not and I'm very sorry about that,” he said.

MORNEAU ALSO APOLOGIZES

Last week Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s office confirmed his daughters have connections to the charity and he also did not recuse himself from the decision-making table. The finance minister’s daughter Clare has spoken at WE events, and his daughter Grace is currently employed by WE Charity.

On Friday, Morneau also apologized for not removing himself from discussions about the student grant program.

“Given the fact that my daughter works for the organization in an unrelated branch, I now realize I should have in order to avoid any perception of conflict. I apologize for not doing so, and moving forward, I will recuse myself from any future discussions related to WE,” Morneau said in a statement.

STUDENTS LEFT IN LIMBO

Initially, WE Charity was selected to set up placements and administer grants to students and new graduates for their volunteer work this summer.

With the program halted, thousands of students are now in limbo without summer jobs and, for now, no chance for volunteer grants to help cover costs like fall tuition.

The grant to post-secondary students and recent graduates was designed to provide one-time payments of up to $5,000 for volunteering in pandemic-related programs, depending on the number of hours worked. For every 100 hours spent, a student will receive $1,000.

On Monday, Trudeau repeated his regret that his error in judgment has resulted in students hoping to help their communities being left in limbo instead.

“Because of the mistake I made in not withdrawing from these conversations when the public service recommended we move forward with the WE organization, it has gotten a little slower for young people who are facing a difficult time right now, to be able to get involved in their communities and make a difference,” Trudeau said.

Now, Trudeau says the government is looking to Service Canada as a potential avenue to run the program, despite doubling down on the statement that the public service had initially suggested outsourcing the program to WE Charity.

OPPOSITION PARTIES DIG IN

The Conservatives have written to the RCMP suggesting they look into the matter, while two House of Commons studies are underway into various aspects of the controversy.

Now, the opposition is looking to convene a third committee probe, with the intent to uncover as many documents as possible and aiming to call and a slate of cabinet ministers to testify.

Trudeau said a series of cabinet ministers will be testifying this week about the affair, and if he gets an invitation, he will consult with his House of Commons leadership team about attending.

“Obviously, the opposition parties have their job to do and they will keep doing it. I have my job to do as well, which is to make sure that Canadians are well supported through this pandemic and we have an economic restart that goes smoothly,” Trudeau said.

“Revelations that Justin Trudeau’s family was paid to speak at events for an organization, which later received a $900 million sole-source contract, are deeply disturbing,” said Conservative MP and ethics critic Michael Barrett in a statement about the push for a third committee study. “This new information has raised concerns about the way this Liberal government operates and whether the appropriate processes are in place to avoid conflicts of interest,” said Barrett.

Critics have pointed to the WE Charity affair as the latest in a series of ethical oversights Trudeau has had over his time as prime minister.

Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion’s ongoing investigation is now the third ethics investigation Trudeau has been subjected to, with the two previous times — his trip to the Aga Khan’s private island and in relation to the SNC-Lavalin prosecution — resulting in findings that Trudeau had breached federal ethics law. In both cases Trudeau apologized for his improper behaviour, and both times he said he had learned his lesson.

“I feel like it's Groundhog Day. We've seen so many instances where the prime minister gets caught… seems outraged that anyone could question him, and then as the scandal deepens then he apologizes,” said NDP MP and ethics critic Charlie Angus in an interview on CTV News Channel. He said what is most concerning is that no one around Trudeau seemed to try to stop him from getting involved given his close personal ties to the organization.

Angus said the controversy should have never happened and if the proper standards and protocols were in place, it wouldn’t have. He called it “one of the stupidest scandals in Canadian history.”

Asked if he was worried that the controversy puts his minority government on unstable footing after months of positive polling numbers, Trudeau said on Monday that he trusts Canadians will make judgments on his leadership based on the pandemic response as a whole.

“When we look at these things, proximity to the prime minister has an impact… The fact that it includes family members makes it very problematic for the prime minister,” said pollster Nik Nanos in an interview on CTV News Channel.

WE CHARITY WEIGHS IN

In a new statement on their website, WE Charity co-founders Craig Kielburger and Marc Kielburger say they want to “set the record straight” about the entire affair. The brothers wrote about how their organization was qualified to stickhandle the administration of the Canada Student Service Grant program, which had 35,000 applicants a week after launching. But, as their statement notes, “the program was immediately enmeshed in controversy,” and handed back over to the government along with the funding.

“WE has not profited from this contract in any way,” said the Keilburgers, adding that the last two weeks have been “extremely difficult.”

“The charity’s integrity and purpose has been called into question. It has had direct impacts on our staff, supporters, and beneficiaries. We have made mistakes that we sincerely regret,” says the statement.",[]

The RCMP said Andre Audet, a 62-year-old man from Boucherville, on the South Shore of Montreal, used pseudonyms on multiple social media sites where he allegedly made some 100 hate posts directed towards Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the Muslim community.

Specifically, Audet allegedly called for the death of Trudeau in addition to encouraging the eradication of Muslims.

After appearing in court for the same investigation in December, two new charges were laid against Audet following a more thorough analysis of the evidence, the RCMP said.

The charges Audet faces include advocating genocide, public incitement of hatred, willful promotion of hatred and intimidation of a justice system participant or journalist.

Audet is set to appear in court Monday to formally face the new charges.",[]

Trevor Florence, owner of the Invermere Soaring Centre, tells CTV News that he had just landed his glider shortly before 7 p.m. on July 10 and conditions were great. He began monitoring the unusual path of another glider using a device for collision avoidance on-board his glider.

The pilot of the airborne glider — who Florence says is a member of a Vancouver-area gliding club — was flying in an area that sparked concern. It appeared from the flight path that the glider was ""flying itself"" for several minutes before coming to an abrupt halt.

An emergency call was placed to RCMP, B.C. Ambulance and local search and rescue.

Ahead of the arrival of emergency personnel, Florence asked a helicopter pilot to help him survey the area for the downed glider. Within minutes, the pair spotted it from the air and the aircraft's cockpit appeared unscathed.

Florence was dropped near the site with a first-aid kit and he made his way to the wreckage where he discovered the pilot was alive and semi-conscious.

A helicopter with a doctor and members of Columbia Valley Search and Rescue arrived on scene and retrieved the man using a gurney and rope-rescue system.

Florence says the search and rescue crews did a ""marvelous job"" in reaching the scene in short order and commends the doctor for her actions.

""She was fantastic,"" he said.

The pilot of the downed glider was transported by helicopter to the Invermere Hospital and arrived within three hours of the crash.

According to Florence, the pilot had suffered a neurological issue in the minutes prior to the crash and suffered no serious injuries.

Due to the nature of his medical concerns, the pilot was airlifted from the Invermere Hospital and arrived at the Foothills Medical Centre in Calgary early Saturday morning.

Florence says, as of Monday morning, the glider pilot remains in hospital in Calgary where he has been able to sit upright and talk.

34,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/canada-s-largest-indigenous-police-force-has-never-shot-anyone-dead-1.5020967,Canada's largest Indigenous police force has never shot anyone dead,['Colin Perkel'],2020-07-12 11:02:00-04:00,"TORONTO -- In its 26 years of existence, officers with Canada's largest Indigenous police force have never shot and killed anyone and no officer has died in the line of duty, despite a grinding lack of resources and an absence of normal accountability mechanisms.

It's a record of which the Nishnawbe Aski Police Service is proud, especially in light of the recent uproar in North America over police killings and brutality involving Indigenous, Black, and mentally distressed people. It's a record achieved in communities frequently in social distress, places where hunting rifles and shotguns are ubiquitous.

The key difference from urban, non-Indigenous policing, insiders and observers say, is the relationship building between officers and the people they serve.

""In the past, you might have been the only officer in there,"" Roland Morrison, chief of NAPS says from Thunder Bay, Ont. ""You would have no radio, you've got no backup, so you really effectively have to use your communication and talk to people. You have to develop relationships with the communities in order to have positive policing.""

Inaugurated in 1994, NAPS is responsible for policing more than 38,000 people in 34 communities, many beyond remote, across a vast, largely untamed swath of northern Ontario. Currently the service has 203 officers, about 60 per cent of them Indigenous, Morrison says. Its mandate is culturally responsive policing.

Erick Laming, a criminology PhD candidate at the University of Toronto, says people from First Nation communities -- many with an ingrained suspicion of police given the brutal realities of generations of enforced residential school attendance -- have a higher level of trust when officers are Indigenous.

In contrast, he said, new RCMP recruits with no such background might find themselves in Nunavut or Yukon confronted with significant language and cultural barriers.

""If you're from the community, you have those lived experiences. You can relate to people. You just know how to deal with the issues,"" says Laming, who is from the Shabot Obaadjiwan First Nation north of Kingston, Ont.

""If you don't have that history, you can have all the cultural-sensitivity training in the world, you'll never fully be able to fully integrate into that situation.""

Another example, he said, is the service in Kahnawake, Que., which calls itself the Kahnawake Peacekeepers rather than a police force.

While all officers in Ontario undergo the same basic training, the province's nine Indigenous police services are fundamentally different from their non-Indigenous counterparts.

For one thing, they are not deemed an essential service, although federal Public Safety Minister Bill Blair said last month that policing First Nations communities should be. Nor are those in Ontario subject to the provincial Police Services Act, which mandates standards, including for an extensive oversight framework.

Now, the process for filing complaints against members of an Indigenous police force is ad hoc, although NAPS does have a professional standards branch and will on occasion call in Ontario Provincial Police. Officers have been disciplined, charged or even fired for excessive use of force.

Another difference is that Indigenous forces are completely reliant on the vagaries of government program funding -- with Ottawa footing 52 per cent of the bill and provinces 48 per cent. The current operations budget for NAPS, for example, is around $37.7 million -- more than its peers -- with expenses approaching $40 million.

The upshot, particularly in years gone by, has been a dire shortage of officers and even of basic facilities and equipment that urbanites can scarcely imagine. In more than a dozen cases, Indigenous self-administered police services in Canada have simply folded.

Now retired, Terry Armstrong, who spent 22 years with Ontario Provincial Police as well as five years as chief of NAPS, says people would be shocked to find out just how poorly funded First Nations policing has been.

Armstrong recounts how a few years ago, in the Hudson Bay community of Fort Severn, Ont., a NAPS officer found himself dealing with a homicide. Besides having to secure three crime scenes and the body, the lone officer had to arrest the suspect and deal with a separate gun call. Bad weather prevented any forensic or other help flying in until the following day.

One thing he always stressed to newcomers as chief, Armstrong says, is the importance of treating people respectfully.

""Some day, they're going to be your backup. When stuff goes south, you're going to need people to support you,"" he says. ""If you're going to be a dick ... when you need help, they aren't going to be there for you.""

One frigid afternoon in February 2013, the only on-duty NAPS officer in Kasabonika Lake First Nation in Ontario's far north detained Lena Anderson, an intoxicated young mother upset over the apprehension of her daughter. The new detachment portable was unheated. The old holding cell was unusable because prisoners could escape through holes in the floor.

The arresting officer left Anderson, 23, in the caged back seat of his Ford 150 police truck for warmth while he went to get help from his off-duty colleague. Alone for 16 minutes, Anderson strangled herself.

The tragedy, combined with a threatened strike over working conditions by NAPS officers, caused an uproar. The situation, says Grand Chief Alvin Fiddler, prompted his Nishnawbe Aski Nation to take a stand. Governments, he said, had to do better or face the far more daunting prospect of doing the policing themselves.

As a result, Fiddler says, a new funding agreement was reached in 2018 that allowed the hiring of 79 new officers over five years and critical infrastructure upgrades to detachments and poor or non-existent communication systems. Most importantly, he said, the deal set in motion pending Ontario legislation that would finally allow First Nations police services to opt in to the Police Services Act, putting in place solid standards and accountability mechanisms.

""That's something our communities and citizens deserve."" Fiddler says. ""If they have an issue with NAPS, there should be a forum for them to pursue their grievance.""

However, giving investigative authority to the province's Special Investigations Unit or Office of the Independent Police Review Director must come with cultural safety built in, he says.

Stephen Leach, current review director, says his office is not yet involved in the opt-in process.

""My expectation is that once the Community Safety and Policing Act is proclaimed and the opt-in process is further along, then I would be involved in explaining how the public complaints process works, and listening to how it might have to be adapted to meet the needs of First Nations communities,"" Leach says.

Stephen Warner, a spokesman for Ontario Solicitor General Sylvia Jones, confirmed the government was working on regulations to the new act. Part of the work, he said, was to set clear and consistent standards for policing delivery ""informed by, and responsive to, the views of the communities that police are both a part of and serve.""

Toronto-based lawyer Julian Falconer calls the new legislation a game changer. Despite having devoted much of his career to holding police accountable, he says he has no qualms in representing NAPS.

Despite, or perhaps because of, their chronic lack of resources, Falconer says Indigenous police behave much differently from their urban counterparts. He cites the dearth of police killings and racist behaviours that have sown deep mistrust of policing among Indigenous, Black and marginalized groups.

""Mainstream policing has a lot to learn from Indigenous policing,"" Falconer said. ""The relationship between community and policing is so dramatically different.""

""If the basics aren't followed, there is only one way this pandemic is going to go,""said the director of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. ""It's going to get worse and worse and worse.""

Debate over the risks the virus poses, and how best to fight it, were spotlighted in Florida after it shattered the record among U.S. states for the largest single-day increase, with more than 15,000 newly confirmed cases.

Officials and health experts in hard-hit Miami pushed back against pressure, both from Gov. Ron DeSantis and President Donald Trump, to bring students back to classrooms next month.

""We just absolutely cannot risk the health of children, their well-being and safety, or any of our colleagues,"" said Karla Hernandez-Mats, president of the United Teachers of Dade union and a middle school teacher herself. ""We're probably going to have to go to a full shutdown mode. I can't see the schools reopening except with the 100% virtual model.""

Parents have until Wednesday to notify the Miami-Dade school district of their decision whether they will send their kids to school this fall or have them study online from home.

""Children can get get the virus in their bodies and get contaminated just like anybody else,"" said Florida International University epidemiologist Dr. Aileen Marty, who has been advising the Miami school district on its reopening plans.

DeSantis has argued that children have not proven to be vectors for the disease and that if retailers like Walmart can be reopened safely, then schools should be able to as well. But he made those arguments with a notable caveat, saying that each county should make it own decision on reopening in consultation with local health officials.

The debate is hardly limited to Florida.

In Detroit, where summer school classes for hundreds of students opened Monday, protesters blocked a school bus yard with tree branches.

""When I visited schools this morning I knew we were doing the right thing for children,"" schools Superintendent Nikolai Vitti said, in a post on Twitter.

""COVID is not going away. Many of our children need face-to-face, direct engagement,"" he said.

But lawyer Shanta Driver said she planned to file a lawsuit to stop the in-person instruction.

""I'm not going back until this pandemic is defeated. There is not a safe way to return to school while this virus is spreading uncontained,"" said teacher Benjamin Royal.

Officials in California's two largest school districts, Los Angeles and San Diego, announced Monday that students will stick to online learning from home when school resumes next month, rather than return to classrooms.

The districts cited research about school safety experiences from around the world, along with state and local health guidance.

""One fact is clear: Those countries that have managed to safely reopen schools have done so with declining infection rates and on-demand testing available. California has neither,"" the districts said in a joint statement. Los Angeles, the second largest school district in the U.S., has about 730,000 students and San Diego serves about 135,000 students.

In North Carolina, which reported its highest one-day number of cases and hospitalizations, Gov. Roy Cooper has asked school districts to prepare three re-opening plans that include options for in-person and fully remote learning. His decision is expected later this week.

But teacher Becky Maxam, whose husband is considered high-risk for the virus because of a genetic heart condition, said she doesn't plan to return if her Charlotte middle school reopens.

""I'm not going back if we're opening up. I can't risk my family,"" Maxam said. ""I think we should be virtual until we find a vaccine or cases go down much more than what they are.""

The debate over what to do about schools came as a pair of WHO experts were in China for a mission to trace the origin of the pandemic. The virus was first detected in central China's city of Wuhan late last year. Beijing had been reluctant to allow a probe but relented after scores of countries called on the WHO to conduct a thorough investigation.

China has argued that the virus might have originated outside of China and has angrily denied allegations that it covered up the scale of the outbreak as infections first began to spread.

Also Monday, the United Nations warned that the pandemic could cause 130 million more people worldwide to go hungry this year.

U.N. officials estimate there were about 690 million people in 2019 who went hungry worldwide, with the majority in Asia and Africa.

""While it is too soon to assess the full impact of the lockdowns and other containment measures,"" the agency said that, at a minimum, another 83 million would go hungry as a result of the pandemic.

The WHO's Tedros said the consequences would be worst for the world's most vulnerable populations. But he noted Monday that the most recent surge in cases had come in the Americas. The United States and Brazil alone account for more than a third of all global deaths from the disease.

""I really do think we could control this, and it's the human element that is so critical. It should be an effort of our country. We should be pulling together when we're in a crisis, and we're definitely not doing it,"" said University of Florida epidemiologist Cindy Prins.

But with Trump pressuring school districts to reopen this fall, and with the academic year in some southern states just weeks away, the debate over how to respond to the resurgence is growing more heated.

Trump has harshly criticized the WHO over its response to the coronavirus pandemic and accused it of bowing to Chinese influence. The Trump administration formally notified the U.N. last week of its withdrawal from WHO, although the pullout won't take effect until July 6, 2021.

In Japan, more than 30 Marines tested positive at the Futenma U.S. air station on Okinawa, where infections among American service members have rapidly risen to more than 90 since last week. Okinawa is home to more than half of about 50,000 American troops based in Japan.

In other parts of the world, the number of infections has been rising dramatically in India, South Africa and Brazil, whose virus-denying president has tested positive.

India, which has the most confirmed virus cases after the United States and Brazil, on Monday reported a record daily surge of 28,701 new cases reported in the past 24 hours. Authorities in several cities are reinstating strict lockdowns after attempting to loosen things up to revive an ailing economy.

In South Africa, which accounts for over 40% of all the reported coronavirus cases in Africa, President Cyril Ramaphosa reimposed a ban on alcohol sales and a nighttime curfew to reduce the number of people needing emergency treatment so hospitals have more beds to treat COVID-19 patients.

""We are taking these measures fully aware that they impose unwelcome restrictions on people's lives. They are, however, necessary to see us through the peak of the disease,"" Ramaphosa said in a letter to the nation Monday. ""There is no way that we can avoid the coronavirus storm. But we can limit the damage that it can cause to our lives.""

The moves to undercut Fauci come just days after he gave an unvarnished look at his relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump, including that they have not spoken in weeks.

The tension between the two men -- who are no longer speaking, CNN reported last week -- has grown publicly as they have responded to one another through interviews and statements. But recent moves by the White House to publicly diminish the nation's top infectious disease expert amounts to a significant escalation as it seeks to divert attention from the government's failure to contain the coronavirus and instead push Trump's call to reopen the country. That effort continued Monday morning, when the President retweeted a baseless claim by game show host Chuck Woolery that ""everyone is lying"" about the coronavirus -- including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

In a statement Saturday, a White House official told CNN that ""several White House officials are concerned about the number of times Dr. Fauci has been wrong on things."" The official went on to provide a lengthy list of examples, citing Fauci's comments early in the pandemic and linking to past interviews.

These bullet points, which resembled opposition research on a political opponent, included Fauci downplaying the virus early on and a quote from March when Fauci said, ""People should not be walking around with masks,"" among other comments. Not included were previous statements from the surgeon general urging people not to buy masks or an acknowledgment of the President's own false claims and misstatements about the virus.

Fauci did not return a request for comment by CNN. But in a recent series of newspaper and radio interviews, Fauci, who has worked under six U.S. presidents from both parties, has at times openly disagreed with Trump.

In particular, a recent interview with the Financial Times in which Fauci disclosed that he has not briefed the President in weeks prompted the White House to distribute the list of Fauci statements, an aide familiar with the matter said. Among other things, Fauci disputed Trump's claim that ""99%"" of coronavirus cases in the United States were ""totally harmless"" -- saying that was ""obviously not the case"" -- and drew a connection between his insistence on ""speaking the truth at all times"" to his noticeably diminished television appearances.

A person familiar with the situation acknowledged that Fauci has been appearing on television less frequently because Trump is annoyed by his public statements. Though Trump was already miffed by Fauci's television appearances early on, the White House has sought to downplay tension between the two for several months. The press shop stopped approving Fauci's television appearances, believing it would help alleviate the situation, though they continued to allow him to give interviews with print outlets.

Another person familiar has said the rare in-person meetings between Trump and Fauci are not awkward and don't involve raised voices, but Trump has complained about Fauci privately. Sources say part of that irritation is over the ""good press"" Fauci has received. Trump's irritation with Fauci has also, at times, been encouraged by Peter Navarro, Trump's trade adviser who has repeatedly blamed Fauci for doubting the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine.

Navarro once told Fauci he would be personally responsible if it was later shown that hydroxychloroquine worked to treat coronavirus, despite multiple studies questioning its use.

One senior administration official told CNN that some officials within the White House do not trust Fauci. According to the source, those officials think Fauci doesn't have the best interest of the President, pointing to some of Fauci's interviews. Other administration officials have told CNN that while they have disagreements with Fauci's methods, they don't doubt his motives, and that his only concern was public health.

In an interview on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" Sunday, Adm. Brett Giroir, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, said there is ""open discourse"" within the team.

""I respect Dr. Fauci a lot, but Dr. Fauci is not 100% right and he also doesn't necessarily -- and he admits that -- have the whole national interest in mind. He looks at it from a very narrow public health point of view,"" Giroir said.

Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs at Health and Human Services Michael Caputo said Sunday there was no White House-versus-the scientists narrative.

""We have great faith in the capacity of all of our scientists and doctors on the coronavirus taskforce to impart necessary public health information. People like Admiral (Brett) Giroir, Surgeon General (Jerome) Adams and others are carrying these messages very effectively,"" Caputo said in the statement, although he did not directly answer questions about Fauci.

Fauci is scheduled to be in the West Wing Monday for meetings.

TRUMP PUBLICLY CRITICIZES FAUCI

Trump -- who in April retweeted a message calling for Fauci to be fired, though he later downplayed the significance of the message when asked -- has recently intensified his public criticism of Fauci in recent weeks.

""Dr. Fauci is a nice man, but he's made a lot of mistakes,"" Trump said last week, undermining the public health expert whom Americans say in polls they trust more than the President.

In recent interviews, he openly questioned the advice he'd received from Fauci at the start of the outbreak.

""I think we are in a good place. I disagree with him,"" Trump said in an interview Tuesday when questioned about Fauci's assertion the U.S. is still ""knee-deep in the first wave"" of the pandemic.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, said Sunday evening that any effort by the White House to sideline or discredit Fauci is ""just atrocious.""

Schiff told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on ""The Situation Room"" that such a move ""is so characteristic of Donald Trump. He can't stand the fact that the American people trust Dr. Fauci and they don't trust Donald Trump -- and so he has to tear him down.""

""We need people more than ever to speak truth to power, to be able to level with the American people about what we're facing with this pandemic, how to get it under control, how to protect ourselves and our families,"" Schiff continued. ""That's what Dr. Fauci has been trying to do and by sidelining him the President is once again interfering with an effective response to this pandemic.""

Kathleen Sebelius, who served as secretary of Health and Human Services under former President Barack Obama, told CNN efforts to discredit Fauci and other scientists are ""potentially very, very dangerous"" as the US and other countries work toward a coronavirus vaccine.

""I think people want to know from the scientists that the vaccine is safe, that it is effective, that it will not do more harm than good,"" she told Blitzer on ""The Situation Room.""

""And if the public scientists have been discredited, if the President says 'don't believe them, you can't listen to them, they're often wrong,' we have then undermined a national vaccination campaign which is an essential step to bringing this horrible period to an end.""

Prosecutors made the revelation in court papers as they argued there is no reason to free Ghislaine Maxwell on bail.

The 58-year-old British socialite has been held without bail since her recent arrest at a $1 million New Hampshire estate she bought late last year.

Prosecutors told a Manhattan federal judge in written arguments that at least one woman and possibly more were expected to exercise their right to appear at Tuesday's hearing and ask that Maxwell be detained until trial.

“The Government is deeply concerned that if the defendant is bailed, the victims will be denied justice in this case,” prosecutors wrote.

The filing came a day before an arraignment and bail hearing for Maxwell, who has been held for the last week at a federal jail in Brooklyn.

On Friday, her lawyers filed arguments that said she's being made a scapegoat after Epstein killed himself in a Manhattan lockup last August. They said she should be freed on $5 million bail with electronic monitoring.

“Ghislaine Maxwell,” they wrote, “is not Jeffrey Epstein.”

They said their client denies any allegations of misconduct, has had no contact with Epstein for more than a decade and has never been charged with a crime or found liable in civil litigation stemming from the allegations against Epstein.

Prosecutors noted that Maxwell's defence lawyers proposed offering as collateral property their client owns in the United Kingdom, but they said that was beyond the reach of U.S. authorities.

Epstein was arrested in July 2019 and was awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges of women and girls in Florida and New York in the early 2000s when he died by suicide in custody.",[]
38,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/virus-immunity-may-disappear-within-months-study-1.5021708,Virus immunity may disappear within months: study,['Patrick Galey'],2020-07-13 08:58:00-04:00,"PARIS, FRANCE -- Patients who recover from coronavirus infections may lose their immunity to reinfection within months, according to research released on Monday that experts said could have a ""significant"" influence on how governments manage the pandemic.

In the first study of its kind, a team led by researchers from King's College London examined the levels of antibodies in more than 90 confirmed virus patients and how they changed over time.

Blood tests showed even individuals with only mild COVID-19 symptoms mounted some immune response to the virus.

Of the study group, 60 per cent showed a ""potent"" viral response in the first few weeks after infection.

However, after three months only 16.7 per cent had maintained high levels of COVID-19-neutralizing antibodies, and after 90 days several patients had no detectable antibodies in their bloodstream.

When the body encounters an external danger such as a virus, it mobilises cells to track down and kill the culprit.

As it does so, it produces proteins known as antibodies that are programmed to target the specific antigen the body is fighting, like a key cut for a particular lock.

As long as someone has enough antibodies, they will be able to snub out new infections, giving them immunity.

But Monday's research suggests immunity cannot be taken for granted and may not last more than a few months, as is true with other viruses such as influenza.

'PLAYING THE LOTTERY'

Experts said the findings may change how governments plan for the next phase of the pandemic, including how they fund and organise vaccine research and development.

""This is an important study that starts to define the longer-term dynamics of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2,"" said Lawrence Young, professor of Molecular Oncology at the University of Warwick, using the full name of the virus strain.

""It further emphasises the need for us to better understand what a protective immune response looks like if we are to develop an effective vaccine,"" said Young, who was not involved in the research.

James Gill, an honorary Clinical Lecturer at Warwick Medical School, said the research reiterated the need for everyone to continue taking measures to mitigate the virus spreading, particularly at the start of Europe's holiday season.

""In the same way that these patients were surprised to have antibodies to COVID19, we should NOT be surprised if any protective benefit is mild, or at least transient,"" he said.

""If you played the lottery and won £10, you wouldn't immediately think that you had acquired increased natural luck, and used your life savings to buy further lottery tickets.

""Even those with a positive antibody test -- especially those who cannot account for where they may have been exposed -- should continue to use caution, social distancing and appropriate mask use.""",[]
39,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/b-c-man-prepares-to-be-first-to-receive-double-hand-transplant-in-canada-1.5020297,B.C. man prepares to be first to receive double-hand transplant in Canada,[],2020-07-11 10:34:00-04:00,"VANCOUVER -- When Rick Thompson's doctor told him a surgical team was going ahead with his double-hand transplant in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, his first reaction was surprise.

""We're targeting August, maybe early September,"" he said in a recent interview.

""I was even shocked when (the doctor) told me. I met him last week and I asked him for a ballpark time frame. And he said August, and I said 'Oh, OK.' I wasn't quite ready for that.""

Thompson moved to Ontario from British Columbia in April to prepare for the surgery in London. It involves medical and psychological tests, as well as finding a donor.

If things go as planned, Thompson will be Canada's first double-hand transplant patient.

Thompson had all of his limbs amputated after contracting bacterial meningitis and septic shock in 2015.

He left work early one day in May, after feeling like he was coming down with the flu, and decided to sleep it off. A few hours later, he woke up to get a drink of water.

""But when I stood up my feet were like on fire. I could barely walk. I made it downstairs to where my wife Rita was watching TV. And that's pretty well the last thing I remember. I just collapsed on the floor.""

He woke up six weeks later in intensive care, confronted with the choice of dying in palliative care or amputation.

""If I wanted to survive, I would need all four limbs amputated,"" he said.

""In the end, the will to live is stronger than anything else.""

After 8 1/2 hours of surgery, doctors had amputated his limbs.

""That was a difficult time, obviously, because you know, you wake up as a different person. You look down and all you see is bandages ... where your hands used to be or where your legs and feet used to be,"" he said.

""The first thing that came to my mind was, what did I just do?""

After learning about hand transplants two years ago, Thompson met with a team of doctors in Ontario to assess whether he would make a suitable candidate.

""It's life changing,"" he said.

""Being able to shake someone's hand, being able to pick up a cup of coffee with one hand, write your name with a pen, open a door, you know, just the things that we take for granted every day.""

Dr. Steven McCabe, who performed Canada's first hand transplant, may participate in the surgery. He is a hand surgeon at Toronto Western Hospital and an associate professor at the University of Toronto.

The surgery can take 10 to 12 hours with four teams of surgeons. Each team consists of six to 10 people.

While operating on both hands makes the surgery logistically harder because it involves more people, McCabe said it is ""logical"" to do the two transplants at the same time.

""When you transplant, you're introducing this different tissue,"" he explained. ""And the theory behind that is that you don't want to introduce two different donor tissues.""

A person who undergoes a transplant has to take immunosuppressants, so the body doesn't reject the new organ or limb, and it's easier when surgery is done all at once, he said.

""So if you transplanted one limb, and then three months or a year later, the other one, you'd have to go through that again. The idea is to get that all over with one donor.""

But there's also another reason.

""Having one hand when you have none is a huge benefit,"" McCabe said.

""But if you're going to have that type of surgery, and it seems logical to transplant both hands, part of the sense of wholeness is restored. It seems to be very important for patients.""

There are risks associated with the surgery, including infections and the possibility of blood loss. But McCabe said the benefits outweigh the risks, and limb transplants have low rejection rates.

After the surgery, transplant patients face a long recovery, he added.

""If you transplant the limb near the elbow, it will take a few months for the muscles to start to work again, and maybe up to a year or more for the nerves to get down to the fingers to have some feeling,"" McCabe said. ""So, I think we would say, you can't judge whether it's really helped or not for at least a couple years.""

Thompson said unlike most organ transplants, a hand transplant is visible.

""It's physically there. So getting over the mental challenge is going to be the hardest one, because you know they belonged to someone else at one point and now they're on your body,"" Thompson said.

""You have to look at it as a gift ... (the donor) family has decided to give you this gift. And it's a gift I'm not going to waste.""

Both said they had chosen to publicize the infections on their own, with one deciding to close for cleaning too, without being asked by authorities to do either thing.

“Although we have not been contacted by Quebec Public Health,” wrote management of La Voûte bar in Old Montreal on Friday, “it is our civic responsibility to inform you.”

They’re right, say public health authorities: bars are not required to warn clients in these cases, or to close.

“A bar does not have to close if there has been a [person who tested positive] that frequented it during his or her infectious period,” said Marie-Claude Lacasse, a spokeswoman for Quebec’s health department.

This, however, is because health authorities are supposed to already be on top of the situation through contact tracing, and their system doesn’t rely on establishments reporting this kind of concern.

Instead, it starts with individual people’s positive test results and works backwards, including checking if they’ve been at a bar or restaurant.

“These are assessments that are made by the public health [regional authorities], depending on the situation,” wrote Lacasse.

For example, in the case of a bar, was the infected person an employee or a client? How long did they spend in the bar, and were people complying at the time with other health measures?

“In the same vein, a public place or a workplace is not necessarily closed if a positive case has been present,” she said. It depends on a variety of factors.

It’s not that being forthcoming is to be discouraged, others said.

“It would be weird for us to say no, right,” if a bar owner wanted to take that initiative, said Jean Nicolas Aubé, a spokesperson for Montreal’s public health department.

However, he thinks people should know that contact tracers get to work quickly on every single positive test result, contacting the person involved.

“It generally is within the day. It’s very fast,” said Aubé.

Montreal’s public health department doesn’t comment on specific contact tracing cases, including the two bar-associated ones this week, he said.

An infectious diseases specialist agreed that it can’t hurt to give people more warning,

“As a physician I would say that is an admirable effort,” said Dr. Matthew Oughton of McGill, speaking of bar owners’ COVID-19 transparency.

However, he’d want to make sure they “can do it in a way that, as much as possible, protects the right to privacy of people's medical information,” he said.

Oughton also said people shouldn’t panic at the idea that they won’t always hear about cases they crossed paths with. The risk should still be fairly low, and it’s important to remember that prior to this kind of announcement, “what [public health] did behind the scenes is invisible.”

Closing and doing a deep clean makes a lot of sense for a business owner for other reasons, however, said Oughton.

“From a practical perspective, if I were a customer and I found out there were cases at a bar and the bar knew and didn't say anything… I don't think that would be a very smart public relations route,” he said.

There’s one last thing to keep in mind about human nature—a reason not to announce every single positive case, he said.

This marks the second extension of the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS). On May 15, the government added an additional 12 weeks to the program, extending eligibility to August 29.

""For the last three months, you’ve seen me come out to talk with Canadians about what we’re doing to help you and your family, your employer, your local businesses deal with this pandemic. We’re going to continue to do that vital work,"" said Trudeau during a press briefing outside Rideau Cottage in Ottawa.

Announced on March 27, the CEWS provides qualifying businesses and non-profits funding for 75 per cent of employee wages, retroactive from March 15.

The objective of the program is to keep employees on the payroll so businesses can rebound more quickly when restrictions are lifted and the economy restarts. The CEWS had a slow uptake, but has increased in popularity as more Canadians transition off of the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.

In an interview on CTV’s Question Period in May, Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough attributed the program’s rocky start to barriers in the application process.

""It’s been slower than expected. I think businesses are having to put a lot of time and effort into their applications because you have to dig into your payroll – who earned what and when,"" she said.

Since then, the government has been consulting with the business community and promoting its benefit amid calls from opposition that the Liberal’s are disincentivizing Canadians from returning to work as CERB application numbers balloon.

As of July 5, just under 19 million Canadians had applied for the benefit and more than $54 billion had been paid out.

The new $82. 3 billion CEWS projection, outlined in last Wednesday’s fiscal snapshot, is a stark increase from the original $45 billion estimate.

As of July 6, 581,800 out of a total of 587, 060 submissions had been approved. This equates to slightly more than $18 billion.",[]

This comes as Trudeau spoke to U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday morning, though the border was not among the range of topics the prime minister said the two world leaders discussed — despite the looming July 21 deadline.

""Every month we have been able to extend the border closures to all but essential goods and services and those discussions are ongoing with the United States right now as we are a week from the next deadline for closures,"" Trudeau said.

""We're going to continue to work hard to keep Canadians safe and to keep our economies flowing, we will have more to say later this week I'm sure.""

Canada has been under renewed pressure to reopen the shared border, despite surging COVID-19 case numbers in the United States. At the end of June, the U.S. became home to the world’s highest number of reported infections: more than 2.2 million. That number has since soared to more than 3.3 million, according to the New York Times, with more than 134,000 deaths.

Despite these figures, 29 bipartisan members of U.S. Congress penned an open letter to Public Safety Minister Bill Blair calling on the Canadian government to plan a phased reopening of the Canada-U.S. border and to consider easing existing measures.

""We are asking that the United States and Canada immediately craft a comprehensive framework for phased reopening of the border based on objective metrics and accounting for the varied circumstances across border regions,"" read the letter, which was published on Western New York Congressman Brian Higgins' website on July 3.

The members of Congress, who represent the northern states along the border, also implored the Canadian government to consider easing restrictions on family members and property owners impeded by the restrictions.

The Canadian government pushed back on the request, with Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland's office telling CTVNews.ca in a statement that the health and safety of Canadians is ""absolutely priority.""

""Decisions about Canada's border are made by Canadians, for Canadians,"" Freeland's spokesperson Katherine Cuplinskas said in the statement on Friday.

The suggestion was also unpopular with non-politician Canadians, who took to social media to express their staunch opposition.

In response to a tweet from Higgins, who had shared the open letter on his Twitter account, hundreds of Canadians slammed the suggestion.

""No thank you...clean up your backyard before you attempt to enter ours..sincerely Canada,"" wrote a user who goes by the name @MichelletypoQ.

Another user, @rachelinTO, wrote that ""most of our earliest cases came from the U.S. So......that's a firm 'no'. Sorry, eh.""

Users called the request ""disastrous"" and multiple accounts said they’d only be comfortable easing restrictions after seeing improvement in the number of COVID-19 cases in the U.S.

TRUMP, TRUDEAU DISCUSS TARIFF THREAT

While Trudeau did not give any indication in his press conference that he and Trump had touched on the border issue during their phone call on Monday, he did confirm that the two discussed a host of other issues — including China and the two detained Canadians, the Black Lives Matter movement, and the U.S. president’s renewed aluminium tariff threat.

""I impressed upon him that it would be a shame to see tariffs come in between our two countries at a time where we’re celebrating NAFTA , and at a time where we want our businesses and our manufacturers to get going as quickly as possible,"" Trudeau said.

""We pledged to keep working on it together.""

Trudeau also said he told Trump that the pandemic had disrupted the usual supply chains and manufacturing processes, but that this disruption is slowly subsiding.

""That is starting to realign itself, given the economies are starting up again and manufacturing is getting going,"" Trudeau said.

CTV News confirmed the possibility of the U.S. slapping another set of tariffs on Canada at the end of June. The tariffs would fall under Section 232 of the U.S. Trade Expansion Act, and the threat comes amid U.S. claims that their aluminum market is being flooded by Canadian product.

Two Canadian sources told CTV News at the time that the announcement is possible in the coming weeks, though to date no formal announcement of tariffs has transpired.

Should the U.S. decide to re-impose tariffs on Canada, it would reopen a trade rift between the two countries that had been healing since a spat just over a year ago, that saw the U.S. impose tariffs on steel and aluminum and Canada answer with tariffs on a wide array of U.S. products including quiche, mayonnaise, and toilet paper.

Trudeau has been outspoken in his defence of Canada's aluminum industry, noting when the possibility of the U.S. imposing new tariffs emerged recently, that the U.S. ""needs Canadian aluminum"" and would only be hurting its own economy.

""Our economies are so interlinked that punitive actions by the United States administration end up hurting Americans the same way they end up hurting Canadians,"" Trudeau said at the time.",[]

The liftoff of the UAE's Mars orbiter named Amal, or Hope, on a Japanese H-IIA rocket is scheduled for early Wednesday from the Tanegashima Space Center in southern Japan, in what would be the Arab world's first interplanetary mission.

A final decision will be made Tuesday before the roll out of the rocket, said Keiji Suzuki, launch site director for Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.

A seasonal rain front was expected to cause intermittent lightning and rain over the next few days, he said.

""But this thunder is not expected to be severe or lasting, and our assessment is that there will be a chance for a launch,"" Suzuki told an online briefing Monday from Tanegashima. ""We will make a careful decision based on data.""

Heavy rain has continued for more than a week in large areas of Japan, triggering mudslides and floods and killing more than 70 people, most of them on the southern main island of Kyushu.

Hope is set to reach Mars in February 2021, the year the UAE celebrates 50 years since its formation. A successful Hope mission would be a major step for the oil-dependent economy seeking a future in space.

Hope carries three instruments to study the upper atmosphere and monitor climate change and is scheduled to circle the red planet for at least two years.

Emirates Mars Mission Project Director Omran Sharaf, who joined Monday's briefing from Dubai, said the mission is not just a repeat of what other countries have done. It will provide a complete view of the Martian atmosphere during different seasons for the first time, he said.

Two other Mars missions are planned in coming days by the U.S. and China. Japan has its own Martian moon mission planned in 2024.",[]

Locals said waves of waste -- mostly plastic bottles, fishing nets and buoys -- floated ashore late Saturday. They spotted turtle carcasses among the sand dunes early Sunday.

Bangladesh's forestry department said it was the first time such a large volume of plastic had washed onto the 120-kilometre beach along the Bay of Bengal.

""Hundreds of locals rushed to the beach since early morning to rescue the wounded turtles,"" forestry spokesman Sohail Hossain told AFP.

""We have buried the dead ones and are trying to release the rescued turtles back to sea.""

Beach clean-up charity Plastic Bank Bangladesh said their volunteers found and buried at least 20 Olive Ridley turtles among the estimated 50 tonnes of waste spread out over a 10 kilometre stretch of the beach at Cox's Bazar.

""I haven't seen these many dead turtles lying on the beach in my life and also haven't seen such a massive pile of waste floating ashore,"" fisherman Jashim Uddin told AFP.

Leading Bangladesh turtle and tortoise expert Shahriar Caesar Rahman of the NGO Creative Conservation Alliance said most of the turtles were at least 30 years old.

""The turtles often get trapped in gigantic waste patches floating in the sea and eventually die of suffocation. This seems to be a similar case,"" he told AFP.

About 26 tonnes of waste produced from ships and neighbouring countries float into Bay of Bengal every year, said Moazzem Hossain of local conservation charity Save the Nature Bangladesh.

""This is a unique case of plastic invasion. It sends a great danger signal to our marine biodiversity,"" he said.

It was not clear how many turtles were rescued.

Local district administrator Kamal Hossain said authorities were investigating the incident.

Olive Ridleys are the most abundant of all sea turtles around the world, according to conservationists.

But their numbers have been declining and the species is recognised as vulnerable by the IUCN Red list.",[]

The case, brought by Amnesty International in January, called on the court to prevent NSO from selling its technology abroad, especially to repressive regimes.

The Tel Aviv District Court ruled that Amnesty's attorneys did not provide sufficient evidence ""to prove the claim that an attempt was made to track a human rights activist by trying to hack his cellphone"" or that the hacking was done by NSO.

""Granting a license is done after the most rigorous process and also after granting the permit, the authority conducts oversight and close inspection, as necessary,"" the court said. If human rights are found to be violated, that permit can be suspended or cancelled, it added.

The court issued its ruling on Sunday, but only made it public on Monday.

Gil Naveh, spokesman for Amnesty International Israel, said the group was disappointed but not surprised.

""It's been a longstanding tradition for the Israeli courts to be a rubber stamp for the Israeli Ministry of Defence,"" he said.

The group doesn't know what evidence NSO or the Defence Ministry gave to the court, because the hearings were closed. ""Even if we knew, we were not able to talk about it,"" he said.

In 2018, Amnesty claimed one of its employees was targeted by NSO's malware, saying a hacker tried to break into the staffer's smartphone, using a WhatsApp message about a protest in front of the Saudi Embassy in Washington as bait.

NSO, an Israeli hacker-for-hire company, uses its Pegasus spyware to take control of a phone, its cameras and microphones, and mine the user's personal data.

The company has been accused of selling its surveillance software to repressive governments that use it against dissidents. It doesn't disclose clients, but they are believed to include Middle Eastern and Latin American states. The company says it sells its technology to Israeli-approved governments to help them combat criminals and terrorism.

NSO Group said in a statement that the company ""will continue to work to provide technology to states and intelligence organizations,"" adding that its purpose is to ""save human lives.""

In a report published last month, Amnesty International said Moroccan journalist Omar Radi's phone was tapped using NSO's technology as part of the government's efforts to clamp down on dissent.

For many families the thought of discussing money can make them uneasy and is often a taboo subject. In fact, this conversation doesn't discriminate -- wealthy, poor, young or old no one likes to open themselves up and share their financial situation, especially if it is challenging.

Money is deeply personal and can influence our lives in so many ways.

Families are finding this out first-hand as the pandemic has hit the bottom line and parents are struggling. One or both parents may find themselves laid off permanently or temporarily and while the government aid can help pay the bills and keep a roof over their head today these same parents who may have in the past been able to afford to say ""yes"" to their children are now finding themselves having to say ""no"" financially. And that is ok.

There are going to be opportunities during this pandemic that are going to force us to change and this may be one of them.

Here are a few ideas that may help.

Begin a honest conversation with your children about how you are feeling and where you stand financially. They may not appreciate the numbers but I have found the more you respect their ability to grasp a situation the quicker they embrace it. Include your children in big purchases. I recall having a conversation with our children about a family vacation. With four teenagers in high school and one computer they responded,""we don't really need a vacation but we do need a second computer."" The vacation didn't happen. It is ok to say no to your children even if you can afford to say yes financially. To the extent you can replicate real life the better your children will be when they embark on their own journey. We clearly don't always get want we when we want all the time and neither should they. I know this sounds a little like tough love but it is a great lesson in living below your means that will stick with them. Encourage your children to set financial goals that excite them. They absolutely will not save money for something that excites you. I learned this first-hand when when our daughter got her first part-time job and I thought great you can tuck a little money away for university. Trust me that wasn't on her agenda. Also try to resist the temptation of telling them how to spend their money. It is their money. Yes they will make mistakes but that is ok it is all part of the process. Talk about the difference between investing in your children - helping to fund their education and bailing them out when they run up a credit card bill they can't afford to pay. I'm not suggesting you don't help them out. I would however, ensure they pay you back. Owning the problem can be a game changer. Our son received a notification from CRA highlighting a tax bill he wasn't expecting. He said to me, ""How did you let this happen?"" My response,"" I didn't get you into this situation - you did."" He paid the bill and has never been in that position again. These are difficult times and families are coming together. Just like your salary maybe a moratorium on allowances has to be put into place. That's ok. It can be a temporary situation. However, this doesn't mean everyone should still pitch in. It means maybe we all have to do a little more for less.

When children contribute something to the household regardless of your financial situation it can be a great accomplishment for them as well as you. Now more than ever we need to pull together.",[]

The Toronto-based retail distributor has had to confront myriad supply chain issues during the COVID-19 pandemic, but she calls the current school and home life situation of Canadian families an ""operational nightmare.""

""It's the uncertainty that's eating away at people,"" says Pretty, adding that some of her retailer customers are relying on a skeleton staff of childless workers to keep physical locations running. ""I can't make plans about how to grow my businesses. . . . I can't imagine what my revenue might be like.""

After months of balancing childcare and online schooling with work responsibilities, anything short of complete school reopening presents a crucial challenge for families. Without children in school five days a week, someone has to care for them, and working full-time while simultaneously caring for children is simply not possible -- even when working remotely is an option.

Schools in most of Quebec have been open since May, while those in B.C, Manitoba and P.E.I. have partially reopened. The remaining provinces and territories plan on having students return to the classroom in the fall, though details have not been finalized. School boards are mulling scenarios such as alternating days or weeks with smaller class sizes or continued at-home learning.

The result is a significant number of workers who feel they have little choice but to leave the workforce until a semblance of stability is restored.

According to Statistics Canada's June Labour Force Survey, the employment recovery has been ""slowest for mothers with school-aged children,"" with employment rising 5.2 per cent for women and 6.4 per cent for men with children younger than six. For mothers of children ages six to 17, however, women's employment remains below pre-pandemic levels, and women with children are more likely to be working less than half their usual hours.

Pretty has kids of her own, but she says she can't take leave as people depend on her for their wages. She's considering enrolling her children in private school in Orillia, Ont. in the hopes they would have smaller class sizes and a safer environment. And she isn't alone.

""I know lots of people considering taking a leave of absence,"" says Pretty. ""I know someone who sold a second business. I know teachers who are considering leaves of absence -- they have little people at home.""

Susan Prentice, a sociology professor at the University of Manitoba who studies childcare policy, says the current situation will cause ""unfathomably tough problems"" for families to figure out.

""For any household that has children, a school closing is a make-or-break factor for family decision making,"" says Prentice. ""Women trying to do homeschooling by day and trying to do their own work at night -- in the end, they manage it at the expense of their own health, by sleeping very little. You can get through a short-term period like this, but it's not sustainable over months or semesters.""

Experts say there simply aren't enough daycare spots to accommodate the number of school-age children who may find themselves without a caregiver if parents return to work. Monica Lysack, a professor of early childhood leadership at Sheridan College in Oakville, Ont. says that even in the best of times, Canada only has space in licensed childcare facilities for less than 30 per cent of kids.

""Imagine being told your business could open up only at half capacity, and you have to keep going with all the same expenses,"" says Lysack of childcare centres in the pandemic.

""That means parents are going to have to pay double fees, for already astronomically priced childcare ... And where are the other 50 per cent of children going to go?""

For many families, having two working parents is not optional. Prentice says that families have been able to offset flat wages in the Canadian economy through the contributions of working mothers.

""This discussion of dual earners, or 1.5 earners as we sometimes call part-time work, it's really mothers,"" says Prentice. ""When children are in school, this is when mothers' labour force participation rate jumps to its highest.""

""If schools open on some crazy extraordinary schedule, like two days one week, three days the next week, this will play havoc with the ability of mothers and fathers to keep their jobs. It will play havoc on children. And it immediately has huge, huge economic and social consequences,"" says Prentice.

Pretty says that among the concerns she's hearing from her employees and clients, the return to school is the most pressing.

""Everyone is really obsessed with school opening,"" she says. ""We are getting it from every angle. Everything is complicated.""

But instead of hospitality, the pandemic is exposing a glimpse of hostility aimed at those who are assumed to be outsiders.

""Being from Halifax, growing up here all but eight years of my life, I really didn't expect this,” resident Tony Mountenay told CTV News.

Tony and Debbie Mountenay chose to return to Nova Scotia during the pandemic because they were looking for a laid back retirement.

As required, they isolated after they arrived. But then they decided to go out and run errands.

""And we had three different incidents where people came up beside us, yelling at us, through the window, and when it first happened, we had to try to think, well what was that about?” Debbie said.

The answer was the licence plate on their truck — showing that they came from Ontario.

Visitors from beyond the “Atlantic bubble” have been vilified by locals fearing the virus could be imported.

Though relatively rare, there have been incidents of “plate-shaming.”

A woman from Quebec was told to go home while walking on a New Brunswick beach.

More than 15,000 Newfoundlanders signed a petition demanding their province not open the border to anyone.

Debbie said one woman who had harassed the couple had done so in front of her own children.

“She really shouldn't have been doing that in my opinion,” she said. “Another man, you could tell he was out of control.""

The Atlantic bubble, which encompasses the provinces of New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador, is a concept that was introduced recently to allow easier travel between the Eastern provinces as the region reopens.

People from all across Canada are allowed to travel to any Atlantic province, but those outside of the Atlantic bubble must isolate for 14 days — as leaders in the region are quick to remind people.

""The Atlantic bubble is open today, [but] that does not apply to those who are from Ontario, Quebec or Western Canada,” Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil said. “If you're coming into our province, you're required to self isolate as well.""

The Atlantic provinces have largely fared well during the pandemic compared to provinces such as Ontario or Quebec. Of the Atlantic provinces, Nova Scotia has had the most cases in total, at just over 1,000 — a far cry from Quebec’s 56,521 cumulative cases.

The stress for locals in the Atlantic provinces is that out-of-bubble visitors could lead to a second wave of the virus.

Only last week, a string of new cases in Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island were proven to be related to travel from outside of the bubble. One individual flew from the United States to Toronto, and then to Halifax. This case was then connected to cases in Prince Edward Island.

McNeil said on July 6 that he is frustrated with travellers who do not isolate for the 14 days after they arrive.

“We have worked hard together and sacrificed so much in this province to help flatten the curve only to have some people come into our province who think they’re above it all, who think that the rules don’t apply to them,” he said. “Guess what? They do.”

But the Mountenay’s experience in Nova Scotia suggests that the uncertainty over who has isolated and who has not has led to some rather un-neighbourly behaviour.

In response, the couple has come with a way to alert people they’re not a threat. A piece of paper that clearly states a person has completed isolation.

""I don't want to get [COVID-19],” Debbie said. “And I don't want to give it to anybody.""",[]

Most of Schumacher's wins were during a dominant spell with Ferrari, but his old team is struggling badly. For the second time in the past four races, Charles Leclerc and Sebastian Vettel crashed into each other and went out.

When Hamilton stood on the podium he raised a clenched right fist.

Hamilton's record-extending 89th career pole on a rain-drenched track was one of his best in extreme conditions, but during the race he was hardly challenged as he finished a sizeable 13.7 seconds ahead of Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas and 33.7 ahead of Red Bull's Max Verstappen.

Because of social distancing amid the coronavirus pandemic, the drivers on the podium had their trophies delivered by a remote controlled device.

""What a weird year but (it's) great to be back driving with this kind of performance. The team did a fantastic job, it was just for me to bring it home,"" said Hamilton, who finished fourth last week after a time penalty. ""Difficult weekend last weekend but this was a great step forward.""

Montreal's Lance Stroll of Racing Point was seventh, picking up six points. Toronto rookie Nicholas Latifi of Williams Mercedes was 17th.

Bottas won last weekend's season-opening Austrian GP on the same Red Bull Ring track in Spielberg at the foot of the Styrian mountains -- hence the name change.

Despite the sizeable margin of Hamilton's win, Bottas maintains he can challenge for the F1 title. He leads in points 43-37.

""I have no reason to doubt any of my ability or skills. I know what I'm capable of,"" the Finnish driver said. ""I really feel some improvements in my driving since last year that's why I'm confident it will be a good battle for the championship this year.""

Like last Sunday, drivers again wore black T-shirts with ""End Racism"" and most took the knee a few moments before the national anthem.

Red Bull driver Alexander Albon did well to fend off persistent attacks from Racing Point's Sergio Perez and finished fourth ahead of McLaren's Lando Norris and Perez, who dropped to sixth after touching wheels with Albon late on.

McLaren's Carlos Sainz Jr. started from third and finished ninth, but collected a bonus point for the fastest lap.

At the start of the race, Hamilton got away cleanly while Verstappen did well to hold off Sainz.

Leclerc tried to overtake down the right entering a hairpin bend and ended up riding over the back of Vettel's car, mangling his rear wing and prompting a safety car to come out for two laps.

Vettel, who finished 10th last week, had to retire while Leclerc came into the pits on Lap 5 and was soon out of the race.

At last season's penultimate GP in Brazil, both Ferrari cars crashed out. Vettel appeared at fault that time after being overtaken cleanly by Leclerc and trying to regain position.

But this time Leclerc was far too hasty and impatient.

Up ahead, Hamilton was coasting and about five seconds clear of Verstappen when the Dutch driver came in for his first tire change on Lap 25 of 71.

Hamilton came in for fresh tires soon after and then Bottas a few laps later, meaning that by Lap 38 Verstappen was second again -- still five seconds adrift of Hamilton.

Verstappen's front wing was damaged on the right side and, with six laps remaining, his lead over Bottas was down to under a second.

Bottas overtook Verstappen on the next lap but Verstappen regained his position superbly, only to concede it again moments later as Bottas' superior speed proved decisive.

""When Valtteri tried to pass me I tried to make it a bit more difficult,"" Verstappen said. ""The podium is good but there's still a lot of work to do.""

Red Bull showed signs late last season that it was closing the gap on Mercedes, but this time Verstappen is not convinced a serious challenge can be mounted.

""I tried everything I could but it's still not enough,"" Verstappen said. ""As a team we want to win and fight for the championship, and to do that we need to win races.""

Chairman Carlos Ghosn says he is assisting those who helped him flee from Japan to Lebanon last year but refuses to provide details about the escape, saying such information would endanger them.

In an interview aired late Saturday by the pan-Arab Al-Arabiya TV, Ghosn refused to comment on allegations from prosecutors in the U.S., who said last week that he wired more than US$860,000 to a company linked to one of the men accused of helping smuggle him out of Japan in a box in December.

Michael Taylor, a 59-year-old former Green Beret and private security specialist, and Peter Taylor, 27, are wanted by Japan on charges they helped Ghosn escape the country in December after he was released on bail.

Ghosn was arrested in November 2018 and was expected to face trial in April 2020. He posted 1.5 billion yen ($14 million) bail on two separate instances after he was arrested a second time on additional charges, and released again.

When pressed to speak about the Taylors, who are under arrest in the U.S., as well as others who helped him flee, Ghosn refused to speak about any specific person. He said that after he arrived in Lebanon he vowed not to speak about how he left Japan ""because any statement I am going to make will endanger the people who helped me leave Japan.""

Asked if he is aiding those who helped him get out of Japan, Ghosn said, ""of course."" When asked about the Taylors, Ghosn said: ""You are talking about specific people, and I will not comment. However, I am helping everyone who stood by me as much as I can, financially and in any way I can.""

""I made the entire plan of how to get out, but I needed information and assistance. I am not ready to involve these people at this moment simply by talking about it,"" he said. He is believed to have been smuggled inside a large box.

Ghosn, who holds Lebanese, Brazilian and French citizenship, said the ""only side that stood by me is the Lebanese state. They intervened and they asked the Japanese state, `Why are you doing this to him?""'

Ghosn said that when he arrived in Lebanon, Japan requested the Lebanese government hand him over. ""Lebanon approved, if they receive the case file. They (Japanese) didn't send anything for six months,"" he said.

Earlier this month, a Turkish court released four pilots and a private airline official from jail, pending the outcome of their trial on charges of smuggling Ghosn out of Japan to Lebanon, via Turkey.",[]

Described by Sotheby's as a ""lost masterpiece,"" the rare artifact made specifically for China's Qianlong Emperor in the early 1700s went under the hammer on Saturday, selling for 70 million Hong Kong dollars.

China's Qianlong Emperor ruled for more than 60 years and reportedly praised the vase as a ""masterwork.""

According to Sotheby's, the vase was rediscovered by Amsterdam-based art consultant Johan Bosch van Rosenthal in an elderly women’s home after she called him to inquire about assessing her collection.

In a video posted to the auction house's YouTube channel, Van Rosenthal said the dust-coated vase was in almost-pristine condition after nearly 60 years, despite being kept in a room surrounded by the owner’s cats and dogs.

""We reached a room with a number of Chinese works of art inherited many years ago. Her four cats walked around freely among these. She pointed out a ... partly gilded Chinese vase on a cupboard -- a cherished object which she knew to be something special and valuable,"" Van Rosenthal said.

Van Rosenthal said he is not an expert in Chinese art and sent pictures of the vase to Sotheby's experts who were able to match it to an item in the Chinese imperial archives belonging to the Qing dynasty.

According to the archive record, the vase was previously kept in the Palace of Heavenly Purity, part of Beijing's Forbidden City.

Van Rosenthal said the vase is ""highly unusual"" given its design in which a blue-and-white floral pattern is visible through the object's lattice shell, giving it a “double-walled"" appearance.

Sotheby’s said the vase is similar to only a handful of other designs attempted under China's imperial kiln supervisor Tang Ying in the years 1742 and 1743, describing the object as a ""technical tour-de-force."" The auction house said the pear-shaped vase is an example of ""yangcai"" style, also known as ""foreign colours,"" that saw artisans incorporate Western-style enamels into their porcelain work.

Sotheby's records showed that the artifact -- known as the Harry Garner Reticulated Vase for its original collector -- was sold through its London auction house in 1954 for $75 (£44). Records also showed that the vase was sold again later that year for $136 (£80).

""It is a miracle that this extraordinarily fragile vase survived half a century in a home surrounded by countless pets,"" Nicolas Chow, chairman of Sotheby's Asia, said in a press release prior to the sale.",[]

The virus kept them apart for 114 days.

Daniel said the isolation took a toll on her 66-year-old husband, who has Alzheimer's. So when the facility offered her a part-time dishwashing job, she jumped at the opportunity.

""I told them, 'I'm gonna be the best dishwasher you've ever had, because I want to be here, because I need to be with him,'"" she told CNN.

Before COVID-19, Daniel said she would help her husband get ready for bed each night and they would watch TV together before she tucked him in.

""That was our set routine and then all of a sudden I'm gone,"" she said. ""And he doesn't know why. He can't understand why.""

She said they've tried doing window visits, but they upset Steve. He can't carry on conversations, she said, so visiting over FaceTime didn't work well for them either.

Daniel, 57, said that getting to see her husband after she's done working is a perk, but she's scrubbing dishes, mopping floors and cleaning the kitchen just like any dishwasher.

""It is full on legit, I had to do a COVID test, a TB test, 20 hours worth of video training and a drug test,"" she said, adding that she was going to use her paychecks to do something nice for the rest of the staff.

She worked her first shift on July 3, and said Steve recognized her, even with her mask on.

""I walked into his room and he said my name, he said Mary, which was also a relief,"" she said. ""So when he said, Mary, and gave me the biggest hug, I mean, we both cried.""

She said her husband seems much more relaxed since she's been able to see him, and he even gave her a hug during a recent shift.

""He came up from behind me and put his arms around the front of me ... which is an incredible feeling,"" she said. ""So, he knows who I am. There's no question, he knows who I am even in a mask.""

Florida issued an emergency order in March that prohibits visits to nursing homes, assisted living and other long-term care facilities, except for families and friends in end-of-life circumstances. Gov. Ron DeSantis extended the restrictions this week for another 60 days.

The state has become a hotspot, and officials on Friday reported 11,433 new COVID-19 cases and 93 deaths, according to data on the Florida Department of Health (DOH) website.

""Visitor restrictions have been put in place at communities across our state as a safety measure, aimed at protecting the vulnerable population we serve. But it has been hard on families and residents alike, so we felt creative solutions were necessary, especially in the case of Mary and Steve,"" said Kelley Withrow, the executive director for Rosecastle at Deerwood, in a statement.

""We are happy to report that Mary is off to a great start in her new role, and we are excited to see the positive changes in Steve's demeanor as well.""

Daniel said that she understands why the rules are in place and she appreciates the hard work everyone is putting in, but she thinks there has to be a better way.

She's urged the state and Gov. DeSantis to adjust the restrictions and has started a Facebook group with other families to try to find other options.

""It's incredibly sad to see that these patients are significantly declining because they are isolated,"" she said. ""We are isolating these patients to save them, but the isolation is killing them.""",[]

When coronavirus first hit in March, the freelance production manager paid about $30 for a three-month premium subscription on the dating app Hinge -- and he figured he'd just keep swiping until that ended.

Like many, the 29-year-old used dating apps like Hinge as a way to connect with others, especially since making in-person connections had become nearly impossible with COVID-19 shutdowns. He went on one Facetime date -- the girl, he said, seemed like she was ""just going through her matches ... like on a spreadsheet.""

But on May 29, he had plans to meet up with a different match -- this time in person. A 28-year-old nurse named Brooke, with whom he would hike Runyon Canyon -- Los Angeles' picturesque, influencer-ridden trail.

It was in the middle of their approximately three-mile hike, when the two decided they felt comfortable enough to remove their face masks, that he knew this was different. Their guards were down, or as he described it, ""all caution (regarding coronavirus) was thrown to the wind.""

Now, less than one month and many dates later, they split most of their time between his West Hollywood apartment and hers in Long Beach. He's done what many initially considered impossible with social distancing guidelines and stay-at-home orders:

He found love during a global pandemic.

""This is truly two people finding their soulmate during the most unlikely of times,"" he told CNN in a phone interview. ""We're thinking about eloping to Vegas if the chapels open.""

While this may sound extreme, many formerly single people -- and dating experts -- say the pandemic has actually helped people find their matches more easily.

""I think people are more likely to find love during this time than not during this time,"" Yue Xu, co-host of the popular ""Dateable"" podcast, told CNN in a video call.

""Because we have this dedicated time to find love, there are no distractions -- you're not a bar looking at people around you or looking at your drink. Everyone's more present and they are more conscious about the way they are showing up to these virtual or real-life dates.""

Xu and podcast co-host Julie Krafchick, who are based in San Francisco, said they've noticed an overall change for the better in terms of the dating landscape over the past few months.

""Consider this a reset,"" Xu said. ""Even though we're losing magic of that first date -- the first kiss, first touch -- we're forced to think about how we can reinvent dating.""

The 'fail fast mentality'

Dating has never been -- and never will be -- perfect. Before the pandemic, Xu and Krafchick answered questions on their podcast such as ""Do Millennials even want to find love?"" and ""Is monogamy dead?""

""We can't have amnesia that dating wasn't perfect before,"" Krafchick said. ""Part of the reason we created the podcast in the first place was to answer the question, 'What the f**k is wrong with modern dating?'""

The biggest challenge for the singles out there before the pandemic, Krafchick said, was that many spent a lot of time in relationship limbo.

""No one wanted to say they were excited about someone,"" she said. ""No one wanted to define the relationship.""

Now, however, the pandemic has led to what Krafchick described as the ""fail fast mentality.""

""People are starting to feel it's better to fail fast than be in this constant state of equilibrium,"" she said. ""Like, let's either get it off the ground or end it.""

The podcast hosts have heard countless stories during these past few months of people who have successfully found love, and people who have felt more encouraged by their dating experiences even if their quarantine relationships didn't work out.

""Coming out of quarantine, everyone has a really strong feeling of a yes or no,"" Xu said.

Many have also taken this time in quarantine to self reflect, which has helped pave the way to finding healthier relationships.

""I think this time has given people a lot of clarity into what they want in life,"" Krafchick said. ""It's shown life is short and at the end of the day, relationships are what matters most. A lot of people have used this time to do self work, especially in the dark middle period of quarantine, where it didn't feel like there was any way to meet someone.""

Virtual dates have also made people throw their old notions of dating out of the window, as they are forced to get creative. For example, ""there are 'Zootie' calls now,"" Xu explained. ""Zoom booty calls.""

'A whole other dimension of consent'

With this uncharted era of dating also comes new conversations around consent: Do you feel safe meeting in person during a pandemic? Do you agree to wearing masks on the first date? Do you feel comfortable being less than 6 feet apart?

Jessica Gerhardt, a Santa Monica, California, native, and her new partner -- they have not labeled the relationship yet -- waited three months before they decided to meet in person for the first time last week.

""He's way more conscientious than me,"" the musician said of the new guy in her life, who is also a musician.

The two, who had mutual friends in the music scene, began talking after he ""slid into her DMs"" on Instagram. Before they met up, he researched and looked into data about social distancing, Gerhardt said.

""We both consented to hug when we first met,"" the 30-year-old told CNN. ""There's a whole other dimension of consent during this pandemic. Under normal circumstances, of course I'd want to hug -- but it was helpful to have that conversation before and nice to know if we don't do something it's not necessarily a sign of 'Oh, I'm not attracted or interested, but I'm trying to be considerate of your safety and vice versa.'""

The lack of touching before meeting, Gerhardt said, made her feel like the two were cultivating ""deeper intimacy"" as they got to know each other.

They ended up going on a social distance walk in her neighborhood while both wore face masks. At the end of their walking date, he asked whether he could use her bathroom before he drove home.

""He came inside, and we both took off our masks after I asked, 'Do you feel comfortable being maskless?' and he said, 'I feel comfortable.' It was a nice surprise,"" she said. ""We ended up feeling comfortable enough to also hold hands and cuddle. It was really sweet.""

While they do not have plans to move in together any time soon, Gerhardt said he has now joined her quarantine pod, which includes her roommate and her roommate's boyfriend.

Learning each other's values early on

On top of the pandemic, these past few months have seen nationwide protests demanding justice and an end to police brutality in the aftermath of the deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and Rayshard Brooks.

How people have acted during this time has helped provide a window into their beliefs, which for some singles has helped narrow down their pool of potential matches.

For example, on dating apps, many have said they have encountered photos of people holding ""Black Lives Matter"" signs at protests on their profiles. Others said they've seen people sporting face masks in their pictures, to highlight the fact that they are following social distancing guidelines recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in order to curb the spread of the virus.

""With the Black Lives Matter movement, COVID, and everything else that's been going on, it's been causing people to have way deeper conversations,"" Krafchick said. ""You can really quickly realize who has same values as you and who would be a better long-term partner. (Talking about) those things can really help you understand someone a lot better on a deeper level and get you past those basic dating questions.""

Liz Dwyer, who lives in LA, fell for a guy named Demis Courquet-Lesaulnier, who she has been messaging on Instagram since before the pandemic. He lives in Paris, and they had plans -- pre-coronavirus -- to meet abroad. Now, that plan has been put on hold.

But that hasn't slowed their relationship down at all. In fact, it's sped things up. Dwyer said she's gotten closer to her now-boyfriend these past few months virtually, thanks to many of the current events they discuss.

""We have completely different cultural backgrounds,"" the writer and editor told CNN. ""I'm American, he's French. I'm Black, he's White. We had to get to know each other -- not just on the 'I think you're good looking' and 'you're cute too' conversation.""

Dwyer said Demis created a list of 54 films -- including ""BlacKkKlansman,"" ""13th"" and ""When They See Us"" -- ""to try and understand what it's like to be Black in America."" The two have conversations about them, and discuss what he noticed, observed and learned from them. He even wrote a post titled ""A Love Letter to Black America"" to reflect on his takeaways.

""He was open to understanding what was happening in terms of racism,"" she said.

Without the pandemic, she doesn't know what their relationship would look like today.

""I don't know what the future holds,"" she added, ""but no matter what, the experience has changed me for the better.""

Finding your 'apocalypse partner'

Ronni Morgan, 32, and her partner Adriane (AJ) Johnson, 41, met on the HER app -- a dating app for queer people -- on March 23.

They started by texting, having FaceTime dates and watching Netflix together virtually, with Morgan in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and Johnson in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

When they finally reached a point where they felt safe enough to start planning an in-person meeting, they found an AirBnB in between their two locations that they considered secluded and off-the-beaten path.

From the beginning, Morgan said, the two were ""on the same page about how to handle the pandemic.""

""We have both taken it very seriously,"" Morgan told CNN. ""I don't think we would've made it this far otherwise.""

When they finally did meet, on June 26, Morgan said their weekend together ""legitimately was like a lesbian romance novel, complete with a fireplace, velvety red blanket and epic thunderstorm.""

""When we did finally get to meet in person, we were already so deeply connected there was no question of what the chemistry would be like,"" she told CNN.

Their relationship is still a long-distance one -- but Morgan said there's no doubt in her mind that she's found her ""apocalypse partner,"" aka the person to ride out the pandemic with.

""There's this meme that talks about how dating in 2020 is about choosing your apocalypse partner wisely and honestly I couldn't agree more,"" Morgan said. ""I can say, without a shadow of a doubt, there's no one I'd rather be braving the new world with than AJ.""

The two have created a Facebook page and Instagram page dedicated to their love story.

""I never imagined I'd meet the love of my life during a global pandemic but here we are,"" Morgan wrote in a post sharing their story on Facebook.

""Anything is possible.""

Meeting at the virtual bar

Back in March, Krafchick and Xu decided to bring their community of listeners together in a Facebook group they called ""Love in the Time of Corona by the Dateable Podcast."" They said they felt it was important for people to feel less alone as quarantine began.

So far, the group has amassed more than 500 members -- who all actively utilize the group to share their experiences with dating in comments, over virtual happy hours, and, sometimes even with the two hosts as guests on their show.

Thursday afternoon, a ""Dateable""-hosted virtual happy hour was in full swing, with about 20 people from across the United States -- some returning faces, others new to the hangout -- hopping on a video chat on Facebook.

Group members could check out different Facebook rooms, including: ""The Bar,"" where Krafchick and Xu kicked off the afternoon with intros. Then, some stayed behind to play a game of ""Would You Rather?"" with dating-themed questions.

""Would you rather date someone who is in a lot of debt but donates to charity on a regular basis,"" Xu asked the group, ""or someone who has no debt, but doesn't donate to charities?""

Others joined the ""Playtime"" room, where they participated in dating-themed trivia. And some joined a new ""room"" called the ""Dance Floor,"" where one member taught a dance class.",[]

The first was in 1918, during the Spanish flu when Stallworthy was just three years old. The second, today, when she turned 105 during Covid-19.

She admits she doesn't remember much about her first pandemic birthday, but this was one she will never forget.

Dozens of people gathered down the street from the Kingston Road home where Stallworthy has lived for more than half a century, and then, on foot, paraded past her house to offer their best wishes. Sitting on her front porch, Stallworthy watched as person after person came to pay their respects from a safe social distance.

""It's just tremendous,"" Stallworthy told CTV News, ""I'm absolutely blown away.""

Stallworthy was born on July 12, 1915, in London, England. Before moving to Canada in 1951, she'd already lived through two world wars and the great depression. One of the first things she did upon settling in Toronto, was to join the congregation of Kingston Road United Church. ""I've been working my bottom off ever since,"" Stallworthy said with a laugh. To this day, she remains active in the church.

And it's her faith that she credits with getting her to 105, an age she admits she never thought she'd reach. When asked for the secret to her longevity, Stallworthy replies, ""I think it's my belief in good old God.""

Sunday's birthday parade was organized by her fellow parishioners. Granddaughter Sheri Gardiner told CTV News, ""she just loves people, and I think it's pretty obvious today that people love her too​.""

Finding a way to safely celebrate a 105th birthday during Covid-19 can be a challenge.

""I feel as if I'm living my life in a bubble,"" Stallworthy said.

The normally active and social centenarian says she's been trying to stay social but at a safe distance from those who visit. And she says while she heard stories about the 1918 pandemic from her mother, Covid-19 gives her pause. ""Well this one is so different, I'm not sure how we're going to come out of it.""

Stallworthy has been married twice, and along with remaining active in her church, she's a lifetime member of the Girl Guides and speaks to students about her experiences during the war each Remembrance Day.

Those at her birthday celebration marvelled at how active she remains at her age. Stallworthy says with a smile, ""life has to be lived. And you have to get up in the morning and say 'thank God I'm alive,' even though it hurts a little everywhere.""

As for what she might do to celebrate her 106th birthday next year, Stallworthy thinks for a second, and then says she'd like to fly to British Colombia, to visit family- including a new great-grandson she has yet to meet.

But for this birthday, Stallworthy sat back, and blew kisses from her porch- celebrating a milestone most will never achieve, and looking back at a life most could never imagine.

""It's been an incredible journey, and I feel that I'm the luckiest woman in the world to have gone through it.""",[]

Ready to return to Vancouver after two years in China, Robertson and her husband ran into hurdle after hurdle trying to book a plane ticket for their rescue terrier mix as the coronavirus pandemic was taking hold of the world -- shutting cities and airports down.

Soon they'd realize they were far from alone in their efforts to get their dog on a plane. Five hundred people joined a WeChat group the two created -- initially meant as a tool to gather ideas and information on transporting pets.

Other owners were mostly from cities throughout Canada and the U.S. Many had left China hurriedly months ago to see friends or family, thinking they'd be back with their furry roommates in days. But then coronavirus hit and hundreds of travelers were stranded, while their pets remained in the care of either boarding facilities or acquaintances.

Soon, an idea emerged: They'd charter a plane from Shanghai to fly their dogs and cats home, which would touch down in Vancouver, then Seattle. That plane will also help reunite families by bringing back Americans or Canadians stuck in China.

They're calling the effort ""Mission Impawsible.""

'CAN WE EVEN PULL OFF SOMETHING LIKE THIS?'

Arranging the flight was no easy task. Dozens of group members -- from China, the U.S. and Canada -- collaborated on different parts of the plan often with more than half a day's hour difference between them. Nights were long and sleepless.

Many, like dog owner Catherine Hildreth, tasked themselves with learning how to edit videos and design T-shirts, in order to help the group raise awareness of their efforts and fundraise.

The group shared details of the flight on social media and messaging apps and began selling tickets to other Canadian or American citizens hoping for a flight back to their families, after meeting with each consulate. And they enlisted some of those passengers to accompany each dog and cat on the flight.

""It's been a whirlwind and definitely never in my wildest dreams did I think that creating a WeChat group was going to lead me here six weeks later,"" Robertson told CNN. ""Chartering a flight across the ocean for my dog.""

And finally, the group secured a flight for July 18. One hundred furry passengers are booked.

The journey has been a ray of light amid dark times, some group members say, a reminder of what strong collaboration can look like when everyone feels so isolated.

""It's just been kind of one of those things where we've been like, .... at first, 'Whoa, can we even pull off something like this?'"" Robertson said. ""We don't even know each other, we haven't even met in person, we're from different places.

""If you kind of just put your mind to it and just work really hard... you can make this happen,"" she said. ""I think that's what's been amazing for me.""

A COMPANION ON HIS WAY

One of the people waiting for her dog on the other side of the ocean is Kaitlyn Hooper, who now lives in Ontario after a string of devastating news she had to endure without her best friend.

One of the last moments she recalls spending with her rescue, Ted, was the dog's long licks on her face, shortly before a phone call let her know her dad had passed away.

Hooper, who until December taught at a Canadian international school, flew back with return tickets scheduled in three weeks' time. But then another piece of news hit: her mom was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer and passed away shortly after.

""The world was just in a dark place,"" she said. ""So I started looking for ways to get my dog home.""

She tried working with an agent and once she gathered the money to get Ted on a plane, the flight was no longer operating. So when a friend passed along information of the charter flight that would get pets to their owners, she started paying attention. But having no one to accompany her dog on the flight, as required, she shared her story with the group in hopes of a volunteer to accompany him.

That volunteer was Robertson, who along with her husband and their one dog, signed up to be Ted's plus one.

""I've never met Kyla and she's willing to accompany my dog on a 12-hour flight. And that's amazing,"" Hooper said. ""When the world has been so dark for the last few months, it's really added a lot of light in the last few days.""

And it's brought light to the past few weeks as well, she says, seeing a group of strangers form their own determined committee to bring their pets back home. The long nights and endless communications, she says, have been worth it.

""It's hard to get out of bed in the morning and having a dog, it makes you get up, go outside, get some fresh air,"" she says. ""And I think that mental health benefit of having a pet outweighs any costs or frustrations or 3 a.m. text message exchange trying to coordinate all aspects of the flight.""

ANOTHER 20-HOUR DRIVE HOME

In North Carolina, Hildreth has busied herself creating videos and designing T-shirts for the cause -- and counting down the days until she's reunited with her ""fur baby.""

Hildreth and her husband, who both worked for the U.S. Army, rescued their German short-haired pointer in 2015. She says the dog looked so sad, she instead decided to name him -- fittingly -- Happy. The two planned a four-day trip in January to the U.S. from China to begin coordinating for a hopeful move here over the summer.

Health Canada announced May 16 that it had approved Ad5-nCoV for human trials in Canada, to be carried out by the Canadian Center for Vaccinology (CCV) at Dalhousie University in Halifax.

Human trials of the vaccine candidate are further along in China, with results promising enough that the Chinese government has approved it for use in its military.

Dr. Scott Halperin, the CCV's director, said in May that the tests would be carried out ""in a more accelerated fashion"" than the usual process, which can take five years or more. He told The Canadian Press that he expected the first phase of the trial to get underway within about three weeks.

Nearly two months later, though, not a single Canadian has been given Ad5-nCoV – because, as was first reported by iPolitics, not a single shipment of the vaccine candidate has arrived in the country.

A spokesman for Health Canada told CTVNews.ca on Monday that Chinese authorities have yet to sign off on sending the potential vaccine here.

""The vaccine candidate for Phase 1 clinical trials has not yet been approved by Chinese customs for shipment to Canada,"" Andre Gagnon said in a statement.

""Once the Canadian Center for Vaccinology receives the vaccine candidate it will start the clinical trial for CanSino, under the regulatory supervision of Health Canada.""

CanSino Biologics, the biopharmaceutical company that developed the Ad5-nCoV along with Chinese government scientists, did not respond to a request for comment before this story was published.

In a statement to CTVNews.ca, a spokesman for Innovation, Science and Industry Minister Navdeep Bains described Ad5-nCoV as ""one of the leading candidate vaccines against COVID-19 in the world"" and said an arrangement is in place that will allow it to be manufactured in Canada ""for emergency pandemic use"" if it is approved for distribution by Health Canada.

The government announced in May that it was planning a $44-million upgrade to a National Research Council of Canada facility in Montreal to prepare for the possibility of a large-scale Ad5-nCoV manufacturing effort.",[]

There have been several well-documented cases of female COVID-19 patients giving birth while positive for the disease. Doctors were even able to deliver a baby boy in Colombia last month 14 weeks early, after the mother slipped into a coma.

Researchers have also found evidence of the novel coronavirus in at-term placenta, an umbilical cord and breast milk of infected mothers.

However, there had been no known examples of a baby born to a COVID-19-positive mother also testing positive for the disease – not until Friday, when researchers affiliated with the University of Texas published their findings in The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal.

In this case, the baby was born prematurely, at 34 weeks. Because of that and because of the possible exposure to COVID-19 through her 37-year-old mother, she was placed in a neonatal intensive care unit for observation.

Although all her vital signs were normal on the day of her birth, the researchers say, she developed a fever and some mild breathing difficulty the following day. A test administered 24 hours after her birth came up positive for SARS-CoV-2, as did a second test 24 hours later.

Further tests of the placenta revealed the presence of coronavirus particles and a protein that is believed to be specific to the virus. Because of these results, the researchers concluded that COVID-19 was passed on to the baby in the womb, not during or after her birth.

The researchers say this sort of transmission ""appears to be a rare event"" given that no other documented cases of it have come to light.

The baby was given supplemental oxygen for a few days and continued to test positive through her first two weeks of life. Three weeks after she was born, she and her mother were sent home, and both are said to be in good condition.",[]

""A vaccine is several years in development,"" said epidemiologist Arnaud Fontanet, a member of the team of scientists advising the government on the crisis, speaking on BFMTV television.

""Of course, there is an unprecedented effort to develop a vaccine, but I would be very surprised if we had that was effective in 2021,"" he added.

While we would probably have one that worked partially, we were very far from the end of the crisis, he said.

That being the case, ""we have to live with this virus"" he said. And since another lockdown was out of the question, people had to go back to ""more serious habits"".

""This summer, let's respect physical distance, at least!"" he said, stressing that large gatherings were the main threat.

On Saturday, a DJ's set on a beach in the Mediterranean resort of Nice drew thousands of people together, sparking a furious reaction on social media.

Also Saturday, a group of well-known doctors called for the government to make the wearing of masks inside public buildings compulsory in a bid to head off a second wave of the coronavirus.

Fontanet said the main risks for the appearance of new virus clusters were in confined spaces, such as on cruise ships, warships, sports halls, discos, slaughterhouses, accommodation housing migrant workers and places of worship.

On Wednesday, the French government said it was preparing for a second wave of COVID-19, but rather than imposing another nationwide lockdown, they would use ""targeted"" measures such as stay-at-home orders or business closures.",[]

What PM Trudeau's COVID-19 messaging reveals,['Rachel Aiello'],2020-07-13 07:15:00-04:00,"OTTAWA -- It became a scene most Canadians could recognize: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau emerges from Rideau Cottage and descends six steps to a podium, notes in hand. This was how the prime minister chose to speak to the country, day in and day out between March and July. In his morning updates, COVID-19 aid packages amounting to hundreds of billions of dollars were unveiled and public health advisories were driven home, but what else did Trudeau have to say?

CTVNews.ca has analyzed the 81 national addresses and following media availabilities that Trudeau held during the 110 days between entering a 14-day self-isolation, on March 12, to his June 29 announcement that, going forward, he would only convene the Rideau Cottage updates when he had big news to share.

The day after Trudeau entered quarantine on account of his wife Sophie having symptoms that were soon confirmed to be from COVID-19, the prime minister began what quickly became a daily routine: addressing the nation from Rideau Cottage, his family’s temporary home on the grounds of Rideau Hall.

Those morning addresses, mostly from the grounds of Rideau Hall, became a seven-day-a-week ritual, with few days off in the first two months. Then, as the public health crisis entered into the initial phase of reopenings, the routine was eased, with no press conferences on weekends and eventually only a few times a week.

Analyzing the transcripts of his English-language remarks from all those Rideau Cottage updates, as well as the few offsite, CTVNews.ca identified his commonly used phrases and terms, as well as his go-to nouns and adjectives, before asking political communication experts and a linguist to assess the words he was using to deliver his messages, and whether they were effective.

WHAT WORDS DID HE USE?

CTVNews.ca’s analysis found that the most repeated phrase was “right across the country,” followed by variations of “keep Canadians safe.” Others that topped the list included “make sure,” and “move forward.”

Speaking to the use of “keep Canadians safe,” former lead speechwriter for Trudeau, Jeni Armstrong, said she thinks it was a great choice.

“It's simple, it's direct, it appeals to the kind of worries that we all have about our families… It’s memorable and like I said, it is the kind of reassurance that I think people were seeking especially in the early days,” said Armstrong, who is now an instructor with the Clayton H. Riddell Graduate Program in Political Management at Carleton University after working as the director of communications for Finance Minister Bill Morneau and helping to author the Liberal Party’s 2019 and 2015 federal election platforms.

Other phrases that appeared often included: “long-term care”; “continue to work”; “public health”; “social distancing”; “people need”; “staying home”; and “coming weeks.”

CTVNews.ca also searched for the frequency of other key words, which may not necessarily be the words said the most. The word “recognize” came up 183 times over the 81 addresses, “virus” was said 127 times, “parliament” got named 108 times and “unprecedented” was said 63 times. Further, “racism” was said 53 times, “China” was found in the transcripts 45 times, and “budget” just nine times.

Armstrong said Trudeau has a personal verbal habit where he builds formulas for responding to questions, which could explain the frequency of the word “recognize”—which often was how he started an answer to reporters’ questions: “we recognize…”

“He'll often say—and this has been true for a number of years… ‘Canadians expect us to ABC, and we are doing just that.’ It's kind of a formula that he has,” she said.

Trudeau’s go-to verbs, in order of frequency: “need”; “get”; “make”; “continue”’ “know”; “keep”; “ensure”; “want”; “think”; and “help.”

As for adjectives, he most often said: “many”; “sure”; “safe”; “able”; “right”; “important”; “different”; “new”; “Canadian”; and “possible.”

Linguist Shana Poplack told CTVNews.ca that Trudeau’s word choices show he wants to evoke he is in charge and has things under control.

“If this is the message he's trying to relay, those words are consistent,” said Poplack, who is the director of the Sociolinguistics Laboratory at the University of Ottawa and Canada Research Chair in Linguistics.

Poplack also said what stood out to her were the phrases that didn’t crack the top of the list of things Trudeau said, despite them being so frequently said in society writ large these days, including “in these uncertain times,” and “the new normal.”

“That does not tie in with the message that he's trying to get across,” she said, suggesting it’s possible he didn’t want to highlight the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“That's why we see “ensure,” we see the word “safe,” reappearing... He also has to convince us that he's on top of it,” she said.

BUILT UP LEXICON OF PHRASES

What the frequent repetition of these and other phrases indicates, experts said, is that Trudeau and his relatively small team of speechwriters had developed a dictionary of key phrases to reinforce and repeat in his prepared remarks. The messaging was first built into his speeches, but after their near-daily repeating, they became a reflexive part of his vocabulary when responding to questions, too.

Poplack said these are referred to as “fixed expressions,” some of which are commonly used by all, others are created, as seen with terms for aid programs to establish a clear message. The use of such phrases can be seen across political lines and in past prime ministers’ speaking habits as well.

“For Paul Martin it was ‘let me be clear,’ for Stephen Harper it was ‘obviously’,” said Garry Keller, vice president at StrategyCorp and a past adviser to former prime minister Stephen Harper.

Armstrong said the repetition of the COVID-19 benefit-specific phrases also helped to build up familiarity with new programs. “Emergency Response Benefit” — referring to the Canada Emergency Response Benefit of $2,000 a month to out of wok Canadians — was in the top-five most said three-word phrases, and “wage subsidy” was in the top five two-word phrases spoken.

“What he's attempting to do there is to get people familiar with the name of any program… When you're working on that, repetition is your friend,” she said.

STRUCTURE SUITS THE PM

Strategic communication professional and political commentator Scott Reid said that the formula of “political communication by dint of news conference” has become a go-to form of communicating COVID-19 crisis updates around the world and across Canada, where provincial premiers have all taken a similar approach.

The format plays to Trudeau’s strengths, Reid said, contrasting the PM’s comfort and skill delivering on-message remarks without relying on rote responses to the communication approach of other world leaders including U.S. President Donald Trump, who Reid said failed at being consistent in his messaging and shut down his routine of regular press conferences long before Trudeau did.

“A crisis such as this, which has created a made-for-television daily news conference, it's almost perfectly built for his [Trudeau’s] talent set and instincts because he has a preternatural sense of self… He's extraordinarily conscious of his presentation and of his representation to the public, and that serves him extremely well in this situation,” said Reid, who also worked as an adviser to former prime minister Paul Martin.

Keller noted that opting to keep Trudeau’s addresses to the high-level details and letting a cadre of ministers follow after him to take reporters’ more detailed questions also meant that Trudeau was usually out of the spotlight by midday, rather than facing reporters and opposition MPs multiple throughout the entire day.

“It quite frankly has worked for them,” said Keller, adding that all of the opposition parties found it challenging to compete with.

BOOST TO APPROVAL RATING

The more frequent prime ministerial appearances also had positive returns on his approval ratings, according to CTV News’ pollster and Chair of Nanos Research, Nik Nanos.

“What I'll call the ‘relentless chain of press conferences’ … they've effectively done a bit of a reset on his brand,” Nanos said. “There's been a complete reset on Justin Trudeau’s personal brand. His brand is now strong again— it's not as strong as the honeymoon [phase]— but it's strong and the Liberal numbers are strong.”

Nanos Research asks Canadians weekly whether they feel the various federal party leaders have the qualities of a good political leader, and Trudeau’s trend line shows that Canadians surveyed are viewing him more positively since March than they have in the entirety of the last four years.

KEY MOMENTS LIKE 'SPEAKING MOISTLY'

These routine speeches also provided several key moments over the initial four months of the COVID-19 pandemic, from Trudeau’s infamous “speaking moistly” slip-up when describing how the coronavirus can transmit through droplets, to his conspicuously long pause when asked about Trump's handling of anti-racism protesters in the United States.

While the combination of “speaking” and “moistly” was swiftly removed from Trudeau’s lexicon, Armstrong said even when such moments inspire mockery, they are generally well-received.

“That ended up being really funny at a time when people needed to laugh right? And he's, he's very much able to laugh at himself in moments like that,” she said of Trudeau. She cited the first time that he spoke directly to children as another notable moment.

“Kids are an overlooked constituency… They're not even spoken to directly by people in power very often. But they are feeling and experiencing this moment, in a very, very profound way, and I as a mom, and as a citizen, and as a communicator, I really love that he acknowledged that,” she said.

WHY THE ADDRESSES ENDED

By the time Trudeau said he’d be cutting down his regular press conferences, the announcements he was making had already become incremental and small, while the questions he faced were predominately about non-COVID-19 news.

The political communication experts CTVNews.ca spoke with largely agreed that, while the near-daily addresses were key in reassuring Canadians that the federal government was on top of the rapidly unfolding crisis early on, continuing to come out and face reporters was having diminishing positive returns for the prime minister as other big news stories began to bubble up, notably the ongoing WE Charity controversy.

Another reason some suggest could explain why Trudeau’s team opted to wind down what some critics call “the morning show”? Canadians had begun tuning them out.

“I think that they've rightly recognized that should there be a second wave, should there be a need to start communicating again on a daily basis in a way that was happening in March for example, they don't want to kind of burn the goodwill and the listening potential of the audience by continuing to speak every day if there's not something new to share,” said Kate Harrison, vice president at Summa Strategies Canada and Conservative political commentator.

WILL SEE THIS FORMAT AGAIN

Going forward, the experts interviewed said to expect the format to resume should there be a new resurgence in the virus’ spread.

Reid said that if there is a second wave of COVID-19 infections, the public and the media has come to expect the prime minister will be front-and-centre.

“This is now how it is done. It has quietly become a matter of consensus among political leaders, media, public audiences, that this is how this gets prosecuted, and so it will recur, and it will overwhelmingly benefit political leaders who are capable of commanding the podium and follow those very simple rules of being thematic, being consistent, demonstrating empathy,” Reid said.

Methodology: For this project we used the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) in Python to run a word frequency and N-gram analysis on the transcripts. An N-gram analysis counts the occurrences of two or more words together. The code stripped the transcripts to leave only those words spoken by Trudeau in English.

Wood']",2020-07-13 10:14:00-04:00,"The surge in coronavirus continues to rage uncontrolled across the United States as cases are rising in 35 states, including record numbers in Florida.

Florida health officials reported Sunday a staggering record of new cases in a single day: 15,300. If Florida were a country, it would be the fourth highest in the world in reporting new cases. The state would rank 10th in the list of nations with the most cases, according to data from Johns Hopkins University data.

The state added at least 12,343 cases since Sunday, according to the Florida Department of Health.

At least 35 states are seeing a rise in new cases compared to the previous week, according to Johns Hopkins University data.

The U.S. has recorded more than 3.3 million coronavirus cases since the pandemic began, meaning nearly 1 out of every 100 Americans has tested positive for COVID-19, according to Johns Hopkins University. At least 135,379 Americans have died.

Across the world, 12.9 million people have tested positive for the virus.

Both local and state leaders in the U.S. have said in recent weeks new cases are largely driven by Americans who have opted to resume gatherings and outings to bars. In many states, the average age of new cases has shifted downward, with more young people testing positive than ever before since the start of the pandemic.

The rising U.S. numbers could just be the tip of the iceberg, as experts have often highlighted infections could be around 10 times higher than what is reported, as many go untraced.

To blunt the rise in case, at least 36 states now have some type of mask requirement order in place, and more than half of U.S. states have paused or rolled back their reopening plans in efforts to contain the spread of the virus.

But precautions have been met with heavy backlash from many officials and residents and some governors have stayed away from statewide mask orders, including Florida.

PEOPLE NEED TO 'FOLLOW THE RULES'

Miami Mayor Francis Suarez said on CNN's ""New Day"" on Monday that the numbers are ""out of control.""

Americans need to follow the rules on social distancing and wearing masks, which are required for citizens in public in the city of Miami, the mayor said.

""If they don't follow the rules, things are going to continue the way they are going,"" he said.

In Atlanta, where the mayor attempted to require citizens to wear masks and revert the city back to its first phase of reopening to combat a rise in cases, Gov. Brian Kemp slammed the decision saying it was ""both non-binding and legally unenforceable.""

Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said on CNN that Kemp had not criticized other cities in Georgia for issuing mask mandates.

""I think that it's unfortunate that when we know the science says wearing a mask is one of the easiest ways to stop the spread, that we had the leader to our state taking exception with it,"" she said.

Miami's Suarez said officials need to have a consistent message at the local, state and national levels.

""A lot of the decisions have been pushed down to local officials that probably should have been done at the federal and state levels,"" he said.

""There's a total disconnect between what is happening and being said out of Washington and even Tallahassee and what is happening in some of these communities right here,"" Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber said.

U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams said the country could turn the rise of cases around in ""two (to) three weeks."" But that is based on whether ""we can get a critical mass of people wearing face coverings, practicing at least 6 feet of social distancing, doing the things we know are effective,"" Adams said Sunday on CBS' ""Face the Nation.""

The surge in cases comes as the White House is making a concerted effort to discredit Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, as he becomes increasingly vocal about his concerns over reopening the country during the national surge in coronavirus cases.

The moves to undercut Fauci come just days after he gave an unvarnished look at his relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump, including that they have not spoken in weeks.

During a webinar with the Stanford School of Medicine, Fauci said the pandemic is ""clearly the most challenging"" public health crisis he's ever dealt with, including HIV, the Ebola virus, anthrax and Zika virus.

""We haven't even begun to see the end of it yet,"" Fauci said of the novel coronavirus.

'THIS THING IS JUST ABOUT EVERYWHERE'

Across the country, health officials are sounding the alarm over the number of infected patients seeking medical care.

In Florida, 8,038 patients are hospitalized across the state with the primary diagnosis of coronavirus as of Monday morning, according to numbers released by the state's Agency for Health Care Administration. At the peak of the pandemic in New York, the highest number of hospitalizations for COVID-19 was 18,825.

Florida's three most populous counties, Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach, are experiencing the highest numbers of coronavirus-related hospitalizations.

In Broward County, home to Fort Lauderdale, there was a 279% increase in hospitalizations overnight, the agency reported.

In the past 13 days, Miami-Dade County has seen a 65% increase in the number of COVID-19 patients hospitalized, a 67% increase in the number of ICU beds being used and a staggering 129% increase in the use of ventilators, according to the latest data released by Miami-Dade County government.

Across the state, there are more than 7,500 patients hospitalized with the virus, state data showed Sunday. In Orange County, where Disney World reopened over the weekend, more than 540 patients were in hospitals.

Leah Carpenter, CEO of Memorial Hospital West in Pembroke Pines, a community in Broward County, said the hospital has canceled all elective procedures and converted those surgical spaces into temporary ICUs.

""Basically, we're creating space in every inch of the building as needed,"" she said.

In Los Angeles County, health officials reported more than 3,300 new cases Sunday -- the second highest daily case count in the last week. There are nearly 2,100 people hospitalized, a number ""substantially higher"" than hospitalizations a month ago, officials said.

Texas reported 8,136 new cases, down from the record 10,351 new cases reported on Saturday. County Judge Lina Hidalgo, the executive overseeing Harris County, the largest in Texas, called on Sunday for a stay-at-home order to be issued.

""Not only do we need a stay home order now, but we need to stick with it this time until the hospitalization curve comes down, not just flattens,"" Hidalgo tweeted. ""Many communities that persevered in that way are reopening for the long haul. Let's learn from that & not make the same mistake twice.""

And in Arizona, Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego told CNN that health care professionals are reporting they are ""already tired"" and worried about additional strains on hospitals stemming from the July 4 holiday, even as the city is already seeing record-breaking ventilator usage.

In Arizona, 89% of ICU beds are currently in use and 86% of all hospital beds in use, according to the Arizona Department of Health Services. Dr. Ross Goldberg, president of Arizona Medical Association, said the longer length of stay by COVID-19 patients is putting pressure on hospitals.

""Here it's a much longer kind of hospital stay, which takes that bed out of circulation,"" he told CNN. ""So if you get people coming in and coming, it just adds pressure on the system.""

There was a glimmer of good news.

Deaths from the virus have also been rising in the U.S., especially in the South and West, though still well below the heights hit in April, according to a recent Associated Press analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University.

""I really do think we could control this, and it's the human element that is so critical. It should be an effort of our country. We should be pulling together when we're in a crisis, and we're definitely not doing it,"" said University of Florida epidemiologist Dr. Cindy Prins.

Adm. Brett Giroir, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, called mask-wearing in public, which has been met with resistance in some U.S. states, ""absolutely essential.""

Giroir, the assistant secretary at the Health and Human Services Department, told ABC's ""This Week"" on Sunday that ""if we don't have that, we will not get control of the virus.""

President Donald Trump wore a mask in public for the first time Saturday, something Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Sunday showed he has ""crossed a bridge.""

Pelosi told CNN's ""State of the Union"" that she hopes it means the president ""will change his attitude, which will be helpful in stopping the spread of the coronavirus.""

In hard-hit Houston, Texas, two top Democratic officials called for the nation's fourth-largest city to lock back down as area hospitals strained to accommodate the onslaught of sick patients.

In Florida, where parts of Walt Disney World reopened Saturday, 15,299 people tested positive, for a total of 269,811 cases, and 45 deaths were recorded, according to state Department of Health statistics reported Sunday.

California had the previous record of daily positive cases -- 11,694, set on Wednesday.

The numbers come at the end of a record-breaking week as Florida reported 514 fatalities -- an average of 73 per day. Three weeks ago, the state was averaging 30 deaths per day.

Researchers expect deaths to rise in the U.S. for at least some weeks, but some think the count probably will not go up as dramatically as it did in the spring because of several factors, including increased testing.

The World Health Organization, meanwhile, reported another record increase in the number of confirmed coronavirus cases over a 24-hour period, at over 230,000.

The U.N. health agency said the United States again topped the list among countries, with more than 66,000 cases. The figures don't necessarily account for delays in reporting cases, and are believed to far underestimate actual totals.

Countries in Eastern Europe were among those facing rising waves of new infections, leading to riots in Serbia, mandatory face masks in Croatia and travel bans or quarantines imposed by Hungary.

""We see worrisome signs about an increase in the number of cases in the neighbouring countries, Europe and the whole world,"" said Gergely Gulyas, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's chief of staff. ""Now, we have to protect our own security and prevent the virus from being brought in from abroad.""

Hungarian authorities said Sunday they have sorted countries into three categories -- red, yellow and green -- based on their rates of new coronavirus infections, and will impose restrictions, including entry bans and mandatory quarantines, depending on which country people are arriving from.

Serbia, where health authorities are warning that hospitals are almost full due to the latest surge, reported 287 new infections on Sunday, although there have been increasing doubts about the accuracy of the figures. Officially, the country has over 18,000 confirmed infections and 382 deaths since March. Sunday's report of 11 coronavirus deaths was the country's second-highest daily death toll.

Serbian police clashed with anti-government protesters for four nights last week, demonstrations that forced the Serbian president to withdraw plans to reintroduce a coronavirus lockdown. Many of the increasing infections have been blamed on crowded soccer matches, tennis events and nightclubs.

In Bulgaria, authorities reintroduced restrictions lifted a few weeks ago because of a new surge in cases.

Albania also has seen a significant increase in infections since mid-May, when it eased lockdown measures. The Balkan nation reported 93 new cases, over twice as many as the highest daily figures in March and April, and the health ministry called the situation at the main infectious disease hospital ""grave.""

Croatia, whose island-dotted Adriatic Sea coast is a major tourist destination, is making wearing masks mandatory in stores beginning Monday.

Yet the numbers of infections in Eastern Europe pale in comparison to daily coronavirus reports from India, South Africa and Brazil, whose virus-denying president has tested positive.

India, which has the most cases after the United States and Brazil, saw a record surge of 28,637 cases reported in the past 24 hours. Authorities also announced a weeklong lockdown beginning Tuesday in the key southern technology hub of Bangalore, where the offices of top tech companies like Microsoft, Apple and Amazon are located.

South Africa has reported over 10,000 new daily cases for several days in a row, including 13,497 new infections announced Saturday night. Johannesburg's densely populated Soweto township is one of the virus hot spots. With over 264,000 cases and 3,971 deaths, South Africa accounts for over 40% of all the reported coronavirus cases in Africa.

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said Sunday the country would return to a ban of alcohol sales to reduce the volume of trauma patients so that hospitals have more beds to treat COVID-19. The country is also reinstating a night curfew to reduce traffic accidents and has made it mandatory for all residents to wear face masks in public.

Meanwhile, in Taiwan, which kept its coronavirus outbreak to a few hundred cases, an annual film festival wrapped up with an awards ceremony this weekend where actors and others lined up for photo shoots with no social distancing, and participants didn't wear masks.

Kimberley Chavez Lopez Byrd, 61, died June 26, less than two weeks after she was hospitalized. The other two teachers -- Jena Martinez and Angela Skillings -- said they're still struggling with the effects of the virus that has killed nearly 135,000 people nationwide.

All three teachers wore masks and gloves, used hand sanitizer and socially distanced, but still got sick, according to school officials at the small community in the eastern part of the state.

Kimberley Byrd had worked at the Hayden Winkelman School District for 38 years -- so long that she'd started teaching the children of her former students.

""Losing Mrs. Byrd in our small rural community was devastating. She was an excellent educator with a huge heart,"" said Pamela Gonzalez, principal of Leonor Hambly K8. ""We find comfort in knowing her story may bring awareness to the importance of keeping our school employees safe and our precious students safe in this pandemic.""

THE INFECTION STARTED IN JUNE

Kimberley Byrd started feeling unwell in June. She was prone to sinus infections, and also had asthma, diabetes and lupus. Her doctor gave her antibiotics and steroids and on June 13, she went to the emergency room, according to her husband, Jesse Byrd Sr.

She was admitted to the hospital and immediately put on oxygen, but her husband was not allowed to be with her. The next morning, she called him to say doctors were putting her on a ventilator. That was the last time they spoke.

""I just had this horrible gut-wrenching feeling just knowing how much of a struggle this was going to be because I knew her lungs were compromised even before this ... fear, just the worst fear that you could feel,"" Byrd said. ""I knew it was going to be rough on her.""

Days later, Jesse Byrd, his daughter, son, daughter-in-law, 4-year-old granddaughter and several other relatives contracted COVID-19. His wife's brother's also tested positive and has been on a ventilator for over 27 days, he told CNN Saturday night.

Jesse Byrd said his wife's condition started improving and the doctors woke her up to see if she could tolerate being intubated while semiconscious. When she woke, she had a panic attack and started regressing.

""We just prayed for a miracle, and we put her in God's hands and we said either he's gonna work a miracle in her and save her or he's gonna take her home,"" Jesse Byrd said. ""She didn't make it ... It's been devastating for us here in our home.""

She died just short of their 24th wedding anniversary.

HUSBAND WARNS ABOUT REOPENING SCHOOLS

Kimberley Byrd loved the outdoors, said Jeff Gregorich, the superintendent of Hayden Winkelman Unifed School District. ""One of my fondest memories was every time I would see her, she would show me [pictures of] her last weekend fishing at the lake,"" he said.

Jesse Byrd said his wife had a passion for teaching and cared for her students. ""A lot of her classroom rules were based around kids respecting each other and being kind to each other and not bullying -- that was really important to her,"" he said.

Gregorich reiterated the three teachers were careful and still got COVID-19.

""I think that's really the message or the concern that our staff has is we can't even keep our staff safe by themselves ... how are we going to keep 20 kids in a classroom safe? I just don't see how that's possible to do that,"" he said.

Byrd said reopening schools will put people in their small community at risk and he does not want to see other families go through a similar experience.

""Many grandparents, wind up being caretakers to kids when they get off school- mom and dad are working and a lot of grandparents are even raising their grandchildren. So, many of these grandparents fall into this high risk category of being older with more health issues,"" he said.

""They have no business opening the schools to try and get back to a traditional classroom ... let's get through this pandemic first before we try to get back to normal.""",[]

The Canadian Council of Business Leaders Against Anti-Black Systemic Racism and the Canadian Association of Urban Financial Professionals announced the plan dubbed the Black North Initiative on Monday.

The plan advocates for companies to work with them to hire more Black students for their internship/co-op programs and to ensure business succession planning strategies include a Black talent strategy to help build a pipeline of employees for future leadership positions.

It is also asking that businesses disaggregate their employee race data and publish it annually, including data on executive representation and/or employee mobility statistics for each racialized group.

The push to deal with systemic racism has gained strength in recent months in the wake of demonstrations held across Canada and the U.S.

A summit is planned for July 20 where business leaders will be asked to sign a CEO pledge and say what they are doing to fight anti-Black systemic racism.

The Canadian Association of Urban Financial Professionals has more than 600 Black professionals as members who work across Bay Street.

""The BlackNorth Initiative and CAUFP are fully aligned regarding the critical need to begin dismantling systemic racism in corporate Canada,"" said Wes Hall, founder and chairman of the Canadian Council of Business Leaders Against Anti-Black Systemic Racism.

""Corporations must do more to create and nurture Black talent pipelines to ensure proper representation at the highest levels. This is a natural partnership in a shared mission that will lead to measurable results.""

Here's a look at how much Canadian cities spend on policing,[],2020-07-10 07:30:00-04:00,"TORONTO -- An analysis by CTVNews.ca of 18 of Canada’s largest cities, regions and provincial capitals found more than half allocated 15 per cent or more of their 2020 operating budget to policing, with cities in Western Canada budgeting 20 per cent or more.

Coast-to-coast, from Vancouver to Charlottetown, P.E.I., Canadian cities are spending 15 to 20 per cent or more of their budget on law enforcement, the bulk of it coming from municipal taxes. Cities that do not have a municipal force were excluded from the analysis.

Cries to defund the police have rung out in protests across the United States, sparked by the death of George Floyd, seen in a video pleading and gasping for air as a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee against his neck -- long after he had already gone silent.

Around the world and in Canada, cities are also facing public pressure to reduce their law enforcement budgets to reallocate funds to other areas including mental health and community social support services.

It is a contentious issue, however. Ontario Premier Doug Ford has already dismissed the idea for the Ontario Provincial Police, saying he believes in strengthening policing through better community involvement.

In recent months, several deaths that followed “wellness checks” by Canadian police have sparked further discussion over whether police officers are properly trained or even the appropriate authority to deal with someone having a mental health crisis, in particular those who are Black, Indigenous, or a person of colour.

In June, 62-year-old Ejaz Choudry was killed in his home by police in Mississauga, Ont., after the family said it called a non-emergency helpline because he was having a mental health episode. Paramedics who arrived called the police after Choudry was seen with a knife in his hand. Earlier in the month, Chantel Moore, an Indigenous woman, was shot and killed by police in New Brunswick during another wellness check, while Regis Korchinski-Paquet, a Black, Indigenous woman, fell from her apartment balcony in Toronto last month while police officers were in her home.

BIGGEST POLICE BUDGET IN CANADA

At the end of June, Toronto city council rejected a 10 per cent cut to the police budget, about $107 million, and instead passed a motion on police reform that includes implementing body cameras and overhauling the way Canada’s largest municipal police force responds to people in crisis.

A 10 per cent reduction would have meant cutting about 1,000 police officers, according to the Canadian Press, a move that could take years to implement due to collective bargaining agreements with the union.

The Toronto Police Service operating budget for 2020 is $1.22 billion, about 9 per cent of the city’s $13.53 billion operational budget for 2020. More than $3 billion is distributed for various social support and development programs including employment, social assistance, child-care, long-term care services, helping under-resourced neighbourhoods, housing and shelter support.

In early June, the Vancouver Police Board rejected a motion by city council calling for a 1 per cent cut to the police’s $339 million budget, about 21 per cent of the city’s $1.62 billion operating budget for 2020.

Meanwhile, Edmonton city council approved a motion in early July that included cutting the police service’s budget by $11 million over the next two years amid weeks of debate around police reform.

South of the border, the city of Los Angeles voted on July 1 to cut police department hiring, slashing the LAPD’s budget by US$150 million. The cut brings the department’s staffing down to its lowest level in 12 years, the Los Angeles Times reported. The city said the money would eventually be reallocated into services like hiring programs and summer youth jobs for Black, Latino and other marginalized communities.

BIGGEST LINE ITEM ON THE BUDGET

For cities in Western Canada including Victoria, Vancouver, Saskatoon, Regina, Winnipeg, policing accounts for at least 20 per cent of their 2020 operating budgets. Among them, all but Vancouver have policing as the city’s biggest expenditure. (Utilities is listed as Vancouver’s biggest operating expenditure in its 2020 budget, though annual financial reports show that police is the city’s biggest expense.)

In Victoria, the police force accounts for roughly 23 per cent of the city’s total operating expenses for 2020. For Vancouver, Saskatoon and Regina, it’s just over 20 per cent. Edmonton and Calgary are the exceptions.

The Winnipeg Police Service is getting $304.1 million this year, or 26.6 per cent of the city’s $1.14 billion tax-supported operating expenditures. It is the largest percentage among the cities examined by CTVNews.ca. By comparison, community services in Winnipeg are getting $115 million, or 10 per cent of the budget.

As in many other cities, a petition has been circulating calling for change and defunding the Winnipeg police. Chief Danny Smyth said in June that it was too early to “just say defund the police and forward that all to social services” but added there was room for conversation on what such a move could look like.

Even places with modest budgets, like Charlottetown, P.E.I., which has a budget of $59.7 million, allocates more than 16 per cent to police. In Fredericton, N.B., more than 14 per cent of its $124.4 million budget (including capital expenditures) goes to policing. That portion is more than 18 per cent if capital expenditures are excluded.

In larger southern Ontario, Toronto-area cities and regions including Hamilton, Waterloo, Peel, and York, hundreds of millions of dollars are spent each year on policing. Peel and York, which have similar operating budgets of approximately $2.5 billion, spend about $445.8 million and $384.2 million, respectively, or 17 and 16 per cent. The Waterloo Regional Police, which also serves Kitchener, Ont., accounts for just over 17 per cent of the region’s operating budget. Hamilton’s police budget accounts for nearly 19 per cent of the city’s net operating budget. (That portion is halved however, if calculated based on the tax and rate supported gross operating expenditure).

Nearly all cities that spend roughly 10 per cent or less on policing have operating budgets of at least $1 billion. These include Toronto, Calgary, Ottawa, Quebec City, Montreal and Halifax, which has a budget just shy of a billion.

According to Statistics Canada data, the average salary among municipal police officers was $100,962 for 2017/2018, the latest year in which data is available. And while police spending has increased, the number of police officers per 100,000 people has been shrinking, the data showed.

In the United States, data varies depending on the source, but the percentage allocated to police departments for the 10 largest cities in the country ranged from 6 per cent to 17.4 per cent based on an analysis by U.S. News & World Report. Data compiled by the Center for Popular Democracy, a progressive advocacy group, which includes other cities, showed that percentage ranged as high as 20 to 45 per cent, with such cities as Minneapolis accounting for more than 35 per cent and Milwaukee making up nearly 48 per cent.

One important caveat to note is that cities are all structured differently and may report their finances or categorize their spending differently as well, so a true apples-to-apples comparison is extremely difficult. A few cities include utilities as part of its operating expenses, for example, while many do not.The Canadian police data in this analysis was collected and calculated based on figures presented in 2020 budget proposals and reports released by each city and region. As much as possible, comparable figures were used. In general, total operating budget or expenditure budget excluding capital expenditures as presented in the budget reports were used. In some cases, for example, figures provided may be net of recoveries and/or transfers, terms for certain types of financial transactions in accounting.

The majority of Ontario's 34 local public health unit regions will move forward to Stage 3 on July 17, the province announced on Monday.

Health units in the Greater Toronto Area, along with a few others like Niagara and Windsor, are not included on the list of regions moving forward to Stage 3. The regions excluded from the list will remain in Stage 2 of the restart phase until further notice.

""We will keep working until every part of this province gets to Stage 3,"" Premier Doug Ford said Monday. ""My friends, this is great news. We are moving forward as a province but we can't stop, we won't stop until we get every worker in Ontario back to work and back on their feet.""

For the regions moving forward to Stage 3, there will be a significant increase to social gathering limits.

Indoor gathering limits will increase from 10 to a maximum of 50 people, while outdoor gathering limits will increase to a maximum of 100 people.

Physical distancing is still required during any gathering with people from outside an individual's social circle. The province is not increasing the number of people a person can gather with without physical distancing measures in place.

The government is also banning a number of high-risk businesses and activities from resuming in Stage 3, including amusement parks, water parks, buffet-style food services, dancing in restaurants and bars, overnight stays at camps for children, private karaoke rooms, prolonged or deliberate contact while playing sports, saunas, steam rooms, bath houses and oxygen bars.

Casinos will be allowed to reopen but table games are banned.

All restaurants, bars, concession stands, and other food and drink establishments are allowed to reopen for indoor dining in Stage 3. Nightclubs are still banned from reopening, except for the purpose of serving food or drinks.

Gyms and fitness studios can also reopen with safety protocols in place. Organized sports can also resume, with the exception of contact sports.

Playgrounds, community centres and libraries will also reopen.

The province will also allow personal support services to resume that involve a customers' face, such as facials and some piercings.

""All other businesses and public spaces will be permitted to be open, subject to ensuring the appropriate health and safety measures are in place, as well as limits on gathering sizes,"" the government said.

The government said that as more businesses and activities reopen, COVID-19 trends will be monitored closely and restrictions can be “further loosened, or if they need to be tightened.”

People are still being asked to work remotely ""as much as possible,"" the government said.

Health Minister Christine Elliott said that Ontario will remain in Stage 3 for the ""foreseeable future.""

""Certainly we are all hoping there will be a vaccine in short order but apart from that we will remain in Stage 3,"" she said. ""But depending on how Stage 3 moves forward in different parts of the province, if we keep our numbers down, if there are no new outbreaks of COVID-19, then we will be able to gradually expand things like the size of gatherings for example.""

""That will be a gradual loosening of the health restrictions, still within Stage 3.""

Ontario also extended the province's state of emergency on Monday until July 24.

When will the Toronto area move to Stage 3?

Elliott said that the province needs more COVID-19 data from the regions who are not heading into Stage 3 before a decision can be made about moving forward.

""There are several other communities that moved into Stage 2 before Toronto did. We expect that will happen in the same way because the chief medical officer of health and the public health experts need to see about four weeks of data to understand what is going on locally, to make sure there are no further public health concerns,"" Elliott said.

""We expect that the next group will be the second group that moved to Stage 2 will be the second group to move to Stage 3 just because of the time frames that have elapsed and then Toronto will follow.""

Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr. David Williams, said he hopes all regions will enter Stage 3 by the end of July.

Dr. Heather Morrison said the latest cases are not the result of seasonal visitors to the province or the so-called Atlantic bubble, which the four provinces opened July 3 to allow travel within the region.

""But this situation raises questions about the possibility of the Canadian bubble,"" Morrison told a news conference.

""Although ultimately this is not my decision, I believe it would be premature today to be considering a further loosening of our border restrictions and encouraging broader travel.""

The latest case is a man in his 40s who works in the emergency room at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Charlottetown. Morrison said he tested positive Sunday night after being identified through contact-tracing of another case.

She said the health-care worker had come into contact with a Queen's County woman in her 80s who went to the hospital by ambulance on July 4.

Morrison said the woman was not displaying COVID-19 symptoms when she was at the hospital and was not tested. She had no contact with anyone in the waiting room. She had diagnostic testing and then was taken home by family.

Morrison said the woman's symptoms worsened Saturday and she called 811 and was tested. The results came back positive Sunday.

""This is a challenging and worrisome situation,"" Morrison said Monday. ""The increased number of contacts, both patients and staff, makes for a larger and more complex response.""

Morrison said the health-care worker had travelled to a Canadian destination outside the Atlantic provinces and returned to work July 4 after testing negative for COVID-19.

""Essential health-care workers who travel or arrive from elsewhere in Canada have been able to work as long as they are tested immediately prior to reporting to work and wear appropriate (personal protective equipment),"" she said.

Morrison wouldn't say what role the person has in the emergency department, but he worked seven shifts between July 4 and 11.

She said 100 patients and 125 staff have been identified as contacts and will be tested.

""I encourage anyone who was at the QEH emergency department between July 4 and July 11 to be patient and calm. Not everyone who went to the emergency department during this period will need to be tested,"" Morrison said.

She said anyone who flew on WestJet Flight 654 from Toronto to Charlottetown on July 2 should call 811 or their family doctor about testing.

She said it is hoped the spread to patients and staff at the hospital has been limited.

P.E.I. has now had 35 cases of COVID-19, including 27 that are considered recovered.

Morrison said, now more than ever, she is pleading with Islanders and visitors to the province to pay attention to the public health measures, including hand washing, physical distancing and wearing a mask when physical distancing isn't possible.

Dr. Brent Roussin, the province's chief public health officer, made the announcement Monday afternoon.

Manitoba has had 325 cases since early March. There is currently one active case in Manitoba, and 317 people have recovered from the virus.

The death toll remains at seven.

On Friday, 798 tests were performed. An additional 1,149 tests were completed on Saturday, followed by another 573 on Sunday. The province's total number of tests is now at 71,559 since early February.

As the province continues to see favourable numbers, Roussin said Manitobans can't let their guards down, and now is not the time to relax on health guidelines, such as physical distancing and consistent hand washing.

""This virus is not done with us and if we don't remain vigilant, we'll be seeing increasing cases. So we need to adhere to the principles that got us here,"" said Roussin.

""If we want to keep our success going forward, if we want to keep reopening our economy, we need to start getting back to the basics that got us here.""

Roussin added Manitoba can't loosen restrictions too quickly and people should look at other jurisdictions when restrictions were lifted too early.

""The last thing we want to do is go backwards, we move so quick, and we end up having to put restrictions on again,"" he said.

RESPIRATORY VIRUS STEERING COMMITTEE

Lanette Siragusa, the chief nursing officer with Shared Health, said health officials are preparing for the upcoming influenza season, even as they continue to deal with COVID-19.

A respiratory virus steering committee has been created, which will help officials prepare for COVID-19 and influenza coming together.

""One of the priorities that we are considering is the vaccine strategy that we will be initiating,"" said Siragusa. ""We are looking to increase the uptake of vaccines this year.""

The committee is also looking at how to shift resources in the province.

The committee is being co-chaired by both Siragusa and Roussin.

PLANNING TO LOOSEN MORE RESTRICTIONS

Roussin said with the case count in the province continuing to be low, health officials are looking at loosening more restrictions in the coming days and weeks.

""We're right now having plans to add to the loosening of restrictions. So I don't I think we are going frame any further ones as a phase necessarily, but there's a few things that are still required to be closed due to the orders and we're looking at how we can open those up and some other loosening restrictions such as outdoor group sizes,"" said Roussin.

The 116 new cases reported Monday is a slight decrease from the 129 reported on Sunday and the 130 reported on Saturday.

“Having seen a continued decline in the number of new COVID-19 cases as the province entered Stage 2, and with hospitalizations being at all-time lows, today we’re providing details about Stage 3 of our plan to continue the safe and gradual reopening,” Ontario Health Minister Christine Elliott said on Monday.

The province also reported that three more people have died due to COVID-19. Ontario’s total number of lab-confirmed cases of the disease now amounts to 36,839, including 2,722 deaths and 32,663 recoveries.

Where are the COVID-19 cases?

Elliott said that 29 of the province’s 34 public health units have reported five or fewer new cases of the disease on Monday, with 21 of them reporting no new cases at all.

According to Monday's epidemiology report, 38 of the new cases were found in Peel Region, six were found in York Region, 34 were found in Toronto and 15 were found in Windsor-Essex, a region that has been grappling with outbreaks among migrant workers.

Of the new cases in Ontario, 88 are between the ages of 20 and 59. There are nine patients who are 19 years old or younger and 18 patients who are over the age of 59.

The majority of total deaths to date have been reported in people over the age of 79. One person under the age of 19 who had COVID-19 has died in Ontario, but it is not clear if the death was caused by the disease or other health issues.

Eleven patients who died were between the ages of 20 and 39, while 111 were between the ages of 40 and 59, and 723 were between the ages of 60 and 79.

More than 1,800 people over the age of 80 have died of the disease, many of whom lived in long-term care homes.

As of Monday, there were 104 people in the hospital due to COVID-19. Twenty-eight of those patients are in the intensive care unit and 20 of them are breathing with the assistance of ventilators.

“The number of COVID-19 patients receiving care in hospital has dropped significantly from the highs of over 1,000 reported in May,” Elliott said in a statement posted to Twitter.

“ICU admissions and vented patients have also seen a persistent decline since the peak of this pandemic.”

COVID-19 testing in Ontario

In the last 24 hours, just over 20,000 COVID-19 tests were conducted by officials.

Ontario health officials have conducted more than 1.7 million tests for the disease since the pandemic was declared.

More than 7,000 tests are still under investigation.",[]
79,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/who-s-hiring-a-look-at-the-canadian-job-market-1.5022260,Where the jobs are: Some sectors rebounding faster as Canada emerges from lockdown,['Ryan Flanagan'],2020-07-13 14:39:00-04:00,"TORONTO -- Jobs lost during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic are coming back – but not all at once, and not in the same order they disappeared.

Statistics Canada reported July 10 that more than 950,000 jobs were added in the country in June. While only a small fraction of the three million or so positions that were lost as lockdowns were imposed in March and April, the number represents a record increase as those measures are lifted.

""There's a lot of places that are still hiring amidst all the doom and gloom that we've been experiencing over the past few months,"" Carolyn Levy, president of the technologies division of staffing and recruitment agency Randstad Canada, told CTVNews.ca on Monday via telephone from Calgary.

Breaking down the numbers by industry yields clues into where the first wave of rebound hiring is taking place. More than 20 per cent of the added jobs were classified as wholesale and retail trade – with 16 per cent in accommodation and food services, 12 per cent in health care and social assistance, and eight per cent apiece in construction and manufacturing.

This suggests that the retail and restaurant workers who were among the first to be let go when their establishments were ordered to close were also among the first to be hired back when limited activity was allowed to resume.

There is still a long way to go before those sectors can be back to normal, though. In food services alone, it is believed that 400,000 Canadian jobs eliminated during the pandemic have yet to return. Many businesses in the broader service sector say they do not expect to ever return to pre-pandemic staffing levels.

Also notable, StatCan found, is that there were more wholesale jobs in Canada in June than there were in February, before the pandemic hit. Levy chalked this increase up to the surge in online shopping, which has left companies needing extra staff in warehouses and other parts of the supply chain.

On manufacturing, Levy said the increase could be due to companies retooling their lines to produce personal protective equipment or other items suddenly in demand due to the pandemic.

EMPLOYERS RETHINKING OLD ROLES

For the nearly 2.5 million Canadians who remain unemployed, though, knowing where hiring has recently happened only paints part of the picture. More helpful is information about where hiring is happening now.

According to the federal government's job bank, the most in-demand jobs right now are sales associates, administrative assistants and customer service representatives, followed by truck drivers, general farm workers and light-duty cleaners.

A popular website used by job-seekers to connect with employers is seeing similar patterns. Brendon Bernard, an economist with the Indeed Hiring Lab, wrote July 7 that retail and customer service jobs are among those that saw the biggest drop in new postings on Indeed earlier in the pandemic, and have since seen some of the biggest rebounds.

""Sectors narrowing the gap relatively quickly in recent weeks include ones featuring lower-paying positions, like retail, and customer service,"" he wrote.

""Areas posting roles with many mid-wage jobs have also seen noticeable bounce-backs, like construction, as well as education and instruction.""

Levy said that some employers are also creating new roles as they look to respond to their customers' needs during and after the pandemic. Opportunities created by this include more positions for financial advisers, she said, as well as an even greater demand for tech workers.

Postings on Indeed for higher-paying jobs have been slower to bounce back, Bernard said. Indeed has tracked two categories where new job postings have fallen off since early May – security and public safety, and aviation.

Bernard reported that the number of new job postings on Indeed as of July 3 was 21 per cent lower than it had been one year earlier. That gap had been as large as 70 per cent in mid-April. Smaller provinces, which have generally been less affected by COVID-19, have kept job posting levels closer to where they were in 2019 than larger provinces.

Levy said she is seeing employers increasingly show interest in hiring for temporary contract positions. This benefits them because it allows them to avoid making long-term commitments in an uncertain environment, she said, but can also be good for those looking for jobs because it gives them a chance to find work that they might not otherwise have.

""Companies have had to take a step back and start to reimagine how they have to work in this new normal,"" she said.

""Businesses have to look at what do we need to do to reskill, what do we need to do to retrain, given the way we operated our business four months ago is not the way it's going to be … from now on.""",[]
80,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/jewishprivilege-hashtag-trends-on-twitter-as-users-fight-back-against-anti-semitism-1.5022216,'JewishPrivilege' hashtag trends on Twitter as users fight back against anti-Semitism,[],2020-07-13 14:17:00-04:00,"TORONTO -- The anti-Semitic hashtag 'JewishPrivilege' was trending on Twitter Monday after Jewish people took it over to share their experiences of discrimination, with one expert saying such hatred is still 'alive and well' in Canada today.

According to Jewish News, the trend first started Sunday night when Israeli writer and activist Hen Mazzig shared his family's experience with anti-Semitism after others used the hashtag to accuse Jewish people of being ""privileged.""

""#JewishPrivilege is when my grandparents were violently forced out of Iraq and Tunisia for being Jewish with only the clothes to their back. Along with 850,000 other MENA [Middle East and North Africa] Jews they arrived to Israel with nothing, only spoke Arabic, and lived in a tent/tin shack for years,"" Mazzig tweeted.

""I want all my Jewish followers to share the 'Jewish Privilege' them and their families experienced.""

Noah Shack, vice president of the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs (CIJA), told CTVNews.ca that #JewishPrivilege has, for years, existed as an anti-Semitic hashtag used primarily by conspiracy theorists.

""A lot of these tropes are well known about Jews controlling media and government, and the economy and unfortunately, a lot of these conspiracy theories have ended in the past with violence,"" Shack told CTVNews.ca in a phone interview on Monday.

""We're seeing a lot of traction on the hashtag now because Jewish people have sort of taken it over to discuss those experiences of persecution that have come about as a result of anti-Semitism, not just as something in the past but of course something that's very much alive and well today.""

After Mazzig's tweet, many others joined in on the conversation including stand-up comedian Sarah Silverman who said she experienced other children ""throwing pennies at me on the bus"" and had ""pastors in Florida calling for my death and telling their congregation that knocking my teeth out and killing me would be God’s work.""

Comedian David Baddiel tweeted that ""Jews don't always feel white, if by white you mean, to put it bluntly, safe."" Baddiel explained that he was just 12-years-old when he overheard a new teacher call him a 'Jew' and others agreed. He added that ""this is without getting into most of my mum’s family being murdered.""

Dov Hikind, founder of the campaigning organization Americans Against Antisemitism, also used the hashtag to tweet: ""I had the #JewishPrivilege of growing up without grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins because my parents’ friends were nearly entirely wiped out by Hitler.""

The hashtag has been used more than 100,000 times on Twitter as of Monday afternoon, trending in the U.S., Israel, the U.K. and Canada.

Shack said anti-Semitism is ""not just a relic of the past"" and that countries such as Canada, the U.S. and the U.K. are seeing a rise in discrimination against Jewish people.

""I am enjoying a life in Canada today, because a couple of generations ago somebody had the good fortune to be able to flee murderous persecution,"" Shack explained. ""Despite the fact that we live in such a wonderful open diverse and vibrant democracy here in Canada, I can't help but worry whether or not my children will be the next generation that's forced to flee.""

While Jewish people are using the hashtag to bring awareness to discrimination, a number of organizations expressed concerns online that hashtag is drawing attention to those tweeting anti-Semitic comments.

Danny Stone, the CEO of the Antisemitism Policy Trust, tweeted ""That #JewishPrivilege is trending makes me feel sick. It may not be a hate term but Twitter should know what this does to communities.""

The Campaign Against Antisemitism (CAAS) also criticized Twitter for not taking action to curb anti-Semitism on the platform, claiming that the social media site has a ""long record of enabling racism against Jews.""

""The idea that Jews are a 'privileged' group is a slur designed to deny that antisemitism exists and to imply that Jews are a cause of racism towards other minorities,"" the CAAS tweeted.

However, Shack said the attention the hashtag is getting is a ""good thing"" as it will amplify Jewish voices and ""drown out those of the anti-Semites.""

""It's important that people take note that this isn't something that just gets swept under the rug and that Canadians, Jews and non-Jews alike stand together and call it out and make it absolutely clear that this kind of hate [and] discrimination has no place in Canada,"" Shack said.

""Whether it's directed towards Jewish people, or any other people, it's just not what we're about here.""",[]
81,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/fatty-liver-disease-a-growing-public-health-concern-in-canada-study-1.5022155,Fatty liver disease a growing public health concern in Canada: study,['Lauren Krugel'],2020-07-13 13:23:00-04:00,"CALGARY -- Doctors are warning that soaring rates of a common, but often undetected, liver disease could impose an enormous burden on Canadian health care over the next decade if there isn't more public awareness.

""There's a reason why they call liver disease the silent killer,"" said Dr. Mark Swain, a University of Calgary liver specialist who led a study published recently in the online journal CMAJ Open.

""It's because liver disease broadly has no symptoms.""

Liver cells are like balloons that can fill with fat over time, especially when someone is obese, he said.

The paper notes an estimated one-quarter of Canadians over the age of 20 have this condition, called nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD.

Swain, who directs the university's gastroenterology and hepatology division, said physicians have historically treated it as relatively benign because liver fat usually just sits there and doesn't do much.

But about three to five per cent of those with the disease go on to develop a more problematic condition called nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH. In those cases, Swain said, an immune response can trigger inflammation, which can lead to scarring or even cancer.

Swain and other researchers with the The Canadian NASH Network, a coalition of doctors focused on the disease, used trends in obesity rates to forecast the prevalence of fatty liver disease in the Canadian population between 2019 and 2030.

The study found cases of NAFLD are on track to rise 20 per cent in that time frame and that its more advanced form, NASH, is projected to rise by 35 per cent.

Cases of liver failure, liver cancer and the need for transplants are expected to rise by a total of 65 per cent to 579,000 by 2030.

Deaths are expected to double to 49,100 in that time.

""There has been a conditioning amongst many health-care professionals that it's not of concern,"" said Swain.

""We really need to be better at increasing awareness, both in the population and amongst health-care professionals and allied health-care workers, that this is an issue.""

A dollar figure for the cost-burden on the health-care system has not been calculated in Canada, but Swain expects it would be ""astronomical.""

Dr. Diana Mager, an associate professor of clinical nutrition at the University of Alberta, said patients are often surprised to find out that they even have fatty liver disease. Symptoms, like a sore abdomen, don't show up until it's well advanced, she said.

""People walk around for years with NAFLD and don't know they have it.""

The biggest culprits seem to be processed foods and sugary drinks, she said. Mager, who specializes in pediatric patients, said fatty liver disease has been showing up in children and adolescents.

A more wholesome diet and more active lifestyle can reverse the disease in its early stages, she said.

There's some debate as to whether the same holds for when the disease is more advanced. But, at the very least, lifestyle changes can slow its progression, said Mager, who also chairs the Canadian Liver Foundation's national education advisory committee.

Simply telling people to go on a diet and lose weight isn't enough, she said.

""It's one thing to tell the Canadian public, 'Don't eat this and don't eat that.'

""But if there isn't an availability of affordable healthy foods, then that's a problem. You can't expect a family, if they can't afford to purchase those foods, to be able to consume those foods on a regular basis.""

Monday's search is focusing on the same wooded area where police discovered the bodies of Romy Carpentier, six, and Norah Carpentier, 11, after provincial police said ""elements of interest"" were found, though would not disclose what they were.

urete du Quebec Sgt. Ann Mathieu said search teams were focusing on a sector near rang Saint-Lazare and Bois-Joly, also raising the possibility the man may be unconscious or dead.



""Can we say 50/50? In fact, the time passing by, we cannot neglect that maybe he could not be alive. But also the information that we have can let us think that he could still be alive. There's a lot of sheds around here that he could maybe find a place to (hide). So we can't neglect any hypothesis at this moment,"" she said.

On Sunday, police narrowed in on the woods when sightings of Carpentier were reported.

“Some people said they saw him so we are continuing to focus on that area,” Mathieu said at the time.

L’Association des Scouts du Canada spokesperson Dominique Moncalis confirmed that Carpentier was a pack scouter with the 128 Charny chapter of the Scouts and there is a vigil set up at Parc des Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere. Video is circulating of the father and daughter Norah in their Scout uniforms. Norah was a Cub Scout and Romy was set to enter the Beaver Scouts when she turned seven.

Moncalis told CTV News that the association plays games in nature and sleep outside, but only learn basic survival skills.

Police are using ATVs, drones and K-9 patrols, as well as a helicopter as part of their search for Carpentier. The 44-year-old is described as 5'10"" and 130 pounds.

STAY HOME, DON'T INTERFERE

The SQ also made a plea to residents on Sunday to not livestream the manhunt for Carpentier after an incident Saturday night.

“What happened yesterday is someone did a Facebook live to ask citizens to come over and pursue the search with us, but in fact those kind of initiatives are really not good to help our police officers,” said SQ Sgt. Ann Mathieu. “It’s called false calls that we have to verify, so it’s going to slow down the investigation.”

Mathieu said around 100 people went into the woods after hearing a noise to see what was going on. Police say the influx of people contaminated the scene and caused the SQ’s K-9 squad to be ineffective.

“So that’s why we ask the people, we appreciate the work you want to do for us, we appreciate your goodwill, but doing so is not a good idea to help us. It’s not helping us,” said Matthieu.

“Stay home. Just look on your property. You’re the best person to know exactly if there’s something wrong on your property. If so, call us we’re going to do the verification about it.”

Police are still analyzing the scene to determine what may have led to the young girls’ deaths.

“We’re working on different things. We’re still waiting for the autopsy results, we’re still waiting for the scene results because those elements can be important but I cannot say more than that,” said Mathieu.

A QUEBEC TOWN TRANSFORMED

The attention of the entire province has been on the case, especially in the town of just over 6,000 where it's playing out.

Police have transformed the parking lot of a community centre into a base of operations and helicopters have been taking off and landing at a nearby soccer field.

Cedric Lambert, a native of St-Apollinaire, which is about a 30-minute drive from Quebec City, said he never imagined he'd see this type of deployment in his quiet little corner of the province.

""Seeing police everywhere, helicopters, you wouldn't have believed it,"" Lambert, 23, said. ""Then to know that they found the little girls here is stressful.""

His partner, Marie-Myriam Dion, a mother of two, said she doesn't feel safe.

""I can't wait for them to find him,"" she said. ""I lock my doors at home as soon as I am alone.""

Lambert was concerned Carpentier could represent a danger, given he's been missing since Wednesday and couldn't very well return to town to buy food.

One local described the area as a prime hiding spot.

Gerald Rousseau, a St-Apollinaire resident for 40 years, lives about four kilometres from where the police are searching. He said there's plenty of places to hide in the densely forested area.

""There are plenty of small chalets around there, cabins, sugar shacks, trailers,"" Rousseau said. ""It's a good place to hide ... people come down on the weekends, but there aren't a lot of people coming down given what's happening, so there's often food left behind inside.""

He also did as police asked and surveyed his own property.

""I turned my own property over, I didn't find anything,"" Rousseau said.

Police have said the girls and their father were believed to have been in a car crash on Highway 20 in St-Apollinaire on Wednesday evening.

Investigators said the car was heading east on the highway when it skidded into the median, flipped over and landed on the shoulder on the opposite side of the highway.

But police did not find any occupants inside the car when they arrived.

Lambert and Dion had joined the search on Saturday, criss-crossing the wooded area by car before the sisters' bodies were found, with autopsies to determine the cause of death still pending.

Jocelyne Fortier lives in the neighbouring village of St-Agapit, where police have also looked.

""It's appalling, it's stressful,"" she said. ""We lock our doors, we don't know if it's dangerous or not.""

The car accident that triggered the investigation happened near her brother's residence. And the sisters remind her or her own nieces, about the same age.

""As soon as there are children involved, it's even more difficult,"" Fortier said.

OUTPOURING OF GRIEF

There was a mass outpouring of grief Saturday night after the two girls' bodies were discovered.

Quebec Premier Francois Legault posted on Twitter calling the girls' deaths a ""national tragedy.""

1/4 Comme tous les Québécois, je suis bouleversé, sans mots. Perdre deux enfants, ce qu’on a de plus cher dans la vie, c’est incompréhensible. C’est une tragédie nationale. — François Legault (@francoislegault) July 11, 2020

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau added that he was ""devastated by the news.""

I’m devastated by the news coming out of Quebec today, an incomprehensible tragedy for any parent. My heart breaks for the family and friends of Norah and Romy - I’m sending you my deepest condolences. Know that all Canadians are keeping you in their thoughts tonight. — Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) July 12, 2020

'CALL FOR HELP': PREMIER

As he opened his press briefing on COVID-19 Monday, Legault made a statement about the tragedy.

""I can tell you how shocked I am, and I guess all Quebecers are shocked like me. Unfortunately, the alleged culprit has not been found, '' he said. He added that the police will do everything to find the suspect, before asking people in distress to ask for help.

""When we feel that we are exhausted or when we see in those close to us, our spouse, that there is someone who looks distressed, it is not embarrassing, it is not shameful, it's responsible to call and ask for help, '' he said.

Legault mentioned the parent support line 1-800-361-5085.

Leona Alleslev made the announcement on Twitter on Monday morning, as the party's four leadership candidates look to shore up last-minute support before the August 21 deadline for mail-in ballots.

""Canada faces an uncertain future. Canada needs a leader who has the experience and a plan to tackle the priorities of our time. That is why Peter MacKay has my support,"" reads the tweet.

On Sunday evening, Alleslev made her decision to step down as deputy party leader public, citing a need to engage in the final weeks of the campaign.

""The selection of the next leader of the Conservative Party of Canada is too important a decision for me to stand to the side. Today, I am stepping down as Deputy Leader of her Majesty’s Loyal Opposition to engage more actively in the leadership campaign,"" the tweet reads.

Alleslev was appointed deputy leader by Andrew Scheer in November, 2019, about a year after causing a stir in the House of Commons when she crossed the floor, swapping her Liberal badge for a Tory one.

""I stand here today deeply concerned for the future of our country. After three years of hope and hard work, I find myself asking: Am I doing everything I can to serve the citizens of Aurora—Oak Ridges—Richmond Hill and my country?,"" Alleslev said when delivering her announcement in the House in September, 2018.

""My attempts to raise my concerns with the government were met with silence. It is my duty to stand and be counted. Our country is at risk.""

The Ontario MP quickly adapted to her role under the opposition tent, grilling her former colleagues for their foreign affairs policy and most recently for their pandemic response.

She was steadfast in her loyalty to Scheer and defended his positioning on social conservative issues during the fall federal election campaign.

In an interview on CTV’s Question Period shortly after she became deputy leader, she questioned the allegiance of Scheer critics who railed against the leader for his campaign performance and shed doubt on his ability to lead following the party’s devastating loss.

""I think that there are certain obviously disgruntled people and I'm very disappointed in them, because if they really cared about the country and they really cared about the conservative movement, they would wait for the external review that we are investing in, to find out exactly where we can do better and what we did wrong,"" Alleslev said at the time.

In her resignation letter Sunday, she celebrated her party’s recent accomplishments and expressed her commitment to help build a strong Tory base.

""Together, our Conservative team has held the government to account and challenged them to address critical policy flaws that they had failed to consider or deliberately neglected,"" reads the letter.

""Canada faces an uncertain future. The Conservative Party of Canada is in the process of choosing a new leader that will guide us through the nation’s next chapter.""

Peter MacKay, Erin O’Toole, Leslyn Lewis and Derek Sloan are vying to replace Scheer from the party’s top post. MacKay, a former cabinet minister, and O’Toole, a sitting MP, are widely considered to be the front-runners.

Alleslev represents a part of the old riding that once belonged to MacKay’s former partner and Conservative turned Liberal MP Belinda Stronach.",[]

One Adelaide Airport worker said that staff believe the grey BMW has been in the employee car park since “February or even earlier.” It had been covered with a protective sheet until a windy day in April revealed its licence plate.

It was still there on Monday, after Steven Spry, an operations supervisor with Qantas, clocked out for the night, he told CTVNews.ca over Instagram messaging.

“We guess it may be a long haul pilot or hostess caught overseas,” he wrote.

The novel coronavirus wasn’t officially dubbed COVID-19 until February 11, when Spry said some colleagues believe the car might have already been parked at the airport. Since the World Health Organization deemed the global outbreaks a pandemic in March, international travel has been widely restricted and countries were forced to charter jets to bring citizens home.

Australia, which has close to 10,000 known cases of the virus and 108 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 dashboard, has recently renewed lockdowns after flareups of the virus in major cities.

Amid lockdowns, the airline industry was hit particularly hard as planes were grounded and flights cancelled, leading companies to lay off thousands of staff. Spry said that most workers with Qantas and Virgin Australia Airlines are out of work, which could be part of the reason the car is still at the airport. Typically, staff can only leave their vehicles there for 48 hours.

But it’s a mystery as to when the owner of the car would have had the licence plate approved by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, and why. The BMW in question is registered until late September, but there are no licence plates registered as “COVID19,” according to ABC Radio Adelaide, who first reported the story.",[]

Nova Scotia has now gone five days without a new case of COVID-19. The last positive case was reported on Wednesday, in a Nova Scotia truck driver who travelled outside Canada as an essential worker.

The QEII Health Sciences Centre's microbiology lab completed 401 Nova Scotia tests on Sunday. No new cases were identified.

To date, Nova Scotia has 57,675 negative test results.

1,000 COVID-19 CASES RESOLVED

The total number of COVID-19 cases remains at 1,066, but 1,000 cases are now considered resolved and 63 people have died, leaving only three active cases in Nova Scotia.

Among the 63 Nova Scotians who died from COVID-19 are 53 residents of the Northwood long-term care home in Halifax.

There are no active cases of COVID-19 in any long-term care facilities and the Northwood outbreak is considered resolved.

There is still one person in hospital. The province says that person’s infection is considered resolved, but they still require treatment.

The confirmed cases range in age from under 10 to over 90.

Sixty-one per cent of cases are female and 39 per cent are male.

There are cases confirmed across the province, but most have been identified in the Nova Scotia Health Authority’s central zone.

The provincial government says cumulative cases by zone may change as data is updated in Panorama, the province’s electronic information system.

The numbers reflect where a person lives, and not where their sample was collected.

western zone: 54 cases

central zone: 901 cases

northern zone: 57 cases

eastern zone: 54 cases

The provincial state of emergency has been extended to July 26.

SYMPTOMS AND SELF-ISOLATION

Anyone who tests positive for COVID-19 is required to self-isolate at home, away from the public, for 14 days.

Anyone who travels to Nova Scotia from outside the Atlantic region is also required to self-isolate for 14 days and must fill out a self-declaration form online before coming to the province.

Residents of New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador are no longer required to self-isolate when travelling to Nova Scotia, but they must provide proof of their place of residency at provincial borders.

Anyone who experiences one of the following symptoms is encouraged to take an online test to determine if they should call 811 for further assessment:",[]

According to the province’s website, the number of active cases remains at one.

All zones in New Brunswick remain at the yellow level.

To date, the number of confirmed cases in the province is 166 and 163 have recovered. There have been two deaths.

Currently, there are no patients in hospital or in intensive care.

As of Sunday, public health staff have conducted 46,502 tests.

SERVICE NEW BRUNSWICK CENTRES TO REOPEN MONDAY

On Friday, the province announced Service New Brunswick centres will reopen on Monday and operate at regular hours, but the typical customer experience will likely be different.

""We are recommending that residents wait a few more days before visiting a service centre in person or do their business online or through Teleservices if they are able,"" said Service New Brunswick Minister Sherry Wilson in a statement on Friday.

Wait times at service centres could dramatically increase. The province says wait times at Service New Brunswick have traditionally averaged just under 15 minutes compared to the North American average of 44 minutes. However, due to the increased demand, lines and wait times are expected to be much bigger.

Customers who must visit a service centre in person are reminded to keep two metres of physical distance from others and have a mask with them if physical distancing cannot be maintained. The number of people allowed to wait inside air-conditioned waiting rooms will be limited in accordance with Public Health guidelines.

Anyone with a pre-booked appointment for a road or written driver’s test should identify themselves to the commissionaire.

Many of Service New Brunswick’s services can be conducted online or by calling Teleservices at 1-888-762-8600, including renewing a driver’s licence, registering a vehicle or booking a driving test. The renewal of all licences, registrations, certificates and permits has been extended to July 31, 2020, unless suspended by a court or by other authority

Investigators have not said how Harding died, but they do say they are treating her death as suspicious.

Neighbours have told CTV News that Harding had lived in the community for a long time and was a widowed mother of three adult sons.

Police returned to Lynwood Drive on Monday, where they appeared to be investigating two scenes of interest -- the woman’s home and a nearby park on Wilcot Lane, which was blocked off with police tape.

Police say the investigation is in its early stages and details are few at this time. They are working with the Nova Scotia Medical Examiner Service and say more information will be released when possible.

JOHN'S, N.L. -- Conservationists are taking issue with this year's annual catch limit regarding Newfoundland's northern cod stock, which federal scientists say is still critically depleted.

The federal Fisheries Department set the catch limit last week for northern cod at a maximum 12,350 tonnes, the same amount as 2019 when the quota was increased by 30 per cent.

Robert Rangeley, science director for advocacy group Oceana Canada, says the decision to maintain the catch limit represents ""scandalous"" fisheries management in Canada, given the current cod population and lack of a formal rebuilding plan for the species.

""It's nothing less than irresponsible,"" Rangeley said in an interview Monday.

Rangeley said the current fishing limit is not a solution to the challenges faced by the once-abundant cod population that famously collapsed in 1992, throwing thousands of people out of work and devastating fishing communities in Newfoundland.

""We all want to see this stock regrow. We need to be patient,"" he said. ""You can't fish yourself out of this kind of biological debt.""

He said federal Fisheries Minister Bernadette Jordan is not meeting her obligation to prioritize rebuilding fish populations, a duty outlined in the mandate letter issued to her by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Jordan's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Fisheries Department, known as DFO, has not yet finalized a rebuilding plan for northern cod, which Oceana Canada argues is essential for population recovery.

An audit of Canada's fisheries published by the organization last fall indicated only 18 per cent of critically depleted stocks in Canada had rebuilding plans in place.

And while conservationists are calling for a lower catch limit, the Fish, Food and Allied Workers union is arguing it should be raised.

In a statement last week, the union said the current quota is unfair to harvesters because a full stock assessment did not take place this year due to COVID-19. Union president Keith Sullivan said the province's inshore fishery has been hit hard by the pandemic and the quota is intensifying the pressure.

""A rollover for this year's quota is completely unacceptable and must be reconsidered by DFO before the season opens,"" Sullivan's statement said. He argued that the northern cod biomass has increased and a modest increase in the quota is justified.

The Newfoundland and Labrador Groundfish Industry Development Council had argued for an increased quota of 14,350 tonnes and said DFO's approach has been overly conservative.

COVID-19 restrictions prevented federal scientists from holding their annual gathering to assess fish stocks, but a ""regional science response"" meeting was held in April.

During that meeting DFO reported on the results of a fall survey of northern cod biomass, which indicated the population fell within projections from last spring, and it was determined the advice from 2019's assessment was still valid.

DFO's presentation to journalists highlighted continuing concerns from scientists about the health of the stock, which is still considered to be in the ""critical zone."" The department noted there are signs the stock's growth has stalled since 2016.

The April presentation reported evidence of limited food supply for the fish, including declining prey populations of capelin and shrimp as well as increased cannibalism among the cod. It recommends fishing remains at the ""lowest possible levels"" until the stock leaves the critical zone.

Oceana Canada had called for DFO to reinstate 2018's quota of 9,500 tonnes this year, to correct the ""harmful decision.""

Rangeley said fishing mortality is one pressure on the cod population that humans can control and said a cautious approach is necessary for the valuable stock to have a chance at a rebound.

""You can't keep killing the fish and expect the population to grow when they're heavily depleted,"" he said. ""Be patient, wait a few more years, get the house in order in terms of a rebuilding plan, and then we want to see an increase in fishing when the time is right.""

Clarence Barry White, 51, was charged last Thursday with two counts of criminal negligence causing death, and two counts of failing to keep lookout, under the Canada Shipping Act.

He has not entered pleas and is due back in Provincial Court in Georgetown, P.E.I., on Aug. 13.

A report by the Transportation Safety Board of Canada says the two boats, Forever Chasin' Tail and the Joel '98, left Beach Point, P.E.I., to haul lobster traps on June 9, 2018.

Police responded to the corner of Brunswick and Cornwallis streets in Halifax at 6:09 p.m. Sunday after receiving a report that a group of adults had been fighting with knives and bats.

Police located some people at the scene, but they weren’t injured, and no weapons were found. Officers did find blood droplets in the 2000 block of Brunswick Street, but they weren’t certain whether the blood was related to the altercation.

Forensic investigators processed the blood in case an injured person was identified or came forward.

While there’s no indication that any of the incidents are connected, residents and anti-violence advocates say the string of events is concerning.

Residents of Lynwood Drive in Dartmouth were shocked when they heard one of the neighbourhood’s oldest residents died on Saturday morning -- a death that police are investigating as suspicious.

“I'm in disbelief, can't believe it,” says one neighbour named Shelley.

“We've lived here, 24 to 25 years, and that doesn't happen in this neighbourhood,"" says another neighbour named Michelle.

""Just after 11 a.m., Halifax Regional Police responded to a call on Lynwood Drive regarding a person who had passed away,” says Halifax Regional Police Sgt. Tanya Chambers-Spriggs, recounting the incident. “Based on the scene, there are some concerns; we're just waiting for an autopsy at this time to determine the cause and manner of the death.""

Neighbours say the resident of the home was an 85-year-old woman who was a widowed mother of three adult sons. Neighbours say she lived in the community for as long as they can remember.

""I used to hang around with her youngest son every day,” says Shelley. “She was a nice woman, very nice.”

“[She was] in very good shape; she looked after her own home, she mowed her own grass,” says Michelle.

However, the 85-year-old’s suspicious death wasn’t the only call Halifax Regional Police responded to on the weekend.

Sunday morning violence

“We have had a couple of shootings,” says Chambers-Spriggs. “We do have a suspicious death and also a stabbing that we are investigating, so it has been quite busy the last 24 to 48 hours.""

Between 1 a.m. and 8 a.m. on Sunday, police responded to two shootings and a stabbing.

Shortly after 1 a.m., police were called to the Dartmouth Regional Hospital, where a 23-year-old man arrived suffering from a gunshot wound to his leg. Police say they believe the man was shot in the area of Lahey Road in Dartmouth.

A few hours later, police responded to a shooting in Halifax’s north end, where a 31-year-old man was shot. Police say they do not believe it was a random incident.

Both men remain in hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.

After 8 a.m., police were called to a Dartmouth residence after an 18-year-old man was stabbed and taken to hospital with serious injuries.

""We have a suspect description as a white male in his late teens to early 20s in a dark four-door sedan, and a black male passenger in that vehicle,"" says Chambers-Spriggs.

Community concern

Anti-violence activist Quentrel Provo says the recent increase in violent crime hits close to home.

“We're still in a pandemic and everything, but the warm weather is here, and now we're starting to see the violence rise over the past month or so,” says Provo. “It's really concerning and really frustrating. We have to figure out how to deal with this and deal with it soon.""

Provo believes the COVID-19 pandemic and the lifestyle change it has brought about could be partly to blame for the recent spike in violence, especially domestic violence. He notes violence can affect individuals from all walks of life.

""You don't have to be in the street life, or caught up in things,” says Provo. “The way society is now, violence affects all. It has no limits, no boundaries; it doesn't check your religion, race or gender -- it affects all.""

Meanwhile, as police await autopsy results and continue to investigate the elderly woman’s death, neighbours are concerned.

""I want to know what the outcome is,” says Michelle, who is considering moving away from the neighbourhood. “If the outcome is not good, this house is going to be sold – I will not come back to it.”

“She didn't deserve anything like that – if that's what happened,"" says Shelley.

If the woman’s death is deemed a homicide, it will be Halifax Regional Municipality’s sixth confirmed homicide of 2020 and the third homicide in two weeks.

Built in 1929, St. Andrew’s Catholic Church in Boisdale, N.S., is nearly a century old.

The work is expected to not only preserve the church for future generations, but also reveal its original stone design, unlocking a bit of its past.

“The best way we could figure to do that was to take the walls down and reintroduce the church to its original form on the outside so that people, when they came here, would see the church as it should be seen,” says Joe MacDonald, a member of the parish council.

MacDonald and area historian Blaine MacKinnon are part of a community-led effort to preserve the future of the church by taking it back to its past.

St. Andrew’s has been falling into disrepair in recent years. As a result, many of the exterior additions that have been introduced over the years are being stripped away, but the church still needs a lot of work, including repairs to the roof.

A GoFundMe page to help cover costs has brought in just under $3,000 and MacKinnon says many of the donations have been made by people outside Nova Scotia.

“We’ve gotten donations for this cause from right across North America,” he says.

While it’s a good start, more money is needed to complete the project, and organizers are appealing for help.

Only one church service has been held at St. Andrew’s since the COVID-19 crisis hit the Maritimes, and organizers know the pandemic has been hard on people’s pocketbooks.

Still, they are pushing on.

“As a tribute to the people who built St. Andrew’s in the early years, the people, the pioneers that were here that had a stronger faith than we’ll ever have,” says MacDonald.

As a sentimental side benefit, the project is also revealing expert stone work that had been hidden for decades, allowing parishioners of a certain age to see St. Andrew’s the way they remember it.

“It’s an original stone church and there was originally a tower on it that made it quite an edifice that could be seen from many, many miles around,” explains MacDonald.

Organizers are hoping to raise $12,000 for the project through the GoFundMe Page.",[]

With many visitors allowed to travel interprovincially, the Maritime hospitality industry says business is getting back on track, and bookings are beginning to fill up again – a sign of hope for the economy after being impacted by COVID-19.

""Since it's opened, we had more calls from locals, from Nova Scotia, P.E.I., even New Brunswick,"" says Bay Vista Lodge and Cottages manager, Saunya Leblanc, about the fortuitous increase in bookings at her New Brunswick-based business.

Cottages, hotels and Airbnb hosts have noticed a recent uptick in bookings since the Atlantic provinces opened their borders on July 3, with Maritimers exempted from self-isolating.

""It has been very good to us,"" says N.B. Airbnb host, Jay Tse. ""Since the announcement, that day, within the 24-hour span, we had about ten bookings.""

Many Maritimers are booking their weekend getaways – with the weekend of July 11 being the first weekend for visitors to have access to a pre-travel registration service to help expedite their trip.

In nearby Prince Edward Island, a new testing site for residents who are essential workers is being set up near the Confederation Bridge in Borden-Carleton.

There is also optimism in Nova Scotia, where the number of visitors to the Halifax Waterfront has been steadily increasing. Tourism operators are hopeful that they will be able to salvage some of the summer season.

""I think people do want to get out, move around, visit around, visit their friends and family,"" says Segway Nova Scotia owner, Max Rastelli. ""Halifax is probably going to be one of those spots where a lot of people are going to come to; there's still a lot to do and see here.""

Those who are travelling through the bubble say it's a nice getaway – even if their destination is only a few hours from home.

""It's better than being cooped up on the island for so long,"" says P.E.I. resident, Jennay Randall, who is visiting Halifax. ""Even though there is the caution of COVID-19 and everything, it's nice to have the opportunity to go out and meet new people.""

Many say the bubble has offered a glimmer of hope during tough times.

""There's light at the end of the tunnel,"" says Tse.

However, people in charge of booking guests from out-of-province say, while the extra tourism is appreciated, there is still a financial hit from the lack of Canadian visitors from outside of Atlantic Canada who want to visit.

""Most of our visitors are from Quebec,"" says Leblanc, who is missing the revenue from her non-Maritimer visitors. ""We do have some from Ontario.""

Meanwhile, the testing site for essential workers in P.E.I. will open on Monday at noon. Testing will be available daily from 8 a.m. until 3 p.m. Essential workers will be given direction on how to access the service as soon as they cross the Confederation Bridge and are screened.",[]

Wintersleep won three other ECMAs: Group Recording of the Year and Rock Recording of the Year for their 2019 album, ""In The Land Of,"" and Song of the Year for the song, ""Beneficiary.""

Prince Edward Island's The East Pointers won the Songwriter of the Year and Contemporary Roots Recording of the Year awards, while singer-songwriter Tim Baker, from St. John's, N.L., won Solo Recording of the Year for his album, ""Forever Overhead.""

Baker also won Folk Recording of the Year for the same album, and Video of the Year for the song, ""All Hands.""

This year's ECMAs were originally set to take place in St. John's in late April and early May, but the event was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

JOHN'S, N.L. -- Cool temperatures didn't stop hundreds of dog walkers, bikers and diners from flocking to St. John's, N.L.'s main downtown street Wednesday evening.

Friends waved to each other across Water Street and approached newly built patio decks to chat, as residents of Newfoundland and Labrador's capital basked in the product of a long-discussed vision that's been fast-tracked by city officials during the pandemic: a pedestrian-only downtown.

""The city really got this right this time. We're very happy,"" Dick Barter, co-owner of Green Door restaurant, said while working on his establishment's patio.

Barter, like other business owners on the colourful downtown strip, said he's advocated for closing the street to cars for years.

Less than a week after the July 3 launch, Barter said he's noticed an increase in business and his customers seem happy to be outside sharing a drink and a meal after staying home for months under restrictions meant to beat back the spread of COVID-19.

With one active case of the illness reported in the province, many restrictions on daily life have been lifted, and in June the capital city green-lit the pedestrian mall on Water Street to support struggling businesses reopening with new limits on capacity.

The experiment will run from July 3 until Sept. 7, closing four blocks of Water Street from noon to 10 p.m. each day, with picnic tables and other seating installed along the route.

Barter noted that businesses had just a few weeks to complete paperwork for their outdoor expansions, but he said the result has been worth it.

Water Street is one example of how cities are making quick changes to support businesses and cooped-up city dwellers in a physically-distanced world where outdoor public space is at a premium.

Cities around the world have introduced similar experiments since the pandemic began, closing some streets to cars and hastily expanding cycling routes, as Toronto mayor John Tory pledged to do in May.

In St. John's, many hope the transformation on Water Street will become an annual fixture -- including Liberal Finance Minister Tom Osborne, who has predicted tough times ahead for the province's already troubled economy.

Osborne had a front row seat to the new Water Street during his outdoor meal at The Merchant Tavern Wednesday. ""It's nice to see the economy start to take shape again,"" he said.

Osborne said he's happy with the outcome that he said resembles the bustling outdoor dining spaces he's admired in other Atlantic Canadian cities that rely heavily on tourist dollars in the summer.

""I hope it lives beyond this year because it does bring more people downtown and it's not only good for the hospitality industry but some of the shops down here may benefit as well,"" he said.

Osborne wasn't the only familiar face on the street Wednesday. Musician Alan Doyle of Great Big Sea fame was impressed by the turnout as he wandered to find a seat. ""It's fantastic, I'm glad to be down here,"" Doyle said. ""I can't believe this is the first year it happened in my lifetime.""

A handful of people were wearing face masks but most had their faces uncovered, including waiters at a number of the busy restaurants. People recognized friends and talked standing close together, but for the most part people appeared to stick to their social groups.

Kelly Whittle spent the evening on Water Street with two girlfriends. The group said it was exciting to see the downtown changed into a vacation-like destination with enough room to safely spread out.

Although it's been lauded as a success by residents and politicians, the modifications to Water Street are still being tweaked after some pointed out the changes didn't consider the needs of residents with reduced mobility.

In Facebook post shared widely this week, Lisa Walters posted 48 photos of herself outside downtown spaces she was unable to enter in her wheelchair. She wrote that the new patios and tables on the street made it more challenging for her to navigate the space.

""The glaringly obvious thing to me was how sad it was that so many businesses could build these elaborate patios overnight, and still not have small wheelchair ramps into their stores or restaurants,"" Walters wrote.

Mayor Danny Breen was one of the many people who commented on Walters' post, saying city staff would review the issues she raised. Walters said in a Facebook message that a subsequent conversation with the mayor left her ""hopeful that some changes will actually be made.""

A Friday news release from the city acknowledged room for accessibility improvements, and discussed a plan to develop a program to install ramps. ""It is important to recognize that this is just the beginning,"" Breen's statement said.

Erin Levy was supposed to be on summer vacation in Alberta, but the COVID-19 pandemic forced her to stay in Nova Scotia, where she decided to enjoy a staycation.

Levy went camping at Five Islands Provincial Park and planned a trip to the Joggins Fossil Cliffs on July 3.

The UNESCO World Heritage Site had just reopened on July 1.

“We hadn’t explored that area of the province before, so we went over there and wanted to do a day trip,” says Levy, who lives in Bedford, N.S.

After touring the Joggins Fossil Centre, Levy went for a walk near the beach.

“Up a little ways up to the right were the cliffs, so I got up next to the cliffs thinking maybe there’s cooler things there, and this was honestly just lying in the sand,” says Levy of her find. “So I pulled it out a little bit and saw the two sets of tracks and thought it was really neat.”

Levy soon discovered that “neat” was an understatement for her discovery, which turned out to be a 310-million-year-old fossil.

It dates back to a snapshot in time when Joggins was part of Pangaea, 100 million years before dinosaurs roamed the earth.

“These are fossilized footprints of two different animals,” explains Melissa Grey, curator at the Joggins Fossil Centre.

“One’s an amphibian creature and one’s a millipede, so two very different animals, which is really unusual and, not only that, they are both really beautifully preserved.”

“They were very excited about it,” says Levy. “They identified the tracks in a heartbeat and said it was interesting because the tracks were much smaller than what they were used to seeing for that kind of creature.”

Stunning find by a visitor to @JogginsFossils last week! Two sets of trackways - can you see both of them? One (one right) is from a large millipede and the other (left) is from an amphibian. This will be going into our Collection for future study! pic.twitter.com/NWXEWMjtxD — Dr. Melissa Grey (@CuratorGrey) July 6, 2020

The fossil has captured the attention of experts across the province. It will be researched and may go on display at the Joggins Fossil Centre, but Levy will always be part of its history.

“Erin the fossil finder will go down as the collector, so her name will forever be associated with that find,” says Grey.

Both Levy and Grey say they hope the discovery will encourage more people to explore Joggins and other historic sites in Nova Scotia.

“You do not have to be an expert or a trained paleontologist to find fossils at Joggins,” says Grey. “There’s so many. You actually can’t help but step on them.”

“This was amazing,” says Levy. “We have a ton of history that’s a bit unexplored, so I’m hoping it will just bring more people here to spend a bit more time in Nova Scotia and realize what we have to offer.”",[]

The Cliffs of Fundy in Nova Scotia and the Discovery Geopark in eastern Newfoundland were both designated UNESCO Global Geoparks Friday by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.

UNESCO says global geoparks are places that offer visitors a glimpse of exceptional geological heritage.

The Cliffs of Fundy Geopark stretches 125 kilometres, from Debert, N.S., to the Three Sisters cliffs past Eatonville, N.S. -- and out to Isle Haute in the Bay of Fundy.

""We have about 40 different geosites along that location. It's not a one-stop shop. You can spend many days visiting our different sites,"" manager Beth Peterkin said.

The site is well known for having the world's highest tides, Canada's oldest dinosaur fossils and stunning landscapes steeped in Mi'kmaq and Acadian legends.

""We are the site where the Pangaea continent split apart 200 million years ago. You can see where the rocks split apart. You can see the different types of rocks. You can see the cliffs, and the clam flats, and the shores,"" Peterkin said.

""At low tide you can walk out on the floor of the Bay of Fundy for a mile or more in many places, but watch the tide, because in six hours and 13 minutes it's going to be 50 feet higher up the shore,"" she said.

Peterkin and others have been working to get the UNESCO designation for the last five years.

Meanwhile staff at the Discovery Geopark, located on the upper half of Newfoundland's Bonavista Peninsula, have been working for the past 13 years to get their designation.

The park contains some of the earliest fossils of animal life, with rock dating back more than a half-billion years.

""You can see really unique geology that is of national and international significance,"" said John Norman, chairman of Discovery Geopark.

""There are some of the oldest complex life fossils on the planet,"" he said.

Many of the fossils are still in place in the rocks, while others have been removed for display in the provincial museum, The Rooms, in St. John's.

The Discovery Geopark now has 10 sites with interpretation, trails and other infrastructure.

""We have dozens of other sites within our geosites inventory that aren't yet showcased to the public,"" Norman said. ""Some of them will never be. Some of them are for research. Some of them are for academic only and others will be showcased to the public as more infrastructure is added.""

There are now 163 global geoparks in 44 countries, and Peterkin said being part of that group provides important exposure.

""People who travel to one geopark will soon learn about the next geopark. We'll be able to reach visitors that we were never able to reach on our own,"" she said.

Norman said the designation puts them on the world stage, especially in Asia and Europe where geoparks are popular.

Cliffs of Fundy and Discovery join three other UNESCO Global Geoparks in Canada: Stonehammer in New Brunswick, Perce in Quebec and Tumbler Ridge in British Columbia.

""It's incredibly tough, because I've essentially spent the last four months in isolation, at work and then at home,"" said oilfield worker Adam Wiseman. ""It's really no life.""

Wiseman lives in Glace Bay, but travels to Alberta for work. He's there for 10 days, and then home for 10, but with COVID-19, any time spent at home is in isolation because of the 14-day rule.

""I had to go home and try to explain to my three children at home, that don't get too close to daddy,"" Wiseman said. ""How do you explain to three children that there's a global pandemic?""

With the Atlantic bubble, and easing of restrictions, most people are getting to see family and friends.

Wiseman wants the government to test workers as soon as they arrive home and says he's tried to address his concerns with his local MLA, but there's been no response.

""Why are we not able to be tested when we come home from work,"" Wiseman said. ""If we're able to be tested, then we can isolate while waiting for results. If it comes back positive then we quarantine, and if the test comes back negative, I don't see why we can't follow public health protocols like the rest of the population.""

According to an email from the province, workers who are asymptomatic, with low risk of exposure because of the settings they have been in and their adherence to public health measures, can have contact with other people in their household, but must not leave the home or property.

When results are negative, the province says it does not guarantee a person won't become positive the next day or within the next 14 days.

""It just seems like we've been forgotten about,"" Wiseman said. ""While they try to progress the economy and let people into the province with the Atlantic bubble, we haven't been addressed.""

It's a frustrating feeling for workers providing for their families during uncertain times.",[]

Cormier has been trying to make up for the loss of live concerts, with a roster of online performances.

But he says the lack of high-speed internet in his area, something he has called ""dismal,"" is making it increasingly difficult to keep up with the rest of the connected world.

He recently invested in the extra cost of an LTE hub, which turns cell signal into Wi-Fi to try to beef up his sluggish internet service. That service normally provides him with upload speeds well below the federal CRTC minimum standard of 10 Mbps.

But his LTE hub can only get a good signal while balanced precariously on the railing on the front deck of his studio.

""So when the weather changes,"" Cormier says, ""We're done; no more internet.""

His frustration has led Cormier to become a representative plaintiff in an intended proposed class-action lawsuit against the municipality of Halifax, the province of Nova Scotia, and Develop Nova Scotia. Develop Nova Scotia is the Crown corporation tasked with the job of getting the province's rural internet up to speed, with a $193 million budget to get the job done.

""And when Develop Nova Scotia is touting a certain level and not delivering,"" says Cormier, ""and still spending the money anyway, that's not acceptable.""

Cormier's lawyer, Rob Pineo of Patterson Law, has served the intended defendants with the 60-day notice required before the proposed lawsuit is filed in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in an application to be certified.

With the matter before the courts, none of the intended defendants would comment on the proposed lawsuit.

But a spokesperson with Develop Nova Scotia did respond in an email to overall concerns about high-speed internet service in rural areas.

""Our ISP partners are moving as fast as they can to build these new networks,"" writes Develop NS marketing and communications manager Deborah Page. ""We recognize it can't come soon enough, but we are working hard to make it happen as quickly as possible.""

Cormier takes issue with the performance of some of those internet service providers so far.

""The mandate (of Develop Nova Scotia) says all of those partners have to be vetted (to be) providing a 50 (Mbps) down, 10 (Mbps) up service,"" says Cormier. ""Twelve of those companies have never provided that type of service, ever.""

Page says Cormier's community, Cooks Brook, is on the list for improvements, with an update to come next month after a second round of proposals to address underserved communities.

Cormier says the province has already been far too slow to provide high-speed internet to those whose livelihoods depend on it, now more than ever.",[]

The majority of Ontario's 34 local public health unit regions will move forward to Stage 3 on July 17, the province announced on Monday.

Health units in the Greater Toronto Area, along with a few others like Niagara and Windsor, are not included on the list of regions moving forward to Stage 3. The regions excluded from the list will remain in Stage 2 of the restart phase until further notice.

""We will keep working until every part of this province gets to Stage 3,"" Premier Doug Ford said Monday. ""My friends, this is great news. We are moving forward as a province but we can't stop, we won't stop until we get every worker in Ontario back to work and back on their feet.""

For the regions moving forward to Stage 3, there will be a significant increase to social gathering limits.

Indoor gathering limits will increase from 10 to a maximum of 50 people, while outdoor gathering limits will increase to a maximum of 100 people.

Physical distancing is still required during any gathering with people from outside an individual's social circle. The province is not increasing the number of people a person can gather with without physical distancing measures in place.

The government is also banning a number of high-risk businesses and activities from resuming in Stage 3, including amusement parks, water parks, buffet-style food services, dancing in restaurants and bars, overnight stays at camps for children, private karaoke rooms, prolonged or deliberate contact while playing sports, saunas, steam rooms, bath houses and oxygen bars.

Casinos will be allowed to reopen but table games are banned.

All restaurants, bars, concession stands, and other food and drink establishments are allowed to reopen for indoor dining in Stage 3. Nightclubs are still banned from reopening, except for the purpose of serving food or drinks.

Gyms and fitness studios can also reopen with safety protocols in place. Organized sports can also resume, with the exception of contact sports.

Playgrounds, community centres and libraries will also reopen.

The province will also allow personal support services to resume that involve a customers' face, such as facials and some piercings.

""All other businesses and public spaces will be permitted to be open, subject to ensuring the appropriate health and safety measures are in place, as well as limits on gathering sizes,"" the government said.

The government said that as more businesses and activities reopen, COVID-19 trends will be monitored closely and restrictions can be “further loosened, or if they need to be tightened.”

People are still being asked to work remotely ""as much as possible,"" the government said.

Health Minister Christine Elliott said that Ontario will remain in Stage 3 for the ""foreseeable future.""

""Certainly we are all hoping there will be a vaccine in short order but apart from that we will remain in Stage 3,"" she said. ""But depending on how Stage 3 moves forward in different parts of the province, if we keep our numbers down, if there are no new outbreaks of COVID-19, then we will be able to gradually expand things like the size of gatherings for example.""

""That will be a gradual loosening of the health restrictions, still within Stage 3.""

Ontario also extended the province's state of emergency on Monday until July 24.

When will the Toronto area move to Stage 3?

Elliott said that the province needs more COVID-19 data from the regions who are not heading into Stage 3 before a decision can be made about moving forward.

""There are several other communities that moved into Stage 2 before Toronto did. We expect that will happen in the same way because the chief medical officer of health and the public health experts need to see about four weeks of data to understand what is going on locally, to make sure there are no further public health concerns,"" Elliott said.

""We expect that the next group will be the second group that moved to Stage 2 will be the second group to move to Stage 3 just because of the time frames that have elapsed and then Toronto will follow.""

Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr. David Williams, said he hopes all regions will enter Stage 3 by the end of July.

This comes as Trudeau spoke to U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday morning, though the border was not among the range of topics the prime minister said the two world leaders discussed — despite the looming July 21 deadline.

""Every month we have been able to extend the border closures to all but essential goods and services and those discussions are ongoing with the United States right now as we are a week from the next deadline for closures,"" Trudeau said.

""We're going to continue to work hard to keep Canadians safe and to keep our economies flowing, we will have more to say later this week I'm sure.""

Canada has been under renewed pressure to reopen the shared border, despite surging COVID-19 case numbers in the United States. At the end of June, the U.S. became home to the world’s highest number of reported infections: more than 2.2 million. That number has since soared to more than 3.3 million, according to the New York Times, with more than 134,000 deaths.

Despite these figures, 29 bipartisan members of U.S. Congress penned an open letter to Public Safety Minister Bill Blair calling on the Canadian government to plan a phased reopening of the Canada-U.S. border and to consider easing existing measures.

""We are asking that the United States and Canada immediately craft a comprehensive framework for phased reopening of the border based on objective metrics and accounting for the varied circumstances across border regions,"" read the letter, which was published on Western New York Congressman Brian Higgins' website on July 3.

The members of Congress, who represent the northern states along the border, also implored the Canadian government to consider easing restrictions on family members and property owners impeded by the restrictions.

The Canadian government pushed back on the request, with Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland's office telling CTVNews.ca in a statement that the health and safety of Canadians is ""absolutely priority.""

""Decisions about Canada's border are made by Canadians, for Canadians,"" Freeland's spokesperson Katherine Cuplinskas said in the statement on Friday.

The suggestion was also unpopular with non-politician Canadians, who took to social media to express their staunch opposition.

In response to a tweet from Higgins, who had shared the open letter on his Twitter account, hundreds of Canadians slammed the suggestion.

""No thank you...clean up your backyard before you attempt to enter ours..sincerely Canada,"" wrote a user who goes by the name @MichelletypoQ.

Another user, @rachelinTO, wrote that ""most of our earliest cases came from the U.S. So......that's a firm 'no'. Sorry, eh.""

Users called the request ""disastrous"" and multiple accounts said they’d only be comfortable easing restrictions after seeing improvement in the number of COVID-19 cases in the U.S.

TRUMP, TRUDEAU DISCUSS TARIFF THREAT

While Trudeau did not give any indication in his press conference that he and Trump had touched on the border issue during their phone call on Monday, he did confirm that the two discussed a host of other issues — including China and the two detained Canadians, the Black Lives Matter movement, and the U.S. president’s renewed aluminium tariff threat.

""I impressed upon him that it would be a shame to see tariffs come in between our two countries at a time where we’re celebrating NAFTA , and at a time where we want our businesses and our manufacturers to get going as quickly as possible,"" Trudeau said.

""We pledged to keep working on it together.""

Trudeau also said he told Trump that the pandemic had disrupted the usual supply chains and manufacturing processes, but that this disruption is slowly subsiding.

""That is starting to realign itself, given the economies are starting up again and manufacturing is getting going,"" Trudeau said.

CTV News confirmed the possibility of the U.S. slapping another set of tariffs on Canada at the end of June. The tariffs would fall under Section 232 of the U.S. Trade Expansion Act, and the threat comes amid U.S. claims that their aluminum market is being flooded by Canadian product.

Two Canadian sources told CTV News at the time that the announcement is possible in the coming weeks, though to date no formal announcement of tariffs has transpired.

Should the U.S. decide to re-impose tariffs on Canada, it would reopen a trade rift between the two countries that had been healing since a spat just over a year ago, that saw the U.S. impose tariffs on steel and aluminum and Canada answer with tariffs on a wide array of U.S. products including quiche, mayonnaise, and toilet paper.

Trudeau has been outspoken in his defence of Canada's aluminum industry, noting when the possibility of the U.S. imposing new tariffs emerged recently, that the U.S. ""needs Canadian aluminum"" and would only be hurting its own economy.

""Our economies are so interlinked that punitive actions by the United States administration end up hurting Americans the same way they end up hurting Canadians,"" Trudeau said at the time.",[]
107,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/who-s-hiring-a-look-at-the-canadian-job-market-1.5022260?autoPlay=true,Where the jobs are: Some sectors rebounding faster as Canada emerges from lockdown,['Ryan Flanagan'],2020-07-13 14:39:00-04:00,"TORONTO -- Jobs lost during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic are coming back – but not all at once, and not in the same order they disappeared.

Statistics Canada reported July 10 that more than 950,000 jobs were added in the country in June. While only a small fraction of the three million or so positions that were lost as lockdowns were imposed in March and April, the number represents a record increase as those measures are lifted.

""There's a lot of places that are still hiring amidst all the doom and gloom that we've been experiencing over the past few months,"" Carolyn Levy, president of the technologies division of staffing and recruitment agency Randstad Canada, told CTVNews.ca on Monday via telephone from Calgary.

Breaking down the numbers by industry yields clues into where the first wave of rebound hiring is taking place. More than 20 per cent of the added jobs were classified as wholesale and retail trade – with 16 per cent in accommodation and food services, 12 per cent in health care and social assistance, and eight per cent apiece in construction and manufacturing.

This suggests that the retail and restaurant workers who were among the first to be let go when their establishments were ordered to close were also among the first to be hired back when limited activity was allowed to resume.

There is still a long way to go before those sectors can be back to normal, though. In food services alone, it is believed that 400,000 Canadian jobs eliminated during the pandemic have yet to return. Many businesses in the broader service sector say they do not expect to ever return to pre-pandemic staffing levels.

Also notable, StatCan found, is that there were more wholesale jobs in Canada in June than there were in February, before the pandemic hit. Levy chalked this increase up to the surge in online shopping, which has left companies needing extra staff in warehouses and other parts of the supply chain.

On manufacturing, Levy said the increase could be due to companies retooling their lines to produce personal protective equipment or other items suddenly in demand due to the pandemic.

EMPLOYERS RETHINKING OLD ROLES

For the nearly 2.5 million Canadians who remain unemployed, though, knowing where hiring has recently happened only paints part of the picture. More helpful is information about where hiring is happening now.

According to the federal government's job bank, the most in-demand jobs right now are sales associates, administrative assistants and customer service representatives, followed by truck drivers, general farm workers and light-duty cleaners.

A popular website used by job-seekers to connect with employers is seeing similar patterns. Brendon Bernard, an economist with the Indeed Hiring Lab, wrote July 7 that retail and customer service jobs are among those that saw the biggest drop in new postings on Indeed earlier in the pandemic, and have since seen some of the biggest rebounds.

""Sectors narrowing the gap relatively quickly in recent weeks include ones featuring lower-paying positions, like retail, and customer service,"" he wrote.

""Areas posting roles with many mid-wage jobs have also seen noticeable bounce-backs, like construction, as well as education and instruction.""

Levy said that some employers are also creating new roles as they look to respond to their customers' needs during and after the pandemic. Opportunities created by this include more positions for financial advisers, she said, as well as an even greater demand for tech workers.

Postings on Indeed for higher-paying jobs have been slower to bounce back, Bernard said. Indeed has tracked two categories where new job postings have fallen off since early May – security and public safety, and aviation.

Bernard reported that the number of new job postings on Indeed as of July 3 was 21 per cent lower than it had been one year earlier. That gap had been as large as 70 per cent in mid-April. Smaller provinces, which have generally been less affected by COVID-19, have kept job posting levels closer to where they were in 2019 than larger provinces.

Levy said she is seeing employers increasingly show interest in hiring for temporary contract positions. This benefits them because it allows them to avoid making long-term commitments in an uncertain environment, she said, but can also be good for those looking for jobs because it gives them a chance to find work that they might not otherwise have.

""Companies have had to take a step back and start to reimagine how they have to work in this new normal,"" she said.

""Businesses have to look at what do we need to do to reskill, what do we need to do to retrain, given the way we operated our business four months ago is not the way it's going to be … from now on.""",[]

Health Canada announced May 16 that it had approved Ad5-nCoV for human trials in Canada, to be carried out by the Canadian Center for Vaccinology (CCV) at Dalhousie University in Halifax.

Human trials of the vaccine candidate are further along in China, with results promising enough that the Chinese government has approved it for use in its military.

Dr. Scott Halperin, the CCV's director, said in May that the tests would be carried out ""in a more accelerated fashion"" than the usual process, which can take five years or more. He told The Canadian Press that he expected the first phase of the trial to get underway within about three weeks.

Nearly two months later, though, not a single Canadian has been given Ad5-nCoV – because, as was first reported by iPolitics, not a single shipment of the vaccine candidate has arrived in the country.

A spokesman for Health Canada told CTVNews.ca on Monday that Chinese authorities have yet to sign off on sending the potential vaccine here.

""The vaccine candidate for Phase 1 clinical trials has not yet been approved by Chinese customs for shipment to Canada,"" Andre Gagnon said in a statement.

""Once the Canadian Center for Vaccinology receives the vaccine candidate it will start the clinical trial for CanSino, under the regulatory supervision of Health Canada.""

CanSino Biologics, the biopharmaceutical company that developed the Ad5-nCoV along with Chinese government scientists, did not respond to a request for comment before this story was published.

In a statement to CTVNews.ca, a spokesman for Innovation, Science and Industry Minister Navdeep Bains described Ad5-nCoV as ""one of the leading candidate vaccines against COVID-19 in the world"" and said an arrangement is in place that will allow it to be manufactured in Canada ""for emergency pandemic use"" if it is approved for distribution by Health Canada.

The government announced in May that it was planning a $44-million upgrade to a National Research Council of Canada facility in Montreal to prepare for the possibility of a large-scale Ad5-nCoV manufacturing effort.",[]

The body was discovered five days after the 33-year-old Rivera disappeared on Lake Piru, where her son was found July 8 alone a few hours later on a boat the two had rented, the Ventura County Sheriff's Office said.

Authorities would not immediately say if the person found was Rivera, but said the day after she disappeared that they believed she drowned in the lake northwest of Los Angeles. A 2 p.m. press conference was scheduled.

Search crews found the body floating in the northeast area of the lake, authorities said. The body would be flown 40 miles (64 kilometres) to the coroner's office in Ventura, Sheriff's Capt. Eric Buschow said. Rivera's family has been notified of the discovery.

The lake an hour's drive from Los Angeles was searched by dozens of divers working in waters with little visibility, with help from sonar and robotic devices combing the bottom and helicopters and drones searching above.

“I can't imagine what it's like for her parents, her family,” Buschow said. “It takes an emotional toll on the search teams too.”

Rivera played singing cheerleader Santana Lopez for six seasons on the Fox musical-comedy “Glee.”

If she is declared dead, she will become the third major cast member from the show to die in their 30s.

Cory Monteith, one of the show's leads, died at 31 in 2013 from a toxic mix of alcohol and heroin.

And co-star Mark Salling, who Rivera dated at one point, killed himself in 2018 at age 35 after pleading guilty to child pornography charges.

Rivera had experience boating on the lake in Los Padres National Forest, authorities said.

Surveillance video shows Rivera and her son, Josey Hollis Dorsey, leaving on the rented boat.

When the boat failed to return, its vendor found the vessel drifting in the northern end of the lake late Wednesday afternoon with the boy asleep on board. He told investigators that he and his mother had been swimming and he got back into the boat but she didn't, according to a sheriff's office statement.

The boy was wearing a life vest, and another life jacket was found in the boat along with Rivera's purse and identification.

Rivera is believed to have drowned “in what appears to be a tragic accident,” the statement said.

The boy, Rivera's son from her marriage to actor Ryan Dorsey, was safe and healthy and with family members, authorities said. The couple finalized their divorce in June 2018 after nearly four years of marriage.

The most recent tweet on Rivera's account, from July 7, read “just the two of us” along with a photo of her and her son.

The IWK Telethon for Children, which airs on CTV Atlantic every year, is one of the many charity events impacted by the virus.

“The IWK Telethon is a tradition that has brought Maritimers together for the past 35 years and symbolizes the true spirit of our community. We have always been there for each other united in our connection to the IWK,” says Jennifer Gillivan, the president and CEO of the IWK Foundation.

The telethon, which was scheduled to air on June 6 and June 7, will not go ahead as planned this year.

“We are sad that we can’t go ahead with the broadcast, but we are committed to bring content, as much as we can, using innovative ways to reach our community. We’re forever grateful to our community because they’ve always stayed with us. We’ve been in this relationship for over 35 years with our Maritime community, who in fact have built the IWK,” says Gillivan.

“We know some people are suffering and we would never expect them to do anything other than take care of their selves, and they are in our thoughts, but for those who can continue to support us, we hope they will.”

Much of the fundraising for the telethon has already taken place. Those donations will go towards priority equipment.

“The pandemic is happening and that just heightens and intensifies what’s already happening at the IWK,” says Gillivan.

“Kids can’t wait. They are already there. The sickest of the sick are there and then there is the heightened piece now, with the potential for infection during the pandemic. So the hospital still needs the equipment, they still need the beds, they still need the priority pieces that we fundraise for year-round. Probably now more than ever, they need that support.”

Gillivan says the IWK Foundation is committed to finding ways to celebrate donors and share the stories of patients and care teams at the IWK.

“Thank you to our broadcast partner CTV. Thank you to our many loyal donors who fundraise year-round for the IWK and thank you to our incredible telethon volunteer committees across the Maritimes,” says Gillivan.

“We applaud your unwavering commitment to the IWK. Stay healthy, safe and support each other.”

In a brief statement, Dr. Heather Morrison said the Queens County woman is self-isolating at home and contact tracing is underway.

Morrison said the new case is not believed to be linked to a recent COVID-19 cluster in P.E.I. or to a Charlottetown seniors' residence where a worker had tested positive.

On July 4, the P.E.I. government had announced three confirmed COVID-19 cases, including a woman in her 20s who worked at Whisperwood Villa. They were the first cases in the province since late April.

The woman was believed to have been in contact with a man in his 20s who tested positive for COVID-19 after returning to the island from Nova Scotia.

Two other P.E.I. residents later tested positive for COVID-19 after coming into contact with that same man, public health officials said.

On Friday, Morrison said 129 residents and 140 staff members of Whisperwood Villa, as well as anyone who visited the facility on June 30, had completed two rounds of testing for COVID-19, and all the tests came back negative.

Morrison is expected to provide more information about the new COVID-19 case later Sunday or Monday morning.

In a statement, Quebec said residents must now complete online registration forms to be able to travel through Atlantic Canada to reach the Quebec islands in the Gulf of St. Lawrence.

Quebec said the request came at the behest of New Brunswick and P.E.I. and that the registration procedures apply to all travellers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

""The two provinces have made this request to apply the same requirements or formalities to everyone wishing to travel in their territories,"" the statement said.

Some Quebec politicians were angered last month when New Brunswick said Quebecers could not stay overnight on their way to the Iles-de-la-Madeleine.

Quebecers travelling to the islands by car need to go through New Brunswick to catch a ferry from Souris, P.E.I., a drive of at least 500 kilometres from the Quebec border.

""Considering the pandemic, the Quebec government and the two provinces concerned agreed on access to the ferry to the Iles-de-la-Madeleine and the requisite safe health-related measures,"" the statement read.

Quebec also said residents must continue to meet other requirements to travel over land to the Iles-de-la-Madeleine during the pandemic.

Quebecers must fill out and carry a Quebec self-declaration card outlining their trip, the government said, as well as other documents, including a return ferry ticket, proof of address in the Iles-de-la-Madeleine, or a tourist accommodation reservation.

New Brunswick, P.E.I., Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador launched an Atlantic bubble on July 3, allowing residents to travel in the region without needing to self-isolate.

But travel restrictions remain in place for most people from outside the Atlantic provinces to prevent the potential spread of COVID-19.

Quebec has been Canada's COVID-19 epicentre, recording more than half of all cases and deaths in the country to date.

The province has gradually reopened as the number of daily cases and deaths decreased, however.

Quebec reported 114 new COVID-19 infections on Sunday for a total of 56,521 since the pandemic began, as well as seven more deaths for a total of 5,627.

HALIFAX -- The family of a woman facing criminal charges after a video posted online showed a dog being swung by its leash in an apparent altercation, has released a statement on her behalf.

Police say it started after women in one vehicle confronted women in another vehicle about being cut-off near a drive-through cold beer store in Dartmouth.

Twenty-seven year old Clarissa Crawley is charged with assault with a weapon and willfully causing unnecessary suffering to an animal in the incident, which happened on Canada Day.

Crawley was arrested by Halifax Regional Police on Wednesday and has been released on conditions to appear in court in August.

The Crawley family has provided a statement to CTV News, saying it ""is in response to the flurry of wrong information to the public, and damaging racially charged hate circulating on social media and elsewhere.""

The statement goes on to say ""the owner of the dog was driving in the other lane in an attempt to cut in front of Clarissa … the person recording (the video) did not catch the beginning nor the end of the incident, which would have captured racial slurs, including the n-word, being hurled at Clarissa.""

""The use of the n-word, especially in these racially charged times, is categorically and unmistakably meant to incite a negative or violent reaction. As the argument ensued, one of the women ripped Clarissa’s necklace from her neck and the other woman put it in her purse. The women continued with the verbal assaults, a physical altercation, and still a refusal to return the necklace.""

According to the statement, Crawley retrieved the puppy in an attempt to get the women to return her property.

""The situation escalated quickly as the woman threatened Clarissa and ran toward her. She was unsure at that point if the woman had taken anything from her car as a weapon, and without thinking, used the dog as a shield in the heat of the moment. It does not make the action acceptable, and Clarissa has continually expressed deep remorse over the dog’s safety, and never intended any harm to come to the dog. She also expressed immediate remorse for how the situation between them had escalated so quickly.""

For her part, Brittany McGuire, the owner of the dog, says she was in the line of cars for over an hour and a half and that Crawley cut her off.

She also says she never used the n-word or any racial slur. She says she has black family members, including a black father-in-law.

""Race has nothing to do with this and it’s a shame that’s what they’re trying to turn this into,"" McGuire said.

When asked about the alleged physical altercation – including having the necklace ripped off the other woman, McGuire said ""when (Crawley) reached into my passenger side window and assaulted my passenger, during that altercation her necklace was ripped off. I was trying to look for it to throw it out the window so we could leave the scene. In fact, I gave her full access to my car to look for her necklace … and she found it, wrapped around (the base of) the steering wheel.""

As the incident escalated, McGuire says ""of course when somebody takes your animal out of the car you’re going to go after them and at that point all I was screaming was 'give me back my dog, don’t take my dog,' and I was screaming for people to help me. Her life was not being threatened and the only life that was being threatened at that time was my dog's.""

McGuire says she did call Crawley a ""psycho bitch"" after her dog was allegedly taken. She repeatedly denies using any racial slurs.

McGuire also says that she believes the threats and racism Crawley and her family have received on social media is ""absolutely unacceptable.""

She says she just wants justice. She also says her dog will be taking puppy classes to help with the trauma of this incident.

Halifax police say they are investigating this incident in its totality. They continue to ask anyone who saw what happened to come forward with any information they can provide.

“Let me be clear, I want to see every child in Ontario back to school, full-time, this September,” Ford said on Monday. “This is what we’re working towards with the support of our medical officer of health and our local school boards, and I’m confident that we will get there.”

The news comes as Ford announced on Monday that nearly all of Ontario, with the exception of the Toronto-area and a few other regions, will move into Stage 3 of the province’s regional reopening plan by the end of the week.

Ford acknowledges that the plan is not without risk and says his government will “continue planning for every possible scenario” to keep kids safe as they get back to school.

In June, the Ontario government released three potential plans for how schools will operate in September.

These include students returning to in-person instruction while adhering to public health measures, continue using remote learning strengthened by live instruction, or take part in a blending of the first two options that will see students attend school on alternative days or weeks.

""We need to be prepared for all eventualities and adopt a prudent flexibility for whatever path the outbreak takes,"" Education Minister Stephen Lecce said. ""This has not changed. As the public health data has improved over the past several weeks, we've been working closely with medical experts to enable conventional daily delivery in September.""

Publically-funded schools in Ontario closed after March Break as new COVID-19 infections surged in the province. The government originally set up online learning tools to keep students engaged during the time off, but decided to close schools for the rest of the year in mid-May.

Lecce said he would have more to say about the plan to return students to school ""soon.""

Ontario child care centres to increase capacity

At the same news conference, Ford’s government also announced that Ontario child care centres would be increasing capacity later this month.

“A key part of getting people back to work is making sure parents and workers have the child care support they need,” Ford said.

As a result, the Ontario government said child care centres in the province will be able to operate in increased cohorts of 15 children, up from the current maximum of 10 children, as of July 27 with health and safety measures in place.

Minister Lecce says the changes will allow the sector to reach “approximately 90 per cent of the capacity that existed pre-COVID.""

""Make no mistake, when it comes to your kid's safety, we will do whatever it takes,"" Lecce said.

Last month, all child care centres in Ontario were allowed to reopen with limited capacity and enhanced cleaning protocols.

Right now, all child care centres operating in Ontario must also have a COVID-19 response plan in place if a child, parent or staff member is exposed to the virus.

Calgary is considering joining other major Canadian cities — including Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal — in making masks mandatory in public indoor places. Mayor Naheed Nenshi says the city could implement a bylaw to do so within a week if Calgarians aren’t willing to take matters into their own hands and help prevent a second wave of infections.

Is Alberta prepared for a second wave of infections?

The Alberta government is holding a review of its COVID-19 response to investigate whether the province is adequately prepared to deal with a potential second wave of the virus.

The province has opened a request for proposal to organizations to conduct a third-party review of the government’s handling of the crisis that explore the health system response, economic response, governance and decision-making, procurement, engagement with other governments and stakeholders and communications.

The government wants to see results of the review by the fall, which is when a number of experts believe a second wave could hit to coincide with the annual flu season.

""It’s certainly possible it could happen sooner than the fall depending on behaviors and depending on how people are interacting and taking all of these protective measures into consideration,"" said Dr. Vanessa Meier-Stephenson, an infectious disease expert at the University of Calgary. ""It’s not just the temperatures that are prompting increased infectivity, it’s behaviours as we open more things up, as we have more spaces where people are congregating it puts more people at risk in that sense.""

Masks are not mandatory, but Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Deena Hinshaw ""strongly"" recommends them when physical distancing isn't possible.

""When used properly, masks can protect others and help limit the spread of COVID-19,"" she said.

The bodies of Norah and Romy Carpentier, aged 11 and 6, were located in a wooded area in St-Apollinaire, Que., but Martin Carpentier, who is suspected of abducting the girls, remains missing.

Provincial police said the focus of their manhunt was an area near where the girls' bodies were found on the weekend and where police found ""pertinent elements"" on Sunday.

""The elements that we possess lead us to think Martin Carpentier could still be around the area, or at least be in transit in that area,"" said Sgt. Ann Mathieu, a Quebec provincial police spokeswoman.

Police did not specify what the items were, but as the search entered a fifth day, police raised the possibility Carpentier could be unconscious or dead, given the weather conditions and the potential he was injured from a car crash right before his disappearance.

""We can't rule out the fact that he could be dead,"" Mathieu said. ""But also, he's a suspect in our case, so it's important for us to find Martin Carpentier, because the key to this event is Martin Carpentier.""

Police deployed a helicopter, a drone and police dogs as needed in the search.

The girls were last seen Wednesday and became the subject of an Amber Alert the next day. Police have said the girls and their father are believed to have been in a serious traffic accident on Highway 20 in St-Apollinaire on Wednesday evening about 9:30 p.m.

Investigators said the car was heading east when it skidded into the median, flipped over and landed on the shoulder on the opposite side of the highway. But police did not find any occupants inside the car when they arrived.

On Sunday, the manhunt for the 44-year-old Carpentier had authorities tightening the search in a thickly wooded area near where the young sisters from Levis, Que., were found.

Residents had helped with the searches until Saturday, but police asked people to stay away from the area Sunday to let officers work.

The case has gripped the attention of the province, especially in the town of just over 6,000 people where it's playing out and in the family's hometown of Levis, Que., across the St. Lawrence River from the provincial capital.

The oldest of the sisters, Norah, was a member of a local chapter of the Association de Scouts du Canada -- which primarily serves the French-speaking scouting community across the country.

Dominique Moncalis, a spokeswoman for the Association de Scouts du Canada, said Martin Carpentier had been a leader with the 128th Groupe Scout de Charny since last September.

It was a brief role, cut short when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the suspension of all activities in mid-March.

She said two leaders from the group have established a makeshift memorial inside a small gazebo in an area park, holding a vigil for Romy and Norah on Saturday night and again Sunday morning.

Stuffed animals, flowers and notes of condolence have filled the gazebo, Moncalis said.

Quebec Premier Francois Legault began a Montreal news conference on Monday by offering condolences to the family of the young victims.

""I'm shocked, and I believe all Quebecers are shocked like me,"" Legault said adding police will do everything they can to find the father.

Legault also urged anyone who sees family members in difficulty or distress to get help, giving out a number for a parent help line.

""If you have trouble, if you don't feel (in) control or if you see somebody close to you not being in control, having difficulties, you don't need to be shy,"" he said.

""You have to do something when you see that you're in trouble before doing something terrible.""

The province is leaving it up to merchants and owners of other indoor public spaces to enforce the wearing of masks in their establishments; those who don’t apply it could face fines ranging from $400 to $6,000.



Closed public places include restaurants, but Legault noted that customers will obviously be able to take off their face covers to eat.

""We wear a mask when we are on the move. Once seated, and you are two metres from other people, you can take off your mask. However, when you get up to go to the bathroom or leave the restaurant, you are going to put on your mask, '' he said.

The rule will apply to people age 12 and older, with exceptions for people with specific medical conditions.

""We're not going to ask people to walk around with a medical certificate,"" said Quebec's director of public health Horacio Arruda, specifying that typically it would be people with severe cardiac or respiratory illnesses, adding that it's up to people's judgment. ""It's not because you have a bit of asthma that you can't wear a mask.""

The premier reminded people that gatherings of more than 10 people in homes or yards remains prohibited.



Following a number of outbreaks stemming from bars in the Montreal area and beyond in recent days, Health Minister Christian Dube had a special message to bars.

""We'll monitor very closely, especially with bars,"" saidDube. ""If we see bar owners not applying the rules, we will have to act accordingly… but we need to give them the benefit of the doubt.""

On Monday, masks became mandatory on public transit across Quebec.

The City of Montreal, among other municipalities, had already been planning to make masks mandatory in public indoor spaces as of July 27.

The Montreal suburb of Cote-St-Luc had already made masks mandatory indoors early last month.

All eastern Ontario health units, including Ottawa, are included in this list.

In Stage 3, the government says nearly all businesses will be allowed to reopen and the maximum size of public gatherings will increase.

Businesses that can reopen include indoor dining in restaurants, bars, concession stands, and other food and drink establishments; gyms and fitness studios, with safety protocols in place; playgrounds, community centres and libraries; and beauty salons can resume services that involve customers' faces like facials and some piercings.

Casinos can reopen but table games will not be permitted. Nightclubs can only reopen to serve food and drink. Dancing is not allowed in Stage 3.

Indoor gatherings will increase to a maximum of 50 people and outdoor gatherings will increase to a maximum of 100 people. Physical distancing is still required, so gathering limits are subject to the amount of space any individual indoor or outdoor area has available.

Despite the larger cap on gatherings, Ontario's ""social bubbles"" remain at a maximum of 10 people.

Some businesses that will not be reopening in Stage 3 are those considered ""high-risk"" for large crowds congregating, difficulties with physical distancing or challenges with keeping up with COVID-19 sanitation requirements.

The businesses and activities that will not be open or allowed in Stage 3 include:

Amusement parks and water parks;

Buffet-style food services;

Dancing at restaurants and bars, other than by performers hired by the establishment following specific requirements;

Overnight stays at camps for children;

Private karaoke rooms;

Prolonged or deliberate contact while playing sports;

Saunas, steam rooms, bath houses and oxygen bars;

Table games at casinos and gaming establishments.

Ottawa was among the first regions allowed to ease restrictions when Stage 2 came into effect June 12.

Since then, the number of active COVID-19 cases has remained relatively steady.

Ottawa Public Health announced 161 new laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 between June 12 and July 13; however, at least five cases were also removed from the total case count as they were deemed to be in residents from outside of Ottawa.

10 new cases were announced on Monday, bringing the number of active cases to 59. Two people remain in hospital with one in the ICU.

During Stage 2, there were two days where no new cases were announced by OPH. Six new COVID-19 related deaths were announced in the past month. Ottawa is currently on its 17th straight day of reporting zero new COVID-19 deaths.

Changes have also come to everyday life, with masks being made mandatory in enclosed public spaces in Ottawa by public health order. A mandatory mask by-law will be discussed at Ottawa city council on Wednesday, which includes fines for non-compliance.

Under the public health order, you are allowed to temporarily remove your mask indoors if you are receiving services, eating or drinking, participating in fitness or water-based activities, or for an emergency.

""If not now, when?""

Local business owners were eager Sunday to find out what it Stage 3 would mean for them.

Some have had to keep their doors closed since the start of the pandemic.

""The services that we do are generally pertaining to the face, and that’s prohibited in phase two,"" said Kim Bui, co-owner of Pure Beauty Studio, which remains closed.

She’s hopeful the next phase will allow her to reopen her business.

""We should be able to reopen because, if not, our livelihoods are at stake. We have families to feed, roofs to keep over our heads, and just a business that simply is a dream really.""

Meanwhile, other businesses have been able to reopen amid Stage 2, but owners say it has come at a cost.

""Right now, we’re just hoping to stay relevant; we’re hoping people will support us and drop by,” said Curtis Houlden, owner of Tail Gators on Merivale Road.

Houlden said he has been able to reopen a small patio four days a week, but it isn’t financially sustainable and he hopes that will change soon.

Just one new COVID-19 case was reported in Middlesex-London on Monday, bringing the total in the region to 630.

The single case comes a day after the region saw an increase, with five cases reported on Sunday, after a week of mainly either just one or no new daily cases.

Middlesex-London Health Unit Medical Officer of Health Dr. Chris Mackie said Monday three of five the cases were travel related.

The number of recovered cases rose to by one to 565, while there have been no deaths since June 10, with that total at 57. That leaves 18 active cases in the region.

None of the most recently reported cases have been associated with seniors’ facilities, where the totals stand at 180 cases and 37 deaths.

Meanwhile the total number of people tested at the city’s two assessment centres has exceeded 30,000.

No new cases were reported in other area counties. Here is how the totals stand there as of their most recent updates:

Holder emphasizes safety

As the region moves to Stage 3 on Friday, Holder said his big concern is complacency.

“First it was weariness, now it seems to be us taking for granted the good news of our successful results. And I do worry about that when we see larger groups of individuals that are hanging around that are not within their own circles or established social circles.”

He added that he has seen first-hand a lack of people wearing masks where maintaining physical distancing is difficult.

“I’m in the supermarket on the weekend, I’m wearing my mask and you know there are still a lot of cowboys who think it’s OK, and by the way a lot more men than women, I don’t know why, don’t think it matters to wear a mask in a grocery store.”

City council’s Corporate Services Committee voted 6-0 to recommend turning down an annual scheduled increase to their compensation. A final decision will be made by council next week.

A motion by Deputy Mayor Jesse Helmer proposes a pay freeze in 2020 for councillors, the mayor, or citizen appointees.

“Let’s just keep it the same as last year,” explained Helmer to the committee. “I don’t think this is the year to even be taking inflationary increases. Anything we can do to contain costs is something we have to look at.”

The policy for elected officials and citizen appointees would automatically increase compensation by about 2.1 per cent this year.

The increase is calculated based on the previous year’s change to either the Consumer Price Index or Labour Index, whichever is lower.

Mayor Ed Holder supported the pay freeze for 2020, citing the economic impacts caused by the pandemic both at city hall and in the economy.

“I think it is an important commitment and an equally important symbol to our community.”

Helmer’s motion was co-signed by Councillor Maureen Cassidy and Councillor Arielle Kayabaga.

On Dec. 1, 2018 city councillors’ compensation jumped from about $36,000 per year to $51,181 per year.

That amount rose again on Jan. 1, 2019 with an annual increase of $2.3 per cent ($1,177).

If the 2020 pay freeze is approved, compensation for councillors would remain at $52,358 per year. The mayor’s compensation would remain at $141,200 per year.",[]

It happened around 7 p.m. Sunday outside of a home on Rita Street in Sudbury’s Valley area.

Officers were called to the residence on a weapons complaint after the accused reportedly shot a 50-year-old man several times with a handgun during an altercation during a social gathering. The accused shooter was also allegedly wounded with self-inflicted injuries during the incident.

""Officers attended and found one male party victim shot and people were working on him. And a suspect was in custody,"" said Insp. John Valtonen, Greater Sudbury Police Service.

Police say the other people at the home were able to disarm the shooter before the police arrived. He was arrested and both men were taken to hospital.

""It was a very violent, chaotic incident and I have to say that the Greater Sudbury Police officers commend the witnesses that were there tending to the victim and subduing the accused person so quickly and being able to ensure that no other injuries were sustained by anybody else,"" said Valtonen. ""The fact is that the accused had attempted to inflict harm on himself, he did sustain self-inflicted injuries, but was taking to Health Sciences North and was treated and remained in our custody.""

The victim of the attack later died in hospital as a result of his injuries. His name is not being released at the request of the family.

""On behalf of all the members on the Greater Sudbury Police Service we send our deepest condolences to the family and friends of the victim and our thoughts are with them,"" said Valtonen.

Police say they believe this was an isolated and targeted incident between two people known to each other and that there is no threat to the public.

""This was by all intents deliberate and the individual was very focused on the one person,"" said Valtonen. ""Anytime that a weapon is used, despite being targeted, the opportunity for anybody else, bystanders, to be injured is top of mind for us. We know that it is a significant concern.""

An investigation into the shooting is continuing.

""There are a couple of scenes that we are conducting, as I said, the criminal investigation is ongoing, "" said Valtonen. ""With anything, once individuals are in the hospital and treated medically and we know the area is safe, then we take a very deliberate measured approach to making sure we collect all the evidence. So search warrants are being executed in a couple of locations, in particular a vehicle at the residence.""

Anyone with information about this incident is asked to call police.

""We are actually very encouraged with the information we're receiving from the public, and we would ask that any other witnesses, even if they think that they don't have any relevant information,"" said Valtonen. ""Any information is important, which includes things like video, anything they might have heard, things like that would be really important to piecing this together.""

This is the second murder in Greater Sudbury this year, the other involves the death of a 45-year-old man who has died after a serious and violent assault in the city's Minnow Lake neighbourhood on Canada Day.

""Anytime a violent event takes place in our community, it's concerning.

RCMP were called to a quarry near the dam on July 12, at approximately 3:05 p.m.

Her sister-in-law warned her that the bear had already entered a nearby home earlier that night. The bear had gained access to the home by pushing an air conditioner out of a window, according to RCMP

Within a few hours, around 2 a.m. Monday, Mcleod said she heard a noise.

""I was kind of on edge because it was just the street over from me. I heard some banging outside and I peeked out and my garbage bin was flipped over.”

She didn’t see the bear at first and said that local security scared it away by driving by, but several minutes later she saw it again.

""I just happened to look outside because I was really paranoid because of what my sister told me. I looked outside and that’s when I got a glimpse of it walking right towards my front doorstep.

""I was like ‘oh my gosh, oh my gosh’ and I was so scared because I thought that the bear was going to try to come into my house.""

Mcleod said that the bear then sniffed around her garbage before security was able to scare it off again.

In the earlier incident, officers were advised by local security members that the bear had left the house and ran into the woods, RCMP say.

Police believe they found the bear a few hundred metres in the bush behind the home and it began running away as officers approached.

One resident of the home was injured while exiting the home and was taken to the medical clinic.

Conservation officers have set up a bear trap near the last known location of the bear, RCMP said.

Mcleod said she is still concerned because it hasn’t been caught yet. She hopes that the bear can be located and brought away from the community.

She and her daughter are getting out of town to their cabin because her daughter is too scared to sleep at home, she said.

Stanley Mission RCMP and the Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment are asking residents in the area to be careful and contact a conservation officer or the police if the bear is spotted.

They are also warning residents to be aware of items in the garbage or around their properties that may attract bears.",[]

The BCCDC didn't specify which seats on the flight could have been exposed, which means all travellers who were on the plane are asked to keep an eye on their symptoms for 14 days from the time of the flight.

The outdoor pools at Kitsilano, Second Beach, and New Brighton would usually re-open in mid-May, but health concerns over the virus meant a major delay for swimmers this year as the Vancouver Park Board formulated a health and safety plan that would allow people to safely return to the water.

All swimmers are being urged to reserve a spot online, as there is a limit on occupancy and drop-in spaces. Demand over the weekend was so great, at one point it crashed the reservation system.

Lane swimmers are being limited to 45-minute sessions during set times, while public swimmers are limited to 90 minutes.

The pools will undergo cleaning several times a day.

Those swimming lengths are being asked to stay five metres apart from others when they are in the water.

At Kitsilano Pool Monday morning, lifeguards could be heard over megaphones reminding some swimmers to keep their distance.

Despite the online ticketing issue over the weekend, things appeared to go smoothly Monday, with swimmers mostly staying apart in the water and on the pool deck.

For many regulars, getting back in the water at their favourite pool came as a relief.

“They couldn’t have done a better job, it was fantastic,” said Christine Ingemorsen, who has been swimming at Kits Pool for about 30 years. “I think everyone is being respectful about physical distancing and i didn’t feel there were any personal health issues. I think everyone was so happy to be back in the pool.”

Verena Foxx stopped by the pool early Monday ahead of her reserved time to see how the new measures were working as she is in a vulnerable age category for COVID-19.

“I think their guidelines are good and i notice people are staying apart,” Foxx said. “I think this is a safe way to get the exercise I like to get.”

Park Board Commissioner Tricia Barker feels the re-opening has been handled carefully.

“We want everyone to know it is going to be safe when they’re here. That’s always been one of park board’s biggest concerns as we open things up — to make sure people are confident we are looking after their well-being.”

Online sales for the next day’s swimming sessions start at 9:30 a.m.

Other measures include one-way restrictions around the pool deck. Pool equipment, like kick boards, are not being provided — though swimmers can bring their own.

Today, lifeguards at beaches & 3 outdoor pools open. Online ticket sales start at 9:30 am for next day. Drop-ins limited. Arrive swim ready, leave valuables at home, & stay in designated pod on pool deck. Change rooms, lockers not available.

Changerooms and lockers are not available, but spaces have been marked off for people to leave their belongings or to relax in the sun if they are taking part in a public swim.

Maple Grove Pool in Kerrisdale is expected to open next Monday.

If there are no issues, the outdoor swimming season is expected to wrap up in early September.",[]

The three-time Paralympic medalist from Cranbrook was set to compete in the summer games but is now preparing for a gruelling ride through southern B.C.

Chernove said he hopes to make the trip from Fernie to Merritt which spans 1,000 kilometres, in just three days. He would be the first Para-cyclist to complete the trek.

It's part of the BC Epic 1000, an almost entirely off-road and self-supported cycling challenge, which raises money for the Canadian Paralympic Foundation.

The foundation aims to provide more opportunities for Canadian athletes with disabilities to participate in various sports.

He recognizes the impact funding from the organization has had on his own cycling career and is excited to help give back to other athletes.

""It was one of those foundations that I could try to give back to, that was very personal,"" Chernove told CTV News. ""I know exactly how the work they do plays out in the lives of people living with a disability.""

The 45-year-old took home three medals at the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio, including a gold, silver and bronze. He also captured 13 world titles.

Chernove plans to set off on his journey before sunrise Saturday, where he hopes to raise $40,000 for the Canadian Paralympic Foundation.

""I do my best as far as performing as an athlete when I have difficult challenges to rise to and this to me looked like something that would challenge me on many levels,"" said Chernove, in a news release.

He adds that he's never done any long distance cycling events before and is new to self-supported biking.

According to Statistics Canada, Victoria’s unemployment rate climbed to 11 per cent in June, up from 10.1 per cent in May. Around this time last year, Victoria’s unemployment rate was roughly four per cent, according to the South Island Prosperity Partnership (SIPP).

Previously, the city’s highest unemployment rate ever was 7.4 per cent in 2008, as a result of a national financial crisis and recession, says the SIPP.

While B.C.’s overall unemployment rate went down for the first time in months in June, from 13.4 per cent to 13 per cent, Victoria was among four cities where unemployment continued to rise.

The South Island Prosperity Partnership believes that one reason why Victoria’s unemployment rate is rising is because tourism-related sectors continue to be hamstrung by the global pandemic.

""Of particular concern are the tourism-related indicators since our region has the third-most tourism-related jobs out of Canada's metro regions,"" said Dallas Gislason, SIPP director of economic development, in a release Friday.

On Friday, B.C. Finance Minister Carole James echoed this assessment when speaking at a news conference.

""You would, by now in Vancouver and in Victoria, be seeing cruise ships coming in, seeing passengers unload, be seeing people through the downtown core,"" said James. ""And that's just not possible.""

The SIPP says that the loss of this year’s summer tourism season in Victoria will likely lead to a “prolonged recession” in the region.

However, nearly one month after Statics Canada recorded its most recent monthly labour force survey, the SIPP says that Victoria could see a reduction in unemployment as people return to work amid Phase 3 of B.C.’s restart plan.

Phase 3, which began on June 24, included the reopening of more economic industries. James says that around this time, more members of the hospitality and service industry began returning to work.

""In fact, the accommodation and food services sector accounts for 50 per cent of this month's gain in jobs,"" said James.

Moving forward, as B.C. continues to reopen parts of its economy, James stresses that health and safety will continue to be a priority in the province.

""We need to stay focused on our restart plan, doing it in a responsible way so we can see more and more businesses reopen,"" she said Friday.

Dash-camera video shows the very moment a Victoria police car runs a red light and strikes an SUV on Wednesday morning.

“Out of the corner of my eye at the very last second, I just saw a vehicle coming towards,” said Sandi Piercy.

She was driving through the intersection of Douglas and Johnson streets when her vehicle was hit.

The cruiser was heavily damaged in the crash and so was Piercy’s SUV.

Once she got out of the vehicle, Piercy said the police officer came over immediately to check on her.

“He was very kind, and he hopped out immediately and said, 'I am so sorry this is all my fault, I ran the red light,'” said Piercy. “He explained he missed the light because he was inputting data from a previous case he had just finished up and just missed the light.”

VicPD said in a statement following the crash that it remains under investigation.

Piercy said because there were so many officers at the scene, she didn’t think she needed to find her own witnesses.

“It has been stressful. I thought I was going to be able to just walk away from it and the police would say don’t worry and we'll get this all straightened out. Instead it’s been a little bit secretive,” she said.

Since the crash, Piercy said she has not been contacted by police or ICBC.

The Office of the Police Complaint Commissioner is reviewing the crash. Victoria police did not answer a request for comment on Sunday.",[]

Greater Sudbury Police Service says it learned Sunday that the 45-year-old man who was assaulted early in the morning on July 1, has died in hospital as a result of his injuries sustained in the incident. His name is not being released out of respect for the family’s wishes.

""The injuries sustained by the individual were significant and as a result, unfortunately, the victim over the weekend succumbed to his injuries and passed,"" said Insp. John Valtonen, Greater Sudbury Police Service. ""Again, our deepest condolences to the family on such a terrible result of this incident.""

Initially, a 25-year-old man was arrested for attempted murder in connection with the incident on Ferndale Avenue in the city’s Minnow Lake neighbourhood. However, despite being involved in a physical altercation with the victim, police say it was determined that it was actually a 48-year-old man that is responsible for the injuries sustained.

Officials believe the serious assault took place just before the physical altercation with the 25-years-old.

Now, the 48-year-old accused, who has yet to be named by police, is charged with second-degree murder.

He remains in custody.

Valtonen says this is the first of two murder in Greater Sudbury this year. The other involves the shooting of a 50-year-old man in the Valley area of the city on Sunday.

According to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), the drugs were seized from individuals returning to Canada on commercial airline flights.

The first incident occurred on June 18 as a woman arriving on a flight from Jamaica was referred for a secondary exam by a border official.

“The officers examined six food packages, which revealed 6.6 kilograms of suspected cocaine within the items,” the RCMP said in a news release issued on Monday.

The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) estimates the drugs are worth about $825,000.

The second incident occurred less than a week later on June 23 after another woman was referred to a secondary exam after arriving in Toronto from Jamaica.

Border officers inspected the woman’s belongings and allegedly found 3.85 kilograms of suspected cocaine hidden in eight food packages. The estimated value of the drugs is about $447,500.

The RCMP said that both individuals were taken into custody and the drugs were seized.

Etobicoke resident Mavis Coreta Segree, 76, and Hamilton resident Amran Jama, 31, have each been charged with importing a substance included in Schedule 1 (cocaine) contrary to the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.

They were both released on bail with conditions and are expected to appear in court in Brampton, Ont. on Aug. 26 and Sept. 2 respectively.

According to the RCMP, more than 184 kilograms of suspected cocaine has been seized in the Greater Toronto Area this year.",[]

First Nation,['Chelsea Papineau'],2020-07-13 15:26:00-04:00,"SUDBURY -- The Ontario government says it has reached a final settlement on a 115-year-old land claim with Flying Post First Nation, near Timmins.

A $14.1 million settlement will address the shortfall of land received by the First Nation as part of the James Bay Treaty, Treaty #9, which was originally signed in 1905.

Flying Post First Nation joined the Wabun Tribal Council in 2007 after previously being an independent First Nation within the Nishnawbe-Aski Nation.

""I'm pleased that Ontario is fulfilling its outstanding obligation to Flying Post First Nation, dating back more than a century,"" said Greg Rickford, Minister of Indigenous Affairs in a news release Monday. ""Settling land claims through co-operative negotiations and respectful dialogue is a key step towards reconciliation with Indigenous people.""

The Flying Post First Nation reserve lands are located northwest of Timmins along the Ground Hog River, however, today the majority of its members live near Nipigon.

""This is an important moment,"" said Chief Murray Ray of Flying Post First Nation. ""Flying Post First Nation and the province of Ontario have taken the proper steps to right a historic wrong for a loss that is almost 115-years-old. We had a successful ratification on December 2, 2019, and are confident it will contribute to our economic and social development. We are proud of all our members of voting age who cast their ballot in favour of this settlement.""

Government officials say the settlement was approved by the First Nation members in a vote in December 2019, with 100 per cent of those who voted in favour of the agreement.",[]

Marie,['Jairus Patterson'],2020-07-13 14:35:00-04:00,"SAULT STE. MARIE -- The lack of emergency medical services north of Sault Ste. Marie was first discussed 10 years ago. Planning began in 2018 to figure out how to offer quicker medical service to people in that area.

This year, on Canada Day, a paramedic was finally stationed in Goulais River, 30 minutes north of Sault Ste. Marie.

""We now have this paramedic response unit (PRU) here stationed in the Goulais area for what we call the 'Sault North,'"" said Robert Rushworth, Chief of Paramedic Services in Sault Ste. Marie. ""It serves Searchmont, Batchawana, Hayden, Aweres, with a quicker response time.""

From 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., a paramedic is stationed at the volunteer fire and rescue hall located on Old Highway 17 Road.

""This is the result of significant planning and effort and will significantly improve EMS coverage in our rural service area between Sault Ste. Marie and Montreal River,"" said social services board chair Luke Dufour.

When a call comes in, the Goulais River paramedic will head to the scene. At the same time, an ambulance will be dispatched from the Sault.

On average, the PRU is first on the scene and is between 10 to 17 minutes faster than the ambulance coming from Sault Ste. Marie. The paramedic will be able to assess the situation and start medical attention. When the ambulance arrives, the crew is able to load up the patient right away and take them to the hospital, if needed.

Since July 1, paramedics have responded to 10 calls.

Shane MacFarlane was the first emergency responder on the scene for one of them.

""I arrived on scene just prior to the transporting crew and I was able to get in a COVID screening and do a primary assessment and kinda get a general idea of what was going on with the situation before the arriving crew arrived,"" said MacFarlane. “So I turn over a report to them and they were able to turn over the transport time that much quicker.""

MacFarlane added that seconds count in medical situations, so having a paramedic arrive before the ambulance is crucial.

Two new full-time jobs have been created as a result of the PRU being opened.

""The PRU will add support to the many volunteer first responders who have served the rural areas for decades across the district,"" said the District of Sault Ste. Marie Social Services Administration Board in a news release. ""The PRU will be dispatched by the Central Ambulance Communications Centre and the current schedule will see the PRU working seven days a week, 12 hours a day.""",[]

Municipal leaders across Canada have been calling on both the federal and provincial governments to provide up to $10 billion in financial aid to struggling cities -- with Ontario municipalities requesting $4 billion in joint financial relief.

Without those funds cities have warned of severe cutbacks to services or dramatic property tax increases -- by as much as 30 per cent in some cases -- to make up the budgetary gaps.

While the Trudeau government has, so far, offered $14 billion in pandemic funding to provinces, it also applied a set of conditions on how the money should be spent, including testing capacity, contact tracing, health care capacity and support for municipalities.

Premier Doug Ford said he’s negotiating with the federal government for Ontario’s per capita share of the funding -- roughly $5 billion -- and is calling on Ottawa to drop all conditions and allow provinces to spend the funds as needed.

Ontario’s Municipal Affairs, Steve Clark, says while the Ford government agrees that the province has “to put dollars on the table” he told a parliamentary committee that his government is waiting for its negotiations with the federal government to wrap up, before revealing what it's prepared to spend.

“Negotiations aren’t finished at the federal level,” Clark told the Standing Committee on Finance and Economic Affairs which is tasked with studying the impact of COVID-19.

“We deserve our fair share of the money that’s being offered…we’re just not there yet.”

Despite being pressed by members of the opposition for a dollar amount the Ford government is willing to give to municipalities Clark declined to provide one, citing the need for the negotiations to end.

“No province, no territory has put a final amount on their municipal support,” Clark said.

While Clark suggested financial help could be unveiled in the upcoming provincial budget set to be tabled in November, critics are calling on the government to act immediately.

“This is a classic case where [Premier Ford] could show leadership while still talking to the Federal government, and not leave our municipalities hanging in the balance,” said Liberal Leader Steven Del Duca.",[]

But instead of hospitality, the pandemic is exposing a glimpse of hostility aimed at those who are assumed to be outsiders.

""Being from Halifax, growing up here all but eight years of my life, I really didn't expect this,” resident Tony Mountenay told CTV News.

Tony and Debbie Mountenay chose to return to Nova Scotia during the pandemic because they were looking for a laid back retirement.

As required, they isolated after they arrived. But then they decided to go out and run errands.

""And we had three different incidents where people came up beside us, yelling at us, through the window, and when it first happened, we had to try to think, well what was that about?” Debbie said.

The answer was the licence plate on their truck — showing that they came from Ontario.

Visitors from beyond the “Atlantic bubble” have been vilified by locals fearing the virus could be imported.

Though relatively rare, there have been incidents of “plate-shaming.”

A woman from Quebec was told to go home while walking on a New Brunswick beach.

More than 15,000 Newfoundlanders signed a petition demanding their province not open the border to anyone.

Debbie said one woman who had harassed the couple had done so in front of her own children.

“She really shouldn't have been doing that in my opinion,” she said. “Another man, you could tell he was out of control.""

The Atlantic bubble, which encompasses the provinces of New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador, is a concept that was introduced recently to allow easier travel between the Eastern provinces as the region reopens.

People from all across Canada are allowed to travel to any Atlantic province, but those outside of the Atlantic bubble must isolate for 14 days — as leaders in the region are quick to remind people.

""The Atlantic bubble is open today, [but] that does not apply to those who are from Ontario, Quebec or Western Canada,” Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil said. “If you're coming into our province, you're required to self isolate as well.""

The Atlantic provinces have largely fared well during the pandemic compared to provinces such as Ontario or Quebec. Of the Atlantic provinces, Nova Scotia has had the most cases in total, at just over 1,000 — a far cry from Quebec’s 56,521 cumulative cases.

The stress for locals in the Atlantic provinces is that out-of-bubble visitors could lead to a second wave of the virus.

Only last week, a string of new cases in Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island were proven to be related to travel from outside of the bubble. One individual flew from the United States to Toronto, and then to Halifax. This case was then connected to cases in Prince Edward Island.

McNeil said on July 6 that he is frustrated with travellers who do not isolate for the 14 days after they arrive.

“We have worked hard together and sacrificed so much in this province to help flatten the curve only to have some people come into our province who think they’re above it all, who think that the rules don’t apply to them,” he said. “Guess what? They do.”

But the Mountenay’s experience in Nova Scotia suggests that the uncertainty over who has isolated and who has not has led to some rather un-neighbourly behaviour.

In response, the couple has come with a way to alert people they’re not a threat. A piece of paper that clearly states a person has completed isolation.

""I don't want to get [COVID-19],” Debbie said. “And I don't want to give it to anybody.""",[]

On July 11, around 11:50 a.m., police were called to reports of a suspicious package at Montrose Park in River Heights.

Officers found a small package and several resources were called in, including the bomb unit.

It was later determined that the package was safe and police determined the package was a geocache.

Geocaching is an activity similar to a scavenger hunt where people use a GPS and explore the community looking for hidden containers or items that have collectibles, toys, and trinkets inside.

“Geocaching essentially is just a treasure hunt,” said geocacher Julie Mungall.

“You use an app with some GPS coordinates, and it has some clues and you go out and you find the cache. Inside sometimes, you find some little trinkets and toys and a log and you write down your name and the date you found the cache and you move on.”

She said the caches are hidden inside geocaching boxes – which can be bought or made. In Sunday’s incident, it was a homemade geocache.

“It was actually a mini flashlight, covered in black electrical tape,” said Mungall.

“.It was hollowed out and the geocache log was inside. And just the log was inside, so it didn’t rattle, it didn’t make any sound. It was just an empty flashlight.”

Mungall said most geocaches are really well hidden, but this one was more visible.

“This one was little more out in the open, so I can understand how somebody who didn’t know what geocaching was spotted it, found it, and maybe panicked a little bit,” she said.

“After finding the item, holding it in my hand and knowing what it looked like, did it look like a bomb or something dangerous? No, absolutely not. I don’t think so.”

She said the intent of geocaching is to have fun and it’s unfortunate the incident turned out the way it did.

Police are reminding those who geocache to be mindful of how the packages appear and that they shouldn't disguise items to look like they are unsafe.

""Let's keep this activity fun and safe for those participating,"" Winnipeg police said in a news release.

She was 57.

Travolta said in an Instagram post that his wife of 28 years died after a two-year battle with breast cancer.

""It is with a very heavy heart that I inform you that my beautiful wife Kelly has lost her two-year battle with breast cancer,"" Travolta said. ""She fought a courageous fight with the love and support of so many.""

The couple had three children together.

""Shocked by this sad news,"" Maria Shriver said on Twitter. ""Kelly was such a bright loving soul, a talented actress, and a loving mom and wife. My heart breaks for her family who have already known such sadness and grief.""

Born Kelly Kamalelehua Smith on Oct. 13, 1962, in Honolulu, Hawaii, Preston had a lengthy acting career in movies and television beginning in the 1980s, including the 1985 teen comedy ""Mischief,"" 1986's ""Space Camp"" and her breakthrough, 1988's ""Twins."" Preston played Marnie, the woman who marries Schwarzenegger's character.

Preston was first married to actor Kevin Gage. They divorced in 1987.

The year after, Preston met Travolta while shooting the 1989 film ""The Experts,"" a box-office flop about a Soviet KGB agent who hires hip New Yorkers to update the spy program's understanding of American society. They meet on the dance floor after Travolta asks, ""Does anyone here know how to dance."" Preston responds: ""I know how to dance.""

They were married in 1991 at a midnight ceremony in Paris while expecting their first son, Jett.

Preston starred opposite Kevin Costner in the 1999 film ""For the Love of the Game."" In 2003, she starred in ""What a Girl Wants"" and as the mom in the live-action adaptation of ""The Cat in the Hat."" The following year she appeared in the music video for Maroon 5's ""She Will Be Loved.""

Preston gave one of her most well-received performances in ""Jerry Maguire"" as the ex-fiancee of Cruise's sports agent who dumps him early in the movie. The Daily News called her ""icily effective.""

On Monday, Russell Crowe recalled knowing Preston in the '90s. He said he hadn't seen her much since, ""but when I did, she was always the same sparkly eyed gem.""

Preston occasionally appeared in films with her husband, though the results were seldom among either's best work. Among them: the box-office bomb ""Battlefield Earth"" in 2000 and the 2009 Disney comedy ""Old Dogs,"" also with their daughter, Ella Bleu.

In January 2009, Jett Travolta, 16, died after a seizure at the family's vacation home in the Bahamas. The death touched off a court case after an ambulance driver and his attorney were accused of trying to extort $25 million from the actors in exchange for not releasing sensitive information about their son's death.

Travolta testified during a criminal trial that ended in a mistrial and was prepared to testify a second time, but decided to stop pursuing the case and it was dismissed. He cited the severe strain the proceedings and his son's death had caused the family.

Both Preston and Travolta returned to acting, with Preston's first role back in the Nicholas Sparks adaptation, ""The Last Song,"" which starred Miley Cyrus and her future husband, Liam Hemsworth.

In addition to Jett and Ella Bleu, who was born in 2000, the couple had son Benjamin in 2010. Ella wrote on Instagram Sunday: ""I have never met anyone as courageous, strong, beautiful and loving as you. Anyone who is lucky enough to have known you or to have ever been in your presence will agree that you have a glow and a light that never ceases to shine and that makes anyone around you feel instantly happy.""

The couple last starred together in the 2018 film ""Gotti,"" with Travolta playing John Gotti and Preston playing the crime boss's wife, Victoria.

""Kelly's love and life will always be remembered,"" Travolta said on Instagram. ""I will be taking some time to be there for my children who have lost their mother, so forgive me in advance if you don't hear from us for a while. But please know that I will feel your outpouring of love in the weeks and months ahead as we heal.""

165,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/canada-s-largest-indigenous-police-force-has-never-shot-anyone-dead-1.5020967?autoPlay=true,Canada's largest Indigenous police force has never shot anyone dead,['Colin Perkel'],2020-07-12 11:02:00-04:00,"TORONTO -- In its 26 years of existence, officers with Canada's largest Indigenous police force have never shot and killed anyone and no officer has died in the line of duty, despite a grinding lack of resources and an absence of normal accountability mechanisms.

It's a record of which the Nishnawbe Aski Police Service is proud, especially in light of the recent uproar in North America over police killings and brutality involving Indigenous, Black, and mentally distressed people. It's a record achieved in communities frequently in social distress, places where hunting rifles and shotguns are ubiquitous.

The key difference from urban, non-Indigenous policing, insiders and observers say, is the relationship building between officers and the people they serve.

""In the past, you might have been the only officer in there,"" Roland Morrison, chief of NAPS says from Thunder Bay, Ont. ""You would have no radio, you've got no backup, so you really effectively have to use your communication and talk to people. You have to develop relationships with the communities in order to have positive policing.""

Inaugurated in 1994, NAPS is responsible for policing more than 38,000 people in 34 communities, many beyond remote, across a vast, largely untamed swath of northern Ontario. Currently the service has 203 officers, about 60 per cent of them Indigenous, Morrison says. Its mandate is culturally responsive policing.

Erick Laming, a criminology PhD candidate at the University of Toronto, says people from First Nation communities -- many with an ingrained suspicion of police given the brutal realities of generations of enforced residential school attendance -- have a higher level of trust when officers are Indigenous.

In contrast, he said, new RCMP recruits with no such background might find themselves in Nunavut or Yukon confronted with significant language and cultural barriers.

""If you're from the community, you have those lived experiences. You can relate to people. You just know how to deal with the issues,"" says Laming, who is from the Shabot Obaadjiwan First Nation north of Kingston, Ont.

""If you don't have that history, you can have all the cultural-sensitivity training in the world, you'll never fully be able to fully integrate into that situation.""

Another example, he said, is the service in Kahnawake, Que., which calls itself the Kahnawake Peacekeepers rather than a police force.

While all officers in Ontario undergo the same basic training, the province's nine Indigenous police services are fundamentally different from their non-Indigenous counterparts.

For one thing, they are not deemed an essential service, although federal Public Safety Minister Bill Blair said last month that policing First Nations communities should be. Nor are those in Ontario subject to the provincial Police Services Act, which mandates standards, including for an extensive oversight framework.

Now, the process for filing complaints against members of an Indigenous police force is ad hoc, although NAPS does have a professional standards branch and will on occasion call in Ontario Provincial Police. Officers have been disciplined, charged or even fired for excessive use of force.

Another difference is that Indigenous forces are completely reliant on the vagaries of government program funding -- with Ottawa footing 52 per cent of the bill and provinces 48 per cent. The current operations budget for NAPS, for example, is around $37.7 million -- more than its peers -- with expenses approaching $40 million.

The upshot, particularly in years gone by, has been a dire shortage of officers and even of basic facilities and equipment that urbanites can scarcely imagine. In more than a dozen cases, Indigenous self-administered police services in Canada have simply folded.

Now retired, Terry Armstrong, who spent 22 years with Ontario Provincial Police as well as five years as chief of NAPS, says people would be shocked to find out just how poorly funded First Nations policing has been.

Armstrong recounts how a few years ago, in the Hudson Bay community of Fort Severn, Ont., a NAPS officer found himself dealing with a homicide. Besides having to secure three crime scenes and the body, the lone officer had to arrest the suspect and deal with a separate gun call. Bad weather prevented any forensic or other help flying in until the following day.

One thing he always stressed to newcomers as chief, Armstrong says, is the importance of treating people respectfully.

""Some day, they're going to be your backup. When stuff goes south, you're going to need people to support you,"" he says. ""If you're going to be a dick ... when you need help, they aren't going to be there for you.""

One frigid afternoon in February 2013, the only on-duty NAPS officer in Kasabonika Lake First Nation in Ontario's far north detained Lena Anderson, an intoxicated young mother upset over the apprehension of her daughter. The new detachment portable was unheated. The old holding cell was unusable because prisoners could escape through holes in the floor.

The arresting officer left Anderson, 23, in the caged back seat of his Ford 150 police truck for warmth while he went to get help from his off-duty colleague. Alone for 16 minutes, Anderson strangled herself.

The tragedy, combined with a threatened strike over working conditions by NAPS officers, caused an uproar. The situation, says Grand Chief Alvin Fiddler, prompted his Nishnawbe Aski Nation to take a stand. Governments, he said, had to do better or face the far more daunting prospect of doing the policing themselves.

As a result, Fiddler says, a new funding agreement was reached in 2018 that allowed the hiring of 79 new officers over five years and critical infrastructure upgrades to detachments and poor or non-existent communication systems. Most importantly, he said, the deal set in motion pending Ontario legislation that would finally allow First Nations police services to opt in to the Police Services Act, putting in place solid standards and accountability mechanisms.

""That's something our communities and citizens deserve."" Fiddler says. ""If they have an issue with NAPS, there should be a forum for them to pursue their grievance.""

However, giving investigative authority to the province's Special Investigations Unit or Office of the Independent Police Review Director must come with cultural safety built in, he says.

Stephen Leach, current review director, says his office is not yet involved in the opt-in process.

""My expectation is that once the Community Safety and Policing Act is proclaimed and the opt-in process is further along, then I would be involved in explaining how the public complaints process works, and listening to how it might have to be adapted to meet the needs of First Nations communities,"" Leach says.

Stephen Warner, a spokesman for Ontario Solicitor General Sylvia Jones, confirmed the government was working on regulations to the new act. Part of the work, he said, was to set clear and consistent standards for policing delivery ""informed by, and responsive to, the views of the communities that police are both a part of and serve.""

Toronto-based lawyer Julian Falconer calls the new legislation a game changer. Despite having devoted much of his career to holding police accountable, he says he has no qualms in representing NAPS.

Despite, or perhaps because of, their chronic lack of resources, Falconer says Indigenous police behave much differently from their urban counterparts. He cites the dearth of police killings and racist behaviours that have sown deep mistrust of policing among Indigenous, Black and marginalized groups.

""Mainstream policing has a lot to learn from Indigenous policing,"" Falconer said. ""The relationship between community and policing is so dramatically different.""

""That delayed a lot of the natural foods so grasses and leaves and dandelions that bears would typically eat when they come out of hibernation, so those were unavailable when bears came out of hibernation,"" explained MNRF spokesperson Karen Passmore.

Since April 1st, the province's Bear Wise reporting phone line has received 1,232 calls, compared to 712 calls last year during the same time period.

The agency will continue to support clients and families with virtual services. The combination of in-person and virtual care options will be sustained for the foreseeable future.

Hands is launching a survey to ask clients about their concerns, what would help them feel safe in a return to in-person visits and whether they prefer to continue with an online option or combination of in-person and virtual approach to service.

""As providers of essential services to children, youth, adults with developmental disabilities and their families, health and safety is always a priority at Hands. We quickly adapted our services to a virtual model to meet our client’s needs during this pandemic and have maintained that service over the past five months,” said Hands’ CEO Andrea Roberts.

The team is made up of child and family therapists, child and youth workers, behaviour therapists and many more health care workers.

Service is provided to more than 11,000 individuals in North Bay, Nipissing, Muskoka, Parry Sound and northern Ontario each year.

Hands provides services in the areas of: adult developmental services, autism, child development, child and youth mental health and justice services.

The organization plans to use a strategic, staggered approach when re-opening to ensure it meets priority needs.

Some clinicians and employees will begin to return to offices this summer, while others will return in the fall.

""We know that there will be a ‘new normal’ when we do return to our offices. Our ability to carefully plan our return provides us an opportunity to come back better prepared for future disruptions,"" said Roberts.

In planning for a potential second wave of the pandemic, Hands says it is ensuring the agency remains nimble and able to make a swift and successful return to increased virtual service if required.

Hands says it is focused on planning for how the agency can ‘build back better’ in returning to on-site work at its 12 locations throughout the region and in settings with community partners.

The agency is looking at a number of things to consider, including: the need for services that need to be prioritized, meeting with clients or families while maintaining physical distancing, individual clients or families that might be in crisis and need priority in-person help, and much more.",[]

The Near North Palliative Care Network has been providing free compassionate end-of-life care service in Nipissing and Parry Sound for 33 years.

The mission of the network is to go to the patient, whether that's in their home, a hospice or the hospital.

""We want to be present in the lives of our clients and our community,"" said executive director Monica Monni.



""The mission of our visiting hospice is to be with you at your home.""

All but two of the nearly 120 members are volunteers.



The money raised from the butterfly release fundraiser will go towards training new palliative care and bereavement volunteers who will serve patients and their families everywhere in the region.

So far, over $10,000 has been donated but officials expect more donations to flow in over the next little while.

""This is something that touches everybody regardless if the patient is there for cancer, heart and stroke or old age,"" said board chair Darren Renaud.



""No one deserves to die alone and our volunteers work tirelessly.""

Palliative care has had to adapt to more virtual conference calls due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But, it can be challenging, the network is finding many seniors struggling to adapt to the technology.

""There might be a need for an increase and demand in service as well because people are becoming infected and unfortunately succumbing to the infection, there's going to be a lot of need,"" said volunteer care co-ordinator Alison Wilkes.

Monni says volunteers are always needed and hopes the community will remember the work they do.

""We are also seeing more people facing isolation, anxiety, depression due to the fact that they can't be with their loved ones,"" said Monni.

Like a butterfly ready to spread its wings and fly, the team looks to lift the spirits of those who need a smile before they pass on.",[]

Cheryl Sutton, the university's former vice-president of finance and administration, took over the leadership position on July 1, succeeding Dr. Mike DeGagné who has served in the role since 2013.

The Nipissing University Board of Governors officially announced Sutton’s appointment at the end of March after DeGagné's resignation.

""Cheryl’s leadership experience and intimate knowledge of the university make her the ideal person to lead the institution during these extraordinary times,"" said the university's board of governors chair Marianne Berube.



""We look forward to working with her over the coming months to continue the momentum the university has experienced over the last number of years.""

Sutton joined Nipissing University in 2010 and has served as its vice-president since 2016.



The university calls her an 'accomplished executive' with 25 years of experience as a chartered professional accountant and certified general accountant working in public service.

Sutton also holds the designation of Certified Human Resources Leader. She first joined the university as a Director of Human Resources and Employee Relations, and in 2014, took on the role of Assistant Vice-President, Finance and Human Resources.

""I’m honoured that the board has entrusted me to lead the University through this challenging period,"" said Sutton in a news release.



""Nipissing has evolved significantly since I joined the institution in 2010, but our student-centred approach to education has been unwavering. I look forward to engaging with our faculty, staff, students, alumni, donors and community in this new capacity to ensure we continue to be a university of choice for students into the future.""

Before coming to Nipissing, Sutton spent several years at Ontario Northland where her career progressed from Manager of Accounting in 1991 to Vice-President of Passenger Services in 2005.

Police say 10 people died in collisions involving a transport truck or other commercial vehicle on OPP patrolled roads in northeastern Ontario in 2018. Last year six people died and so far this year, two lives have been taken.

They're warning all drivers, especially truck drivers, to pay attention.

""It's even more important for commercial motor vehicles because these vehicles are so much bigger and have the potential to cause so much more damage or possible injury and or death,"" said OPP Const. Phil Young in a phone interview with CTV News.

A major concern for police right now is a spike in crashes.

Commercial motor vehicle collisions have increased by almost 100 from 2018 to 2019. Police attribute most of these crashes to speed.

""Focus on driving. When you're driving, focus on the road,"" said Young. ""Don't look at your phone, don't try to text and don't try to fill out that electronic log book as you're driving.""

Driving instructor Michael Farmer, with Transport Training Centres of Canada, works with new students looking to complete their AZ drivers' license. He sees many mistakes every time he takes a new student on the road.

""Most of the time it's speed or the driver is not paying attention,"" said Farmer. ""One time I saw a guy on the 401 watching a movie from an iPad on the dash. Have some respect for the other drivers on the road.""

Farmer said some transport drivers drive faster to meet deadlines.

""They're being pushed by dispatchers to get to where they've got to go. They've got to get there fast,"" said Farmer.

Marie has closed its doors and will look for a new location.

The police chief said the decision to move was made for safety reasons.



""When we had bylaw and the fire department in there was significant issues associated with that facility,"" said Chief Huge Stevenson.



""There’s no way an employer could allow people to work in that, based on employee standards.""

The Neighbourhood Resource Centre opened in 2014. People hoped the centre would help solve the drug, theft and prostitution issues surrounding the area.



As of late, the chief said the area was a hub for crime.



""We had significant secondary crimes associated with that area, open drug dealing, prostitution,"" said Stevenson.



""Really I think it became more of a hang out then it was helping or treating people.""

Luke Dufour is the chair of the board for the District of Sault Ste. Marie Social Services. He also manages a local small business a block away from the resource centre. He said the success of the centre can not be viewed upon simply by looking at crime stats.

""If all you’re measuring is crime, you’re not necessarily going to measure the impact of a place like the Neighbourhood Resource Centre. Because increasing the quality of life is also part of the equation and helping increase those social determinants of health and make them better for downtown residence.""

The chief said the closure of the building is a perfect time to reassess the goals of the centre.



""During the latter part of the NRC, there was no performance measure, no objectives that were being sort of attained to and so this was an opportunity to re-examine what we were doing there.""

Moving forward, Dufour said it makes sense for social services to take over the lead of the next Resource Centre.



The chief agrees and says there will still be a police presence wherever the next centre is located, but there won’t be an officer stationed there all the time.

The John Howard Society had workers stationed at the Centre for six years. Executive Director Suzanne Lajambe said its time to change the goals of the centre.



""We accomplished what we intended to do but as the time went by and needs changed certainly we have a lot more issues happening in our community around addictions and mental health. I think we need to grow beyond when it originally started up.""

Chief Stevenson, Dufour and Lajambe all agree that wherever the new Neighbourhood Resource Centre will be, it should be located in the downtown.",[]

Beatty said the centre was losing the college roughly $500,000 each year. With new safety guidelines in place and day cares only being allowed to accept 50 per cent of their capacity, the cost of staying open was going to be too expensive.

“He will be an excellent chancellor for Algoma University, particularly in this period of program and enrolment growth where we will welcome increasing numbers of students and employees locally, provincially, nationally and from across the world.”

Born in Italy, and immigrating to Canada as a young child, he had a 42-year career in education, including nine years as director of education for the Algoma District School Board. ""Turco has become a passionate advocate for student success, equity and public education,"" the university said.

Working with the Canadian Mental Health Association Cochrane-Timiskaming branch, the program pairs clients with one-bedroom housing from participating landlords, helps subsidize rent and provides mental health and life skills supports.

Brian Marks, CAO of the social services board, told CTV it’s a switch away from the shelter system to focus on what it hopes is a more sustainable solution.

“Long-term, it’s the continued application of those supports that will determine the success of this program,” Marks said. “Getting somebody housed for a day: great, it was a success. Keeping them housed for six months, 12 months, 18 months, that’s where the work really comes in.”

Making an ‘impactful change’

Marks said getting landlords on board for the program didn’t take much convincing, as long as the social services board could guarantee rent, along with added incentives like damage costs.

Clients stay in the program for as long as necessary, until they can cover rent on their own and no longer need as many supports. So far, Marks said at least 20 clients have been housed.

Paul Jalbert, the mental health association’s local executive director, said the program is still a work in progress and will require adjustments as community partners figure out the most effective ways to address client needs.

But with the pandemic seeming to put the world on hold, he said this is the time to explore different tactics.

Focus on building self-reliance

“It lets us really take a step back and say ‘OK, if we’re going to make meaningful, impactful change, this is an opportunity to do it,’” Jalbert said in a Zoom interview. ""Let’s see what we can get out of this, let’s see what we can learn from it.

""It’s a very action-oriented project but in the background, we’re collecting information ... that lets us know if we’re on the right track.”

If the program works, Jalbert said it will be something the association and the services board can take to other communities as an example of how this approach worked in Timmins. If it doesn’t, he said they will keep looking for better options.

But Marks said he’s now convinced that a housing-first approach is the best method to give the homeless population a pathway to break out of that cycle. And when compared to the shelter system, he said it will end up saving the community money since it would reduce the cost for hospitals, paramedics and police.",[]

Many, like Nicole Graham and her husband, Allen, worried COVID-19 would leave food markets closed, which made it all the more of a relief as the market joined others across the province in returning for another season.

“We put in 12 acres of garden, so we’re going ‘Do we take the leap? Where do we sell this if markets don’t open?’” said Graham. “But we were happy to hear that they all opened up.”

Graham said as she’s taken her farm, Graham Acres, to markets in Timmins, Iroquois Falls and Kirkland Lake, she has seen the effort put into adhering to physical distancing and hygiene standards.

Communities have been passionately supporting local businesses, she said, including her farm's meat products during the province’s economic lockdown.

Noella Rinaldo, the Downtown Timmins BIA’s executive director, said markets will be crucial in supporting local producers through the crisis.

“I think if there’s one thing that people understood during COVID, it’s that food security is very important,” Rinaldo said. “So supporting local and supporting our farmers, it’s very important that we do this.”

Aside from the pandemic, farmer Marion Veens said the high temperatures this summer have taken a toll on vegetable production, since plants react to the heat by growing out their leaves instead of their produce.

That will contribute to a tough year ahead for her business, Sunrise Orchards and Produce, Veens said. Having open food markets means an opportunity to battle through both the health and economic crisis.

“Now that the markets have opened ... we’re happy and as long as people keep their safe distance, we’re a go.”",[]

After a thorough search, the kitten was found in a car fender and has now been given the name ‘Fender.’

Fender is about 10 weeks old and was found under Shirley Anderson’s car, who was able to rescue the distressed feline.

“I glanced at the side of the road and I saw this little black thing hopping and I thought it was a weasel,"" Anderson said. ""I look over and see a man trying to stop traffic and I realized it was a kitten. So I did a U-turn, got out and tried to help rescue this kitten. As I approached … a vehicle almost hit the kitten, then she ran under my car,”

Anderson said someone from nearby Speedy Glass helped her look for Fender for close to an hour Tuesday afternoon.

“We kept on trying and trying, then another man from Fountain Tire named Corey came by and he said, 'hold on I’ll go get a jack,'' she said. ""He jacked up the car and went under the fender, and there she was. She was terrified.”

Anderson then called SAINTS Rescue Sudbury, which stands for 'Safeguarding Animals In Need Today Society,' and a volunteer immediately picked her up.

Found good homes

“We got the cat, we put her in the carrier and I brought her home and now it’s time to get the cat to relax, know that it’s safe,” said Carole Gascon, a volunteer at SAINTS.

Officials with SAINTS said the number of applications to adopt a cat has doubled this summer. Just last month, 32 cats were adopted, which they say is significantly higher than June of 2019.

“We believe we have found good homes for them,” said Gascon. ""Last year in comparison, nothing was moving. People were busy, we had kittens that were being adopted late in the year and now they don’t even make it to the shelter. They are pre-adopted. We have a waiting list of people wanting to adopt cats and kittens.”

Volunteers say COVID plays a big role in that.

“People have the time to spend to get the cat accustomed to their new home and to train it,” said Gascon.

Officials with SAINTS said donations are vital at this time. Money donated goes to feeding the cats and getting them the medical help they need.

Fender will be looking for her forever home in a few weeks.",[]

While he was expecting to step outside to play hockey with his big brother, a few other players wanted to join in. Among them was NHL star and Sudbury's own Tyler Bertuzzi.

""What I heard is we're just going to take a couple (of) shots, (then) go swimming,"" Lukah said. ""So my big brother mentioned something about the news and stuff … so I walked out the door and I just see a bunch of people there!""

Accompanying Bertuzzi was Sudbury Wolves winger Gio Biondi, who has stopped by a few times before to play with Lukah, a goalie in the Sudbury Minor Hockey Association.

""Just the fact that I thought it would be a normal day and then all of this happened,"" said Lukah, moments after playing with the NHL star.

Nine-year-old Lukah was diagnosed with a brain tumour in November 2019. The devastating diagnosis came just a few months after his aunt faced a similar situation.

""Hearing the news is surreal, it's shocking,"" said Lisa Labrecque, Lukah's mother. ""But we're working with doctors in Toronto and (getting) scans every five months.""

After noticing Lukah was often fatigued and suffering from headaches, the family doctor suggested an MRI, given the recent family history.

""We try not to talk about it,"" said Lisa. ""I don't want to bring him down or get him frustrated or scared, so we treat him like a nine-year-old boy.""

Following his most recent scans earlier this month, that is exactly the advice given to the family by physicians.

With no growth in the tumour, Lukah was told to continue to live life as he normally would.

Despite the recent positive outlook, the last year has not been an easy time for the Labrecque family. That's when friend and community activist Kim Brouzes decided that a morale boost was in order.

""So I contacted Tyler Bertuzzi and said ‘this kid could use a good day, a good memory, certainly a good experience,’"" said Brouzes. ""So Tyler jumped on board … Luca got to deflect or play goalie against a Sudbury Wolves player and an NHL player and it worked beautifully!""

Brouzes and Bertuzzi are now spearheading the annual NHL Charity Golf Tournament, which had to be cancelled this year due to concerns surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic.

With funding needed for local agencies, such as the Northern Ontario Families of Children with Cancer (NOFCC), Brouzes realized Bertuzzi's smile provided a unique opportunity to sell face-masks showing off his infamous toothless grin.

""What we did was we recreated Tyler Bertuzzi's smile, missing the one tooth, so it is a smile that you can't miss and can't replace,"" laughed Brouzes, while wearing one herself.

Knowing the cause was important and was helping families such as the Labrecques, Bertuzzi was on board.

""It's funny,"" said Bertuzzi. ""It's a little bit of both, obviously the safety part of it, but the funny part of it (too). It's going to be good and I'm excited to get these sold and get the money to charity.""

The masks are being sold for $70, with all funds going directly to the NOFCC, which works to provide financial relief for families of children fighting cancer. The organization helps those families cover costs such as travel expenses and medications not covered by OHIP and tutoring costs.

""This is a wonderful replacement for (the charity golf tournament),"" said Dayna Caruso, executive director of the NOFCC. ""We're definitely always looking for fundraisers that we can accomplish from a distance throughout this time because NOFCC doesn't have a lot of funding coming in, but obviously over the last couple of days we've seen some very great initiatives come out of the community.""

For families like the Labrecques, relying on support like that and from the community is priceless.

Not only did the two hockey players show up for Lukah, so did nearly two dozen neighbours and friends, who were all gathered in social bubbles to show their support.

""I can't even say enough for this community,"" said Brouzes. ""So within a few minutes and with a few phone calls…we had half the community here cheering on Lukah. But more importantly, showing him for a brief moment the heat doesn't matter, the brain tumour doesn't matter and he got an experience of a lifetime that he will remember for a lifetime.""

In addition to the priceless memories, Lukah left with some tangible gifts, including a signed hockey stick and one of the new Bertuzzi face masks.

Missing from the action was Sudbury's other major NHL star, Nick Foligno, captain of the Columbus Blue Jackets. But he made sure to send Lukah a video greeting to show his support.

That message, along with nearly a few dozen neighbours, was enough to overwhelm the family with gratitude.

""What do you say to that? There (are) no words,"" said Lisa. ""Holding his hand in the MRI machine versus this, you can't compare. This is amazing.""

Those sentiments echoed by her son.

""It means everybody is here to look out for me,"" said Lukah.

If you would like more information on purchasing a Tyler Bertuzzi face mask, you can email kim@atrcc.ca, follow the social media channels of Active Therapy+ or contact the NOFCC.",[]

Dr. Penny Sutcliffe, the area's medical officer of health, is also requiring passengers aboard city transit vehicles to wear masks. Both directives take effect on July 8.

“The face-covering requirement for commercial premises that are open to the public is in addition to the diligent work many are already doing to ensure physical distancing and hand sanitizers,"" Sutcliffe said in a news release Friday. ""Face coverings are extra protection to prevent COVID-19 spread, they also send a message that the wearer wants to protect others.”

She said the measures are in tandem with the gradual reopening of the province, which brings new risks of spreading the virus.

“Establishing common expectations about routine face-covering helps reduce this risk now and will pave the way to successful Stage 3 re-opening,"" Sutcliffe said. ""It will also help protect us against a potential second wave in the fall and keep businesses and services up and running.”

As of July 8, city transit and businesses will have to have policies in place to stop people from entering if they are not wearing a face covering. The instructions are being issued under the authority of the provincial Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act, Public Health Sudbury said.

Businesses don't have to turn away customers

While commercial establishments are expected to use their best efforts to implement their face covering policies, there is no requirement that a business must turn away the customer not wearing a mask.

""This is in line with the 'good faith' enforcement framework of the Public Health Sudbury & Districts instructions, which builds on education and reminders,"" the release said.

In the instruction letter sent out Friday, all employers are reminded of their ongoing responsibilities to maintain two metres distance between employees and clients, to screen employees and members of the public for COVID-19 symptoms, and to promote excellent hygiene practices including handwashing.

For the purposes of the directive, a face-covering means a medical or non-medical mask or other face coverings such as a bandana, a scarf or cloth that covers the mouth and nose. Certain exemptions apply, for example, based on age or medical circumstances.

“I encourage everyone to be kind, patient, and respectful to one another,"" Sutcliffe said. ""How we navigate this pandemic is our individual and our shared responsibility. These latest instructions continue to count on everyone’s best intentions and my confidence is well placed. I fully expect we will show the province and the world how to do this right.""

Growing evidence shows the widespread use of face coverings decreases the spread of respiratory droplets, and expert opinion supports the widespread use of face coverings to decrease transmission of COVID-19.

Public Health is also reminding residents to follow public health guidance—wash your hands; cover your cough or sneeze with your arm or a tissue; avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth; stay two metres apart from others; wear your face covering, and stay home when ill.

If you have any COVID-19 symptoms, get tested. People who are asymptomatic, who are concerned that they have been exposed to COVID-19 are also encouraged to contact an assessment centre and get tested.

Region of Waterloo Public Health Region's Acting Medical Officer of Health Dr. Hsiu Li Wang said the region was notified on the move into Stage 3 on Monday afternoon.

""This will be a welcome update for many in our community,"" she said. ""We are able to move to Stage 3 because of the efforts of our residents to date.""

Dr. Wang said people will need to remain vigilant as more businesses open their doors.

""I ask all residents to please continue to follow the public health measures to slow the spread of COVID-19 in our community,"" she added.

Mandatory masking bylaws came into effect in the region on Monday. People need to wear masks in all indoor public spaces and on public transit, with some exceptions.

Waterloo Mayor Dave Jaworsky said the move into Stage 3 is ""welcome news for those businesses who have been waiting patiently.""

""We can't lost sight of the fact, however, that we are still in the midst of a pandemic and we cannot let our guard down,"" an emailed statement from Jaworsky said in part. ""This is still a serious issue and we must follow physical distancing.""

He also advised businesses to be deliberate in their plans to welcome people back through their doors and stick to guidelines from public health officials to avoid another shut down in the future.

""Only open when you're absolutely ready, don't rush it,"" he said. ""Nothing is more important than keeping everyone healthy.""

Indoor gathering sizes will increase to up to 50 people, a large increase from the 10 people currently allowed under Stage 2. Outdoor gatherings can be up to 100 people under Stage 3. People will need to maintain physical distance if they're gathering with people outside of their social circle.

The provincial government says certain activities won't be allowed because they are considered high-risk for the spread of COVID-19, including amusement parks, water parks, buffets, dancing at restaurants, and saunas and steam rooms.

SIU Director Joseph Martino said based on preliminary inquiries “it is apparent that the SIU is without jurisdiction to continue with the investigation,” as the injuries sustained do not amount to a “serious injury” within the SIU’s terms.

It was reported on the night of June 23, Essex OPP officers responded to a mischief call and located a 26-year-old man. After a struggle, the man was arrested and placed in the back of a police cruiser.

A news release from SIU states that while in the back of the cruiser “the man smashed his head and face off the plexiglass partition in the rear with great force.”

He was then taken to the hospital by EMS.

Martino said originally the matter was reported to the SIU as involving a brain bleed and concussion, however, upon reviewing the man’s medical records he was taken to the hospital where his injuries were determined to be a “subdural hematoma of no significant mass or effect.”

Since the man’s injuries do not fall within the terms of the SIU’s jurisdiction the investigation has been discontinued and the file closed.

""Today's investments will improve the accessibility and reliability of bus services in Barrie,"" said the Honourable Mary Ng, Minister of Small Business, Export Promotion and International Trade.

The government is investing $16.4 million into a new transit hub at the Allandale GO Station, a new connection hub downtown, bus stops and platforms, and additional bicycle parking.

The bulk of the money will be put towards replacing ageing city buses with 30 new, low-floor, accessible buses.

The province and city each pledged more than $10 million to this plan last year.

Barrie Mayor Jeff Lehman said he's thrilled to be able to link to different modes of transportation all under one roof.

""This combined federal, provincial and municipal investment in Barrie will offer our community updated and more accessible buses, and the new transit hub will ensure a better connected and integrated city. It will improve the ability of residents to travel and get to work, make connections and provide more active transportation options as our city grows,"" said Lehman.

The new Allandale Transit Hub was supposed to be completed by early next year, but with the design still in the works, the new timeline is likely to be late 2022 or early 2023.",[]

A policy that requires face coverings for masks to enter at all indoor businesses, organizations, and to ride public transit takes effect Monday.

There are some exemptions for those with medical conditions, children under the age of five, those with religious reasons, and those who are unable to remove the mask without help.

For many businesses that have lost revenue during the COVID-19 pandemic, masks mean an additional financial pinch.

Will Smith, owner of Say It With Love Bridal in Barrie, has struggled since reopening mid-May without weddings, proms, or graduations.

Smith says staff members will be ensuring that customers are aware of the protocols, and will provide a mask for those who don't have one.

""They are not cheap. They are over a dollar for a disposable mask. It's proving to cost us a lot of money,"" Smith said.

Despite the cost, Smith would rather provide a mask than lose a customer.

At Centennial Beach on Sunday, many people said they felt safer with face masks being in effect, and they're confident that most of Simcoe-Muskoka residents will comply.

The public health unit says they are focusing on education before enforcement. But individuals could ultimately face tickets of $750-$100,000 if they don't follow the rules. Corporations could be fined up to $10-million a day for an offence.",[]

The bodies of Norah and Romy Carpentier, aged 11 and 6, were located in a wooded area in the community of St-Apollinaire, Que.

Provincial police say they continue to focus their hunt for Martin Carpentier near where the girls' bodies were found after discovering items they say are of interest to their investigation.

Police did not specify what the items were but raised the possibility Carpentier could be unconscious or dead.

They say a helicopter, a drone and police dogs are all involved in the search.

The girls were last seen Wednesday and became the subject of an Amber Alert the next day.

On Sunday, the manhunt for their 44-year-old father had authorities tightening the search in a thickly wooded area near where the young sisters from Levis, Que. were found.

Residents had helped with the searches until Saturday, but police asked people to stay away from the area Sunday to let officers work.

The case has gripped the attention of the province, especially in the town of just over 6,000 people where it's playing out.

Police have said the girls and their father were believed to have been in a car crash on Highway 20 in St-Apollinaire Wednesday evening.

Investigators said the car was heading east when it skidded into the median, flipped over and landed on the shoulder on the opposite side of the highway.

An Amber Alert had been issued for Romy, six, and Norah, 11, in Levis, south of Quebec City on Thursday. It was lifted earlier Saturday when the bodies were found. The girls had gone missing along with their father Martin Carpentier, 44, after a crash on Highway 20.

The search continues for the father. In a tweet Saturday night, the SQ wrote that all necessary resources had been deployed for the manhunt, including helicopters, ATV patrollers and dog handlers.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted about the girls' deaths late Saturday night, calling the events an ""incomprehensible tragedy for any parent.""

This is a developing story and will be updated as more details emerge.

ITEMS FOUND THAT MAY BE RELATED

SQ officers searching the Saint-Appollinaire area for the two girls and their father found some objects on Friday that they thought might suggest the girls were alive and on the move.

“We found some objects yesterday, but we can find a lot of different objects in the woods, so what we have to do right now is to be sure that those objects could be related to Martin Carpentier and his two daughters,” said Mathieu Saturday.

A command post was established on Friday on Veilleux Street, south of Rang Bois Joly.

Quebec provincial police ATV, horse, K-9 and foot patrols searched the heavily wooded area along with search and rescue volunteers since the Amber Alert began.

GIRLFRIEND MAKES DESPERATE PLEA

Martin Carpentier's girlfriend, Cathy Gingras, recorded a desperate plea to him on Friday morning, shared by the SQ on Twitter.

""Martin, we're worried. We haven't heard anything from you since the accident. We want to know if you're okay, and the girls, Romy, Norah. We want to know if they're okay... if you're okay. Give us some news, let us know, call your parents, whatever it is. The important thing is that you're all alright,"" she said. ""We just want to know you're alright.""

An SQ helicopter was deployed to search the wooded area.

The SQ also told CTV that it had received word that a neighbour heard screams in the middle of the night. But police wouldn't confirm if it was related to this case.

Premier Legault said Friday afternoon that about 80 people were involved in the search, both on the ground and in the air, and that the province had put all of its resources into finding the girls.

The three were last seen alive Wednesday at 8:30 p.m. in the Saint-Nicholas neighbourhood of Levis, near a convenience store, police said.

At 9:30 p.m. a 2008 Volkswagen Passat with the licence plate P75 PXV was involved in a crash on Highway 20 east in nearby Saint-Apollinaire. When emergency services arrived, the vehicle was unoccupied.



Saint-Apollinaire Mayor Bernard Ouellet said the crash took place in a rural area about four kilometres from the main exit off the highway into town.

""There are many wooded areas -- many, many wooden areas -- but there are many rural roads, too. It's not completely isolated,"" said Ouellet about the territory around the crash site, which he added also contains several small cottages and shacks.

He said residents began searching their properties for any sign of the three.



""It's worrying everyone a little bit,"" he said.



DESPERATE PLEA FROM MOTHER

Their loved ones said after the crash that they have reason to be concerned for their health and safety. Authorities say they don't know the reason for the disappearance and have spoken to witnesses and family members.



""All the hypotheses are on the table, and kidnapping is among them,"" SQ spokesperson Audrey-Anne Bilodeau said Thursday, ""but the priority for us is that we have missing people that could be injured.""

The girls' mother posted photos of them on Facebook on Thursday with a plea for help: ""We need to find my daughters and their dad.""



WITNESS SAW CRASH, SEARCHED FOR MISSING FAMILY



A woman driving in the area, Lyne Provencher, said she witnessed the crash.



She said she saw a car headed toward Quebec City fly off the road, hit a sign and some trees, and then flip over.

""I was driving towards Montreal when I saw a cloud of dust and, boom, the car ended up in front of me suddenly,"" Provencher said, adding that she had to think fast to avoid a collision.

""I stopped on the side of the road and I ran to see if there were people inside – nobody,"" she said, adding that three people called authorities at the same time.

""We were screaming and panicking,"" she said.

When firefighters arrived, they used spotlights to search the area.

""Only Martin's cell phone was in the car,"" she said. ""His stepfather called saying he was waiting for Martin to arrive, and that he's told him he was going for ice cream with his daughters,"" adding that he thought it had been a long time.

Provencher said authorities then contacted the girls' mother to inform her and ask if she had her daughters with her, since the children didn't appear to have been in the car.

Provencher shot video from the scene and posted it to Facebook. The post has since been removed.

""There's nobody. The tires are blown out, the windows are blown out. There's no one in the car or in the field,"" she is heard saying in the video. ""It's crazy. I don't understand.""



Provencher said she hoped the person was safe, noting there were child seats in the car.

""I really hope there wasn't a child in the car, because it's really serious. The car is finished,"" she said.

It is possible that one or all of the three missing people are injured, said Surete du Quebec spokesperson Stephane Tremblay.



The subsequent police investigation led officers to launch the Amber Alert Thursday afternoon.



""The car is very damaged and that's why we are looking for them, to see what condition they are in,"" said police spokesperson Anik Lamirande, adding that signs point to the three leaving the scene of the crash on foot.

For many Canadians, a cottage by the lake is a dream that more people are trying to make a reality.

""We have had record sales,"" said realtor Catharine Inniss, Johnston and Daniel Rushbrooke Realty.

In June 2019, 161 cottages were sold in the District of Muskoka while last month, 278 were sold, which is an increase of 73 per cent year over year.

Jodi Kovitz lives in a condo in downtown Toronto with her daughter and said she's on the hunt for a Muskoka cottage.

""We're doing great. We're healthy, and we live in 11-hundred square feet, and we haven't really left it for four months,"" Kovitz said she's looking to find her dream cottage.

It's a trend taking shape across the world.

A recent article in the Wall Street Journal reported 39 per cent of urban dwellers in the United States are thinking about moving somewhere more rural because of the pandemic.

But if you are considering a move, Inniss has some tips, including using a local realtor.

""They know whether there's flooding, shore allowances, septics, etc.,"" she explained.

Inniss added that while properties are moving quickly, there are still plenty out there.

Local real estate agents expect prices to continue to climb slowly and demand in cottage country to remain high through the fall.",[]

The borough of Montreal North has had 2,572 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the most of any of the city's boroughs. The borough also has the highest incidence of COVID-19 in Montreal, with 3053.4 cases per 100,000 residents.

The board of directors terminated her contract ""with regret,"" and the decision is ""applicable as of today,"" according to a news release Monday.

Since last year, the museum has seen several key employees leave, and disturbing testimonies have come to light from employees, the organization said.

Last October, the union alerted the board of directors. External firm Cabinet RH was then mandated to shed light on the situation.

The firm's report mentioned a major and multifaceted deterioration in the work environment that certain employees described as ""toxic,"" according to the MMFA.

""The gravity of the reported facts convinced the board of directors to immediately initiate discussions with Bondil in order to find solutions to this situation deemed unacceptable,"" the release read.

The board reported ""repeated attempts"" over the past few months to find a solution, arguing that they ""came up against Ms. Bondil's inflexibility and her denial of several conclusions without, however, wanting to appeal the report.""

""Given the gravity of the reported facts, our commitment to the employees who convey the Museum's values on a daily basis was unequivocal,"" said Michel de la Cheneliere, MMFA board chairperson.

Bondil's refusal to accept a settlement proposal ""that would have allowed all parties to begin a smooth transition by the end of her contract scheduled for the end of June 2021, convinced the board of directors to immediately end her job as executive director and chief curator,"" the statement said.

""It is regrettable that a remarkable association of more than 21 years between the Museum and Ms. Bondil is ending in this way,"" said de la Cheneliere.

With Bondil's departure, and until a successor is appointed, an interim executive director will be appointed by the board’s executive committee. An international recruitment process will be established shortly, the board said.

The Agence Preste decision to end all collaboration with him was announced on Facebook Monday.

“The values of respect and tolerance are in Preste's DNA and are non-negotiable. We unreservedly condemn anyone who departs from it in any form whatsoever,” the agency wrote.

Parent responded to the allegations Monday morning by posting a video on his Facebook page.

“I feel that there is a wave of cries for justice, and I cannot help but support this movement. I made a lot of mistakes in my life and I said a lot of nonsense. I take responsibility for them,” he said. “There is a big tidal wave of awareness and cries for justice... It goes beyond me and my opinion and the desire to defend myself or something like that. This is not what I want to do. I want to listen, understand and be there.

“And for my delinquencies, my misconduct and all that you want to name one after the other, it is important that the context comes out... There is no context, it's a little ‘free for all’ as they say, but I assume and I know it's going to be a ‘rough’ trip for me the next few times, but I hope it will be useful for something.”

The singer said he sincerely apologizes and that he will “pay his debts in due course, when we tell him how.”

Parent’s name is added to the list of several Quebec personalities who have seen their business and creative partners distance themselves following allegations made on social media.

Host Maripier Morin lost her sponsporship with BonLook eyewear and the Blush lingerie line, in addition to seeing Bell Media withdraw the series featuring her on the Vrak, Z and Crave platforms.

The singer Yann Perreau was dropped by the record company Bonsound and the agency Hotel Particulier, while Maybe Watson was shown the door by Alaclair Ensemble, the Quebec rap group of which he was one of the founding members. The Dare To Care label cut ties with singer Bernard Adamus, before being expelled in turn by ADISQ due to charges against its president Eli Bissonnette.

Ha Vi Doan's proposed class-action lawsuit filed in Federal Court seeks unspecified damages for her and other Canadians whose photos were allegedly part of a massive database compiled by U.S. firm Clearview AI and used by the Mounties.

Clearview AI's technology worries many privacy advocates because it allows for the collection of huge numbers of images from multiple sources with the aim of helping police forces, financial institutions and other clients identify individuals.

The federal privacy commissioner said this month the company will stop offering its facial-recognition services in Canada in response to an investigation by the commissioner and three provincial counterparts.

Clearview's retreat includes an indefinite suspension of the company's contract with the RCMP, its last remaining client in Canada.

The Mounties said in February that their National Child Exploitation Crime Centre had two licences for the Clearview AI application and had used it in 15 cases, resulting in the identification and rescue of two children.

Generally, the better the weather is, the more drownings there are per year because there are more people in, around and on the water, according to Raynald Hawkins, the executive director of the Lifesaving Society's Quebec branch (a nonprofit that aims to promote safe interactions with water).

Data shows the main culprit for child drownings in Quebec in 2019 was distracted supervision or a lack of supervision altogether. Specifically, 87 per cent of drownings in the province last year occurred because of inadequate supervision.

Hawkins explained that part of the problem is children having direct access to bodies of water – pools or otherwise.

“It doesn’t matter if it’s an above-ground pool, or in-ground pool, or semi in-ground pool, or inflatable pool,” Hawkins said. “The point is kids cannot have a direct access from the house to the backyard pool.”

But beyond that, distracted supervision from parents is also a major problem. In normal times, distractions include checking phones, reading books, or quickly ducking indoors to make snacks or to answer the landline, Hawkins explained.

But with parents working from home amid the pandemic, they may choose to multitask.

A recent poll by Allstate Canada shows that 52 per cent of Quebec parents who own or are thinking of getting a pool are planning on working from home at least occasionally this summer, 43 per cent of which say they will supervise their children in the pool while they do so.

“This (will be) a big distraction for the parents,” Hawkins said.

The Lifesaving Society and Allstate Canada both strongly advise against distracted supervision.

“When you have a backyard pool or when you take the decision to work at your cottage and you’re close to the water… You don’t want to combine work and supervising the kids during their bathing and swimming activities,” Hawkins said.

PREVENTATIVE MEASURES

In order to protect children from drowning, Hawkins said as soon as they can walk, they should be taught to avoid pools and other bodies of water the way they’re taught to avoid cars.

“You cannot cross the street without mom and dad... You cannot go near the water without mom and dad,"" Hawkins said. ""And when you want to go in the water, you need to wear this flotation device.”

Hawkins said that by using this method, children get into the habit of asking their parents to put on their floaties any time they want to play near the water.

This is especially important because a lot of drownings take place independently of swimming activities, Hawkins said.

“Parents try to find their kids and they find them in the bottom of the swimming pool,” Hawkins said.

Parents are encouraged to use this website to self-evaluate their pool's safety.",[]

Prosecutor Amelie Rivard presented testimony today to Judge Alexandre Dalmau from three people who claim to have been victims of inappropriate touching and exhibitionism by Salvail.

Salvail is charged with sexual assault, harassment and unlawful confinement in connection with events alleged to have occurred between April and October 1993 against his former co-worker, Donald Duguay.

Rivard is attempting to challenge Salvail's earlier testimony, when he said multiple times that he did not behave in inappropriate ways and is not the type of person Duguay is alleging him to be.

Duguay has agreed to be identified publicly but the identities of the three people who offered new testimony against Salvail are under a publication ban.

Salvail's defence is asking the judge to reject the prosecution's request to admit the evidence.

What was once strongly recommended by public health to limit the spread of COVID-19 became mandatory on July 13, though authorities have factored in a two-week grace period during which people won’t be turned away from the services if they show up without a mask.

As of July 27, no one will be allowed to enter a bus or metro in the province if they aren’t wearing one, Quebec Premier Francois Legault said. He made the announcement during a press briefing at the end of June and attributed the decision to the gradual reopening of businesses across the province.

“We went progressively with this, but of course, the more we’ve opened businesses and stores, the more people there are on public transportation,"" he said at the time. “Now I think that we are at a new stage.”

The new rule applies to everyone across the province aged 12 and up. Children between two and 12 years old are not required to wear masks but are still strongly recommended to do so, while it isn’t necessary for those under two.

Fines will not be issued to users who try to enter without masks, however.

""The only consequence will be that you cannot use the transport,"" Legault said, adding that there won’t be officers on site to enforce the rules. “…We will be asking people who manage public transportation not let people without a mask go in.”

Montreal’s transit agency, the Societe de transport de Montreal (STM), says some of the details of the new requirement are unclear – like what happens if someone takes off their mask during a ride.

""That's a good example of how difficult it is,” STM chair Philippe Schnobb told CTV News last week.

The STM’s union for bus drivers says its members don’t want to be responsible for enforcing the rules.

“If someone gets into a metro station with a mask and takes it off in the car, you might understand that it will be very difficult for someone in charge at the STM” to know how to respond, Schnobb said.

The hope is that Montrealers will comply on their own.

In an effort to make the transition run smoothly, the STM will be handing out 1.5 million masks between now and September.

The city of Montreal announced last week the wearing of masks will be mandatory in closed public spaces as of July 27 as well.

According to his LinkedIn profile, Derennes has been with Ubisoft since 1997 and has worked as the executive vice-president of production for its Montreal studio.

In addition to Mallat’s departure, the accusations that swept over Ubisoft also saw the resignation of creative director Serge Hascoët. Cécile Carnet, the human resources manager, has also left the company.

In her message, Burgess Quemard said of letting Mallat go: ""This decision is difficult, but necessary given the magnitude of the problems raised in recent weeks at our studios in Montreal and Toronto.""

Below is the letter in full.

Mr. Premier,

Thirty years ago, Quebec entered one of its worst human, social, and political crises. The climate of violence that we witnessed from July to the end of September 1990 had dramatic consequences, including the death of a serving police officer.

Although the Oka crisis has sadly left its indelible mark in our minds, it can still serve as a reference because nothing has really changed in thirty years. However, the social and political divide between First Nations and part of the Quebec population is the result of decades of injustice and forced measures. It is obvious that subjecting an entire population to such actions can only leave wounds that are still open today. Quebec is no exception in this regard; examples abound around the world.

The AFNQL is addressing you today, publicly, first to respectfully acknowledge the memory of the summer of 1990 and to share with you, as Premier of Quebec, ways to prevent history from repeating itself.

The COVID-19 pandemic, police misconduct of a racist nature, a sad thirtieth anniversary, it is in this sensitive context that the debate on racism and discrimination is resurfacing in Quebec, to which the systemic nature is added, whether we like it or not.

Systemic racism and discrimination are not just concepts or theoretical notions. Rather, they are a set of facts and behaviors and we should not be afraid to name and denounce them if we are genuinely willing to correct them.

From the point of view of the AFNQL, when a people denies the fundamental rights of another on the basis of its race, we are in the presence of racism. When this denial is formally and systematically exercised by a State, we are in the presence of systemic racism and discrimination. Again, let us not be afraid of words. They help us face reality.

We must be reminded that the United Nations adopted the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples more than ten years ago, with the aim of breaking with such behavior and proposing viable solutions to States to redefine their relations with Indigenous peoples on a respectful basis. Moreover, the Declaration called for minimal standards to ensure the survival, the dignity and wellbeing of Indigenous peoples. In our view, the political decisions that led to the Oka crisis are a perfect example of actions to be prohibited under the Declaration.

The lesson could easily have been learned.

Against all odds, through recent court actions, your government is today challenging the fundamental right of First Nations to be self-governing, our right to take charge of our own services for our families and children.

Must we remind the premier that denying our right to self-determination will only make us redouble our collective efforts to ensure that Indigenous peoples get the respect they deserve? Putting so much energy and resources into impeding First Nations' desire to better serve their populations will only exacerbate systemic racism and discrimination.

It is difficult to be optimistic in the search for constructive solutions when the wounds of the relationship that should unite us are still contaminated by contempt.

We need to learn from the past and act to move in the right direction, one that will ensure that there is no turning back on mutually agreed principles. As leaders, we share the duty to find a path that is respectful and beneficial to our respective peoples. It is a matter, Mr. Premier, of willingness.

In Peace and Friendship,

238,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/pattie-lovett-reid-why-not-all-seniors-are-cheering-government-aid-1.5013719,Pattie Lovett-Reid: Why not all seniors are cheering government aid,[],2020-07-08 08:03:00-04:00,"TORONTO -- Not all seniors are cheering when it comes to government aid.

On the one hand the government is helping high-risk Canadians get through a tough financial situation. Government benefits are seen by many as the financial lifeline they needed as jobs were lost, income reduced and financial futures were put on shaky ground due to the pandemic.

On the other hand the government will be taking back some of the financial lifeline it provided. The government benefits such as the CERB will be taxed and is considered to be income. Some aren't thinking about this today but it will become a issue when 2020 taxes are filed.

Others such as seniors who currently qualify for the Guaranteed Income Supplement are worried government aid might actually compromise their lifestyle. This fear of struggling financially isn't new to seniors who are vulnerable and barely making ends meet. Especially those who collect the Guaranteed Income Supplement and maybe generate a little bit of income from a side hustle yet still manage to come in below threshold limits.

In 2020 seniors are eligible to receive GIS if they are: A single senior with a total annual income of less than $18,600. A couple both receiving Old Age Security and with a combined annual income of less than $24,576.

Fear is mounting among low-income seniors who are receiving government aid and who may also be living in subsidized housing that is income-tested. The government aid they receive via CERB may push them out of the eligibility requirements for relief on rent. If this happens they will be hit twice - potentially higher rent and taxation on the benefit. Add to this the concern the GIS could be clawed, which has some wondering if the government benefit will do more harm than good to their financial situation.

Now to be fair, not all government aid will be taxed. It doesn't apply to the one-time special payment seniors will be receiving this week. To add some context, there are currently 6.7 million seniors who are eligible for the OAS pension and 2.2 million who are eligible for the GIS.

Where it gets sticky is if you are a senior, low income and collecting the GIS, some will still qualify for the government program even if they have a side hustle that brings them in a little extra money. If they are no longer making that little bit of extra money due to COVID-19 they now qualify for the CERB. The problem is that it isn't tax-free money and given the amount it could be more than they were making and push their income higher. This may result in them earning too much to qualify for low-income housing.

As the government views financial aid and those most vulnerable, there is a reasonable expectation and case to be made for exemptions for some low-income seniors collecting GIS and who qualified for CERB So the question is: do they or don't take advantage of the government benefit?",[]

If I'm feeling it I know others are feeling it as well.

So, I felt it’s time to share some of the good news that can come out of a bad news scenario given the global pandemic has impacted so many Canadians.

RBC, Canada's largest bank has started to highlight weekly Canadians who have been doing selfless acts of kindness to help family, friends, even strangers while giving back to their communities. The project is being called Random Acts of Canadian and is being rolled out on a national basis.

I love this.

A program like this profiles how resilient we are as Canadians as we all struggle to cope with the ongoing stress of living through a global pandemic. People of all ages and from all walks of life are sharing their stories and doing great things.

My daughter Jane knows I love to be active and keep on the move so she shared with me the story of Guy Aiello who is about to turn 100. He wants to give back to his local hospital, PRHC Foundation, and hopes to raise $42,200 by beginning his journey on July 1 to conquer a 42.2K marathon, taking it one step at a time.

The Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB) shares that almost half of Canadians know a business that has had to close and 8 out of 10 people say they wish they could do more. The fact is, only half of small businesses are fully open and those that are open only one in three are back to pre-pandemic staffing levels and one in five is back to normal sales.

But we can do more and here is how: the CFIB has launched SmallBusinessEveryDay.ca and hopes Canadians will walk to a local business maybe buy a treat for a neighbour or purchases goods and services for themselves. In other words look for ways to support independent business everyday. Let's work to make #SmallBusinessEveryDay become a trend.

Even the Canadian government is getting in on the bandwagon to give back with the launching of the Canada Student Service Grant, which will allow post-secondary and recent grads to gain valuable experience while contributing to their communities. If a student decides to volunteer this summer they could receive a grant of between $1,000 and $5,000 depending on how many hours worked they have completed. Check out the Government of Canada website's ""I Want To Help"" portal.

The point here is that giving back shows no boundaries. It isn't age-restricted, gender-specific and crosses social barriers. Let's share some of the good that has come out such a bad situation.",[]

243,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/in-libel-case-depp-says-heard-hit-him-with-haymaker-punch-1.5021721,"In libel case, Depp says Heard hit him with 'haymaker' punch",['Jill Lawless'],2020-07-13 09:05:00-04:00,"LONDON -- Johnny Depp accused Amber Heard of hitting him with a ""haymaker"" punch during an altercation near the end of their volatile marriage, as the star wrapped up testimony in his libel suit against a British tabloid newspaper that accused him of domestic abuse.

Depp said the fight came after Heard's 30th birthday party, and hours after he had learned that his former business managers had absconded with hundreds of millions of dollars.

The Hollywood star is suing News Group Newspapers, publisher of The Sun, and the paper's executive editor, Dan Wootton, over an April 2018 article that called him a ""wife-beater."" He strongly denies abusing Heard.

Depp, 57, and Heard, 34, met on the set of the 2011 comedy ""The Rum Diary"" and married in Los Angeles in February 2015. Heard, a model and actress, filed for divorce the following year, and the divorce was finalized in 2017.

Depp said the couple separated after an argument that followed Heard's 30th birthday party in April 2016. The actor said that just before the party he had learned that his former business managers had ""stolen my money.""

Asked how much was stolen, Depp said ""this is a ludicrous amount to have to state, it's quite embarrassing -- apparently I had made $650 million,"" much of it through his involvement with the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films.

Depp added that in addition to losing the $650 million he was ""$100 million in the hole because they had not paid the government my taxes for 17 years.""

Depp and his former business managers settled a legal dispute over the alleged fraud in 2018.

Depp alleges that after the party he went to bed to read, and that Heard began accusing him of ruining her birthday dinner before throwing a ""haymaker"" at him.

Depp's lawyer, David Sherborne, asked him to explain the American slang term for the judge, Andrew Nicol.

""A haymaker is a type of a wild swing, a roundhouse punch ΓÇª effective if it reaches the target,"" Depp said.

""I have come across it,"" noted the judge.

Heard is attending the three-week trial and is scheduled to give her own version of events later.

During five days in the witness box, Depp depicted a tumultuous relationship with Heard during a period when he was trying to kick drugs and alcohol, and sometimes lapsing.

He called the relationship ""a crime scene waiting to happen."" But he denied Heard's claims that he slapped, hit, headbutted and threw things at her, and accused his ex-wife of compiling a dossier of fake claims against him as an ""insurance policy.""

Evidence in the trial has included video and audio recordings of Depp made by Heard. One photo discussed Monday shows Depp slumped and apparently unconscious with ice cream spilled over him.

Depp said the picture was taken in 2014 aboard a flight to the Bahamas, where he was going to try to break an addiction to opiod painkillers.

""I was obviously on the nod and very tired, falling asleep, and the ice cream then spilled all over my leg and then she took that ... and showed me the next day and said `Look at what you've become ... look at you, it's pathetic,""' he said.

The Sun's defence relies on a total of 14 allegations by Heard of Depp's violence between 2013 and 2016, in settings including his private island in the Bahamas, a rented house in Australia and a private jet.

Depp was followed into the witness box by his former personal assistant, Stephen Deuters, who contradicted Heard's account of an incident during a flight by private plane from Boston to Los Angeles in May 2014. Heard alleges the actor went into a rage, slapped her and kicked her in the back.

Deuters, who is now the European head of Depp's production company, said Depp was quiet and ""introverted"" on the plane. He acknowledged sending Heard a text message after the flight saying Depp was ""incredibly apologetic and knows that he has done wrong,"" but denied that meant he agreed with her version of events.

Deuters wrote in the text that ""when I told him he kicked you, he cried.""

He said he had used the word ""kicked"" because Heard had used it and he was trying to calm her down. He said Depp did not kick Heard.

""I was seeking probably to deflate the situation. ΓÇª It wasn't my job to be a relationship counsellor,"" he said.

Speaking of the couple's relationship, Deuters said ""I think they were two people that were in love with each other that shouldn't have been together.""

Depp has strongly denied all of Heard's allegations, including a claim that he subjected her to a ""three-day ordeal of assaults"" in March 2015 in Australia while he was filming a ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movie.

He agreed that the couple had an altercation, which ended up with their house being trashed and Depp's fingertip being severed to the bone.

Depp accuses Heard of cutting off his fingertip by throwing a vodka bottle at him, a claim she denies.

Depp said Monday that he had surgery on the severed finger when he returned to the U.S. and developed a ""painful"" superbug infection, MRSA.

Depp says the marriage broke down for good after an incident in which he accused Heard or one of her friends of defecating in the couple's bed after the April 2016 birthday party, a mishap Heard blamed on her Yorkshire terriers.

""I thought that was an oddly fitting end to the relationship,"" Depp said Friday.",[]

Quality Control Music announced the death of Rudolph ""Marlo"" Johnson in a social media post, saying he will be remembered as ""a man of great talent who feared nothing.""

A statement from the Atlanta Police Department says a man named Rudolph Johnson was killed late Saturday in what investigators believe was a targeted shooting.

Officers responded to a single-car wreck on Interstate 285 in Atlanta at about 11:30 p.m. Saturday night and found the driver, later identified as Johnson, dead inside his vehicle, the statement said. Investigators believe Johnson was shot while driving and was the intended target.

Police identified Johnson as 30 years old, while the social media post from Quality Control Music says he was born in 1993, which would make him around 27. Representatives for the record label did not immediately reply to a request for comment Sunday.

Johnson emerged in 2017 collaborating with rapper and friend Lil Baby on ""2 The Hard Way."" Earlier this year, the up-and-coming rapper released his project ""1st & 3rd"" featuring Future, Gucci Mane and Lil Baby.

In 2017 she became the first trans woman to appear on the cover of Vogue Paris. Two years later, she was the first openly transgender model to be hired by Victoria's Secret. Now in 2020, 23-year-old Valentina Sampaio continues to break barriers in the modeling industry by becoming the first transgender woman to be featured in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue.

The Brazilian model has been named as one of the edition's 2020 ""rookies,"" and models a white one-piece by Haus of Pink Lemonaid and a shimmery taupe bikini by Triangl.

Sports Illustrated (SI) has become a respected brand in the modeling world. Its swimsuit issue has featured some of the industry's most successful names, since launching 56 years ago. Sampaio is joining the elite ranks alongside stars like Heidi Klum and Tyra Banks.

In an open essay on what it means to be part of SI, Sampaio praised the magazine for creating another issue that champions ""a diverse set of multitalented, beautiful women in a creative and dignified way,"" adding that she is ""excited and honored"" to take part. While it means a lot to her to model for SI, she is even more inspired by the significance it has for the LGBTQ community as a whole.

Sampaio, who hails from a fishing village in northern Brazil, has been using her platform to fight for transgender rights. She explains that the beauty of her home country is contrasted by brutal crimes against the transgender community. In a previous interview with Vogue, she pointed out that in 2019, 129 transgender people were murdered in Brazil.

""Our protection comes from God. Even with the new laws, people don't widely respect and comply with them, and the authorities aren't enforcing them either,"" she was quoted as saying.

Her success as a model has not come easily, fighting an uphill battle against discrimination, but she realizes her status gives her the opportunity to make a positive difference. Beyond that, Sampaio believes it is her responsibility to stand up for Brazil's trans population. ""I recognize that I am one of the fortunate ones,"" she writes in SI, ""and my intention is to honor that as best I can.""

In recent years, transgender models have been gaining visibility -- landing ""firsts,"" such as magazine covers, beauty campaigns and spots on the runway. Personal journeys have also been shared to the public. In 2019, American model Nathan Westling, formerly Natalie, detailed his decision to transition in an exclusive interview with CNN Style. He has continued to model for top brands, including closing Helmut Lang's Summer-Spring 2020 runway at New York Fashion Week.

For Sampaio, change means leading by example and spreading love and acceptance one person at a time. ""I believe that better people build a better world for all of us, and I stand for any and everyone who, like me, suffers prejudice for not fitting into society's standards.""

Her message for the world is one of resounding empathy. She vows to persevere in her mission for equality and to continue to embolden people who are marginalized. Sampaio ended her essay, with gratitude.

""Thank you, SI, for seeing and respecting me as I truly am. For understanding that more than anything, I am human. Thank you for supporting me in continuing to spread a message of love, compassion and unity for ALL.""",[]

The band, who had previously been known as Lady Antebellum, filed a lawsuit in federal court on Wednesday seeking a ruling that their use of the trademark ""Lady A"" does not infringe on White's use of the same name. The band is not seeking monetary damages.

The Grammy-winning band made up of Hillary Scott, Charles Kelley and Dave Haywood, who are all white, changed their name last month saying they are regretful and embarrassed for not taking into consideration the word's associations with slavery.

White, who is Black, told Rolling Stone magazine in an article posted Friday that she felt like she was being erased. White said she had been performing as Lady A for more than 20 years.

""They claim to be allies and that they wanted to change their name out of the racist connotation, and then they sue a Black woman for the new name,"" White told the publication.

White said in negotiations with the band over the use of the name, she requested $10 million, half of which she would use to rebrand herself and the other half she would donate to charities of her choice, including those associated with Black Lives Matter.

""I have to rebrand myself. I don't want to have to share a name with you. And you shouldn't be allowed to just get a slap on the wrist,"" White said. ""I wanted my name. All I ever wanted was to keep my name in the blues genre doing what I did. I should not have to bend to (the band's) will because they've got money,"" she said.

The lawsuit said that the country group filed for a trademark for the name ""Lady A"" back in 2010.",[]

Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom are reopening Saturday, while Epcot and Disney's Hollywood Studios will follow four days later.

""It's the chance to come back and be in the magic,"" said Diane Watkins, a preschool teacher from Helena, Alabama, who visits the park about eight times a year. ""Hot or not, mask or not, we're just happy to be here. I feel like everybody here is in the same frame of mind. Everybody is just so excited to be here.""

Watkins said that when she and her 16-year-old daughter walked into the Magic Kingdom on Saturday morning, then saw all the cast members lined up and clapping on Main Street, she cried.

""It was very emotional,"" she said.

The reopening comes as a huge surge of Floridians have tested positive for the new coronavirus in recent weeks. On Saturday, there were about 10,000 new cases reported, according to state statistics. Many cities and counties around the state have recently reinstated restrictions that had been lifted in May, when cases seemed to drop.

All of Disney's Orlando parks closed in mid-March in an effort to stop the virus's spread. Universal Orlando and SeaWorld Orlando closed around the same time but reopened several weeks ago after instituting similar rules to protect employees and customers from the virus.

Lori Lovell of Evansville, Indiana, strolled around Frontierland on Saturday morning with friends.

""I have missed coming here. It just feels really good to be back. This is where I've made so many memories. It's kind of our second home. Not being able to come here was hard.""

Disney's new rules include mandatory masks and social distancing. Visitors will need reservations to enter a park, and they won't be allowed to hop between parks. Both visitors and employees will receive temperature checks when they enter. Fireworks shows and parades have been suspended to prevent drawing too many people together.

Park-goers say that nearly everyone in sight wore masks on Saturday morning. Capacity is nowhere near where it is under normal circumstances, they said.

""I've been here on spring breaks where you can barely walk around. The walkways are very wide open,"" said Lovell.

There were lots of hand sanitizer stations around, and people were respecting the physical distancing cues and guidelines. Since the park is at lower capacity, there was only a five-minute wait for the popular Buzz Lightyear ride -- normally it's about 90 minutes, Watkins said.

Some attractions and dining areas aren't yet open. Another change: visitors can't hug and greet the costumed Disney characters. Instead, the characters are in ""cavalcades,"" or motorcades, as they make their way through the park.

Disney has been opening its parks back up around the globe for the past two months. In May, the company opened Disney Springs, a complex of shops, restaurants and entertainment venues in Lake Buena Vista.

The statement was made anonymously on an Instagram account recently created as a space for people to share stories of trauma they’ve experienced at the hands of others in the tattooing, piercing and music scenes in Montreal.

“Recent public statements have led me to acknowledge that some of the interactions I have had with women have caused them harm,” Desrosiers wrote. “I have decided to withdraw from the band and seek professional help to educate myself and act appropriately in the future.”

The same message was posted to the band’s Instagram around the same time on Thursday.

The claims against Desrosiers – posted two days prior to his announcement – say that he made inappropriate jokes with a minor and began “running after her for sex” as soon as she was of age. The post says a consensual relationship between the pair eventually became uncomfortable for the woman, who says Desrosiers would invite his friends to have group sex with them without her consent. The woman said she felt trapped because Desrosiers allegedly threatened to call the cops on her when she threatened to go public with her experience.

The account, called victims_voices_montreal, began posting just four days ago. Since, around 80 stories have been posted and similar accounts around Canada have popped up as well, including ones for the Gatineau and Outaouais regions.

It was on the Montreal account that Safia Nolin, a musician from Quebec City, made a statement claiming that Quebecois actress Mariepier Morin sexually harrassed her and made racist comments during an interaction between the two at a bar in 2018. Following the statement, Morin addressed the sexual harassment claims through an apology on her Instagram. She didn't address the comment about her alleged racist remarks. Morin has since decided to take a professional hiatus.

Several resources are available for Quebecers who have survived trauma, including the Montreal Sexual Assault Centre at 1-888-933-9007 and Juripop, a free legal clinic at 514 705-1637. Other resources are detailed below by a regroupment of centres in the area:",[]

Mostly anonymous allegations are being posted to an Instagram page that has garnered more than 49,000 followers and is focused on prominent Quebecers, including musicians, concert promoters and comedians. The page, which is less than a week old, contains more than 80 posts.

As of Friday, accounts with identical usernames (other than the city they represent) have surfaced across Quebec: they exist for Gatineau, Laval, Outaouais, Sherbrooke, Monteregie, Lanaudiere, Joliette, Saguenay, and the Laurentians, among other places.

The people running the Montreal account posted a message Friday saying that, overwhelmed with submissions, they were taking a hiatus, but planned to return after recruiting more people to help.

One of the biggest names to fall is David Desrosiers, bassist for Montreal rock band Simple Plan, who said Thursday he is leaving the group after he was anonymously accused on the social network of predatory behaviour against his female fans.

The accuser posted Wednesday that Desrosiers started making inappropriate ""jokes"" with her when she was a minor, and they had consensual sex after she came of age. She alleged he invited others for group sex without asking and threatened and demeaned her.

Desrosiers wrote on Instagram that allegations ""have led me to acknowledge that some of the interactions I have had with women have caused them harm."" In a statement on Instagram, Simple Plan also apologized to the women affected as well as fans who are disappointed by the ""regretful situation.""

Maripier Morin, a major TV personality in Quebec, has apologized publicly and La Presse reported she has put her career on pause after singer Safia Nolin posted to the Instagram page July 8 -- with a copy on her personal page as well -- accusations that Morin uttered racist statements in her presence and bit her on the thigh in 2018.

Nolin wrote that Morin made a derogatory comment after learning she was of Arab descent. Nolin said Morin also made racist comments about a Black bartender.

""After that, she bit me on the thigh so hard that I had an enormous bruise for two weeks,"" Nolin said.

According to multiple media reports, Morin apologized on her Instagram page, said she remembered the night in question and called her actions ""reprehensible"" without going into details. By Friday, however, Morin had removed the posts from her Instagram page, which is followed by almost 550,000 people.

Bell Media said Friday it has dropped all the shows it carried on its streaming networks featuring Morin.

Company spokesman Patrick Tremblay said in an email: ""We respect the decision by Maripier Morin to put her professional activities on pause. For that reason, we are pulling all the shows that feature her from our platforms Z, VRAK and Crave.""

Quebec singer-songwriter Bernard Adamus was dropped from his label following an anonymous post to the Instagram page accusing him of improprieties.

Adamus replied Thursday on his Instagram that he had been vulgar, arrogant and drunk too many times in his life, and he apologized to all the women he's hurt.

ADISQ, the association representing Quebec's music industry, issued a statement Friday saying that its board of directors has decided to exclude Adamus from nominations for its annual awards.

The Montreal police confirmed Friday the force ""is aware"" of the Instagram page and the accusations. ""However, in order to conduct an investigation, there needs to be an official complaint filed,"" a spokesperson for the police said in an email.

The police did not say if they had received any official complaints tied to the accusations on the Instagram page.

On Friday afternoon, the people behind the Montreal account posted an update saying they were taking a break.

The person who began the account last week never imagined it ""blowing up this big,"" they wrote.

""We are receiving messages from what seems like the entirety of Quebec, which is extremely overwhelming.""

They said they had over 1,000 messages currently waiting to be reviewed, and that multiple people were helping run the account, including some who had put their ""jobs on hold.""

""Our mission was to deal specifically with the Montreal scene, regarding the tattoo/piercing industry & the music scene. As the page got more traction, the influx of stories we received did as well,"" they said, and they wanted to respect all the stories people were sending.

They said they were going to use the break to recruit more people to help run the account. ""During this weekend break, we will be interviewing people with various backgrounds to join our team,"" they wrote.

They said many people had messaged them offering to help, but they were working through personal contacts only.

""We are prioritizing those in our immediate circle to assist us, as this is a serious matter of security.""

Tom Hanks is the above the title star of “Greyhound,” a new naval thriller now streaming on Apple TV+, but the star of the film is the tension that takes hold in the first ten minutes and does not let go.

Set during the onset of the United States' involvement in the Second World War, Hanks plays Commander Ernest Krause, a stoic sailor on his first command. His mission is to lead an international convoy of 37 Allied ships across the North Atlantic with a wolfpack of German U-boats in hot pursuit. Running out of depth charges and fuel, the convoy needs air cover, which is hours away.

That’s it. “Greyhound” isn’t so much story driven as it is propelled by the action. In a breathless ninety minutes director Aaron Schneider, working from a script written by Hanks, adapted from C. S. Forester’s 1955 book “The Good Shepherd,” ratchets up tension, creating an old-fashioned action movie that mines a life and death situation for real cinematic thrills. That being said, there’s no fight scenes, you never see the face of the enemy and the only dead bodies are wrapped in linen, getting a proper burial at sea.

Inspired by the Battle of the Atlantic, the movie takes place completely on board the USS Keeling (Call sign ""Greyhound""). Krause is in the ship’s claustrophobic helm for ninety percent of the running time, barking orders, peering through binoculars, making hard decisions with consequences that will affect the lives of hundreds of people.

Hanks plays Krause as a man with nerves of steel who hides his concern behind his furrowed brow. In the heat of battle every second counts and both Hanks and Schneider understand that the mental gymnastics required to do the job must be front and centre. This is a movie where the fiercest action is verbal. Sure, there’s gunfire, torpedoes and explosions, but the exciting stuff comes from Krause’s mental perspective. Never have coordinated turn equations and rudder work been this exciting.

“Greyhound” was originally set for a theatrical release. The more sweeping shots, those of the ships as specks in the vast ocean, feel like they would have benefited from the big screen treatment, but the story, driven by intellect, the effectiveness of team effort, and old-fashioned thrills, works well in any format.

THE OLD GUARD: 2 ½ STARS

“The Old Guard,” a new superhero flick starring Charlize Theron on Netflix, has the earmarks of an action flick, but brings the genre kicking and screaming into the twenty-first century by focusing the story on not just one, but two female characters.

Theron channels the dark side that made her characters in “Mad Max: Fury Road” and “Atomic Blonde” so compelling. She’s Andy, a tough-as-nails immortal mercenary with the power to heal herself, no matter how deep the wound.

“She has devised more ways to kill than entire armies will ever know,” says unkillable sidekick, and former soldier for Napoleon, Booker (Matthias Schoenaerts). For centuries they have fought the good fight—depending on which side you take—along with Joe (Marwan Kenzari) and Nicky (Luca Marinelli), sticking up for the maltreated and oppressed. “Through history, we’ve protected this world,” says Andy, “fighting in the shadows.”

In modern day they come across Nile (KiKi Layne), a Marine who shares their “extremely rare skillset.” “She stabbed me,” Andy says admiringly, “I think she has potential.”

Nile is the first of their kind they have come across since 1812 and soon they recruit her to join their ranks. “You haven’t figured this out yet?” Andy asks her. “You can’t die.” At the same time a mad-scientist big pharma type (Harry Melling) sets his sights on them as lab rats in his experiments to find a cure for death. “If we can unlock their genetic code, the entire world will be begging us for the key.”

“The Old Guard” is an action film, with carefully staged and exciting fight scenes, but first and foremost it’s a set-up for a franchise. Like an action-packed trailer for a movie it teases the possibility of the next film. The origin story is talky, illustrated by flashbacks, while the main plot is resolved quickly in a hail of bullets and a few swings of an axe. Then the set up begins, as they hint at further adventures. Trouble is, I’m not sure “The Old Guard’s” appeal is as immortal as its characters.

Theron and Layne are strong characters who deliver in the fist-to-the-face action department, but the movie doesn’t let them shine. As mentioned, the fight scenes are well staged but their relationship is never fully developed. Everyone, except for Melling who appears amped up on something he didn’t share with the rest of the cast, is on a slow simmer which gives the movie a laid-back vibe which doesn’t spark interest.

“The Old Guard” does a good thing by placing two women at the center of an action movie but the all-set-up all-the-time script doesn’t do the characters or the movie any favors.

FISHERMAN’S FRIENDS: 3 ½ STARS

Another entry in the Real-Life-Underdog-Brits-Overcoming-Adversity genre of movies—think “The Full Monty,” “Calendar Girls” and more recently “Military Wives”—“Fisherman’s Friends,” now on VOD, is a good-natured crowd pleaser with some deep laughs but no major surprises.

Daniel Mays is Danny, a “proper bigshot” London music biz executive, on a quick weekend get-a-way with some mates in Port Isaac in Cornwall. They are fish out of water in the village. The locals poke fun at their city-slicker ways, treating them like outsiders. “We have our ways down here,” Jim (James Purefoy) warns Danny, “and once you cross the River Tamar you’re not in England anymore. We’re a land apart. You get my drift, son?”

After hearing a local group of fishermen, led by Jim, Jago (David Hayman) and Leadville (Dave Johns), singing a cappella sea shanties Danny’s pals jokingly convince him that he should sign the band to a record contract. He’s skeptical at first, but there’s something about the music that speaks to his soul. But first, he has to persuade the fishermen who are suspicious of his motives. “We have no need to sell our souls for fifteen minutes of fame,” Jim tells him.

His friends can’t believe he fell for the joke. “Do you really think we’d sign a boy band with the combined age of 643?”

But, convinced the public will want to see real people with real talent communicating 500 years of naval history, Danny perseveres. “In a world saturated with manufactured pop bands,” he says, “the fishermen are a real catch.” Plus, he’s fallen for life in the village and Jim’s daughter Alwyn (Tuppence Middleton).

The story of the band’s success is almost stranger than fiction. In real life The Fisherman's Friends “buoy band” signed a contract with Island Records and their debut went on to become the biggest selling traditional folk album of all time.

“Fisherman’s Friends” keeps the bones of the real story but amps up the big emotional moments. The highs soar and the lows have a heartfelt sentimentality. None of it quite feels like reality but by the time the end credits roll it’s clear that Port Isaac in Cornwall is a nice place to visit for 115 minutes.

“Fisherman’s Friends” is formulaic, clearly manipulative, and any sense of subtlety was clearly cut adrift around the second draft of the script but the story’s feel-good underdog story mixed with innate messages of decency and loyalty make it as refreshing as a gust of sea air in our cynical times. “We stick together down here,” Says Jago. “One and all. That’s the difference between sinking or swimming in a place like this.” A good message, even when delivered with a heavy hand.

WHITE RIOT: 4 STARS

The cultural, moral and emotional impact that music has is undeniable. Songs like “Times They Are A-Changin’,” “Them Belly Full (But We Hungry),"" and “What’s Going On” or events like Live Aid or The Concert for Bangladesh brought with them societal change by mobilizing music fans to action. “White Riot,” new documentary from director Rubika Shah streaming on Virtual Cinema Screening sites (see below), details the fight between Rock Against Racism and Britain’s National Front.

In the macro the film’s story is set against the rise of xenophobic politician Enoch Powell and violent, far-right hate group the National Front. Language that would get anyone kicked off Twitter or cancelled today was casually tossed around in the papers and on television. In one inspired sequence Shah pieces together a montage of outrageous racist remarks pulled from mainstream sitcoms.

In August 1976 guitarist Eric Clapton, whose entire career was based on the elements of blues created by Black American musicians, added his voice to the rhetoric, endorsing Powell from a stage in a drunken rant.

“I think Enoch’s right,” he said. “I think we should send them all back. Stop Britain from becoming a Black colony. Get the foreigners out.""

His comments caught the attention of music photographer Red Saunders who wrote a letter to the music press, calling for rock to be a force against racism. Bigtime outlets like NME, Melody Maker and Sounds all published the letter. The resulting and overwhelming response from like-minded Brits inspired Saunders to create the grassroots movement, Rock Against Racism (RAR) and a fanzine, Temporary Hoarding geared toward reporting on the stories the mainstream press ignored.

“Our job,” Saunders says, “was to peel away the Union Jack to reveal the swastika.”

Their reports on immigration and the police’s racist “suspected persons” powers among other hot button topics appealed to a generation of young people who embraced new ideas politically and musically, in the form of rebel music, punk rock and reggae.

Despite violent resistance from the National Front RAR persevered and “White Riot” ends, not at the end of Rock Against Racism’s mandate—they remained a potent force until 1982—but with their first massive public outing, 1978’s Carnival Against the Nazis. Headlined by The Clash, Steel Pulse and Tom Robinson, it attracted 100,000 people who began marching a march at Trafalgar Square, before the concert at Victoria Park.

“White Riot” pieces together archival footage, like unsettling shots of National Front supporters parading through London, recent interviews with the main RAR players and piles of ephemera, like old gig posters, punk badges and photos, to define the film’s time and place. Shah weaves the elements together, punctuating the info with sonic blasts of music courtesy of live footage of The Clash, The Selecter, Sham 69, Steel Pulse and others.

It is compelling stuff and even though it details a time more than forty years ago it doesn’t feel dated. Racism and rise of neo-fascism are still with us but “White Riot” reminds the viewer that resistance not only comes in many forms but that fighting the good fight is never out of date.

VOLITION: 3 ½ STARS

James (Adrian Glynn McMorran) is a young man with extra sensory perception, but is it an ability or an affliction? That is the question asked in “Volition,” a new thriller now on VOD.

“They say when you die, your whole life flashes before your eyes,” James says in the opening minutes of the movie. “I wish it were that simple.” It’s a signal of sorts to the viewer that nothing in the next ninety minutes is going to be simple or follow the accepted rules.

James, a clairvoyant, makes his money using his insight into the future and doing odd jobs for local crime outfits. On one such job, involving a load of stolen diamonds and a gangster named

Ray (John Cassini), James intuits a bad end for the caper and himself. With the help of a stranger, Angela (Magda Apanowicz), he tries to find a path to alter the future and his fate.

“Volition” is a mix-and-match of speculative fiction and neo-noir crime drama. Driven by ideas rather than special effects, it favors intellect over action, philosophy over fisticuffs. There are tense scenes and gun play but, like movies such as “Looper” or “Next,” it uses time as an ever fluctuating, nonlinear construct.

The bending of the sequence of time makes for some heady filmmaking but the story never allows itself to get lost amid the twists and turns. Director Tony Dean Smith, who co-wrote the script with brother Ryan W. Smith, teases out the thrills and the head-scratching in equal measure, making for a film made up of fragments, to come together to form one fascinating mosaic.",[]

In the now-shuttered world of musical theatre, the name “Hamilton” is said in hushed reverential tones. The groundbreaking show, which mixes-and-matches hip hop, R&B, pop, soul and traditional show tunes to tell the story of American Founding Father Alexander Hamilton, was called “the phenomenon of the season, perhaps of a generation,” by Forbes.

Its appeal to a younger audience, who packed NYC’s Richard Rodgers Theater night after night, gave Broadway a desperately needed shot in the arm and at one point the show was responsible for more than 5% of the Broadway districts total gross.

A new, filmed version, headed by creator Lin-Manuel Miranda, offers up a chance for people who couldn’t afford to blow a mortgage payment on tickets to the original production to watch the show from the comfort of their Disney+ stream.

The movie, shot in June 2016 at the height of “Hamilton”-mania is anything but hushed or reverential. The show, which features a diverse cast including Black, LatinX and Asian actors to tell the story described as being about “America then, as told by America now,” is passionately political, raucously rebellious and emotionally deep.

“Just like my country, I’m young, scrappy and hungry,” Miranda sings in a phrase that could be about the musical as much as it is Hamilton’s personality.

A toe-tapping history lesson, the show details the American Dream life of Hamilton, from an outsider born to unwed parents on the Caribbean island of Nevis to war hero to George Washington's Revolutionary War aide, and, as first Secretary of Treasury under Washington's administration, the founder of America’s economic system. It’s a bootstrap story about legacy, reputation, honor and if that wasn’t enough, there’s an extra-marital affair and, of course, the fateful duel with Aaron Burr.

Director Thomas Kail, who also directed the show’s Off-Broadway and Broadway productions, keeps the camera work to a minimum, simply and effectively capturing the show from a front row center perspective. It’s handsome work that tries to preserve the integrity of the live presentation while still creating a kind of cinematic experience.

As far as the show goes, what the filmed “Hamilton” presents is a moment in time when the musical lived at the very center of pop culture. The original cast, including Miranda, Phillipa Soo, Leslie Odom Jr., Daveed Diggs and Jonathan Groff among many others, are working in peak form.

As a document of a special show the filmed version doesn’t add anything to the presentation, but perhaps that’s the point. Miranda’s daring, genre busting show speaks for itself, often with beautiful tongue-twisting wordplay, and doesn’t need flashy cinematic theatrics to bolster what is already a provocative and timely story of creating a union where none existed.

SHIRLEY: 3 ½ STARS

When reclusive author Shirley Jackson died in 1965 she left behind a body of work, including “The Haunting of Hill House,” a supernatural horror novel sometimes called one of the best ghost stories ever written.

An influence on two generations of speculative fiction writers like Neil Gaiman, Stephen King, Sarah Waters and Richard Matheson, she is brought to vivid life in a new fictionalized drama, now on VOD, starring Elisabeth Moss.

Set just after the publication of “The Lottery,” a controversial short story about the ritual sacrifice of a town citizen to ensure good crops, published in a 1948 issue of The New Yorker, the film sees Shirley (Moss) paralyzed by the expectations that hang heavy over “Hangsaman,” a novel she is struggling to complete. Prickly and quick with a line, she is less than pleased when Stanley (Michael Stuhlbarg), her college professor husband, arranges for his new assistant Fred Nemser (Logan Lerman) and his pregnant wife Rose (Odessa Young) to live in their house while the young couple searches for a place of their own.

As the days and weeks stretch into months the relationship between the two couples becomes a blend of art and reality, a claustrophobic rabbit hole where Rose becomes the model for Shirley’s new main character, a college student who went walking on Vermont's Long Trail hiking route and never returned.

“Shirley” uses elements of Jackson’s life but places them in context of one of her novels. The result is a psychological drama; a haunting look at a person driven to agoraphobia by the weight of her success and a domineering, philandering husband.

Moss is fascinating as the title character. Her take on Shirley is that of a woman who has lived under years of oppression by her bullying husband, a man whose misogyny has left her embittered, desperate and anxious.

“To our suffering,” Stanley says as a toast to his wife. “There’s not enough Scotch in the world for that,” Shirley snorts, in a line that could have been borrowed from “Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” She’s vulnerable and filled with rage, compassionate and spiteful, often in the same scene.

Shirley and Stanley, as compelling as they are as characters, do not comprise the film’s defining relationship. Director Josephine Decker feeds on the psychological aspects of Jackson’s work to tease out a story of Shirley and Rose, two women drawn together by frustration, talent and obsession over the missing woman at the heart of the new novel.

""Let's pray for a boy,” Shirley says to the pregnant Rose, “The world is too cruel for girls.” Their time on screen together is complicated, occasionally unsettling as reality and imagination meld. It’s fascinating work in a film that is a slow burn.

“Shirley” takes its time to get where it is going, building an atmosphere of oppression slowly and carefully. Decker’s distorted dream-like visual approach is often beautiful, as though we’re watching the film through a psychological prism. It creates atmosphere but doesn’t provide the thrills that Jackson herself might have been able to infuse into the telling of this tale.

AMERICAN WOMAN: 3 STARS

“American Woman,” the first feature directed by “Mad Men” producer and writer Semi Chellas, is a fictionalized version of real events. A series of title cards set the stage. The year is 1975. “After multiple investigations, the President of the United States has been forced to resign.” “America’s disastrous involvement in the war in Vietnam is finally coming to an end.” “Some radicals still believe a revolution is necessary.”

Amid this time of political turmoil is Jenny Shimada (Hong Chau), a bomb maker who once blew up a draft board office. On the run, she is hiding out in upstate New York, working as a house keeper for a rich, conservative woman (Ellen Burstyn). She comes out of her semi-retirement when a publisher and old colleague-in-the-cause contacts her with a new mission. He wants her to look after three fugitive Symbionese Liberation Army members, Juan (John Gallagher), his wife Yvonne (Lola Kirke), and Pauline (Sarah Gadon), the kidnapped daughter of a newspaper magnate, as they write a book about their experiences.

“You can’t just sit around waiting to die or be caught,” she tells them. “You have to start writing. Write the book, make the money. It’s the only way you’ll survive underground.” Jenny’s reward? Enough cash to leave the country.

The basics of the story are borrowed from the well documented kidnapping and radicalization, of American heiress Patty Hearst. Pauline is an obvious surrogate for Hearst while Jenny is a fictionalized version of Wendy Yoshimura, the woman who was with Patty Hearst when she was apprehended.

The names have been changed and some of the details, but this sharply written story isn’t a history lesson. It’s a study of people who have chosen a radical path in life. It showcases Jaun’s ideological rantings but also wonders aloud if Pauline truly converted to the cause or was simply trying to survive. “I don’t want to be an outlaw,” she says. “Outlaws always die at the end of the story.”

Add in themes on toxic masculinity—Juan may be a free thinker but his behavior toward women is anything but enlightened—sexuality, class, gender and race and you have film big on ideas while leaving the action scenes for other movies.

“American Woman” is a movie that values words. Some may find the storytelling a bit too low key for such an explosive subject, but the performances, particularly Chau, give the story layers. Chellas, who wrote the script in addition to directing, uses the main characters, Jenny and Pauline, as conduits to help us understand a complicated and slow-simmer story of survival.

STRANGE BUT TRUE: 3 ½ STARS

“Strange But True,” a neo-noir thriller on VOD starring Amy Ryan and Margaret Qualley, examines grief in the context of an ordinary family thrown into extraordinary situations.

The action takes place against the backdrop of loss. Five years ago Ronnie Chase (Connor Jessup) and Melissa’s (Margaret Qualley) prom night began as they all do, with a rented tux, a frilly dress and proud parents taking photos. It ended in tragedy, with Ronnie dead in a car crash, an event that sent shock waves through the family. Stricken, his folks Charlene (Amy Ryan) and Richard (Greg Kinnear), split under the weight of their grief. Younger brother Philip (Nick Robinson) hightails it to NYC to pursue his dream of being a photographer and girlfriend Melissa is wracked with guilt, left with only her dreams of her late boyfriend.

Cut to present day. Charlene’s life has fallen apart. Her husband and job are gone, so when Melissa shows up, five years after the fateful night, claiming she is pregnant with Ronnie’s baby, she is not met with hugs and congratulations.

“If you think about it,” says Phillip, home recuperating from a badly broken leg, “there’s a chance what she said is true. If, and it’s a big if, if Ronnie’s sperm was somehow frozen before he died there’s a chance Melissa could have used it and impregnated herself years later.”

“That’s ridiculous,” Charlene snarls. “He was a teenager with his whole life ahead of him. Why would he do that?”

She sets off to find a rational explanation while Phillip grasps at straws, consulting psychics and leaving no possibility off the table. “I might not believe that this is Ronnie’s baby,” he says to Melissa,” but I believe that you believe it and I believe that Ronnie would have too. If that makes me an uncle, so be it.”

That search is the bedrock for a story packed with secrets and intrigue. Adapted from John Searles’s 2004 novel, “Strange But True” is a bit of a nesting doll of mysteries. Everyone has a backstory and a different relationship with the intrigue that forms the plot and the action toggles between past and present. That means there’s a lot to wade through in the film’s tight ninety-minute running time but director Rowan Athale manages it. He weaves psychological drama, a hint of paranormal, suspense and even some gothic horror into the story.

In the end, the pregnancy is a McGuffin, simply a device to put all these elements into motion, but the result is a tightly wound thriller that leads to a gripping and satisfying conclusion.",[]
263,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/movie-reviews-eurovision-song-contest-not-as-funny-as-it-ought-to-be-1.4996231,Movie reviews: 'Eurovision Song Contest' not as funny as it ought to be,[],2020-06-26 08:00:00-04:00,"EUROVISION SONG CONTEST: THE STORY OF FIRE SAGA: 2 STARS

Will Ferrell is a wonderfully weird and committed actor. Like a dog with a bone when he latches onto a part he doesn't let go, come hell or high water. When it works, it really works, and the result is an indelible comedic creation like the deluded Ron Burgundy that not only makes us laugh, but also reveals the character's humanity. When it doesn't work, as in ""Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga,"" now streaming on Netflix, it is all commitment and little humanity.

Ferrell plays Lars, a middle-aged Icelander whose love for the Eurovision Song Contest began in 1974 when he was dancing in front of the TV to ABBA's winning performance of ""Waterloo,"" much to his father's (Pierce Brosnan) chagrin. No one believes in his musical dreams except for his childhood friend Sigrit (Rachel McAdams), who loves him even though her affections don't seem to be reciprocated. She believes in elves and drops little pearls of wisdom like, ""Anger cannot churn butter.""

Together they are Fire Saga, a synth-pop duo who play to crowds at the local pub who only want to hear songs like ""Ja Ja Ding Dong,"" and not the ""real music"" Lars writes. Through a series of unlikely events they stumble into a spot on the Eurovision show. Lars' father doesn't want them to go. ""All of Iceland will laugh at you,"" he says. Undeterred, Lars soldiers on. ""I have to become an international star to prove to my very handsome father and all of Iceland that I have not wasted my life.""

Lars and Sigrit's experiences in their tiny fishing village of Húsav´ík do not prepared them for the cutthroat world of Eurovision. Will predatory singers, like Russian superstar Alexander Lemtov (Dan Stevens with a George Michael frosted-tip bouffant), and stage mishaps dampen Lars' dreams of Eurovision fame?

""Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga"" should be a lot funnier than it is. It's a little too loving of Eurovision's kitschy spectacle to be a satire; a little too sincere to be truly silly, despite Ferrell's ridiculous hair and even more outlandish sweaters. The comedy is further blunted by the film's main conceit: that Lars and Sigrit are talentless wannabees. ""We all know they are awful,"" says the local Húsav´ík cop, ""but they are our awful."" Thing is, in context, they fit like a puzzle piece next to other over-the-top acts the movie showcases.

Ferrell brings the usual commitment to his trademarked arrogant man-child character, but never pushes the characterization much beyond the way the townsfolk see him. ""Lars is weird,"" they all say, and Ferrell obliges, playing the character as the result of a damaged psyche — he feels unwanted by his father — and just a little too much confidence. It's familiar ground for him and us.

McAdams feels like an odd choice to play opposite Ferrell's exaggerated character. She's good, but her more natural performance feels like it belongs in another movie.

The real Eurovision Song Contest won't be happening this year, another victim of COVID-19, so perhaps ""The Story of Fire Saga"" will fill that gap for fans. If you tune in expect some scattered good moments. Ferrell delivers a few laughs and Stevens has fun, but Lars and Sigrit's protracted love story pushes the movie to an unwieldy 123 minutes with not quite enough laughs to justify the running time.

IRRESISTIBLE: 3 ½ STARS

Big time politics invades small town America in “Irresistible,” an election-year satire from director Jon Stewart, now available on VOD.

Former “Daily Show” correspondent Steve Carell reteams with his old boss to play Gary Zimmer, a Washington insider and the Democratic National Committee's top strategist.

In the midst of creating a strategy to win votes in America’s Republican heartland—""We need some way to road test a more rural friendly message,” he says.—he’s directed to a YouTube video of retired Marine colonel Jack Hastings (Chris Cooper), giving an impassioned speech in defense of undocumented workers at a townhall meeting in Deerlaken, a small right-wing Wisconsin town.

He’s like “John Wayne and tractor had a baby,” says Gary as he concocts a plan to entice Hastings to run for mayor of Deerlaken, giving the Dems a strong presence in a state sea of red.

“Colonel Jack Hastings is our key back into the swing state of Wisconsin,” Gary says. “He just doesn’t know it yet.”

The citified Gary takes off his suit and tie, buys some dungarees and jumps on a private jet to Deerlaken to win over the colonel and his daughter (Mackenzie Davis), who is first seen with her arm inserted where the sun don’t shine, giving relief to a constipated cow. Appealing to Hastings’ sense of duty, Gary convinces the Marine to run and fires up the political machine.

Soon Deerlaken is overrun with Democratic operatives—like demographic profilers played by Topher Grace and Natasha Lyonne—but the real race heats up when the Republican National Committee sends in Faith (Rose Byrne), Gary’s nemesis and now campaign manager to Hastings’ rival.

“Twenty bucks says I do better with fear than you do with shame,” she says, taunting Gary. Soon the national media takes notice and the mayoral race in Deerlaken becomes one of the most debated elections in the country.

There’s more, but that would involve giving away a plot twist and spoilers. Just keep in mind that the word “resist” is tucked away in the film’s title.

“Irresistible” is equal parts heartfelt and darkly humorous. Stewart begins conventionally enough, with the fish out of water story of bigshot Gary in a town of rubes, then slowly calibrates the story to ask, “Who are the real rubes here?”

It’s a damning indictment of how political situations are manipulated, how the media allows outright lies on the airwaves, and how both Democrats and Republicans are culpable and clueless to the real needs of the people.

It doesn’t exactly blaze new ideological ground but the as a reminder of why the political system is twisted and broken, it’s a timely tale.

HAMMER: 3 ½ STARS

“Hammer,” a new VOD thriller starring Will Patton, uses many of the genre’s puzzle pieces but rearranges them in a new and interesting way.

Chris (Mark O’Brien) is having a very bad day. Estranged from his parents and deep in debt to some very bad people, he arranges a deal with an old associate, Adams (Ben Cotton). They arrange to meet on a rural road to exchange $200,000 in cash in return for drugs. The deal goes wrong, bullets are fired. Adams (Ben Cotton) and his girlfriend Lori (Dayle McLeod) are wounded as Chris, covered in blood splatter, makes a getaway on a motorcycle with the drugs and money.

As he speeds through town, his father Stephen (Will Patton), out doing errands, spots him and immediately knows something is wrong. The situation escalates as Adams, looking to find Chris and the stash, grabs Chris’ younger brother Jeremy (Connor Price) as a hostage.

“You haven’t changed,” Stephen says as he and Chris drive toward an uncertain outcome. “You haven’t changed one bit.”

Just after everything goes sideways in Chris’ life director Christian Sparkes stages a scene in a cornfield that tells us everything we need to know about Chris in one potent image. Hidden among the plants is a snake devouring itself. It’s a quick shorthand for the cyclical nature of Chris’ self-destruction.

He’s been in trouble before, and the imagery suggests the pattern will continue, even if he makes it out of this scrape alive. It’s details like this that elevate a standard crime drama, complete with crooked ex-colleagues, innocent family members and bad debts, from the same-old to something new.

But it is the father and son relationship that gives the movie its momentum. It asks, and mostly answers, big questions about unconditional love and how far a father will go to help his son. Sparkes builds tension all the way through the tight eighty-minute running time but never forgets to allow the relationship between the father and his ne’er do well son to slip from the forefront of the storytelling.

“Hammer” is an engaging and offbeat thriller that makes the most of its lead performances. O’Brien manages to make Chris almost likable despite his constant foul-ups and Patton, as a father caught up in a breathless situation, is all strength and goodwill, even when he’s doing terrible things. Why this wasn’t released on Father’s Day I’ll never know.

EXIT PLAN: 1 ½ STARS

The name “Exit Plan” sounds like one of those 1990s direct-to-VHS action titles that might have starred Don ‘The Dragon’ Wilson or someone with a famous last name like Don Swayze, Frank Stallone or Chad McQueen. That this movie, new to VOD this week, stars Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, he who played Jaime Lannister on the blood-soaked “Game of Thrones,” would further suggest chills and thrills.

Instead, it is an anti-action, minor key movie. A film so stark and dreary that you might want to plan to hit the exit button on your remote.

Coster-Waldau plays Max, a mild-mannered insurance investigator who shares his life with wife Laerke (Tuva Novotny) and cat Simba. His latest case, the disappearance of man, presumed dead, leads him to a place called the Hotel Aurora, a Scandinavian resort where people go to meet their “beautiful end.”

It’s a fortuitous turn of events for Max, whose attempts to hang and drown himself were unsuccessful. He’s suffering from an inoperable terminal brain tumour and wants to end it all before the pain becomes too much for him and his family to bear.

But, what seems to be the answers to his problems raises some very troubling questions in Max’s mind.

“Exit Plan” deals in some heavy human dilemmas, but is as cold and angular as the glass and steel that make up the façade of the Hotel Aurora. The mix-and-match of real and illusory makes Max’s existential crisis hard to grasp, impossible to care about.

Even the meaning of a late-stage mystery twist, as Max decides he wants out of the hotel, is obscured by flashbacks and dream sequences, leading to a conclusion that promises to make a point but fails to deliver. Add to that obtuse dialogue like, “You can go but you can’t escape,” that sounds like a rough draft of the “Hotel California” lyrics and you have a movie that promises much but delivers very little.",[]

But the couple came together for a special Friday edition of her ""Red Table Talk"" show on Facebook to share their side of the controversy surrounding her relationship with singer August Alsina.

According to the superstar couple they ""were going through a very difficult time"" and had broken up when Pinkett Smith started a romantic relationship with the 27-year-old singer.

During their ""Red Table Talk"" chat Smith pushed his wife to be clear about what her relationship had been with Alsina.

""I got into an entanglement with August,"" Pinkett Smith said.

In a recent interview with radio host Angela Yee, Alsina said he had been involved in a romantic relationship with Pinkett Smith, who has been married to Smith since 1997.

""I actually sat down with Will and had a conversation,"" Alsina said during the interview. ""Due to the transformation from their marriage to (a) life partnership that they have spoken on several times, and not involving romanticism, he gave me his blessing.""

Alsina said he had lost money and relationships because of rumours he had been involved with Pinkett Smith, 48.

The actress and her 51-year-old husband have long been the subject of rumours that they have an open marriage.

The couple has denied this, but says their marriage is not traditional and that they have a ""life partnership.""

On Friday's episode the pair said they felt compelled to speak out because there was so much speculation after Alsina's interview.

""We specifically never said anything,"" Will Smith said. ""Coming to the table was like we just felt like it got to the point where you gotta say something.""

Pinkett Smith said she began a friendship with Alsina about four and a half years ago and that became more once she and her husband hit a rough patch.

She also said she wanted to clear up Alsina having said her husband had given permission for the affair, though she added that she understood why the young singer may have believed that to be the case.

""The only person that can give permission in that particular circumstance is myself,"" she said. ""I could actually see how he would perceive it as permission because we were separated amicably and I think he also wanted to make it clear that he's also not a homewrecker. Which he's not.""

The actress said she was ""in a lot of pain"" and ""broken"" during the relationship.

She and Will tried ""everything we could to get away from each other only to realize that wasn't possible.""

Pinkett Smith said her relationship with Alsina ended, the Smiths reconciled, and she said she has not spoken to the singer in years.

She said she and her husband have now gotten to a place of ""unconditional love.""

Smith said he had been unsure as to whether he would ever speak to Pinkett Smith again when they were having problems, but he reminded her of their commitment.

""I told you the first year we were married, that I could love you through anything,"" Will Smith said.

The couple bumped fists as they jokingly recited their rendition of his ""Bad Boys"" movie motto: ""We ride together, we die together. Bad marriage for life.""",[]

Ontario Premier Doug Ford revealed the province’s plans for moving into Stage 3 of it’s reopening plan Monday.

Regions not included in the reopening are the Toronto area, as well as Sarnia-Lambton, Haldimand-Norfolk and Windsor-Essex, among a few others.

London was one of the first regions to enter Stage 2 when it was announced.

Over the past week the region served by the Middlesex London Health Unit (MLHU) has seen a decline in numbers, including a three-day stretch where no new cases were reported.

What kind of businesses can reopen in Stage 3?

According to government’s framework set out in April almost all businesses will be able to open in some capacity during Stage 3.

Movie theatres, gyms, casinos, indoor dining and bars can all open with some special measures in place:

Table games at casinos are banned.

Restaurants, bars, concession stands, etc. are allowed to reopen for indoor dining, but nightclubs are still banned except for serving food or drinks.

No dancing is allowed for patrons, but musical performances can resume.

Gyms and fitness studios can reopen with safety protocols in place.

Organized sports can resume, except for contact sports.

Playgrounds, community centres and libraries will also reopen, along with interactive museum and gallery exhibits.

CTV News has learned that work is already being done at London-area movie theatres to prepare for reopening.

Some high-risk businesses, including amusement parks, buffet restaurants and overnight camps, will not yet reopen. Concerts and sporting events are also still prohibited.

The full list of businesses that can reopen is here.

Other changes in Stage 3

Also in Stage 3, the maximum number of people allowed at an indoor gathering climbs to 50 from 10, while outdoor gatherings rise to 100 people.

Physical distancing must still be maintained with those outside someone's social circle, and those limitations have not changed, with only 10 people allowed to interact without physical distancing.

Whilt the total number of people allowed goes up, religious, wedding or funeral services must continue to fill only 30 percent of a venue's capacity.

In addition to organized gatherings, these caps also apply at casinos, bingo halls, performances, convention centres, theatres and sports facilities like gyms.

The government will monitor COVID-19 cases and has warned that restrictions could be tightened again if necessary.

None of the most recently reported cases have been associated with seniors’ facilities, where the totals stand at 180 cases and 37 deaths.

Meanwhile the total number of people tested at the city’s two assessment centres has exceeded 30,000.

No new cases were reported in other area counties. Here is how the totals stand there as of their most recent updates:

• Elgin-Oxford: Three active, 87 cases, 79 resolved, five deaths

• Huron-Perth: None active, 58 cases, 53 resolved, five deaths

• Sarnia-Lambton: Two active, 286 cases, 259 resolved, 25 deaths

• Grey-Bruce: One active, 115 cases, 108 resolved, six referred, no deaths

Across Ontario, 116 new cases were reported Monday, a slight dip, bringing totals to 36,839, including 2,722 deaths and 32,663 recoveries.

Holder emphasizes safety

As the region moves to Stage 3 on Friday, Holder said his big concern is complacency.

“First it was weariness, now it seems to be us taking for granted the good news of our successful results. And I do worry about that when we see larger groups of individuals that are hanging around that are not within their own circles or established social circles.”

He added that he has seen first-hand a lack of people wearing masks where maintaining physical distancing is difficult.

“I’m in the supermarket on the weekend, I’m wearing my mask and you know there are still a lot of cowboys who think it’s OK, and by the way a lot more men than women, I don’t know why, don’t think it matters to wear a mask in a grocery store.”

He added that he believes at least half the people the store weren’t wearing masks.

“That’s nuts…And I want to bop them on the head and say, ‘What are you thinking?’”",[]

City council’s Corporate Services Committee voted 6-0 to recommend turning down an annual scheduled increase to their compensation. A final decision will be made by council next week.

A motion by Deputy Mayor Jesse Helmer proposes a pay freeze in 2020 for councillors, the mayor, or citizen appointees.

“Let’s just keep it the same as last year,” explained Helmer to the committee. “I don’t think this is the year to even be taking inflationary increases. Anything we can do to contain costs is something we have to look at.”

The policy for elected officials and citizen appointees would automatically increase compensation by about 2.1 per cent this year.

The increase is calculated based on the previous year’s change to either the Consumer Price Index or Labour Index, whichever is lower.

Mayor Ed Holder supported the pay freeze for 2020, citing the economic impacts caused by the pandemic both at city hall and in the economy.

“I think it is an important commitment and an equally important symbol to our community.”

Helmer’s motion was co-signed by Councillor Maureen Cassidy and Councillor Arielle Kayabaga.

On Dec. 1, 2018 city councillors’ compensation jumped from about $36,000 per year to $51,181 per year.

That amount rose again on Jan. 1, 2019 with an annual increase of $2.3 per cent ($1,177).

If the 2020 pay freeze is approved, compensation for councillors would remain at $52,358 per year. The mayor’s compensation would remain at $141,200 per year.",[]

The request was in a letter addressed to high-ranking members of the LPS, City Hall and the London Police Services Board.

In the letter, Pride London Festival (PLF) says it ""stands with Black Lives Matter London"" and asks that police respect their request.

""While we recognize the work London Police Service has done to engage with London’s LGBT2Q+ communities over the past several years, the lack of progress with our Black and Indigenous communities is very disappointing, to say the least,"" says PLF in the statement.

""The response from London Police Service surrounding the demands of Black Lives Matter London is unacceptable. We urge London Police Service to take serious actions to dismantle the systematic racism that exists within its organization and to be a leader among other police organizations in making these changes.""

The letter, signed by seven members of the PLF board, insists that the LPS must start having meaningful conversations with BLM to create a path forward.

They add that PLF would be happy to facilitate any of those conversations moving forward.

This year's Pride London Festival will be held virtually from July 16 - 26.

The Beards for Bucks fundraiser, held in Owen Sound, Ont. on Saturday, was attended by several politicians, including Progressive Conservative MPP Bill Walker, Conservative MP Alex Ruff and Owen Sound Mayor Ian Boddy.

Southgate Mayor John Woodbury, Hanover Deputy Mayor Selwyn Hicks, Grey Highlands Deputy Mayor Aakash Desai and Owen Sound Councillors Travis Dodd, Richard Thomas and Scott Grieg were also in attendance.

The event was organized to raise money to purchase personal protective equipment for front line health-care in the region.

All the politicians had their beard's professionally trimmed for the cause, but the event has now sparked a backlash in the community, and from struggling business owners, because facial trimmings are banned under Stage 2 restrictions.

""The rules were blatantly ignored by our politicians,"" Owen Sound spa owner Mindy Biggar told CTV News Toronto on Sunday. ""At what point did it make it okay for them to be above the recommendations?""

Biggar said that following Stage 2 restrictions, which prohibit any services that tend to a customer's face, have resulted in her losing 80 per cent of her business.

She said it feels like a ""slap in the face"" to see local politicians, who were not wearing masks during the trimming, doing exactly what she is banned from performing.

""It's incredibly poor judgement. If that was any of us, as business owners that chose to participate in something like this, we would be fined.""

In a statement to CTV News Toronto, Walker, who is Premier Doug Ford's associate minister of energy, admitted that ""despite being aware of measures in place to protect Ontarians, he received a professional shave.""

""I apologize for any misunderstanding my participation has caused,"" Walker said. ""I recognize the need to remain vigilant in adhering to all public health measures and will ensure that all future public events I attend are in full compliance with the measures in place.""

Bruce-Grey-Owen Sound MP Alex Ruff said in a statement to CTV News Toronto that the event was not completely compliant with provincial health protocols and that ""constituents expect better from their elected officials.""

""I personally should have known better and I will do better going forward,"" he said.

Owen Sound Councillor Richard Thomas, who organized the event, said in a statement on Facebook that he ""made the call"" to allow a stylist to trim their beards.

""At the time, it seemed to be a better choice to minimize the length of time each individual would spend unmasked in an indoor environment,"" Thomas said.

He said clippers were sanitized between each person and the stylist sanitized his hands regularly but admitted at times during the event physically distancing was not maintained.

""In retrospect, I should have given that a little more thought.""

""Overall, however, I feel comfortable that the event minimized the risks to all participants, while at the same time, raising money for an important cause.""

The Grey Bruce Health Unit said in a statement they are aware of the event and that while they have not received an official complaint, their team has ""initiated the appropriate follow up.""",[]

""I just saw flames and black smoke and I tried my best to hold the individual out of the garage as he was trying to put it out,"" says Burt.

""My main goal was to have him stay out of that garage, because the flames were so big.""

Burt knows the importance of letting the professionals handle the fire. He's had personal experience with a house fire.

“Every time we see a sunflower, we see Max’s beaming face. He was such a happy boy,” say his parents, Kevin and Jamie Rombouts.

Less than a month after Max succumb to leukemia, neighbour Brian Schoonjans planted a field of sunflowers in his memory.

This summer, four more fields stretching from Forest to Bayfield have been planted.

“This was my first time growing sunflowers, and it was probably the highest pressure crop there was this year. We didn’t want to screw this one up, knowing so many people were waiting to see it,” says Taylor Van Aaken, who planted a field of sunflowers on his Uncle Brian Coombs land, on the edge of Bayfield.

People can come and take pictures with the sunflowers, and pick some to take home, for a donation.

From last year alone, over $60,000 has been raised for charities like ChildCan that helped the Rombouts during Max’s two year struggle with leukemia.

“Everyone has a story to tell, and you don’t know that until you go through something like this yourself. So it’s awesome to know that these fields mean so much to those people, as it does us,” says Kevin Rombouts.

“Miracle Max’s Minions was created to make sure Max’s memory would carry on forever, and I think we’ve done that,” says Brian Schoonjans, who planted the first field of sunflowers last summer.

It’s colourful, creating a sea of yellow as far as the eye can see.

“This is a canola field behind me,” says Jeff Drudge, who has grown canola for the past five or six years on his family's farm near Wingham.

“This is spring canola, planted early this spring. It just started to flower two weeks ago again, and flowers for one to two weeks. It’s a beautiful crop. We love growing canola,” says Drudge.

Although it’s the lovely yellow flower that gets all the fanfare, it’s the pods that hold the secret to canola.

They hold canola seeds, which are green now, but when they’re harvested come August, they’re black.

These canola seeds are made up of 40 per cent oil, so they’re ultimately crushed in order to extract canola oil, which is used in cooking the world over. What’s left over is turned into livestock feed.

“It’s a very versatile crop,” says Drudge.

Over 20 million acres of canola are grown in Canada each year. Only 45,000 of those acres are grown in Ontario, so canola isn’t likely to challenge corn or beans for Southwestern Ontario acreage anytime soon.

“It’s almost too warm here for spring canola. Further north it goes better. Further south, there’s winter canola grown, and we’re too far north for that. It’s maybe not that hugely popular in this part of Ontario for that reason,” says Drudge.

Because it is so rare and attractive looking, canola fields do attract a crowd. Drudge says many a car driving by has stopped to take pictures of the field, or selfies with the sea of yellow in the background.

“I think that’s a good thing. It gives us a connection between farmers and non-farmers. So, we’re excited to be a part of that intervention and conversation,” says Drudge.

Drudge says canola is also a good crop for soil health, and attracts a lot of bees each summer.

“It’s a good food source for the bees, so we think it’s good for the environment to grow canola, as well,” he says.",[]

A new provincially-led pilot project is installing 24/7 electronic monitoring stations around several suspected odour emitting sites.

The Ministry of Environment, Conservation, and Parks has been in discussions with two waste processing companies in the area, StormFisher Environmental and Convertus (formerly Orgaworld) to create an odour monitoring area.

City staff have been approached about including the W12A landfill.

""We are basically the guinea pig for this program,” says Brockley resident Allan Tipping. “It’s never been tried anywhere else, and I don’t think London or the money being spent by StormFisher is properly spent by putting these up.”

Tipping says this is the 13th year that foul garbage-like odours have made it impossible for London residents living south of Highway 401 to enjoy their yards.

A new staff report to city council recommends spending $80,000 to $140,000 per year to include the municipality’s landfill in the three to five year monitoring program.

“The sensors will basically pick up odorous compounds and be able to identify a profile and create almost a fingerprint,” explains Jay Stanford, Director of Environment, Fleet, & Solid Waste.

Tipping doubts electronic devices that detect specific chemical compounds in the air, will adequately measure the intensity of foul odours, “All this is numbers, and how do you prove offensiveness with numbers from a machine?”

Stanford says accurate and timely data will direct ongoing process improvements at the landfill better than sporadic responses to complaints.

“If we know certain conditions are creating odour, we can adjust our operations,” explains Stanford.

But after a decade of studies, pilot projects, and promises, Tipping remains skeptical.

“We’ve asked them to actually step up and correct this problem. But none of them have the nerve to,” he says.

Council’s Civic Works Committee will discuss the procurement process for the pilot project at its July 14 meeting.",[]

""Number one we don't need landfills, we need to take care of our waste in other ways. And number two, that you must ask the municipalities whether they want it on your doorstep or not,” said Mayor Ted Comiskey.

The new legislation states municipalities, within 3.5 km of a proposed dump have the right to approve or reject it.

Without approval the provincial government would not go ahead with the landfill.

it's a major victory for the town and its neighbouring municipalities including Zorra, where the former limestone quarry is located.

However, the mayor admits there is caution as the bill is only past first reading.

With the support of the Doug Ford’s PC’s and the opposition NDP it’s likely to succeed as early as late summer.

The mayor says the new legislation is the way it should have been for municipalities in the first place.

“We deserve that right. There is no way that another municipality should be dumping 18-million tons of their waste, on another, without asking them.”",[]

Every May the Crime Writers of Canada name their Arthur Ellis Award Winners for excellence in Canadian crime writing.

Those awards were announced Thursday night in Toronto. Although COVID-19 concerns caused the cancellation of the normal awards gala, the winners were no less honoured.

The best crime novel award was won by Michael Christie for his novel Greenwood. His story is told in the future and the past, and reveals a tragedy that bonds two boys over the course of time. It is a family story that grows over time to include omissions, half-truths and outright lies. This is not the only honour secured by Greenwood; it was also long listed for the prestigious Scotiabank Giller Prize last fall.

The best crime first novel award went to Philip Elliott for Nobody Move, a hard-boiled crime story set - where else - but Los Angeles. A debt collection turned double murder fuels the plot that draws in the debt collector, his mob boss employer, an ex-assassin, the femme fatale, and of course, police.

Author Robin Harlick served as one of the judges this year and praises the quality of the work submitted.

She says “For the most part the entries were well-written with good story telling and engaging characters.”

In fact, she says there are more Canadian crime writers out there than she realized, “many of which would stand up to the best in British or American crime writing, a standard often used by avid crime fiction readers.”

Harlick was also pleased to see that many of authors set their books here in Canada.

In a genre where location is often a character in its own right, she says there is persistent pressure from international publishers to “set crime fiction anywhere else other than Canada.”

It’s been seven years since Marilyn Reid last saw and spoke to her husband John. It was in February of 2013 that he was brought to Victoria Hospital via ambulance, suicidal and in crisis.

“When we got him there I was very relieved and I thought he was safe and in good hands.”

John, a veteran of the Canadian Armed Forces suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and was having suicidal thoughts.

“He was in the hospital in crisis and was there a week in crisis and then was released, but nobody contacted me to tell me that he was leaving the hospital. I was actually in shock.”

Reid says she received a phone call from the hospital, one that forever changed her life.

“The only phone call I got from them was to tell me that he was deceased and that he died on hospital grounds. He took his life, just very shortly after they released him.”

Reid says after seeing the CTV News story last week about a suicidal woman going missing after being discharged from Victoria Hospital, she knew she had to speak out.

“I cant believe that people are being released from the hospital and their loved ones aren’t being contacted. It’s been a few years since my husband died and I can’t believe this is still going on.”

The London Health Coalition believes the care for mental health patients is only going to get worse if there continues to be a lack of services and funding for mental health care.

“We in this community have already suffered from losing so many beds, thousands literally,” says Peter Bergmanis from the London Health Coalition. “There was the London Psychiatric Hospital and the St. Thomas Psychiatric Hospital that are vacant. So where are these people supposed to go?”

Reid agrees more funding and services would be key, but in the interim would like to see hospitals contacting family before discharging mental health patients.

“I, in my heart feel if I could have seen him and talked to him again that the outcome would’ve been entirely different.”

Policies differ from hospital hospital when it comes to notifying family of patient discharge.

In a statement the London Health Sciences Centre said, “Our care providers work with patients to support their discharge, including calling their families/supports when needed. We welcome families sharing their concerns with us, and we are committed to working with them directly.”

Meanwhile St. Thomas Elgin General Hospital states, “When a patient presents in the Emergency Department, they are triaged by a nurse and assessed by a skilled emergency physician. Based on the assessment, a decision to admit or discharge would be made. The decision to notify a family member is determined through a conversation with the patient. This process remains unchanged during COVID.“",[]

Mental health patient in crisis released from hospital more than once,['Celine Zadorsky'],2020-05-01 14:22:00-04:00,"LONDON, ONT. -- Kristin Legault suffers from severe bipolar disorder. It was earlier this year she shared her success story with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Legault says for the first time she was seeing a positive change with her mental health, but that all changed months ago.

“Because of the coronavirus all of my ECT treatments were discontinued,” says Legault. It’s been around two months without ECT treatments and her mental health has severely declined.

Just two weeks ago, she was suicidal, and police and ambulance were called when she attempted to take her life at her grandparents home in St. Thomas.

She says, “I saw a GP (general practitioner), I wasn’t formed and I didn’t see a psychiatric nurse. Actually they were more concerned with my physical health than my mental health.”

Legualt says about two hours after arriving at St. Thomas Elgin General Hospital via ambulance, she was discharged without a next of kin being contacted.

“They just gave me directions on how to leave the hospital and I walked around Elm Street in St. Thomas at 2:30 a.m. by myself in my pyjamas.”

Her grandmother, Joanne Donkers, found her and got her home safe.

“She just walked out of hospital and I think that’s totally wrong. She could’ve gone anywhere and she was in real crisis and needed help.”

CTV News reached out to St. Thomas Elgin General hospital for comment, hospital communications staff replied via email saying:

""When a patient presents in the Emergency Department, they are triaged by a nurse and assessed by a skilled emergency physician. Based on the assessment, a decision to admit or discharge would be made.

""The decision to notify a family member is determined through a conversation with the patient. This process remains unchanged during COVID.""

Days later and still feeling suicidal, Legault’s GP sent her to the London Health Sciences Centre's (LHSC) Victoria Hospital on a form for mental health crisis care.

She said again, less than two hours later she was released from the emergency department.

Her grandmother, who found her outside Victoria Hospital, says their family is desperate for help.

“We are not equipped to take care of Kristin in crisis. We do the best we can but we really think there should be more help for her.”

Legault says she’s feeling hopeless, “I feel like - Am I ever going to get better? Is anyone ever going to help me?”

""I made a mistake in not recusing myself immediately from the discussions, given our family's history, and I'm sincerely sorry about not having done that,"" Trudeau said.

Trudeau said he is sorry for how the rollout of the Canada Student Service Grant program went, and he regrets the “unnecessary controversy” it’s caused.

“The mistake that we made was on me, and I take responsibility for it. We will continue to work very, very hard to deliver the program,” Trudeau said, speaking about the ongoing controversy during his first national address on the federal government’s latest COVID-19 response plans from Rideau Cottage in two weeks.

Over the last two weeks, the controversy surrounding the government’s decision to allow the WE Charity to deliver a now-halted $900 million COVID-19 student grant program has grown considerably.

WE Charity backed away from administering the grants amid questions about Trudeau’s involvement, but also in light of a series of news stories about racialized former employees’ experiences with the organization.

The ethics commissioner also launched a probe into a potential conflict of interest with Trudeau’s decision to grant the organization the contract to administer the program, given the prime minister’s close personal ties to the charity.

“This was my mistake. This was me not stepping back from an organization that I should have known to not get involved with, even as prime minister, and allow the public service and non-connected ministers to move forward on delivering this program,” said Trudeau on Monday.

'I DIDN'T KNOW THE DETAILS'

Last week WE Charity confirmed that, over the years, Trudeau’s wife, mother, and brother have received a range of payments amounting to around $300,000 for speaking at WE events. Sophie Gregoire Trudeau is an ambassador with the organization and hosts a mental health podcast under its name. She received a ""one-time speaking honorarium"" of $1,400 for participating in a youth event in 2012, before Trudeau became leader of the Liberal Party.

On Monday, the prime minister faced a series of questions from reporters about whether he knew his family members got paid by WE, and said that, while he was aware of their professional speaking roles, he was unaware of just how much money his family members received.

""I have known, obviously, for many years that my mom has been an extraordinary advocate for mental health issues, a professional public speaker who works with a range of different organizations. Obviously I knew she worked with WE, I didn't know the details of how much she was getting paid by various organizations but I should have and I deeply regret that,” Trudeau said on Monday.

Trudeau said he also regrets bringing his mother, Margaret Trudeau, into the controversy, saying that it was “unfair.”

“I should have been thoughtful enough to recuse myself completely from any discussions around WE because of these connections from the very beginning, and I did not and I'm very sorry about that,” he said.

MORNEAU ALSO APOLOGIZES

Last week Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s office confirmed his daughters have connections to the charity and he also did not recuse himself from the decision-making table. The finance minister’s daughter Clare has spoken at WE events, and his daughter Grace is currently employed by WE Charity.

On Friday, Morneau also apologized for not removing himself from discussions about the student grant program.

“Given the fact that my daughter works for the organization in an unrelated branch, I now realize I should have in order to avoid any perception of conflict. I apologize for not doing so, and moving forward, I will recuse myself from any future discussions related to WE,” Morneau said in a statement.

STUDENTS LEFT IN LIMBO

Initially, WE Charity was selected to set up placements and administer grants to students and new graduates for their volunteer work this summer.

With the program halted, thousands of students are now in limbo without summer jobs and, for now, no chance for volunteer grants to help cover costs like fall tuition.

The grant to post-secondary students and recent graduates was designed to provide one-time payments of up to $5,000 for volunteering in pandemic-related programs, depending on the number of hours worked. For every 100 hours spent, a student will receive $1,000.

On Monday, Trudeau repeated his regret that his error in judgment has resulted in students hoping to help their communities being left in limbo instead.

“Because of the mistake I made in not withdrawing from these conversations when the public service recommended we move forward with the WE organization, it has gotten a little slower for young people who are facing a difficult time right now, to be able to get involved in their communities and make a difference,” Trudeau said.

Now, Trudeau says the government is looking to Service Canada as a potential avenue to run the program, despite doubling down on the statement that the public service had initially suggested outsourcing the program to WE Charity.

OPPOSITION PARTIES DIG IN

The Conservatives have written to the RCMP suggesting they look into the matter, while two House of Commons studies are underway into various aspects of the controversy.

Now, the opposition is looking to convene a third committee probe, with the intent to uncover as many documents as possible and aiming to call and a slate of cabinet ministers to testify.

Trudeau said a series of cabinet ministers will be testifying this week about the affair, and if he gets an invitation, he will consult with his House of Commons leadership team about attending.

“Obviously, the opposition parties have their job to do and they will keep doing it. I have my job to do as well, which is to make sure that Canadians are well supported through this pandemic and we have an economic restart that goes smoothly,” Trudeau said.

“Revelations that Justin Trudeau’s family was paid to speak at events for an organization, which later received a $900 million sole-source contract, are deeply disturbing,” said Conservative MP and ethics critic Michael Barrett in a statement about the push for a third committee study. “This new information has raised concerns about the way this Liberal government operates and whether the appropriate processes are in place to avoid conflicts of interest,” said Barrett.

Critics have pointed to the WE Charity affair as the latest in a series of ethical oversights Trudeau has had over his time as prime minister.

Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion’s ongoing investigation is now the third ethics investigation Trudeau has been subjected to, with the two previous times — his trip to the Aga Khan’s private island and in relation to the SNC-Lavalin prosecution — resulting in findings that Trudeau had breached federal ethics law. In both cases Trudeau apologized for his improper behaviour, and both times he said he had learned his lesson.

“I feel like it's Groundhog Day. We've seen so many instances where the prime minister gets caught… seems outraged that anyone could question him, and then as the scandal deepens then he apologizes,” said NDP MP and ethics critic Charlie Angus in an interview on CTV News Channel. He said what is most concerning is that no one around Trudeau seemed to try to stop him from getting involved given his close personal ties to the organization.

Angus said the controversy should have never happened and if the proper standards and protocols were in place, it wouldn’t have. He called it “one of the stupidest scandals in Canadian history.”

Asked if he was worried that the controversy puts his minority government on unstable footing after months of positive polling numbers, Trudeau said on Monday that he trusts Canadians will make judgments on his leadership based on the pandemic response as a whole.

“When we look at these things, proximity to the prime minister has an impact… The fact that it includes family members makes it very problematic for the prime minister,” said pollster Nik Nanos in an interview on CTV News Channel.

WE CHARITY WEIGHS IN

In a new statement on their website, WE Charity co-founders Craig Kielburger and Marc Kielburger say they want to “set the record straight” about the entire affair. The brothers wrote about how their organization was qualified to stickhandle the administration of the Canada Student Service Grant program, which had 35,000 applicants a week after launching. But, as their statement notes, “the program was immediately enmeshed in controversy,” and handed back over to the government along with the funding.

“WE has not profited from this contract in any way,” said the Keilburgers, adding that the last two weeks have been “extremely difficult.”

“The charity’s integrity and purpose has been called into question. It has had direct impacts on our staff, supporters, and beneficiaries. We have made mistakes that we sincerely regret,” says the statement.",[]

What PM Trudeau's COVID-19 messaging reveals,['Rachel Aiello'],2020-07-13 07:15:00-04:00,"OTTAWA -- It became a scene most Canadians could recognize: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau emerges from Rideau Cottage and descends six steps to a podium, notes in hand. This was how the prime minister chose to speak to the country, day in and day out between March and July. In his morning updates, COVID-19 aid packages amounting to hundreds of billions of dollars were unveiled and public health advisories were driven home, but what else did Trudeau have to say?

CTVNews.ca has analyzed the 81 national addresses and following media availabilities that Trudeau held during the 110 days between entering a 14-day self-isolation, on March 12, to his June 29 announcement that, going forward, he would only convene the Rideau Cottage updates when he had big news to share.

The day after Trudeau entered quarantine on account of his wife Sophie having symptoms that were soon confirmed to be from COVID-19, the prime minister began what quickly became a daily routine: addressing the nation from Rideau Cottage, his family’s temporary home on the grounds of Rideau Hall.

Those morning addresses, mostly from the grounds of Rideau Hall, became a seven-day-a-week ritual, with few days off in the first two months. Then, as the public health crisis entered into the initial phase of reopenings, the routine was eased, with no press conferences on weekends and eventually only a few times a week.

Analyzing the transcripts of his English-language remarks from all those Rideau Cottage updates, as well as the few offsite, CTVNews.ca identified his commonly used phrases and terms, as well as his go-to nouns and adjectives, before asking political communication experts and a linguist to assess the words he was using to deliver his messages, and whether they were effective.

WHAT WORDS DID HE USE?

CTVNews.ca’s analysis found that the most repeated phrase was “right across the country,” followed by variations of “keep Canadians safe.” Others that topped the list included “make sure,” and “move forward.”

Speaking to the use of “keep Canadians safe,” former lead speechwriter for Trudeau, Jeni Armstrong, said she thinks it was a great choice.

“It's simple, it's direct, it appeals to the kind of worries that we all have about our families… It’s memorable and like I said, it is the kind of reassurance that I think people were seeking especially in the early days,” said Armstrong, who is now an instructor with the Clayton H. Riddell Graduate Program in Political Management at Carleton University after working as the director of communications for Finance Minister Bill Morneau and helping to author the Liberal Party’s 2019 and 2015 federal election platforms.

Other phrases that appeared often included: “long-term care”; “continue to work”; “public health”; “social distancing”; “people need”; “staying home”; and “coming weeks.”

CTVNews.ca also searched for the frequency of other key words, which may not necessarily be the words said the most. The word “recognize” came up 183 times over the 81 addresses, “virus” was said 127 times, “parliament” got named 108 times and “unprecedented” was said 63 times. Further, “racism” was said 53 times, “China” was found in the transcripts 45 times, and “budget” just nine times.

Armstrong said Trudeau has a personal verbal habit where he builds formulas for responding to questions, which could explain the frequency of the word “recognize”—which often was how he started an answer to reporters’ questions: “we recognize…”

“He'll often say—and this has been true for a number of years… ‘Canadians expect us to ABC, and we are doing just that.’ It's kind of a formula that he has,” she said.

Trudeau’s go-to verbs, in order of frequency: “need”; “get”; “make”; “continue”’ “know”; “keep”; “ensure”; “want”; “think”; and “help.”

As for adjectives, he most often said: “many”; “sure”; “safe”; “able”; “right”; “important”; “different”; “new”; “Canadian”; and “possible.”

Linguist Shana Poplack told CTVNews.ca that Trudeau’s word choices show he wants to evoke he is in charge and has things under control.

“If this is the message he's trying to relay, those words are consistent,” said Poplack, who is the director of the Sociolinguistics Laboratory at the University of Ottawa and Canada Research Chair in Linguistics.

Poplack also said what stood out to her were the phrases that didn’t crack the top of the list of things Trudeau said, despite them being so frequently said in society writ large these days, including “in these uncertain times,” and “the new normal.”

“That does not tie in with the message that he's trying to get across,” she said, suggesting it’s possible he didn’t want to highlight the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“That's why we see “ensure,” we see the word “safe,” reappearing... He also has to convince us that he's on top of it,” she said.

BUILT UP LEXICON OF PHRASES

What the frequent repetition of these and other phrases indicates, experts said, is that Trudeau and his relatively small team of speechwriters had developed a dictionary of key phrases to reinforce and repeat in his prepared remarks. The messaging was first built into his speeches, but after their near-daily repeating, they became a reflexive part of his vocabulary when responding to questions, too.

Poplack said these are referred to as “fixed expressions,” some of which are commonly used by all, others are created, as seen with terms for aid programs to establish a clear message. The use of such phrases can be seen across political lines and in past prime ministers’ speaking habits as well.

“For Paul Martin it was ‘let me be clear,’ for Stephen Harper it was ‘obviously’,” said Garry Keller, vice president at StrategyCorp and a past adviser to former prime minister Stephen Harper.

Armstrong said the repetition of the COVID-19 benefit-specific phrases also helped to build up familiarity with new programs. “Emergency Response Benefit” — referring to the Canada Emergency Response Benefit of $2,000 a month to out of wok Canadians — was in the top-five most said three-word phrases, and “wage subsidy” was in the top five two-word phrases spoken.

“What he's attempting to do there is to get people familiar with the name of any program… When you're working on that, repetition is your friend,” she said.

STRUCTURE SUITS THE PM

Strategic communication professional and political commentator Scott Reid said that the formula of “political communication by dint of news conference” has become a go-to form of communicating COVID-19 crisis updates around the world and across Canada, where provincial premiers have all taken a similar approach.

The format plays to Trudeau’s strengths, Reid said, contrasting the PM’s comfort and skill delivering on-message remarks without relying on rote responses to the communication approach of other world leaders including U.S. President Donald Trump, who Reid said failed at being consistent in his messaging and shut down his routine of regular press conferences long before Trudeau did.

“A crisis such as this, which has created a made-for-television daily news conference, it's almost perfectly built for his [Trudeau’s] talent set and instincts because he has a preternatural sense of self… He's extraordinarily conscious of his presentation and of his representation to the public, and that serves him extremely well in this situation,” said Reid, who also worked as an adviser to former prime minister Paul Martin.

Keller noted that opting to keep Trudeau’s addresses to the high-level details and letting a cadre of ministers follow after him to take reporters’ more detailed questions also meant that Trudeau was usually out of the spotlight by midday, rather than facing reporters and opposition MPs multiple throughout the entire day.

“It quite frankly has worked for them,” said Keller, adding that all of the opposition parties found it challenging to compete with.

BOOST TO APPROVAL RATING

The more frequent prime ministerial appearances also had positive returns on his approval ratings, according to CTV News’ pollster and Chair of Nanos Research, Nik Nanos.

“What I'll call the ‘relentless chain of press conferences’ … they've effectively done a bit of a reset on his brand,” Nanos said. “There's been a complete reset on Justin Trudeau’s personal brand. His brand is now strong again— it's not as strong as the honeymoon [phase]— but it's strong and the Liberal numbers are strong.”

Nanos Research asks Canadians weekly whether they feel the various federal party leaders have the qualities of a good political leader, and Trudeau’s trend line shows that Canadians surveyed are viewing him more positively since March than they have in the entirety of the last four years.

KEY MOMENTS LIKE 'SPEAKING MOISTLY'

These routine speeches also provided several key moments over the initial four months of the COVID-19 pandemic, from Trudeau’s infamous “speaking moistly” slip-up when describing how the coronavirus can transmit through droplets, to his conspicuously long pause when asked about Trump's handling of anti-racism protesters in the United States.

While the combination of “speaking” and “moistly” was swiftly removed from Trudeau’s lexicon, Armstrong said even when such moments inspire mockery, they are generally well-received.

“That ended up being really funny at a time when people needed to laugh right? And he's, he's very much able to laugh at himself in moments like that,” she said of Trudeau. She cited the first time that he spoke directly to children as another notable moment.

“Kids are an overlooked constituency… They're not even spoken to directly by people in power very often. But they are feeling and experiencing this moment, in a very, very profound way, and I as a mom, and as a citizen, and as a communicator, I really love that he acknowledged that,” she said.

WHY THE ADDRESSES ENDED

By the time Trudeau said he’d be cutting down his regular press conferences, the announcements he was making had already become incremental and small, while the questions he faced were predominately about non-COVID-19 news.

The political communication experts CTVNews.ca spoke with largely agreed that, while the near-daily addresses were key in reassuring Canadians that the federal government was on top of the rapidly unfolding crisis early on, continuing to come out and face reporters was having diminishing positive returns for the prime minister as other big news stories began to bubble up, notably the ongoing WE Charity controversy.

Another reason some suggest could explain why Trudeau’s team opted to wind down what some critics call “the morning show”? Canadians had begun tuning them out.

“I think that they've rightly recognized that should there be a second wave, should there be a need to start communicating again on a daily basis in a way that was happening in March for example, they don't want to kind of burn the goodwill and the listening potential of the audience by continuing to speak every day if there's not something new to share,” said Kate Harrison, vice president at Summa Strategies Canada and Conservative political commentator.

WILL SEE THIS FORMAT AGAIN

Going forward, the experts interviewed said to expect the format to resume should there be a new resurgence in the virus’ spread.

Reid said that if there is a second wave of COVID-19 infections, the public and the media has come to expect the prime minister will be front-and-centre.

“This is now how it is done. It has quietly become a matter of consensus among political leaders, media, public audiences, that this is how this gets prosecuted, and so it will recur, and it will overwhelmingly benefit political leaders who are capable of commanding the podium and follow those very simple rules of being thematic, being consistent, demonstrating empathy,” Reid said.

Methodology: For this project we used the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) in Python to run a word frequency and N-gram analysis on the transcripts. An N-gram analysis counts the occurrences of two or more words together. The code stripped the transcripts to leave only those words spoken by Trudeau in English.

296,ctvnews,http://ctvnews.ca/canada/plate-shaming-is-happening-in-atlantic-canada-as-locals-fear-those-from-outside-the-bubble-1.5021203,'Plate-shaming' is happening in Atlantic Canada as locals fear those from outside the 'bubble',[],2020-07-12 22:00:00-04:00,"TORONTO -- Atlantic Canada’s reputation for being warm and welcoming has long been a source of pride.

But instead of hospitality, the pandemic is exposing a glimpse of hostility aimed at those who are assumed to be outsiders.

""Being from Halifax, growing up here all but eight years of my life, I really didn't expect this,” resident Tony Mountenay told CTV News.

Tony and Debbie Mountenay chose to return to Nova Scotia during the pandemic because they were looking for a laid back retirement.

As required, they isolated after they arrived. But then they decided to go out and run errands.

""And we had three different incidents where people came up beside us, yelling at us, through the window, and when it first happened, we had to try to think, well what was that about?” Debbie said.

The answer was the licence plate on their truck — showing that they came from Ontario.

Visitors from beyond the “Atlantic bubble” have been vilified by locals fearing the virus could be imported.

Though relatively rare, there have been incidents of “plate-shaming.”

A woman from Quebec was told to go home while walking on a New Brunswick beach.

More than 15,000 Newfoundlanders signed a petition demanding their province not open the border to anyone.

Debbie said one woman who had harassed the couple had done so in front of her own children.

“She really shouldn't have been doing that in my opinion,” she said. “Another man, you could tell he was out of control.""

The Atlantic bubble, which encompasses the provinces of New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador, is a concept that was introduced recently to allow easier travel between the Eastern provinces as the region reopens.

People from all across Canada are allowed to travel to any Atlantic province, but those outside of the Atlantic bubble must isolate for 14 days — as leaders in the region are quick to remind people.

""The Atlantic bubble is open today, [but] that does not apply to those who are from Ontario, Quebec or Western Canada,” Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil said. “If you're coming into our province, you're required to self isolate as well.""

The Atlantic provinces have largely fared well during the pandemic compared to provinces such as Ontario or Quebec. Of the Atlantic provinces, Nova Scotia has had the most cases in total, at just over 1,000 — a far cry from Quebec’s 56,521 cumulative cases.

The stress for locals in the Atlantic provinces is that out-of-bubble visitors could lead to a second wave of the virus.

Only last week, a string of new cases in Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island were proven to be related to travel from outside of the bubble. One individual flew from the United States to Toronto, and then to Halifax. This case was then connected to cases in Prince Edward Island.

McNeil said on July 6 that he is frustrated with travellers who do not isolate for the 14 days after they arrive.

“We have worked hard together and sacrificed so much in this province to help flatten the curve only to have some people come into our province who think they’re above it all, who think that the rules don’t apply to them,” he said. “Guess what? They do.”

But the Mountenay’s experience in Nova Scotia suggests that the uncertainty over who has isolated and who has not has led to some rather un-neighbourly behaviour.

In response, the couple has come with a way to alert people they’re not a threat. A piece of paper that clearly states a person has completed isolation.

""I don't want to get [COVID-19],” Debbie said. “And I don't want to give it to anybody.""",[]
297,ctvnews,http://ctvnews.ca/business/initiative-to-fight-anti-black-systemic-racism-on-bay-st-launched-1.5022074,Initiative to fight anti-Black systemic racism on Bay St. launched,[],2020-07-13 12:45:00-04:00,"TORONTO -- A coalition of Canadian business leaders have announced a strategic partnership for a program to support Black professionals on Bay Street and elsewhere.

The Canadian Council of Business Leaders Against Anti-Black Systemic Racism and the Canadian Association of Urban Financial Professionals announced the plan dubbed the Black North Initiative on Monday.

The plan advocates for companies to work with them to hire more Black students for their internship/co-op programs and to ensure business succession planning strategies include a Black talent strategy to help build a pipeline of employees for future leadership positions.

It is also asking that businesses disaggregate their employee race data and publish it annually, including data on executive representation and/or employee mobility statistics for each racialized group.

The push to deal with systemic racism has gained strength in recent months in the wake of demonstrations held across Canada and the U.S.

A summit is planned for July 20 where business leaders will be asked to sign a CEO pledge and say what they are doing to fight anti-Black systemic racism.

The Canadian Association of Urban Financial Professionals has more than 600 Black professionals as members who work across Bay Street.

""The BlackNorth Initiative and CAUFP are fully aligned regarding the critical need to begin dismantling systemic racism in corporate Canada,"" said Wes Hall, founder and chairman of the Canadian Council of Business Leaders Against Anti-Black Systemic Racism.

""Corporations must do more to create and nurture Black talent pipelines to ensure proper representation at the highest levels. This is a natural partnership in a shared mission that will lead to measurable results.""

298,ctvnews,http://ctvnews.ca/canada/canada-s-largest-indigenous-police-force-has-never-shot-anyone-dead-1.5020967,Canada's largest Indigenous police force has never shot anyone dead,['Colin Perkel'],2020-07-12 11:02:00-04:00,"TORONTO -- In its 26 years of existence, officers with Canada's largest Indigenous police force have never shot and killed anyone and no officer has died in the line of duty, despite a grinding lack of resources and an absence of normal accountability mechanisms.

It's a record of which the Nishnawbe Aski Police Service is proud, especially in light of the recent uproar in North America over police killings and brutality involving Indigenous, Black, and mentally distressed people. It's a record achieved in communities frequently in social distress, places where hunting rifles and shotguns are ubiquitous.

The key difference from urban, non-Indigenous policing, insiders and observers say, is the relationship building between officers and the people they serve.

""In the past, you might have been the only officer in there,"" Roland Morrison, chief of NAPS says from Thunder Bay, Ont. ""You would have no radio, you've got no backup, so you really effectively have to use your communication and talk to people. You have to develop relationships with the communities in order to have positive policing.""

Inaugurated in 1994, NAPS is responsible for policing more than 38,000 people in 34 communities, many beyond remote, across a vast, largely untamed swath of northern Ontario. Currently the service has 203 officers, about 60 per cent of them Indigenous, Morrison says. Its mandate is culturally responsive policing.

Erick Laming, a criminology PhD candidate at the University of Toronto, says people from First Nation communities -- many with an ingrained suspicion of police given the brutal realities of generations of enforced residential school attendance -- have a higher level of trust when officers are Indigenous.

In contrast, he said, new RCMP recruits with no such background might find themselves in Nunavut or Yukon confronted with significant language and cultural barriers.

""If you're from the community, you have those lived experiences. You can relate to people. You just know how to deal with the issues,"" says Laming, who is from the Shabot Obaadjiwan First Nation north of Kingston, Ont.

""If you don't have that history, you can have all the cultural-sensitivity training in the world, you'll never fully be able to fully integrate into that situation.""

Another example, he said, is the service in Kahnawake, Que., which calls itself the Kahnawake Peacekeepers rather than a police force.

While all officers in Ontario undergo the same basic training, the province's nine Indigenous police services are fundamentally different from their non-Indigenous counterparts.

For one thing, they are not deemed an essential service, although federal Public Safety Minister Bill Blair said last month that policing First Nations communities should be. Nor are those in Ontario subject to the provincial Police Services Act, which mandates standards, including for an extensive oversight framework.

Now, the process for filing complaints against members of an Indigenous police force is ad hoc, although NAPS does have a professional standards branch and will on occasion call in Ontario Provincial Police. Officers have been disciplined, charged or even fired for excessive use of force.

Another difference is that Indigenous forces are completely reliant on the vagaries of government program funding -- with Ottawa footing 52 per cent of the bill and provinces 48 per cent. The current operations budget for NAPS, for example, is around $37.7 million -- more than its peers -- with expenses approaching $40 million.

The upshot, particularly in years gone by, has been a dire shortage of officers and even of basic facilities and equipment that urbanites can scarcely imagine. In more than a dozen cases, Indigenous self-administered police services in Canada have simply folded.

Now retired, Terry Armstrong, who spent 22 years with Ontario Provincial Police as well as five years as chief of NAPS, says people would be shocked to find out just how poorly funded First Nations policing has been.

Armstrong recounts how a few years ago, in the Hudson Bay community of Fort Severn, Ont., a NAPS officer found himself dealing with a homicide. Besides having to secure three crime scenes and the body, the lone officer had to arrest the suspect and deal with a separate gun call. Bad weather prevented any forensic or other help flying in until the following day.

One thing he always stressed to newcomers as chief, Armstrong says, is the importance of treating people respectfully.

""Some day, they're going to be your backup. When stuff goes south, you're going to need people to support you,"" he says. ""If you're going to be a dick ... when you need help, they aren't going to be there for you.""

One frigid afternoon in February 2013, the only on-duty NAPS officer in Kasabonika Lake First Nation in Ontario's far north detained Lena Anderson, an intoxicated young mother upset over the apprehension of her daughter. The new detachment portable was unheated. The old holding cell was unusable because prisoners could escape through holes in the floor.

The arresting officer left Anderson, 23, in the caged back seat of his Ford 150 police truck for warmth while he went to get help from his off-duty colleague. Alone for 16 minutes, Anderson strangled herself.

The tragedy, combined with a threatened strike over working conditions by NAPS officers, caused an uproar. The situation, says Grand Chief Alvin Fiddler, prompted his Nishnawbe Aski Nation to take a stand. Governments, he said, had to do better or face the far more daunting prospect of doing the policing themselves.

As a result, Fiddler says, a new funding agreement was reached in 2018 that allowed the hiring of 79 new officers over five years and critical infrastructure upgrades to detachments and poor or non-existent communication systems. Most importantly, he said, the deal set in motion pending Ontario legislation that would finally allow First Nations police services to opt in to the Police Services Act, putting in place solid standards and accountability mechanisms.

""That's something our communities and citizens deserve."" Fiddler says. ""If they have an issue with NAPS, there should be a forum for them to pursue their grievance.""

However, giving investigative authority to the province's Special Investigations Unit or Office of the Independent Police Review Director must come with cultural safety built in, he says.

Stephen Leach, current review director, says his office is not yet involved in the opt-in process.

""My expectation is that once the Community Safety and Policing Act is proclaimed and the opt-in process is further along, then I would be involved in explaining how the public complaints process works, and listening to how it might have to be adapted to meet the needs of First Nations communities,"" Leach says.

Stephen Warner, a spokesman for Ontario Solicitor General Sylvia Jones, confirmed the government was working on regulations to the new act. Part of the work, he said, was to set clear and consistent standards for policing delivery ""informed by, and responsive to, the views of the communities that police are both a part of and serve.""

Toronto-based lawyer Julian Falconer calls the new legislation a game changer. Despite having devoted much of his career to holding police accountable, he says he has no qualms in representing NAPS.

Despite, or perhaps because of, their chronic lack of resources, Falconer says Indigenous police behave much differently from their urban counterparts. He cites the dearth of police killings and racist behaviours that have sown deep mistrust of policing among Indigenous, Black and marginalized groups.

""Mainstream policing has a lot to learn from Indigenous policing,"" Falconer said. ""The relationship between community and policing is so dramatically different.""

299,ctvnews,http://ctvnews.ca/canada/defund-the-police-this-is-how-much-canadian-cities-spend-1.5018506,Defund the police? Here's a look at how much Canadian cities spend on policing,[],2020-07-10 07:30:00-04:00,"TORONTO -- An analysis by CTVNews.ca of 18 of Canada’s largest cities, regions and provincial capitals found more than half allocated 15 per cent or more of their 2020 operating budget to policing, with cities in Western Canada budgeting 20 per cent or more.

Coast-to-coast, from Vancouver to Charlottetown, P.E.I., Canadian cities are spending 15 to 20 per cent or more of their budget on law enforcement, the bulk of it coming from municipal taxes. Cities that do not have a municipal force were excluded from the analysis.

Cries to defund the police have rung out in protests across the United States, sparked by the death of George Floyd, seen in a video pleading and gasping for air as a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee against his neck -- long after he had already gone silent.

Around the world and in Canada, cities are also facing public pressure to reduce their law enforcement budgets to reallocate funds to other areas including mental health and community social support services.

It is a contentious issue, however. Ontario Premier Doug Ford has already dismissed the idea for the Ontario Provincial Police, saying he believes in strengthening policing through better community involvement.

In recent months, several deaths that followed “wellness checks” by Canadian police have sparked further discussion over whether police officers are properly trained or even the appropriate authority to deal with someone having a mental health crisis, in particular those who are Black, Indigenous, or a person of colour.

In June, 62-year-old Ejaz Choudry was killed in his home by police in Mississauga, Ont., after the family said it called a non-emergency helpline because he was having a mental health episode. Paramedics who arrived called the police after Choudry was seen with a knife in his hand. Earlier in the month, Chantel Moore, an Indigenous woman, was shot and killed by police in New Brunswick during another wellness check, while Regis Korchinski-Paquet, a Black, Indigenous woman, fell from her apartment balcony in Toronto last month while police officers were in her home.

BIGGEST POLICE BUDGET IN CANADA

At the end of June, Toronto city council rejected a 10 per cent cut to the police budget, about $107 million, and instead passed a motion on police reform that includes implementing body cameras and overhauling the way Canada’s largest municipal police force responds to people in crisis.

A 10 per cent reduction would have meant cutting about 1,000 police officers, according to the Canadian Press, a move that could take years to implement due to collective bargaining agreements with the union.

The Toronto Police Service operating budget for 2020 is $1.22 billion, about 9 per cent of the city’s $13.53 billion operational budget for 2020. More than $3 billion is distributed for various social support and development programs including employment, social assistance, child-care, long-term care services, helping under-resourced neighbourhoods, housing and shelter support.

In early June, the Vancouver Police Board rejected a motion by city council calling for a 1 per cent cut to the police’s $339 million budget, about 21 per cent of the city’s $1.62 billion operating budget for 2020.

Meanwhile, Edmonton city council approved a motion in early July that included cutting the police service’s budget by $11 million over the next two years amid weeks of debate around police reform.

South of the border, the city of Los Angeles voted on July 1 to cut police department hiring, slashing the LAPD’s budget by US$150 million. The cut brings the department’s staffing down to its lowest level in 12 years, the Los Angeles Times reported. The city said the money would eventually be reallocated into services like hiring programs and summer youth jobs for Black, Latino and other marginalized communities.

BIGGEST LINE ITEM ON THE BUDGET

For cities in Western Canada including Victoria, Vancouver, Saskatoon, Regina, Winnipeg, policing accounts for at least 20 per cent of their 2020 operating budgets. Among them, all but Vancouver have policing as the city’s biggest expenditure. (Utilities is listed as Vancouver’s biggest operating expenditure in its 2020 budget, though annual financial reports show that police is the city’s biggest expense.)

In Victoria, the police force accounts for roughly 23 per cent of the city’s total operating expenses for 2020. For Vancouver, Saskatoon and Regina, it’s just over 20 per cent. Edmonton and Calgary are the exceptions.

The Winnipeg Police Service is getting $304.1 million this year, or 26.6 per cent of the city’s $1.14 billion tax-supported operating expenditures. It is the largest percentage among the cities examined by CTVNews.ca. By comparison, community services in Winnipeg are getting $115 million, or 10 per cent of the budget.

As in many other cities, a petition has been circulating calling for change and defunding the Winnipeg police. Chief Danny Smyth said in June that it was too early to “just say defund the police and forward that all to social services” but added there was room for conversation on what such a move could look like.

Even places with modest budgets, like Charlottetown, P.E.I., which has a budget of $59.7 million, allocates more than 16 per cent to police. In Fredericton, N.B., more than 14 per cent of its $124.4 million budget (including capital expenditures) goes to policing. That portion is more than 18 per cent if capital expenditures are excluded.

In larger southern Ontario, Toronto-area cities and regions including Hamilton, Waterloo, Peel, and York, hundreds of millions of dollars are spent each year on policing. Peel and York, which have similar operating budgets of approximately $2.5 billion, spend about $445.8 million and $384.2 million, respectively, or 17 and 16 per cent. The Waterloo Regional Police, which also serves Kitchener, Ont., accounts for just over 17 per cent of the region’s operating budget. Hamilton’s police budget accounts for nearly 19 per cent of the city’s net operating budget. (That portion is halved however, if calculated based on the tax and rate supported gross operating expenditure).

Nearly all cities that spend roughly 10 per cent or less on policing have operating budgets of at least $1 billion. These include Toronto, Calgary, Ottawa, Quebec City, Montreal and Halifax, which has a budget just shy of a billion.

According to Statistics Canada data, the average salary among municipal police officers was $100,962 for 2017/2018, the latest year in which data is available. And while police spending has increased, the number of police officers per 100,000 people has been shrinking, the data showed.

In the United States, data varies depending on the source, but the percentage allocated to police departments for the 10 largest cities in the country ranged from 6 per cent to 17.4 per cent based on an analysis by U.S. News & World Report. Data compiled by the Center for Popular Democracy, a progressive advocacy group, which includes other cities, showed that percentage ranged as high as 20 to 45 per cent, with such cities as Minneapolis accounting for more than 35 per cent and Milwaukee making up nearly 48 per cent.

One important caveat to note is that cities are all structured differently and may report their finances or categorize their spending differently as well, so a true apples-to-apples comparison is extremely difficult. A few cities include utilities as part of its operating expenses, for example, while many do not.The Canadian police data in this analysis was collected and calculated based on figures presented in 2020 budget proposals and reports released by each city and region. As much as possible, comparable figures were used. In general, total operating budget or expenditure budget excluding capital expenditures as presented in the budget reports were used. In some cases, for example, figures provided may be net of recoveries and/or transfers, terms for certain types of financial transactions in accounting.

This comes as Trudeau spoke to U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday morning, though the border was not among the range of topics the prime minister said the two world leaders discussed — despite the looming July 21 deadline.

""Every month we have been able to extend the border closures to all but essential goods and services and those discussions are ongoing with the United States right now as we are a week from the next deadline for closures,"" Trudeau said.

""We're going to continue to work hard to keep Canadians safe and to keep our economies flowing, we will have more to say later this week I'm sure.""

Canada has been under renewed pressure to reopen the shared border, despite surging COVID-19 case numbers in the United States. At the end of June, the U.S. became home to the world’s highest number of reported infections: more than 2.2 million. That number has since soared to more than 3.3 million, according to the New York Times, with more than 134,000 deaths.

Despite these figures, 29 bipartisan members of U.S. Congress penned an open letter to Public Safety Minister Bill Blair calling on the Canadian government to plan a phased reopening of the Canada-U.S. border and to consider easing existing measures.

""We are asking that the United States and Canada immediately craft a comprehensive framework for phased reopening of the border based on objective metrics and accounting for the varied circumstances across border regions,"" read the letter, which was published on Western New York Congressman Brian Higgins' website on July 3.

The members of Congress, who represent the northern states along the border, also implored the Canadian government to consider easing restrictions on family members and property owners impeded by the restrictions.

The Canadian government pushed back on the request, with Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland's office telling CTVNews.ca in a statement that the health and safety of Canadians is ""absolutely priority.""

""Decisions about Canada's border are made by Canadians, for Canadians,"" Freeland's spokesperson Katherine Cuplinskas said in the statement on Friday.

The suggestion was also unpopular with non-politician Canadians, who took to social media to express their staunch opposition.

In response to a tweet from Higgins, who had shared the open letter on his Twitter account, hundreds of Canadians slammed the suggestion.

""No thank you...clean up your backyard before you attempt to enter ours..sincerely Canada,"" wrote a user who goes by the name @MichelletypoQ.

Another user, @rachelinTO, wrote that ""most of our earliest cases came from the U.S. So......that's a firm 'no'. Sorry, eh.""

Users called the request ""disastrous"" and multiple accounts said they’d only be comfortable easing restrictions after seeing improvement in the number of COVID-19 cases in the U.S.

TRUMP, TRUDEAU DISCUSS TARIFF THREAT

While Trudeau did not give any indication in his press conference that he and Trump had touched on the border issue during their phone call on Monday, he did confirm that the two discussed a host of other issues — including China and the two detained Canadians, the Black Lives Matter movement, and the U.S. president’s renewed aluminium tariff threat.

""I impressed upon him that it would be a shame to see tariffs come in between our two countries at a time where we’re celebrating NAFTA , and at a time where we want our businesses and our manufacturers to get going as quickly as possible,"" Trudeau said.

""We pledged to keep working on it together.""

Trudeau also said he told Trump that the pandemic had disrupted the usual supply chains and manufacturing processes, but that this disruption is slowly subsiding.

""That is starting to realign itself, given the economies are starting up again and manufacturing is getting going,"" Trudeau said.

CTV News confirmed the possibility of the U.S. slapping another set of tariffs on Canada at the end of June. The tariffs would fall under Section 232 of the U.S. Trade Expansion Act, and the threat comes amid U.S. claims that their aluminum market is being flooded by Canadian product.

Two Canadian sources told CTV News at the time that the announcement is possible in the coming weeks, though to date no formal announcement of tariffs has transpired.

Should the U.S. decide to re-impose tariffs on Canada, it would reopen a trade rift between the two countries that had been healing since a spat just over a year ago, that saw the U.S. impose tariffs on steel and aluminum and Canada answer with tariffs on a wide array of U.S. products including quiche, mayonnaise, and toilet paper.

Trudeau has been outspoken in his defence of Canada's aluminum industry, noting when the possibility of the U.S. imposing new tariffs emerged recently, that the U.S. ""needs Canadian aluminum"" and would only be hurting its own economy.

""Our economies are so interlinked that punitive actions by the United States administration end up hurting Americans the same way they end up hurting Canadians,"" Trudeau said at the time.",[]
301,ctvnews,http://ctvnews.ca/canada/who-s-hiring-a-look-at-the-canadian-job-market-1.5022260,Where the jobs are: Some sectors rebounding faster as Canada emerges from lockdown,['Ryan Flanagan'],2020-07-13 14:39:00-04:00,"TORONTO -- Jobs lost during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic are coming back – but not all at once, and not in the same order they disappeared.

Statistics Canada reported July 10 that more than 950,000 jobs were added in the country in June. While only a small fraction of the three million or so positions that were lost as lockdowns were imposed in March and April, the number represents a record increase as those measures are lifted.

""There's a lot of places that are still hiring amidst all the doom and gloom that we've been experiencing over the past few months,"" Carolyn Levy, president of the technologies division of staffing and recruitment agency Randstad Canada, told CTVNews.ca on Monday via telephone from Calgary.

Breaking down the numbers by industry yields clues into where the first wave of rebound hiring is taking place. More than 20 per cent of the added jobs were classified as wholesale and retail trade – with 16 per cent in accommodation and food services, 12 per cent in health care and social assistance, and eight per cent apiece in construction and manufacturing.

This suggests that the retail and restaurant workers who were among the first to be let go when their establishments were ordered to close were also among the first to be hired back when limited activity was allowed to resume.

There is still a long way to go before those sectors can be back to normal, though. In food services alone, it is believed that 400,000 Canadian jobs eliminated during the pandemic have yet to return. Many businesses in the broader service sector say they do not expect to ever return to pre-pandemic staffing levels.

Also notable, StatCan found, is that there were more wholesale jobs in Canada in June than there were in February, before the pandemic hit. Levy chalked this increase up to the surge in online shopping, which has left companies needing extra staff in warehouses and other parts of the supply chain.

On manufacturing, Levy said the increase could be due to companies retooling their lines to produce personal protective equipment or other items suddenly in demand due to the pandemic.

EMPLOYERS RETHINKING OLD ROLES

For the nearly 2.5 million Canadians who remain unemployed, though, knowing where hiring has recently happened only paints part of the picture. More helpful is information about where hiring is happening now.

According to the federal government's job bank, the most in-demand jobs right now are sales associates, administrative assistants and customer service representatives, followed by truck drivers, general farm workers and light-duty cleaners.

A popular website used by job-seekers to connect with employers is seeing similar patterns. Brendon Bernard, an economist with the Indeed Hiring Lab, wrote July 7 that retail and customer service jobs are among those that saw the biggest drop in new postings on Indeed earlier in the pandemic, and have since seen some of the biggest rebounds.

""Sectors narrowing the gap relatively quickly in recent weeks include ones featuring lower-paying positions, like retail, and customer service,"" he wrote.

""Areas posting roles with many mid-wage jobs have also seen noticeable bounce-backs, like construction, as well as education and instruction.""

Levy said that some employers are also creating new roles as they look to respond to their customers' needs during and after the pandemic. Opportunities created by this include more positions for financial advisers, she said, as well as an even greater demand for tech workers.

Postings on Indeed for higher-paying jobs have been slower to bounce back, Bernard said. Indeed has tracked two categories where new job postings have fallen off since early May – security and public safety, and aviation.

Bernard reported that the number of new job postings on Indeed as of July 3 was 21 per cent lower than it had been one year earlier. That gap had been as large as 70 per cent in mid-April. Smaller provinces, which have generally been less affected by COVID-19, have kept job posting levels closer to where they were in 2019 than larger provinces.

Levy said she is seeing employers increasingly show interest in hiring for temporary contract positions. This benefits them because it allows them to avoid making long-term commitments in an uncertain environment, she said, but can also be good for those looking for jobs because it gives them a chance to find work that they might not otherwise have.

""Companies have had to take a step back and start to reimagine how they have to work in this new normal,"" she said.

""Businesses have to look at what do we need to do to reskill, what do we need to do to retrain, given the way we operated our business four months ago is not the way it's going to be … from now on.""",[]

The body was discovered five days after the 33-year-old Rivera disappeared on Lake Piru, where her son was found July 8 alone a few hours later on a boat the two had rented, the Ventura County Sheriff's Office said.

Authorities would not immediately say if the person found was Rivera, but said the day after she disappeared that they believed she drowned in the lake northwest of Los Angeles. A 2 p.m. press conference was scheduled.

Search crews found the body floating in the northeast area of the lake, authorities said. The body would be flown 40 miles (64 kilometres) to the coroner's office in Ventura, Sheriff's Capt. Eric Buschow said. Rivera's family has been notified of the discovery.

The lake an hour's drive from Los Angeles was searched by dozens of divers working in waters with little visibility, with help from sonar and robotic devices combing the bottom and helicopters and drones searching above.

“I can't imagine what it's like for her parents, her family,” Buschow said. “It takes an emotional toll on the search teams too.”

Rivera played singing cheerleader Santana Lopez for six seasons on the Fox musical-comedy “Glee.”

If she is declared dead, she will become the third major cast member from the show to die in their 30s.

Cory Monteith, one of the show's leads, died at 31 in 2013 from a toxic mix of alcohol and heroin.

And co-star Mark Salling, who Rivera dated at one point, killed himself in 2018 at age 35 after pleading guilty to child pornography charges.

Rivera had experience boating on the lake in Los Padres National Forest, authorities said.

Surveillance video shows Rivera and her son, Josey Hollis Dorsey, leaving on the rented boat.

When the boat failed to return, its vendor found the vessel drifting in the northern end of the lake late Wednesday afternoon with the boy asleep on board. He told investigators that he and his mother had been swimming and he got back into the boat but she didn't, according to a sheriff's office statement.

The boy was wearing a life vest, and another life jacket was found in the boat along with Rivera's purse and identification.

Rivera is believed to have drowned “in what appears to be a tragic accident,” the statement said.

The boy, Rivera's son from her marriage to actor Ryan Dorsey, was safe and healthy and with family members, authorities said. The couple finalized their divorce in June 2018 after nearly four years of marriage.

The most recent tweet on Rivera's account, from July 7, read “just the two of us” along with a photo of her and her son.

303,ctvnews,http://ctvnews.ca/world/jewishprivilege-hashtag-trends-on-twitter-as-users-fight-back-against-anti-semitism-1.5022216,'JewishPrivilege' hashtag trends on Twitter as users fight back against anti-Semitism,[],2020-07-13 14:17:00-04:00,"TORONTO -- The anti-Semitic hashtag 'JewishPrivilege' was trending on Twitter Monday after Jewish people took it over to share their experiences of discrimination, with one expert saying such hatred is still 'alive and well' in Canada today.

According to Jewish News, the trend first started Sunday night when Israeli writer and activist Hen Mazzig shared his family's experience with anti-Semitism after others used the hashtag to accuse Jewish people of being ""privileged.""

""#JewishPrivilege is when my grandparents were violently forced out of Iraq and Tunisia for being Jewish with only the clothes to their back. Along with 850,000 other MENA [Middle East and North Africa] Jews they arrived to Israel with nothing, only spoke Arabic, and lived in a tent/tin shack for years,"" Mazzig tweeted.

""I want all my Jewish followers to share the 'Jewish Privilege' them and their families experienced.""

Noah Shack, vice president of the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs (CIJA), told CTVNews.ca that #JewishPrivilege has, for years, existed as an anti-Semitic hashtag used primarily by conspiracy theorists.

""A lot of these tropes are well known about Jews controlling media and government, and the economy and unfortunately, a lot of these conspiracy theories have ended in the past with violence,"" Shack told CTVNews.ca in a phone interview on Monday.

""We're seeing a lot of traction on the hashtag now because Jewish people have sort of taken it over to discuss those experiences of persecution that have come about as a result of anti-Semitism, not just as something in the past but of course something that's very much alive and well today.""

After Mazzig's tweet, many others joined in on the conversation including stand-up comedian Sarah Silverman who said she experienced other children ""throwing pennies at me on the bus"" and had ""pastors in Florida calling for my death and telling their congregation that knocking my teeth out and killing me would be God’s work.""

Comedian David Baddiel tweeted that ""Jews don't always feel white, if by white you mean, to put it bluntly, safe."" Baddiel explained that he was just 12-years-old when he overheard a new teacher call him a 'Jew' and others agreed. He added that ""this is without getting into most of my mum’s family being murdered.""

Dov Hikind, founder of the campaigning organization Americans Against Antisemitism, also used the hashtag to tweet: ""I had the #JewishPrivilege of growing up without grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins because my parents’ friends were nearly entirely wiped out by Hitler.""

The hashtag has been used more than 100,000 times on Twitter as of Monday afternoon, trending in the U.S., Israel, the U.K. and Canada.

Shack said anti-Semitism is ""not just a relic of the past"" and that countries such as Canada, the U.S. and the U.K. are seeing a rise in discrimination against Jewish people.

""I am enjoying a life in Canada today, because a couple of generations ago somebody had the good fortune to be able to flee murderous persecution,"" Shack explained. ""Despite the fact that we live in such a wonderful open diverse and vibrant democracy here in Canada, I can't help but worry whether or not my children will be the next generation that's forced to flee.""

While Jewish people are using the hashtag to bring awareness to discrimination, a number of organizations expressed concerns online that hashtag is drawing attention to those tweeting anti-Semitic comments.

Danny Stone, the CEO of the Antisemitism Policy Trust, tweeted ""That #JewishPrivilege is trending makes me feel sick. It may not be a hate term but Twitter should know what this does to communities.""

The Campaign Against Antisemitism (CAAS) also criticized Twitter for not taking action to curb anti-Semitism on the platform, claiming that the social media site has a ""long record of enabling racism against Jews.""

""The idea that Jews are a 'privileged' group is a slur designed to deny that antisemitism exists and to imply that Jews are a cause of racism towards other minorities,"" the CAAS tweeted.

However, Shack said the attention the hashtag is getting is a ""good thing"" as it will amplify Jewish voices and ""drown out those of the anti-Semites.""

This marks the second extension of the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS). On May 15, the government added an additional 12 weeks to the program, extending eligibility to August 29.

""For the last three months, you’ve seen me come out to talk with Canadians about what we’re doing to help you and your family, your employer, your local businesses deal with this pandemic. We’re going to continue to do that vital work,"" said Trudeau during a press briefing outside Rideau Cottage in Ottawa.

Announced on March 27, the CEWS provides qualifying businesses and non-profits funding for 75 per cent of employee wages, retroactive from March 15.

The objective of the program is to keep employees on the payroll so businesses can rebound more quickly when restrictions are lifted and the economy restarts. The CEWS had a slow uptake, but has increased in popularity as more Canadians transition off of the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.

In an interview on CTV’s Question Period in May, Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough attributed the program’s rocky start to barriers in the application process.

""It’s been slower than expected. I think businesses are having to put a lot of time and effort into their applications because you have to dig into your payroll – who earned what and when,"" she said.

Since then, the government has been consulting with the business community and promoting its benefit amid calls from opposition that the Liberal’s are disincentivizing Canadians from returning to work as CERB application numbers balloon.

As of July 5, just under 19 million Canadians had applied for the benefit and more than $54 billion had been paid out.

The new $82. 3 billion CEWS projection, outlined in last Wednesday’s fiscal snapshot, is a stark increase from the original $45 billion estimate.

As of July 6, 581,800 out of a total of 587, 060 submissions had been approved. This equates to slightly more than $18 billion.",[]
305,ctvnews,http://ctvnews.ca/health/fatty-liver-disease-a-growing-public-health-concern-in-canada-study-1.5022155,Fatty liver disease a growing public health concern in Canada: study,['Lauren Krugel'],2020-07-13 13:23:00-04:00,"CALGARY -- Doctors are warning that soaring rates of a common, but often undetected, liver disease could impose an enormous burden on Canadian health care over the next decade if there isn't more public awareness.

""There's a reason why they call liver disease the silent killer,"" said Dr. Mark Swain, a University of Calgary liver specialist who led a study published recently in the online journal CMAJ Open.

""It's because liver disease broadly has no symptoms.""

Liver cells are like balloons that can fill with fat over time, especially when someone is obese, he said.

The paper notes an estimated one-quarter of Canadians over the age of 20 have this condition, called nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD.

Swain, who directs the university's gastroenterology and hepatology division, said physicians have historically treated it as relatively benign because liver fat usually just sits there and doesn't do much.

But about three to five per cent of those with the disease go on to develop a more problematic condition called nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH. In those cases, Swain said, an immune response can trigger inflammation, which can lead to scarring or even cancer.

Swain and other researchers with the The Canadian NASH Network, a coalition of doctors focused on the disease, used trends in obesity rates to forecast the prevalence of fatty liver disease in the Canadian population between 2019 and 2030.

The study found cases of NAFLD are on track to rise 20 per cent in that time frame and that its more advanced form, NASH, is projected to rise by 35 per cent.

Cases of liver failure, liver cancer and the need for transplants are expected to rise by a total of 65 per cent to 579,000 by 2030.

Deaths are expected to double to 49,100 in that time.

""There has been a conditioning amongst many health-care professionals that it's not of concern,"" said Swain.

""We really need to be better at increasing awareness, both in the population and amongst health-care professionals and allied health-care workers, that this is an issue.""

A dollar figure for the cost-burden on the health-care system has not been calculated in Canada, but Swain expects it would be ""astronomical.""

Dr. Diana Mager, an associate professor of clinical nutrition at the University of Alberta, said patients are often surprised to find out that they even have fatty liver disease. Symptoms, like a sore abdomen, don't show up until it's well advanced, she said.

""People walk around for years with NAFLD and don't know they have it.""

The biggest culprits seem to be processed foods and sugary drinks, she said. Mager, who specializes in pediatric patients, said fatty liver disease has been showing up in children and adolescents.

A more wholesome diet and more active lifestyle can reverse the disease in its early stages, she said.

There's some debate as to whether the same holds for when the disease is more advanced. But, at the very least, lifestyle changes can slow its progression, said Mager, who also chairs the Canadian Liver Foundation's national education advisory committee.

Simply telling people to go on a diet and lose weight isn't enough, she said.

""It's one thing to tell the Canadian public, 'Don't eat this and don't eat that.'

""But if there isn't an availability of affordable healthy foods, then that's a problem. You can't expect a family, if they can't afford to purchase those foods, to be able to consume those foods on a regular basis.""

306,ctvnews,http://ctvnews.ca/sports/washington-nfl-team-dropping-redskins-name-long-denounced-as-slur-after-87-years-1.5021524,"Washington NFL team dropping 'Redskins' name, long denounced as slur, after 87 years",['Stephen Whyno'],2020-07-13 01:10:00-04:00,"WASHINGTON -- The Washington NFL franchise announced Monday it is dropping the “Redskins” name and Indian head logo, bowing to recent pressure from sponsors and decades of criticism that they are offensive to Native Americans.

A new name must still be selected for one of the oldest and most storied teams in the National Football League, and it was unclear how soon that will happen. But for now, arguably the most polarizing name in North American professional sports is gone at a time of reckoning over racial injustice, iconography and racism in the U.S.

The move came less than two weeks after owner Dan Snyder, a boyhood fan of the team who once declared he would never get rid of the name, launched a “thorough review” amid pressure from sponsors. FedEx, Nike, Pepsi and Bank of America all lined up against the name, which was given to the franchise in 1933 when the team was still based in Boston.

“The NFL and Dan Snyder, we have to commend them on making the right call to change the name,” said Oneida Indian Nation Representative Ray Halbritter, leader of the “Change the Mascot” campaign. “Dan Snyder won today because now he has a legacy that will be different from the racial slur that was the team name. I know that's not an easy thing to do, but it was the right thing to do.”

The team said it is “retiring” the name and logo and that Snyder and coach Ron Rivera are working closely to develop a new moniker and design. The announcement came on the old letterhead with the Redskins name because the team technically retains it until a new one is chosen and approved.

Native American advocates and experts have long criticized the name they call a “dictionary-defined racial slur.” Over a dozen Native leaders and organizations wrote to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell last week demanding an immediate end to Washington's use of the name. Goodell, who has fielded questions on the topic for years, said he supported the review.

Protests against the name predate Snyder buying the team in 1999, and, until now, he had shown no willingness to consider a change. Strong words from sponsors - including a company run by a minority stakeholder of the team - changed the equation.

FedEx earlier this month became the first sponsor to announce it had asked the organization to change the name, particularly important because CEO Frederick Smith owns part of the team. FedEx paid $205 million for the long-term naming rights to the team's stadium in Landover, Maryland.

The lease at FedEx Field expires in 2027, and dropping the name keeps open various possibilities in Maryland, Virginia and Washington for the team's new stadium and headquarters. District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser has said the name was an “obstacle” to Snyder building on the old RFK Stadium site, which is believed to be his preference.

The team recently started cutting ties with racist founder George Preston Marshall, removing his name from the Ring of Fame and renaming the lower bowl at FedEx Field for the team's first Black player, late Hall of Famer Bobby Mitchell. Marshall, who renamed the Boston Braves the Redskins in 1933 and moved the team to D.C. four years later, was a segregationist and the last NFL owner to integrate his team. The current logo shows the profile of a red-faced Native American with feathers in his hair.

Major League Baseball's Atlanta Braves and the National Hockey League's Chicago Blackhawks have said they have no inclination to change their names. Some advocates would like to see all Native American names, mascots and imagery out of sports.

“Our fight continues,” Crystal Echo Hawk of the Native American advocacy group IllumiNative said in a statement. “We will not rest until the offensive use of Native imagery, logos and names are eradicated from professional, collegiate and (other school) sports. The time is now to stand in solidarity and declare that racism will not be tolerated.”

Halbritter said it was important to note those other names are not a slur, but he hopes a “broader discussion” can be had. He pointed out that Florida State spoke with the Seminole tribe about its name, the same thing a minor league baseball team in Spokane, Washington, did with local Native Americans.

It was not immediately clear if the organization is consulting Native Americans on a new name or if any imagery will even be used.

“I think it's striking that the NFL and other owners of other sports teams don't have a conversation with Native America on these names,” Halbritter said. “It's about respect, and I don't understand why they just don't have a conversation with the affected people.”

Long removed from the glory days of winning Super Bowl titles in the 1982, 1987 and 1991 seasons under coach Joe Gibbs, Washington's NFL team has just five playoff appearances in 21 years and no postseason victories since 2005. The team has lacked a nationally marketable player since Robert Griffin III's short-lived stardom, and the 2020 schedule features zero prime-time games for a franchise that used to be a draw.

Re-branding with a new name and logo - and perhaps the same burgundy and gold colours - coupled with turning football operations over to Rivera could be a boon for Snyder on and off the field. Even if a segment of the fan base opposes the change in the name of tradition, winning would more than make up for those losses.",[]

She was 57.

Travolta said in an Instagram post that his wife of 28 years died after a two-year battle with breast cancer.

""It is with a very heavy heart that I inform you that my beautiful wife Kelly has lost her two-year battle with breast cancer,"" Travolta said. ""She fought a courageous fight with the love and support of so many.""

The couple had three children together.

""Shocked by this sad news,"" Maria Shriver said on Twitter. ""Kelly was such a bright loving soul, a talented actress, and a loving mom and wife. My heart breaks for her family who have already known such sadness and grief.""

Born Kelly Kamalelehua Smith on Oct. 13, 1962, in Honolulu, Hawaii, Preston had a lengthy acting career in movies and television beginning in the 1980s, including the 1985 teen comedy ""Mischief,"" 1986's ""Space Camp"" and her breakthrough, 1988's ""Twins."" Preston played Marnie, the woman who marries Schwarzenegger's character.

Preston was first married to actor Kevin Gage. They divorced in 1987.

The year after, Preston met Travolta while shooting the 1989 film ""The Experts,"" a box-office flop about a Soviet KGB agent who hires hip New Yorkers to update the spy program's understanding of American society. They meet on the dance floor after Travolta asks, ""Does anyone here know how to dance."" Preston responds: ""I know how to dance.""

They were married in 1991 at a midnight ceremony in Paris while expecting their first son, Jett.

Preston starred opposite Kevin Costner in the 1999 film ""For the Love of the Game."" In 2003, she starred in ""What a Girl Wants"" and as the mom in the live-action adaptation of ""The Cat in the Hat."" The following year she appeared in the music video for Maroon 5's ""She Will Be Loved.""

Preston gave one of her most well-received performances in ""Jerry Maguire"" as the ex-fiancee of Cruise's sports agent who dumps him early in the movie. The Daily News called her ""icily effective.""

On Monday, Russell Crowe recalled knowing Preston in the '90s. He said he hadn't seen her much since, ""but when I did, she was always the same sparkly eyed gem.""

Preston occasionally appeared in films with her husband, though the results were seldom among either's best work. Among them: the box-office bomb ""Battlefield Earth"" in 2000 and the 2009 Disney comedy ""Old Dogs,"" also with their daughter, Ella Bleu.

In January 2009, Jett Travolta, 16, died after a seizure at the family's vacation home in the Bahamas. The death touched off a court case after an ambulance driver and his attorney were accused of trying to extort $25 million from the actors in exchange for not releasing sensitive information about their son's death.

Travolta testified during a criminal trial that ended in a mistrial and was prepared to testify a second time, but decided to stop pursuing the case and it was dismissed. He cited the severe strain the proceedings and his son's death had caused the family.

Both Preston and Travolta returned to acting, with Preston's first role back in the Nicholas Sparks adaptation, ""The Last Song,"" which starred Miley Cyrus and her future husband, Liam Hemsworth.

In addition to Jett and Ella Bleu, who was born in 2000, the couple had son Benjamin in 2010. Ella wrote on Instagram Sunday: ""I have never met anyone as courageous, strong, beautiful and loving as you. Anyone who is lucky enough to have known you or to have ever been in your presence will agree that you have a glow and a light that never ceases to shine and that makes anyone around you feel instantly happy.""

The couple last starred together in the 2018 film ""Gotti,"" with Travolta playing John Gotti and Preston playing the crime boss's wife, Victoria.

""Kelly's love and life will always be remembered,"" Travolta said on Instagram. ""I will be taking some time to be there for my children who have lost their mother, so forgive me in advance if you don't hear from us for a while. But please know that I will feel your outpouring of love in the weeks and months ahead as we heal.""

308,ctvnews,http://ctvnews.ca/politics/deputy-conservative-leader-steps-down-from-post-endorses-mackay-1.5021787,"Deputy Conservative leader steps down from post, endorses MacKay",[],2020-07-13 10:25:00-04:00,"OTTAWA -- The Conservative Party’s outgoing deputy leader has put her support behind leadership candidate Peter MacKay, just hours after announcing her resignation from the position.

Leona Alleslev made the announcement on Twitter on Monday morning, as the party's four leadership candidates look to shore up last-minute support before the August 21 deadline for mail-in ballots.

""Canada faces an uncertain future. Canada needs a leader who has the experience and a plan to tackle the priorities of our time. That is why Peter MacKay has my support,"" reads the tweet.

On Sunday evening, Alleslev made her decision to step down as deputy party leader public, citing a need to engage in the final weeks of the campaign.

""The selection of the next leader of the Conservative Party of Canada is too important a decision for me to stand to the side. Today, I am stepping down as Deputy Leader of her Majesty’s Loyal Opposition to engage more actively in the leadership campaign,"" the tweet reads.

Alleslev was appointed deputy leader by Andrew Scheer in November, 2019, about a year after causing a stir in the House of Commons when she crossed the floor, swapping her Liberal badge for a Tory one.

""I stand here today deeply concerned for the future of our country. After three years of hope and hard work, I find myself asking: Am I doing everything I can to serve the citizens of Aurora—Oak Ridges—Richmond Hill and my country?,"" Alleslev said when delivering her announcement in the House in September, 2018.

""My attempts to raise my concerns with the government were met with silence. It is my duty to stand and be counted. Our country is at risk.""

The Ontario MP quickly adapted to her role under the opposition tent, grilling her former colleagues for their foreign affairs policy and most recently for their pandemic response.

She was steadfast in her loyalty to Scheer and defended his positioning on social conservative issues during the fall federal election campaign.

In an interview on CTV’s Question Period shortly after she became deputy leader, she questioned the allegiance of Scheer critics who railed against the leader for his campaign performance and shed doubt on his ability to lead following the party’s devastating loss.

""I think that there are certain obviously disgruntled people and I'm very disappointed in them, because if they really cared about the country and they really cared about the conservative movement, they would wait for the external review that we are investing in, to find out exactly where we can do better and what we did wrong,"" Alleslev said at the time.

In her resignation letter Sunday, she celebrated her party’s recent accomplishments and expressed her commitment to help build a strong Tory base.

""Together, our Conservative team has held the government to account and challenged them to address critical policy flaws that they had failed to consider or deliberately neglected,"" reads the letter.

""Canada faces an uncertain future. The Conservative Party of Canada is in the process of choosing a new leader that will guide us through the nation’s next chapter.""

Peter MacKay, Erin O’Toole, Leslyn Lewis and Derek Sloan are vying to replace Scheer from the party’s top post. MacKay, a former cabinet minister, and O’Toole, a sitting MP, are widely considered to be the front-runners.

Alleslev represents a part of the old riding that once belonged to MacKay’s former partner and Conservative turned Liberal MP Belinda Stronach.",[]

The London-based influencer's family confirmed the news on Sunday in an Instagram post, stating that Thea's unborn son had also died.

""To all Nicole's friends and supporters it is with great sadness that I have to inform you that Nicole and her son she and Boga named Reign sadly passed away on Saturday morning,"" the statement read.

The message explained that Thea had pre-scheduled ""a few YouTube videos"" to upload on her channel before her death, and her boyfriend, Boga, had ""made the decision to allow them to be aired.""

The family asked for privacy, saying ""our hearts are truly broken and we are struggling to cope with what has happened.""

The cause of Thea's death is not yet known. The former dancer was around eight months pregnant.

Thea announced her pregnancy back in April with an Instagram video showing off her baby bump while dancing beside Boga.

""We can't hide this any longer, secrets out... GOD gave us the biggest blessing yet. I'm finally creating a beautiful little human inside of me,"" the accompanying caption read. ""Can't believe this bubba will be half of me and half of the loml. Honestly, @global_boga has been the best support EVER and GOD made no mistakes making him the father.""

She added: ""We are already obsessed with you our little miracle baby. Thank you for choosing us to be your parents and best friends.""

Thea had amassed more than 80,000 subscribers on her YouTube channel, where she often discussed her pregnancy journey and posted content featuring boyfriend Global Boga -- real name Jeffery Frimpong -- who is a street dancer.

Her most recent video, titled ""GOT IN A BATH FULL OF MILK! *BTS PREGNANCY SHOOT,"" was uploaded on Sunday.

In the 14-minute footage, Thea can be seen getting ready for her milk bath, while talking her followers through the process. She also showcased special moments from her maternity photoshoot.

The moves to undercut Fauci come just days after he gave an unvarnished look at his relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump, including that they have not spoken in weeks.

The tension between the two men -- who are no longer speaking, CNN reported last week -- has grown publicly as they have responded to one another through interviews and statements. But recent moves by the White House to publicly diminish the nation's top infectious disease expert amounts to a significant escalation as it seeks to divert attention from the government's failure to contain the coronavirus and instead push Trump's call to reopen the country. That effort continued Monday morning, when the President retweeted a baseless claim by game show host Chuck Woolery that ""everyone is lying"" about the coronavirus -- including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

In a statement Saturday, a White House official told CNN that ""several White House officials are concerned about the number of times Dr. Fauci has been wrong on things."" The official went on to provide a lengthy list of examples, citing Fauci's comments early in the pandemic and linking to past interviews.

These bullet points, which resembled opposition research on a political opponent, included Fauci downplaying the virus early on and a quote from March when Fauci said, ""People should not be walking around with masks,"" among other comments. Not included were previous statements from the surgeon general urging people not to buy masks or an acknowledgment of the President's own false claims and misstatements about the virus.

Fauci did not return a request for comment by CNN. But in a recent series of newspaper and radio interviews, Fauci, who has worked under six U.S. presidents from both parties, has at times openly disagreed with Trump.

In particular, a recent interview with the Financial Times in which Fauci disclosed that he has not briefed the President in weeks prompted the White House to distribute the list of Fauci statements, an aide familiar with the matter said. Among other things, Fauci disputed Trump's claim that ""99%"" of coronavirus cases in the United States were ""totally harmless"" -- saying that was ""obviously not the case"" -- and drew a connection between his insistence on ""speaking the truth at all times"" to his noticeably diminished television appearances.

A person familiar with the situation acknowledged that Fauci has been appearing on television less frequently because Trump is annoyed by his public statements. Though Trump was already miffed by Fauci's television appearances early on, the White House has sought to downplay tension between the two for several months. The press shop stopped approving Fauci's television appearances, believing it would help alleviate the situation, though they continued to allow him to give interviews with print outlets.

Another person familiar has said the rare in-person meetings between Trump and Fauci are not awkward and don't involve raised voices, but Trump has complained about Fauci privately. Sources say part of that irritation is over the ""good press"" Fauci has received. Trump's irritation with Fauci has also, at times, been encouraged by Peter Navarro, Trump's trade adviser who has repeatedly blamed Fauci for doubting the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine.

Navarro once told Fauci he would be personally responsible if it was later shown that hydroxychloroquine worked to treat coronavirus, despite multiple studies questioning its use.

One senior administration official told CNN that some officials within the White House do not trust Fauci. According to the source, those officials think Fauci doesn't have the best interest of the President, pointing to some of Fauci's interviews. Other administration officials have told CNN that while they have disagreements with Fauci's methods, they don't doubt his motives, and that his only concern was public health.

In an interview on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" Sunday, Adm. Brett Giroir, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, said there is ""open discourse"" within the team.

""I respect Dr. Fauci a lot, but Dr. Fauci is not 100% right and he also doesn't necessarily -- and he admits that -- have the whole national interest in mind. He looks at it from a very narrow public health point of view,"" Giroir said.

Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs at Health and Human Services Michael Caputo said Sunday there was no White House-versus-the scientists narrative.

""We have great faith in the capacity of all of our scientists and doctors on the coronavirus taskforce to impart necessary public health information. People like Admiral (Brett) Giroir, Surgeon General (Jerome) Adams and others are carrying these messages very effectively,"" Caputo said in the statement, although he did not directly answer questions about Fauci.

Fauci is scheduled to be in the West Wing Monday for meetings.

TRUMP PUBLICLY CRITICIZES FAUCI

Trump -- who in April retweeted a message calling for Fauci to be fired, though he later downplayed the significance of the message when asked -- has recently intensified his public criticism of Fauci in recent weeks.

""Dr. Fauci is a nice man, but he's made a lot of mistakes,"" Trump said last week, undermining the public health expert whom Americans say in polls they trust more than the President.

In recent interviews, he openly questioned the advice he'd received from Fauci at the start of the outbreak.

""I think we are in a good place. I disagree with him,"" Trump said in an interview Tuesday when questioned about Fauci's assertion the U.S. is still ""knee-deep in the first wave"" of the pandemic.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, said Sunday evening that any effort by the White House to sideline or discredit Fauci is ""just atrocious.""

Schiff told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on ""The Situation Room"" that such a move ""is so characteristic of Donald Trump. He can't stand the fact that the American people trust Dr. Fauci and they don't trust Donald Trump -- and so he has to tear him down.""

""We need people more than ever to speak truth to power, to be able to level with the American people about what we're facing with this pandemic, how to get it under control, how to protect ourselves and our families,"" Schiff continued. ""That's what Dr. Fauci has been trying to do and by sidelining him the President is once again interfering with an effective response to this pandemic.""

Kathleen Sebelius, who served as secretary of Health and Human Services under former President Barack Obama, told CNN efforts to discredit Fauci and other scientists are ""potentially very, very dangerous"" as the US and other countries work toward a coronavirus vaccine.

""I think people want to know from the scientists that the vaccine is safe, that it is effective, that it will not do more harm than good,"" she told Blitzer on ""The Situation Room.""

""And if the public scientists have been discredited, if the President says 'don't believe them, you can't listen to them, they're often wrong,' we have then undermined a national vaccination campaign which is an essential step to bringing this horrible period to an end.""

313,ctvnews,http://ctvnews.ca/world/prosecutors-epstein-victim-to-speak-at-ghislaine-maxwell-s-hearing-1.5022200,Prosecutors: Epstein victim to speak at Ghislaine Maxwell's hearing,['Larry Neumeister'],2020-07-13 13:54:00-04:00,"NEW YORK -- One or more victims of Jeffrey Epstein plan to tell a judge Tuesday that his ex-girlfriend should be denied bail on charges that she recruited teenage girls for him to sexually abuse in the 1990s, prosecutors said Monday.

Prosecutors made the revelation in court papers as they argued there is no reason to free Ghislaine Maxwell on bail.

The 58-year-old British socialite has been held without bail since her recent arrest at a $1 million New Hampshire estate she bought late last year.

Prosecutors told a Manhattan federal judge in written arguments that at least one woman and possibly more were expected to exercise their right to appear at Tuesday's hearing and ask that Maxwell be detained until trial.

“The Government is deeply concerned that if the defendant is bailed, the victims will be denied justice in this case,” prosecutors wrote.

The filing came a day before an arraignment and bail hearing for Maxwell, who has been held for the last week at a federal jail in Brooklyn.

On Friday, her lawyers filed arguments that said she's being made a scapegoat after Epstein killed himself in a Manhattan lockup last August. They said she should be freed on $5 million bail with electronic monitoring.

“Ghislaine Maxwell,” they wrote, “is not Jeffrey Epstein.”

They said their client denies any allegations of misconduct, has had no contact with Epstein for more than a decade and has never been charged with a crime or found liable in civil litigation stemming from the allegations against Epstein.

Prosecutors noted that Maxwell's defence lawyers proposed offering as collateral property their client owns in the United Kingdom, but they said that was beyond the reach of U.S. authorities.

Epstein was arrested in July 2019 and was awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges of women and girls in Florida and New York in the early 2000s when he died by suicide in custody.",[]

""We're targeting August, maybe early September,"" he said in a recent interview.

""I was even shocked when (the doctor) told me. I met him last week and I asked him for a ballpark time frame. And he said August, and I said 'Oh, OK.' I wasn't quite ready for that.""

Thompson moved to Ontario from British Columbia in April to prepare for the surgery in London. It involves medical and psychological tests, as well as finding a donor.

If things go as planned, Thompson will be Canada's first double-hand transplant patient.

Thompson had all of his limbs amputated after contracting bacterial meningitis and septic shock in 2015.

He left work early one day in May, after feeling like he was coming down with the flu, and decided to sleep it off. A few hours later, he woke up to get a drink of water.

""But when I stood up my feet were like on fire. I could barely walk. I made it downstairs to where my wife Rita was watching TV. And that's pretty well the last thing I remember. I just collapsed on the floor.""

He woke up six weeks later in intensive care, confronted with the choice of dying in palliative care or amputation.

""If I wanted to survive, I would need all four limbs amputated,"" he said.

""In the end, the will to live is stronger than anything else.""

After 8 1/2 hours of surgery, doctors had amputated his limbs.

""That was a difficult time, obviously, because you know, you wake up as a different person. You look down and all you see is bandages ... where your hands used to be or where your legs and feet used to be,"" he said.

""The first thing that came to my mind was, what did I just do?""

After learning about hand transplants two years ago, Thompson met with a team of doctors in Ontario to assess whether he would make a suitable candidate.

""It's life changing,"" he said.

""Being able to shake someone's hand, being able to pick up a cup of coffee with one hand, write your name with a pen, open a door, you know, just the things that we take for granted every day.""

Dr. Steven McCabe, who performed Canada's first hand transplant, may participate in the surgery. He is a hand surgeon at Toronto Western Hospital and an associate professor at the University of Toronto.

The surgery can take 10 to 12 hours with four teams of surgeons. Each team consists of six to 10 people.

While operating on both hands makes the surgery logistically harder because it involves more people, McCabe said it is ""logical"" to do the two transplants at the same time.

""When you transplant, you're introducing this different tissue,"" he explained. ""And the theory behind that is that you don't want to introduce two different donor tissues.""

A person who undergoes a transplant has to take immunosuppressants, so the body doesn't reject the new organ or limb, and it's easier when surgery is done all at once, he said.

""So if you transplanted one limb, and then three months or a year later, the other one, you'd have to go through that again. The idea is to get that all over with one donor.""

But there's also another reason.

""Having one hand when you have none is a huge benefit,"" McCabe said.

""But if you're going to have that type of surgery, and it seems logical to transplant both hands, part of the sense of wholeness is restored. It seems to be very important for patients.""

There are risks associated with the surgery, including infections and the possibility of blood loss. But McCabe said the benefits outweigh the risks, and limb transplants have low rejection rates.

After the surgery, transplant patients face a long recovery, he added.

""If you transplant the limb near the elbow, it will take a few months for the muscles to start to work again, and maybe up to a year or more for the nerves to get down to the fingers to have some feeling,"" McCabe said. ""So, I think we would say, you can't judge whether it's really helped or not for at least a couple years.""

Thompson said unlike most organ transplants, a hand transplant is visible.

""It's physically there. So getting over the mental challenge is going to be the hardest one, because you know they belonged to someone else at one point and now they're on your body,"" Thompson said.

""You have to look at it as a gift ... (the donor) family has decided to give you this gift. And it's a gift I'm not going to waste.""

The liftoff of the UAE's Mars orbiter named Amal, or Hope, on a Japanese H-IIA rocket is scheduled for early Wednesday from the Tanegashima Space Center in southern Japan, in what would be the Arab world's first interplanetary mission.

A final decision will be made Tuesday before the roll out of the rocket, said Keiji Suzuki, launch site director for Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.

A seasonal rain front was expected to cause intermittent lightning and rain over the next few days, he said.

""But this thunder is not expected to be severe or lasting, and our assessment is that there will be a chance for a launch,"" Suzuki told an online briefing Monday from Tanegashima. ""We will make a careful decision based on data.""

Heavy rain has continued for more than a week in large areas of Japan, triggering mudslides and floods and killing more than 70 people, most of them on the southern main island of Kyushu.

Hope is set to reach Mars in February 2021, the year the UAE celebrates 50 years since its formation. A successful Hope mission would be a major step for the oil-dependent economy seeking a future in space.

Hope carries three instruments to study the upper atmosphere and monitor climate change and is scheduled to circle the red planet for at least two years.

Emirates Mars Mission Project Director Omran Sharaf, who joined Monday's briefing from Dubai, said the mission is not just a repeat of what other countries have done. It will provide a complete view of the Martian atmosphere during different seasons for the first time, he said.

Two other Mars missions are planned in coming days by the U.S. and China. Japan has its own Martian moon mission planned in 2024.",[]

Locals said waves of waste -- mostly plastic bottles, fishing nets and buoys -- floated ashore late Saturday. They spotted turtle carcasses among the sand dunes early Sunday.

Bangladesh's forestry department said it was the first time such a large volume of plastic had washed onto the 120-kilometre beach along the Bay of Bengal.

""Hundreds of locals rushed to the beach since early morning to rescue the wounded turtles,"" forestry spokesman Sohail Hossain told AFP.

""We have buried the dead ones and are trying to release the rescued turtles back to sea.""

Beach clean-up charity Plastic Bank Bangladesh said their volunteers found and buried at least 20 Olive Ridley turtles among the estimated 50 tonnes of waste spread out over a 10 kilometre stretch of the beach at Cox's Bazar.

""I haven't seen these many dead turtles lying on the beach in my life and also haven't seen such a massive pile of waste floating ashore,"" fisherman Jashim Uddin told AFP.

Leading Bangladesh turtle and tortoise expert Shahriar Caesar Rahman of the NGO Creative Conservation Alliance said most of the turtles were at least 30 years old.

""The turtles often get trapped in gigantic waste patches floating in the sea and eventually die of suffocation. This seems to be a similar case,"" he told AFP.

About 26 tonnes of waste produced from ships and neighbouring countries float into Bay of Bengal every year, said Moazzem Hossain of local conservation charity Save the Nature Bangladesh.

""This is a unique case of plastic invasion. It sends a great danger signal to our marine biodiversity,"" he said.

It was not clear how many turtles were rescued.

Local district administrator Kamal Hossain said authorities were investigating the incident.

Olive Ridleys are the most abundant of all sea turtles around the world, according to conservationists.

But their numbers have been declining and the species is recognised as vulnerable by the IUCN Red list.",[]

The case, brought by Amnesty International in January, called on the court to prevent NSO from selling its technology abroad, especially to repressive regimes.

The Tel Aviv District Court ruled that Amnesty's attorneys did not provide sufficient evidence ""to prove the claim that an attempt was made to track a human rights activist by trying to hack his cellphone"" or that the hacking was done by NSO.

""Granting a license is done after the most rigorous process and also after granting the permit, the authority conducts oversight and close inspection, as necessary,"" the court said. If human rights are found to be violated, that permit can be suspended or cancelled, it added.

The court issued its ruling on Sunday, but only made it public on Monday.

Gil Naveh, spokesman for Amnesty International Israel, said the group was disappointed but not surprised.

""It's been a longstanding tradition for the Israeli courts to be a rubber stamp for the Israeli Ministry of Defence,"" he said.

The group doesn't know what evidence NSO or the Defence Ministry gave to the court, because the hearings were closed. ""Even if we knew, we were not able to talk about it,"" he said.

In 2018, Amnesty claimed one of its employees was targeted by NSO's malware, saying a hacker tried to break into the staffer's smartphone, using a WhatsApp message about a protest in front of the Saudi Embassy in Washington as bait.

NSO, an Israeli hacker-for-hire company, uses its Pegasus spyware to take control of a phone, its cameras and microphones, and mine the user's personal data.

The company has been accused of selling its surveillance software to repressive governments that use it against dissidents. It doesn't disclose clients, but they are believed to include Middle Eastern and Latin American states. The company says it sells its technology to Israeli-approved governments to help them combat criminals and terrorism.

NSO Group said in a statement that the company ""will continue to work to provide technology to states and intelligence organizations,"" adding that its purpose is to ""save human lives.""

In a report published last month, Amnesty International said Moroccan journalist Omar Radi's phone was tapped using NSO's technology as part of the government's efforts to clamp down on dissent.

A Saudi dissident has accused NSO of involvement in Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi's killing in 2018.",[]

For many families the thought of discussing money can make them uneasy and is often a taboo subject. In fact, this conversation doesn't discriminate -- wealthy, poor, young or old no one likes to open themselves up and share their financial situation, especially if it is challenging.

Money is deeply personal and can influence our lives in so many ways.

Families are finding this out first-hand as the pandemic has hit the bottom line and parents are struggling. One or both parents may find themselves laid off permanently or temporarily and while the government aid can help pay the bills and keep a roof over their head today these same parents who may have in the past been able to afford to say ""yes"" to their children are now finding themselves having to say ""no"" financially. And that is ok.

There are going to be opportunities during this pandemic that are going to force us to change and this may be one of them.

Here are a few ideas that may help.

Begin a honest conversation with your children about how you are feeling and where you stand financially. They may not appreciate the numbers but I have found the more you respect their ability to grasp a situation the quicker they embrace it. Include your children in big purchases. I recall having a conversation with our children about a family vacation. With four teenagers in high school and one computer they responded,""we don't really need a vacation but we do need a second computer."" The vacation didn't happen. It is ok to say no to your children even if you can afford to say yes financially. To the extent you can replicate real life the better your children will be when they embark on their own journey. We clearly don't always get want we when we want all the time and neither should they. I know this sounds a little like tough love but it is a great lesson in living below your means that will stick with them. Encourage your children to set financial goals that excite them. They absolutely will not save money for something that excites you. I learned this first-hand when when our daughter got her first part-time job and I thought great you can tuck a little money away for university. Trust me that wasn't on her agenda. Also try to resist the temptation of telling them how to spend their money. It is their money. Yes they will make mistakes but that is ok it is all part of the process. Talk about the difference between investing in your children - helping to fund their education and bailing them out when they run up a credit card bill they can't afford to pay. I'm not suggesting you don't help them out. I would however, ensure they pay you back. Owning the problem can be a game changer. Our son received a notification from CRA highlighting a tax bill he wasn't expecting. He said to me, ""How did you let this happen?"" My response,"" I didn't get you into this situation - you did."" He paid the bill and has never been in that position again. These are difficult times and families are coming together. Just like your salary maybe a moratorium on allowances has to be put into place. That's ok. It can be a temporary situation. However, this doesn't mean everyone should still pitch in. It means maybe we all have to do a little more for less.

When children contribute something to the household regardless of your financial situation it can be a great accomplishment for them as well as you. Now more than ever we need to pull together.",[]

Most of Schumacher's wins were during a dominant spell with Ferrari, but his old team is struggling badly. For the second time in the past four races, Charles Leclerc and Sebastian Vettel crashed into each other and went out.

When Hamilton stood on the podium he raised a clenched right fist.

Hamilton's record-extending 89th career pole on a rain-drenched track was one of his best in extreme conditions, but during the race he was hardly challenged as he finished a sizeable 13.7 seconds ahead of Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas and 33.7 ahead of Red Bull's Max Verstappen.

Because of social distancing amid the coronavirus pandemic, the drivers on the podium had their trophies delivered by a remote controlled device.

""What a weird year but (it's) great to be back driving with this kind of performance. The team did a fantastic job, it was just for me to bring it home,"" said Hamilton, who finished fourth last week after a time penalty. ""Difficult weekend last weekend but this was a great step forward.""

Montreal's Lance Stroll of Racing Point was seventh, picking up six points. Toronto rookie Nicholas Latifi of Williams Mercedes was 17th.

Bottas won last weekend's season-opening Austrian GP on the same Red Bull Ring track in Spielberg at the foot of the Styrian mountains -- hence the name change.

Despite the sizeable margin of Hamilton's win, Bottas maintains he can challenge for the F1 title. He leads in points 43-37.

""I have no reason to doubt any of my ability or skills. I know what I'm capable of,"" the Finnish driver said. ""I really feel some improvements in my driving since last year that's why I'm confident it will be a good battle for the championship this year.""

Like last Sunday, drivers again wore black T-shirts with ""End Racism"" and most took the knee a few moments before the national anthem.

Red Bull driver Alexander Albon did well to fend off persistent attacks from Racing Point's Sergio Perez and finished fourth ahead of McLaren's Lando Norris and Perez, who dropped to sixth after touching wheels with Albon late on.

McLaren's Carlos Sainz Jr. started from third and finished ninth, but collected a bonus point for the fastest lap.

At the start of the race, Hamilton got away cleanly while Verstappen did well to hold off Sainz.

Leclerc tried to overtake down the right entering a hairpin bend and ended up riding over the back of Vettel's car, mangling his rear wing and prompting a safety car to come out for two laps.

Vettel, who finished 10th last week, had to retire while Leclerc came into the pits on Lap 5 and was soon out of the race.

At last season's penultimate GP in Brazil, both Ferrari cars crashed out. Vettel appeared at fault that time after being overtaken cleanly by Leclerc and trying to regain position.

But this time Leclerc was far too hasty and impatient.

Up ahead, Hamilton was coasting and about five seconds clear of Verstappen when the Dutch driver came in for his first tire change on Lap 25 of 71.

Hamilton came in for fresh tires soon after and then Bottas a few laps later, meaning that by Lap 38 Verstappen was second again -- still five seconds adrift of Hamilton.

Verstappen's front wing was damaged on the right side and, with six laps remaining, his lead over Bottas was down to under a second.

Bottas overtook Verstappen on the next lap but Verstappen regained his position superbly, only to concede it again moments later as Bottas' superior speed proved decisive.

""When Valtteri tried to pass me I tried to make it a bit more difficult,"" Verstappen said. ""The podium is good but there's still a lot of work to do.""

Red Bull showed signs late last season that it was closing the gap on Mercedes, but this time Verstappen is not convinced a serious challenge can be mounted.

""I tried everything I could but it's still not enough,"" Verstappen said. ""As a team we want to win and fight for the championship, and to do that we need to win races.""

Renault driver Esteban Ocon was the other driver not to finish, but teammate Daniel Ricciardo was eighth behind Stroll.

Chairman Carlos Ghosn says he is assisting those who helped him flee from Japan to Lebanon last year but refuses to provide details about the escape, saying such information would endanger them.

In an interview aired late Saturday by the pan-Arab Al-Arabiya TV, Ghosn refused to comment on allegations from prosecutors in the U.S., who said last week that he wired more than US$860,000 to a company linked to one of the men accused of helping smuggle him out of Japan in a box in December.

Michael Taylor, a 59-year-old former Green Beret and private security specialist, and Peter Taylor, 27, are wanted by Japan on charges they helped Ghosn escape the country in December after he was released on bail.

Ghosn was arrested in November 2018 and was expected to face trial in April 2020. He posted 1.5 billion yen ($14 million) bail on two separate instances after he was arrested a second time on additional charges, and released again.

When pressed to speak about the Taylors, who are under arrest in the U.S., as well as others who helped him flee, Ghosn refused to speak about any specific person. He said that after he arrived in Lebanon he vowed not to speak about how he left Japan ""because any statement I am going to make will endanger the people who helped me leave Japan.""

Asked if he is aiding those who helped him get out of Japan, Ghosn said, ""of course."" When asked about the Taylors, Ghosn said: ""You are talking about specific people, and I will not comment. However, I am helping everyone who stood by me as much as I can, financially and in any way I can.""

""I made the entire plan of how to get out, but I needed information and assistance. I am not ready to involve these people at this moment simply by talking about it,"" he said. He is believed to have been smuggled inside a large box.

Ghosn, who holds Lebanese, Brazilian and French citizenship, said the ""only side that stood by me is the Lebanese state. They intervened and they asked the Japanese state, `Why are you doing this to him?""'

Ghosn said that when he arrived in Lebanon, Japan requested the Lebanese government hand him over. ""Lebanon approved, if they receive the case file. They (Japanese) didn't send anything for six months,"" he said.

Earlier this month, a Turkish court released four pilots and a private airline official from jail, pending the outcome of their trial on charges of smuggling Ghosn out of Japan to Lebanon, via Turkey.",[]

""I can't say no to a good time,"" said Edmonton Oilers fan Jeet Jermana. ""I'd be hard-pressed not to jump into a big party.""

On Friday, the NHL board of governors and NHL Players' Association said they had ratified the return-to-play plan, paving the way for the league to resume its pandemic-hit season later this summer.

Toronto and Edmonton were also officially unveiled as hub cities where all games will be played, beginning Aug. 1. Training camps start Monday in the 24 cities with teams still in the running for the Stanley Cup, including six in Canada.

In 2017, when the Oilers nearly advanced to the Western Conference final, Jermana was among the thousands of fans who partied in Ford Hall at Rogers Place arena and in bars along the popular Whyte Avenue district.

But with COVID-19 this year, where teams will play in empty arenas, Jermana said he'll likely watch more games at home, maybe with just a few friends.

That is, he said, until the Oilers advance and he and other fans won't be able to resist going out.

""Once it becomes the 'real playoffs' I think more and more the momentum will grab,"" he said.

Matt Black of Hotel X Toronto, located west of the city centre where multiple media outlets have reported that several teams will be based, said the prospect of any accommodation for celebratory fan gatherings, even outdoors, seems unlikely.

Nevertheless, Black said he expects citywide excitement will be palpable, even with empty arenas.

""You look back to those scenes of Jurassic Park and Maple Leaf Square and all of that ... it would be great for people to be able to get together again but you just need to make sure that you're doing it in a safe manner,"" said Black.

The players themselves aren't to have any contact with the general public.

Dr. Vinita Dubey, Toronto's associate medical health officer, said in an emailed statement that players and staff arriving from abroad will also have to serve a modified 14-day quarantine as well as undergo rigorous screening and daily testing protocols, wear masks in indoor settings, physically distance and wash hands often.

An Edmonton police spokesperson said the service wouldn't be able to comment over the weekend on what sorts of preparations they might make for crowds when the season resumes.

Geoff Grimble with the City of Edmonton said the city's civic events management team would likely discuss the issue during a scheduled meeting on Monday.

""The City of Edmonton's first priority is public safety and we'll continue to follow the advice and requirements of the Chief Medical Officer of Health to ensure fans, players, coaches and staff remain healthy,"" Grimble said.

Oilers fan Brendan McLeod admitted he may be lured to a street celebration when -- not if -- his team advances, but said he still wants to maintain physical distancing.

""We have to get through this together or else it's not going to change,"" said McLeod.

But Shadi Merhej, who said he enjoys both hockey and the Oilers, noted the sport doesn't have quite as strong attraction for him in the summer.

""It's daylight 'til 11 o'clock. You don't want to spend half your day watching hockey,"" Merhej explained.

""I'd rather go for a bike ride, or rollerblade or golf.""

Described by Sotheby's as a ""lost masterpiece,"" the rare artifact made specifically for China's Qianlong Emperor in the early 1700s went under the hammer on Saturday, selling for 70 million Hong Kong dollars.

China's Qianlong Emperor ruled for more than 60 years and reportedly praised the vase as a ""masterwork.""

According to Sotheby's, the vase was rediscovered by Amsterdam-based art consultant Johan Bosch van Rosenthal in an elderly women’s home after she called him to inquire about assessing her collection.

In a video posted to the auction house's YouTube channel, Van Rosenthal said the dust-coated vase was in almost-pristine condition after nearly 60 years, despite being kept in a room surrounded by the owner’s cats and dogs.

""We reached a room with a number of Chinese works of art inherited many years ago. Her four cats walked around freely among these. She pointed out a ... partly gilded Chinese vase on a cupboard -- a cherished object which she knew to be something special and valuable,"" Van Rosenthal said.

Van Rosenthal said he is not an expert in Chinese art and sent pictures of the vase to Sotheby's experts who were able to match it to an item in the Chinese imperial archives belonging to the Qing dynasty.

According to the archive record, the vase was previously kept in the Palace of Heavenly Purity, part of Beijing's Forbidden City.

Van Rosenthal said the vase is ""highly unusual"" given its design in which a blue-and-white floral pattern is visible through the object's lattice shell, giving it a “double-walled"" appearance.

Sotheby’s said the vase is similar to only a handful of other designs attempted under China's imperial kiln supervisor Tang Ying in the years 1742 and 1743, describing the object as a ""technical tour-de-force."" The auction house said the pear-shaped vase is an example of ""yangcai"" style, also known as ""foreign colours,"" that saw artisans incorporate Western-style enamels into their porcelain work.

Sotheby's records showed that the artifact -- known as the Harry Garner Reticulated Vase for its original collector -- was sold through its London auction house in 1954 for $75 (£44). Records also showed that the vase was sold again later that year for $136 (£80).

""It is a miracle that this extraordinarily fragile vase survived half a century in a home surrounded by countless pets,"" Nicolas Chow, chairman of Sotheby's Asia, said in a press release prior to the sale.",[]

The funding will go towards 11 projects that will help local farmers respond to changing environmental conditions.

The B.C. government says that the nearly one-dozen projects were identified through the Vancouver Island Adaptation Strategies plan, which was developed by several focus groups that were comprised of 90 farmers, six Vancouver Island regional districts and multiple provincial and federal agencies.

Some of the challenges that the projects address include warmer and drier summer conditions, an increase in the variability of weather and food sustainability, an increase in precipitation and “extreme precipitation events” on the island and changes to local pests and insects.

“B.C. farmers are resilient by nature and experience challenges daily on their farms,” said Lana Popham, B.C. Minister of Agriculture, in a release Monday.

“We’re helping farmers plan and develop to respond to the challenges of a changing climate and how that affects their livelihood.”

The B.C. government says that a group of up to 20 representatives from the agricultural industry and regional and provincial governments will help develop the 11 priority projects.

The provincial government’s Agriculture and Food Climate Action Initiative will then handle the implementation of the projects.

“These strategies, specifically designed for farmers on Vancouver Island and the Southern Gulf Islands, will help them adapt so they can continue contributing to our economy and providing the fresh local food our communities depend on,” said Popham.

As of 2016, more than 7,500 people were employed in the agricultural industry on Vancouver Island.

Meanwhile, as of 2016, more than 50,000 hectares of land on Vancouver Island were considered active farmland.",[]

Construction of the new apartments is expected to begin in August at 4745 Ledgerwood Rd. The apartments will be located in two buildings, which are expected to open in the spring of 2022.

The rental homes are intended for middle-income residents who earn between $44,000 to $76,000 per household.

Monthly rents at the two buildings will range from $1,100 for a studio apartment to $1,900 for a three-bedroom unit.

“People deserve safe and secure homes, but even middle-income people like teachers and small business owners have struggled to find affordable housing in Nanaimo,” said Sheila Malcolmson, MLA for Nanaimo, in a release Sunday.

“These new homes will mean that more people – from young families to seniors – have access to affordable housing in their community, close to their friends, family and work.”

The B.C. government is providing up to $24.8 million to build the two new apartment towers.

Earlier this year, the B.C. government announced a new housing development in Nanaimo for people with mental health and substance abuse challenges.

The development, located at the corner of Rosehill Street and Terminal Avenue, will provide 23 units of affordable housing. Monthly rent at this development will range from $375 to $800 per month.",[]

So, what do some of the region’s top doctors have to say about wearing masks in the community?

Dr. Dee Hoyano – one of two medical health officers in the Island Health Authority’s Sooke, West Shore, Saanich Peninsula, Southern Gulf Island and Urban Greater Victoria region – recommends that masks be used when you are not able to maintain physical separation of two metres from other people.

Hoyano adds that masks may be required in some workplaces by WorksafeBC, and should be worn in enclosed spaces when near other people.

The main purpose of wearing a mask is to protect others from your droplets, preventing the spread of the virus.

Meanwhile, how you wear a mask can be just as important as wearing a mask at all, according to Hoyano.

“You want to make sure that it is covering both your nose and your mouth because the droplets can come out from both places,” she said.

“So just walking around with it just covering your chin or your mouth is not going to be as effective as if you were wearing it completely on your face”

There are several types of masks to choose from; disposable, cloth or medical grade. Hoyano recommends using either a cloth or disposable mask for everyday use so that there is enough medical grade masks for frontline workers.

“When you are choosing what kind of face covering to wear it is important to make sure it is comfortable and it’s positioned in a way that you’re not having to constantly readjust it or fiddle around with it,” said Hoyano.

Other tips from the medical health officer including applying hand sanitizer before putting on a mask, and after taking it off.

Disposable masks shouldn’t be reused and should be placed in the trash after one use.

Meanwhile, cloth or reusable masks should be placed in a large paper envelope after each use so they can dry. They should not be stored in plastic bags as this can trap moister and keep the mask damp.

Cloth masks should be also washed regularly. Hoyano recommends having multiple masks so you can change them throughout the day.

The medical health officer also recommends avoiding touching your eyes, face, or mask to avoid potential virus contamination.

Everyone should also be practicing regular handwashing and using hand sanitizer with an alcohol content of 60 per cent or higher.

Hayano also urges people to stay home if they feel at all unwell to keep everyone safe during the pandemic.

“We want people in that situation staying home, we don’t want them going out just wearing a mask. The best protection there is to stay home so you’re not in contact with anybody,” she said.

“The mask is not a substitution for staying home if you are feeling ill.”",[]

The incident happened around 1:45 a.m. Friday morning at the Nanaimo SCPA on Westwood Road.

The video shows a shirtless man wearing blue jeans with white shoes on, running up to the front door of the SPCA and tagging it with black spray paint. The vandal took less than 30 seconds and ran away from the building in the same direction.

“It wasn’t nice for the team to come into and see this morning. COVID-19 has been a struggle for everybody, us included,” said Leon Davis, branch manager of the Nanaimo SPCA on Friday.

“Fundraising hasn’t been easy, and we really don’t need to be redirecting funds to be cleaning up senseless graffiti off our building,” he said.

Theft from the shelter has happened before, but Davis says this is the first time it has been vandalized.

Local street artists with the Humanity In Art organization are big animal lovers and saw a Facebook post about the incident. On Friday afternoon, they came by the Nanaimo SPCA to help clean up the graffiti.

“We work with spray paint a lot and have the tools and products to try and deal with it,” said Lauren Semple with Humanity In Art.

First Nations discuss closing their borders to tourists,['Nick Wells'],2020-07-13 06:48:00-07:00,"VANCOUVER -- Indigenous bands along the west coast of British Columbia say their borders will remain closed to tourists and non-residents, despite the economic impact, as they work to raise awareness about the threat COVID-19 poses to their communities.

The Nuu-chah-nulth, the Heiltsuk Nation and the Haida Nation have all closed or restricted access to their territories and reserves.

“Of course it's negatively impacting. But our directors have said, our chiefs have said, people before economics,” said Judith Sayers, the president of the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council, in an interview. “I think everyone is slowly realizing the impact economically, but right now we just really feel that we want to protect the members first.”

Members of the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council, made up of 14 First Nations along the west coast of Vancouver Island, have deployed a variety of tactics to help ensure their borders are kept sealed from non-residents.

Members of the Ahousaht First Nation, who live in the remote area of Flores Island, have deputized citizens to act as peacekeeping officers, Sayers said.

The Ahousaht issued a notice on July 2 that their territory, which covers a large area of land and water north of Tofino, including provincial parks, will remain closed to tourists and non-residents as there “is still no vaccine, no anti-serum and no cure for COVID-19.”

Others, like the Tla-o-qui-aht in Tofino, had been stopping cars in an effort to convince them to turn around.

While Tofino is now welcoming back visitors, the Tla-o-qui-aht communities of Ty-Histanis, Esowista and Opitsaht remain closed to those who haven't been invited. The closure includes part of Long Beach in Pacific Rim National Park.

The concern, Sayers says, lies in the ability to test and contain any potential COVID-19 outbreak.

“A lot of our communities are remote and testing is not easily available,” she said. “If you're in Port Alberni, or Nanaimo, or Victoria, or somewhere (else), you can get testing and get results in 24 hours. It's not the same with our communities.”

The closures have resulted in disputes between Indigenous groups and local businesses.

The Haida Nation in Haida Gwaii have turned away non-residents at the ferry terminal, discouraged leisure travel and called on two local fishing lodges to rethink their reopening plans.

“We're such a close-knit community, I think that once we get a case of COVID, I think that it'll spread like wildfire,” said Duffy Edgars, the chief councillor of the Old Massett Village council in Haida Gwaii.

Edgars said many local fishing lodges are respecting the Haida Nation's state of emergency, but is frustrated by others who want to open up.

“It's disrespectful,” he said. “These bigger (lodges) are coming in and just doing whatever they want.”

The fishing lodges that have opened say visitors and staff will not have contact with the Haida Gwaii communities, and they have emergence evacuation plans in place if a COVID-19 case were to develop.

Leaders and representatives from the Nuu-chah-nulth, Heiltsuk and Haida all say they would like to see more co-operation from the provincial government in working with Indigenous communities.

“It's really frustrating,” said Marilyn Slett, the chief councillor of the Heiltsuk. “We have a limited amount of time here, we think, before that anticipated second or third wave so right now is the time for us to be sitting down and having those discussions so going forward we're all working collaboratively together.”

Part of the issue, she says, lies in B.C. politicians encouraging residents to take part in inter-provincial tourism.

“We're seeing a lot more vessel traffic on the coast, we're seeing a lot more recreational boaters, and that's a really high concern for our community,” said Slett.

The closures - many of which began in March - have been felt at a variety of levels.

The pandemic forced the cancellation of the Heiltsuk's Spawn-on-Kelp fishery this year, an event Slett says employs 700 people and is a hugely important economic driver for the community.

“Certainly our community put forward the health and safety before the economic driver,” she said. “So our community has been hit hard.”

Sayers says when the pandemic first broke out and restrictions were placed on communities, First Nations were bringing in food for members so they didn't have to leave their reserves and face possible exposure at grocery stores.

The Heiltsuk, Nuu-chah-Nulth and the Tsilhqot'in issued a statement in late June, criticizing the provincial government's reopening plan and what they saw as a lack of dialogue with First Nations groups.

All three want the province to commit to four conditions, which would allow border restrictions being lifted: COVID-19 information sharing, screening, rapid testing and culturally safe contact tracing teams.

Until those are met, Slett says, she can't see Indigenous communities fully opening their borders.

But the provincial government says it is committed to working with Indigenous communities.

“Many tourist-depending communities are now safely welcoming the gradual return of out-of-town visitors,” said Sarah Plank, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation.

“At the same time, we acknowledge some smaller and more remote communities and First Nations continue to be concerned about visitors to their communities.”

The government is also working on scheduling a meeting with the Nuu-chah-nulth, Tsilquot'in, Heiltsuk and Haida Nations and other communities, she added.

The most recent death occurred in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, bringing the province’s total number of COVID-19 deaths to 187.

“We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic,” said provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix in a joint statement Friday.

Meanwhile, Friday’s new cases brought the total number of coronavirus cases in B.C. to 3,053 since the pandemic began.

Health officials say that no new outbreaks have appeared in health-care facilities or in the community over the past 24 hours.

However, two outbreaks at long-term care facilities and one outbreak at an acute-care facility are ongoing.

The two long-term care facilities that are currently managing outbreaks are the Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, and the Maple Hill long-term care facility in the Fraser Health region.

Health officials added that while no active community breaks have been declared, “new cases and community exposure events continue to occur in the community.”

There are currently 187 active cases of COVID-19 in the province. Of those cases, 16 people are in hospital for treatment, five of whom require critical care.

As B.C. continues to ease restrictions as part of Phase 3 of its restart plan, health officials say that fundamental health practices should continue to be followed.

“When spending more time with friends and family, whether that is close to home or on vacation elsewhere in the province, we remind all British Columbians to avoid closed spaces, crowds and close contact with others,” said Henry and Dix.

Health officials are urging regular hand washing, the use of non-medical masks and physical distancing to help keep the curve of COVID-19 transmission flat.

Each of these health measures improve in effectiveness when used in combination with other safety steps, say Henry and Dix.

“We know that the more layers of protection we use, the safer we will be,” said the pair.

“Let’s all ‘layer up’ by washing our hands regularly, using barriers, staying a safe distance from others and using a mask when that is challenging.”

Most of B.C.’s COVID-19 cases have been located in the province’s Lower Mainland.

Since the pandemic began, there have been 990 cases found in the Vancouver Coastal Health region and 1,610 discovered in the Fraser Health region.

Elsewhere in the province, the Interior Health region has reported 202 cases and the Northern Health region has diagnosed 65.

Meanwhile, the Island Health region has reported 135 cases, an increase of two since Thursday.

As of Friday, a total of 2,679 people have recovered from COVID-19 in B.C.",[]

For the second time this week, a Victoria tattoo studio is announcing it has fired an employee due to claims of sexual assault.

Painted Lotus Studios released a statement on its social media platforms on Tuesday, July 7th, saying the company had terminated Corey Lyon and that it supports the work of Victim's Voices Canada, where a post was made claiming Lyon had sexually abused a client.

Artist Dave Hadden was also terminated this week from Carne Tattoo following allegations of sexual assault.

The post in question, made anonymously a day after Painted Lotus's post, says the artist was examining her for an under breast tattoo when he picked her up and put her on his table.

""That's when the little lightbulb in my head went on and I realized this was sexual. This was close to another particularly traumatizing sexual assault experience so I froze up and allowed everything else that happened to happen including aggressive oral sex.""

Lotus Tattoo said they were shocked by the allegations.

""We hope for everyone's sake that this was an isolated incident, but cannot in good conscience stand by Corey's actions. He is no longer employed at Painted Lotus. We are grateful for, and stand by the work that Victims Voices Canada does giving a platform for victims to be heard. This is an industry with a long history of toxic behaviour that has been swept under the rug. We want to support survivors and prevent abuse wherever possible.""

Another poster on Victims Voices Canada claims Lyon was also inappropriate with her.

""The incident with Corey Lyon is not an isolated one. I was tattooed by him a few years ago and the entire experience was uncomfortable for me. The tattoo I was getting was on the back of my arm so I was laying down while getting it done. Corey continuously ran his hands up and down my back and the backs of my thighs and at certain points would rest his hand on my butt. Throughout out the tattoo he kept calling me baby girl and sweetheart and repeatedly asked if I was single.""

In an email to CFAX 1070, the owner of Painted Lotus said they are focusing on the mental health of their clientele, studio and staff.

""The damage caused by abusers traumatizes their victims, and from this experience, we know it also goes beyond that. Our entire community is damaged, families torn apart, and the sacred professional trusts between artist and client have been broken. We hope that the current whistleblowing movement gives victims a voice and a chance to heal first and foremost. For those seeing these accounts from the outside, we hope it creates more opportunity for accountability and self-assessment in our industry. As tattooers, we can all do better to create a place of trust and safety. We are humbled by every human who allows us to work with them everyday. The trust they extend to us is deserving of the utmost respect and we will continue to evolve with this as our focus.""

Lyon has not been charged and none of the allegations have been tested in court.

On Friday in B.C. Supreme Court in Victoria, Madame Justice Jennifer Power passed sentence over the 51-year-old Mostowy, the former owner of All-Canadian Construction.

He was convicted of sexually assaulting his employee over two to three weeks between May and June of 2014.

Mostowy assaulted the female employee on six separate occasions while he was out on bail after being accused of sexually assaulting five women who worked in his Langford-based office in 2010 and 2011.

During Friday’s sentencing, Power referenced a written victim impact statement in which Mostowy’s victim wrote she has suffered with depression and has been subjected to financial hardship since the sexual assaults.

Power also noted the similarity of the sexual offences suffered by the female employee in 2014 and the circumstances of a previous sexual assault conviction in January 2016.

In January 2017, the Langford contractor was sentenced to 36 months in prison for sexually assaulting five female employees. At his 2016 trial, the court heard all five of the female employees describe similar circumstances. At that time, the women said Mostowy gave them unwanted massages which escalated over time to unconsentual sexual touching and sexual acts.

In Friday’s sentencing decision, Power noted that Mostowy used his position of trust and power over his victim to work alone with her at job sites. It was while they were alone on those job sites that Mostowy tried to coerce the victim into touching his exposed genitals. Power suggested that Mostowy exploited his female employee’s vulnerability because, as her employer, she relied on him to earn her living as a dry-waller.

Power also noted that Mostowy continues to deny he assaulted the female dry-waller and he has shown no remorse for his actions.

Two reports from psychologists prepared for Friday’s sentencing stated that Mostowy poses a low to moderate risk to re-offend.

She sentenced Mostowy a nine-month sentence to be served in a provincial jail. When he is released, he will serve an additional 24 months probation. Mostowy must provide a sample of his DNA. His sentence also includes and automatic lifetime ban from owning or possessing a firearm and ammunition.

The sentence order also bars him from contacting the victim of the assaults or attending to a home where she may live or a place of business or school that she may be attending.

When he is released he is to advise his probation officer of any relationships he may have and any changes to those relationships that may occur.

The judge informed the court that Mostowy intends to appeal his conviction.",[]

Multiple allegations of sexual assault against an employee of Carne tattoo came to light through social media and news media earlier this week. One employee was subsequently fired, according to the company.

Another artist at Painted Lotus Studios was also dismissed after similar allegations were made.

VicPD says the department's Special Victims Unit will investigate any such reports.

The department on Friday issued a statement saying its officers are aware of ""reports of sexualized violence during tattoo appointments here in Victoria,"" and said to anyone who comes forward with such complaints to Special Victims Unit detectives, ""you will be listened to, treated with respect, and you will be believed.""

Police added that victims do not have to file a police report to access community supports, adding that locations such as the Victoria Sexual Assault Centre, the Men’s Trauma Centre, emergency rooms, family doctors' offices, counsellors and other supports are in place.

The department has compiled a list of such community resources under its ""We Believe You"" banner.

The Victoria police said, however, that providing a statement to police before speaking to media or posting details of sexual violence online is beneficial if the matter is to proceed to court in the future.

Anyone wishing to speak with a VicPD detective can call the non-emergency line at 250-995-7654 and select extension 1 for the report desk. Police said an officer will take a complainant's contact information and arrange for a detective follow up within a week or two.",[]

“Whenever you have a bat in someone’s house, then we always have to question, is that normal behaviour of a bat?"" says Dr. Erin Langwith, veterinarian at Harbour City Animal Hospital.

""So if there’s a contact like that, we submit it for testing.”

It's the second bat in the last month the Nanaimo animal hospital submitted for testing. The first bat came back negative.

The dog was given a rabies vaccine booster and will be in self-isolation inside its Nanoose Bay home for three months.

The vaccine is very effective in preventing the disease if pets are vaccinated within seven days of potentially being exposed, the vet said.

If your pet potentially comes in contact with a bat, Langwith says collect the bat safely and bring it in to be tested.

What is surprising, however, is that the film will star an entirely Canadian cast.

Usually, Hallmark films cast U.S. based actors who then travel to B.C. for filming.

The city filed an application in B.C. Supreme Court on Friday seeking an order to remove people sheltering in the park's Garry oak groves and allow them to camp instead in ""less vulnerable locations within the park,"" the city said in a statement Friday.

""The Garry oak ecosystems in Beacon Hill Park are part of a protected and endangered natural system, which less than five per cent remains in B.C.,"" the city said.

“This is a challenging time for everyone, especially for people in our city who don’t have a home,” said Victoria Mayor Lisa Helps in the statement.

“While we acknowledge previous court decisions that recognized the rights of people experiencing homelessness to shelter in municipal parks, we all have a responsibility to protect sensitive ecosystems and the natural environment,"" Helps said.

“No one is being forced to leave Beacon Hill Park, but we do expect people to relocate to one of the many less vulnerable areas.”

The number of homeless people in Beacon Hill Park and other city parks has grown significantly since the COVID-19 pandemic began. The municipality has worked with provincial and regional housing organizations to move homeless people out of parks and into shelters, including motels around the city.

Victoria staff and outreach workers estimate that 180 people are currently sheltering in city parks, with approximately 100 of them in Beacon Hill Park.

The city said it anticipates it will be able to move homeless people willingly from the Garry oak areas of the park.

""No one should have to live outside in a tent because they don’t have a place to stay,” Helps said. “Getting everyone housed indoors will take continued leadership and investment from the provincial and federal governments, as well as cooperation and coordination throughout the region.”

The city says it expects the court to hear its application to move homeless people within Beacon Hill Park during the week of July 27.",[]

In a statement, the matriarchs known as “daughters of the rivers” say the Queen Charlotte Lodge is reopening as a local state of emergency remains in effect over the COVID-19 pandemic.

They say they're concerned that non-residents will expose local people to the novel coronavirus and with only two ventilators on Haida Gwaii, an outbreak would be devastating.

The matriarchs say they made the decision to peacefully occupy the lands with children, elders and other island residents following several community meetings.

Brian Clive, vice-president of sales and corporate development for the lodge, says it is fully complying with the orders and guidelines issued by the B.C. government, health authorities and WorkSafeBC.

Earlier this week, Clive said the lodge plans to use a helicopter to bring guests directly to the lodge from the mainland.

The coroner’s report says that the driver of a minivan, who was allegedly impaired, was travelling northbound on the Malahat at approximately 101 km/h when she crossed the centre line and collided with an SUV that was travelling southbound.

The driver of the SUV, 46-year-old David Tilley of Vancouver, died shortly after the crash occurred. A passenger in the SUV was also sent to hospital for treatment of serious injuries.

Meanwhile, the driver of the minivan, 31-year-old Sara Thomas, was also taken to hospital for treatment.

Thomas was later charged with six offences related to the crash, including impaired driving.

The coroner’s report says that the crash occurred in a construction zone on the Malahat highway, located roughly 500 metres north of Aspen Road.

Normally, the speed limit in the area is 80 km/h. At the time, the speed limit had been lowered to 60 km/h due to construction in the area. Tilley was travelling between 28 to 40 km/h when the crash occurred, say coroners.

While Thomas travelling more than 100 km/h at the time, coroners say that there is “no physical evidence to indicate that the (minivan) was out of control and witness statements confirm this.”

The coroners report adds that evidence from the vehicle suggests that the driver of the minivan only reacted 0.5 seconds before the collision occurred, “when the accelerator pedal was released and there was a slight steering input to the right.”

“This all indicates that the Dodge Caravan’s entry into the southbound lane was as a result of non-cognitive driving actions such as medical distress, fatigue, distracted driving or impairment,” say coroners.

The coroner’s report adds that a mechanical inspection of both vehicles indicates that mechanical factors did not contribute to the crash.

Since the fatal crash occurred, the section of highway where the collision took place has since been expanded from three lanes to four, and three kilometres of concrete median have been installed. In fact, the installation of the medians was part of the construction that was taking place in the area when the crash occurred.

Coroners believe that the new medians will prevent any similar crashes from occurring in the future.

Thomas, was originally scheduled to appear in court on May 19 for six charges related to the crash, including impaired driving and dangerous driving.

Her court date has since been postponed to July 21 in Duncan.",[]

If you look at the pictures accompanying the post, it seems like there are more than five.

“They can turn into seven or eight,” Tossa laughs. “Depending on what you like to wear.”

Tossa shows me the first dress she bought, featuring fabric cascading to the floor: “My mom didn’t like it,” she explains. “So it’s never been worn.”

The second one is a little simpler. Her mom did like it, so Tossa wore it during the ceremony in Sooke. She shows me a picture of her wearing it while walking between her parents.

“Then — to spice it up — I put a tutu underneath,” Tossa smiles, pointing to the official wedding photos which show the rainbow-coloured tutu emerging from the white dress.

Later that evening at the reception, Tossa wore the tutu under a shorter third dress with lights attached to it.

“I like colour!” she smiles. “So I had to add a lot of colour to my dresses.""

Her life had been just as dynamic as her wedding wear. Tossa says she’s clinically died 13 times because of complications due to Type 1 diabetes.

“It made me go blind,” she explains. “It gave me Charcot-Marie joint syndrome in my one foot, and kidney failure.”

Tossa was adopted (and never knew her birth family) but credits the people who raised her with supporting her through decades of health problems.

“My parents were just amazing,” she says. “And my brother.”

Tossa ended up enduring six surgeries to correct her vision, while 27 pins and plates were used to fix her foot. “The doctor said there wasn’t any room fit more,” she laughs.

Tossa’s diabetes was also cured after a pancreas-kidney transplant. The donor was a crash victim from a different city — a stranger with an unexpected connection to her birth family.

“My surgeon said she was 99.9% probably my [biological] sister,” Tossa says. “I didn’t even know about her.”

Tossa says her feelings about the origins of her organs are complicated, but is ultimately grateful for the chance to keep living and eventually meet the love of her life.

All the wedding dresses were worn to marry the same man, Jody.

Tossa shows me pictures of her wearing the fourth dress at their ceremony on a beach in Mexico. It was for the friends who couldn’t make it to Sooke. She wore the fifth and final dress at that reception.

‘I’m going to live my life to the best that I possibly can,” Tossa says of her celebrations, now that her health problems are behind her.

Now she’s hoping that by selling her dresses another bride — or five — will be able to celebrate living and loving life to the fullest too.

“I hope they have the best days of their lives,” Tossa smiles. ""Like I did.”",[]

Since the 2020 Mackenzie Tour – PGA Tour Canada tournament was cancelled due to COVID-19, four smaller tournaments have been scheduled across the country as part of a “Canada Life Series.”

Two tournaments are taking place at the Bear Mountain Golf & Tennis Resort Community in Langford, and two will be held at TPC Toronto at Osprey Valley.

The first Bear Mountain tournament will take place on Aug. 10 to 12 on the resort’s Mountain Course.

The second tournament will take place on Aug. 17 to 19 on the resort’s Valley Course.

“Bear Mountain’s two courses are quite diverse, and (Jack Nicklaus and his son Steve) designed them in such a way that we think the tournaments will certainly have different feels to them while at the same time providing excellent tests of golf,” said Rob Larocque, Bear Mountain director of golf in a release Friday.

The two tournaments in Toronto will take place on Sept. 2 to 4, and Sept. 9 to 11.

Contestants in the tournaments will include professional Canadian golfers, “elite amateurs,” and Mackenzie Tour members who are currently living in the country, regardless of their citizenship.

Golf Canada estimates that tournaments will range between 90 to 120 players, with prizes set at $50,000 per tournament.

Once the tournament concludes, top ranking golfers will receive conditional Mackenzie Tour status for the 2021 Mackenzie Tour, as well as guaranteed tournament starts.

“It was certainly disappointing when circumstances surrounding COVID-19 required us to cancel the 2020 Mackenzie Tour season,” said Scott Pritchard, Mackenzie Tour executive director.

“We were poised for a great summer of golf, but we never lost sight of the purpose for this Tour, which is to give players opportunities to play tournaments on quality golf courses.”",[]

A Victoria tattoo parlour says it has fired one of its artists after allegations of sexual assault came to light this week, but the business knew about at least one other alleged assault for over a year.

Carne Tattoo in Victoria posted on its Instagram account, saying the company had terminated one of its artists for his ""betrayal of young women"" and of their space.

The post was made on Monday, July 6, after another Instagram user posted a detailed account of an alleged sexual assault by Carne Tattoo artist Dave Hadden, though Carne does not say the posts are connected.

The user claims the incident happened two years ago, when she was 18 years old. She says Hadden slowly moved his fingers between her legs through the course of the tattoo until he eventually had nonconsensual ""digital sex"" with her. She claims he had his fingers inside of her for over half of the four-hour appointment.

The accusations were made on Victims Voices Canada, a page which posts anonymous allegations of abuse, assault, and violence by those in the tattoo and piercing industry.

Hadden, known as TygrDave on Instagram, admitted to the allegations on the social media platform on Tuesday.

""The accusations of me sexually assaulting a client at my former place of employment are true and disgusting, it was a line I should have never crossed,"" Hadded said. ""I am deeply sorry, I do not condone this behavior in anyway shape of form. Theres nothing I can say right now other than that i am so unbelievably sorry. I will be taking a step back from tattooing and seeking professional help.""

One of Hadden's other alleged victims, called 'Sarah' in this article to protect her identity, says she brought a complaint about him to the owners of Carne in March 2019, after first going to the police.

Sarah emailed Carne's co-owner, Kailey Van Der Eyden on March 27, 2019, saying that Hadden had ""put his finger inside"" her, more than once, while she was getting a tattoo.

Van Der Eyden replied saying they would take the issue seriously and with great care, and asked Sarah to speak over the phone.

After that conversation, Sarah says Hadden sent her an apology email, which she said at the time seemed sincere.

""I would like to begin by saying I am truly sorry,"" said Hadden in an email on April 2, 2019. ""I broke a sacred trust that you had instilled to me and I am so ashamed. Ashamed in myself for letting anything like that get to close to even happening. I can't really explain myself, other than I feel so embarrassed.""

In a second email, Hadden said ""I PROMISE nothing will ever come close... ever again.""

Sarah told the Victoria police that she did not want to pursure charges against the artist because she had accepted his apology. The investigating Victoria Police Officer sent her an email dated April 4, 2019.

""I spoke to Dave just now and he told me his side - which I understand he has spoken to you about a couple of times now,"" the VicPD officer wrote. ""I am going to conclude this file as is. I gave him a warning about behaviour, talked about having conversations regarding consent in the future, and how this file could be opened again if you decide so. I agree with you, he does seem sincere and that was a huge mistake of mis-reading the situation.""

Sarah says now that she has seen the post from Carne about Hadden's termination, she wishes she had followed through with her complaint.

""In the post, they're talking about a victim like I don't exist, like just basically erased me is how I felt. There was me who had already reported it 15 months before.""

Sarah says she was insecure about her own appearance and age, thinking that if she came forward no one would believe her.

""I feel like that's what Kailey was looking at me like, like she didn't believe me. I tried to figure out how to reach women... but I had a lot of things in my mind, everyone was praising how wonderful he was and I just thought, approaching people on something like Instagram would open me up for attack from the entire tattoo community. It was so great when this young woman finally posted, now we know it was lots of women.""

Sarah says there is a support group for women who were allegedly assaulted by Hadden, and many have posted comments online detailing inappropriate touching, though she believes that none have filed complaints with the police.

VicPD spokesperson Bowen Osoko says as a department, they believe victims, and explained how it can happen that a complaint could be made and no charges laid.

""A person who has experienced sexual assault has already been in a situation where their power has been taken away and that's not okay, and we as a police department don't want to participate in furthering that, in doing that to them again. So that's why we really let the person who is making that report guide us and partner with us and set the stage for what they want to do. So someone may want to make a report but may not want to proceed with charges and that's okay, and that's someone's right and ability.""

Osoko says in that situation, they will identity the suspect, possibly speak with them and gather evidence in case the victim does want to pursue something in the future.

In a statement from Carne Tattoo released Wednesday afternoon, the business acknowledged that allegations of sexual assault had been brought to their attention over a year ago:

""In March of 2019, we received an email from a customer alleging that the now terminated member of our staff had sexually assaulted her while working on her tattoo,"" the statement said.

""At the time, we worked closely with the survivor to determine a path forward. It was our understanding that the situation had been resolved to the satisfaction of the survivor.

In retrospect, we should have terminated this employee immediately as this disgusting behaviour has no home in our industry or our shop and our failure to immediately act upheld a system that protects aggressors and continues the cycle of victimization. This situation and the decisions that followed were made by the shop’s management. Our other artists were not aware of the situation that occurred.

Up until this past weekend, we were not aware of any similar incidents perpetrated by this member of our staff; however, it is now clear that this employee’s actions were not a one-off, but rather a piece of a disturbing pattern. When we were made aware of other alleged assaults on social media, we moved quickly to terminate the employment of the artist.

We have always put the safety of our clients first and we are extremely troubled that these actions could have taken place at our shop. In response, we have begun to implement new hiring policies, changed our internal practices, and scheduled our staff to participate in Safer Spaces Training, which will be mandatory going forward. These new measures will help us work to ensure that this does not happen in our shop again.""

At the time of this publication, Hadden did not respond to CFAX 1070's request for comment.

Hadden has not been charged and none of the alegations have been tested in court.",[]

Abby Morris is the owner of Crabby Bob's Seafood at the marina where the garbage bags were found floating in the water.

""It just doesn't make sense to me why you would dump your actual garbage bags into the harbour,"" Morris said. ""It would be one thing if you just showed up and dumped a bunch of food in the water because, of course, the creatures would take care of that, but they don't take care of plastic.""

A surveillance camera captured the man backing his pickup onto the dock and then dumping a plastic barrel full of trash off the edge of the dock, followed by several tied garbage bags.

Phyllis Titus is the marina's manager and reviewed video of the incident, which occurred at 5:27 a.m. on July 7.

""He dumped what looked to us, (to be) frozen food that thawed from a freezer. There was fish, there was bread, apples, all in plastic zip-lock bags and then also inside plastic garbage bags,"" Titus said.

The incident happened right next to an open dumpster, which Titus found puzzling. She posted an image from a surveillance camera on Facebook and tips from the public started coming in immediately.

""Even though it's a large town, it's a small town at the same time and everyone wants to protect the ocean,"" she said.

Dock attendant Rylan Fisher was tasked with helping retrieve the bags from the water and the rocks under the pier.

""It was brutal,"" Fisher said. ""It was the worst smell I have ever encountered. There was a few full fish in them, there was sausages, dry freezer bags and random food items.""

The dumping left Morris disappointed.

""It actually made me embarrassed to be a human being yesterday,"" she said.

Titus reported the incident to various agencies which she said are looking into the matter. She said she'd also like to have a talk with the person involved and hopes he'll come and make his amends to staff that had to clean up the mess he left behind.",[]

Premier John Horgan says he supports police chiefs from across Canada who are calling for the decriminalization of illicit drugs for personal use.

The Canadian Association of Police Chiefs announced Thursday that it endorses the decriminalization of drug possession and is calling for a national task force to research drug policy reforms.

""If not now, when?"" the premier responded Thursday to a question about decriminalizing drugs amid B.C.'s ongoing opioid crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic.

""We're in the midst of a global pandemic when it comes to COVID-19. In British Columbia that is further complicated by an overdose crisis which saw last month the highest monthly number of deaths that we've seen in a good long time,"" Horgan said.

In a statement Thursday, the head of the Canadian Association of Police Chiefs (CAPC) said the role of frontline officers has already shifted away from traditional enforcement toward harm reduction.

“Canada continues to grapple with the fentanyl crisis and a poisoned drug supply that has devastated our communities and taken thousands of lives,” said CAPC president and Vancouver police Chief Adam Palmer.

""We recommend that enforcement for possession give way to an integrated health-focused approach that requires partnerships between police, healthcare and all levels of government.""

The BC Coroners service announced last month that more drug users died in May in British Columbia than in any other month in the province's history.

""Anything we can do to reduce the deaths and to reduce the dependence and to, quite frankly, free up law enforcement to do other things, I support,"" Horgan said.

The premier said his government is limited in what it can do as drug policy and enforcement is a federal issue, but said he has ""made it clear to the prime minister where British Columbia stands.""

Horgan said the years-long opioid epidemic in B.C. is proof that a change to drug policy is required.

""I don’t have experience – serious experience – with addictions, other than being a smoker in my past,"" Horgan said.

""But we need as a society to come together and say, 'We cannot allow our brothers and sisters, our mothers and fathers, our neighbours to continue to succumb to overdose deaths because we're not prepared to do everything we can to reduce that likelihood.""",[]

Police say the incident occurred Tuesday at 4:15 p.m. at Brydon Park when the victim of the alleged attack was walking in the area.

Ted Penston tells CTV News that he and his wife, as well as many other people in the park, witnessed a man repeatedly striking his dog.

“A fella was walking through the park with his pit bull in a chokehold and he threw it on the ground. Then he kicked it and kicked it, picked it up, threw it down, kicked it again and picked it up by the throat and kicked it again,” said Penston.

“Finally, my wife said, ‘You have to do something.’”

That’s when Penston says he confronted the man. The pair exchanged heated words before the man allegedly tried to strike Penston.

“He came up to me and threw a punch at me, it just missed my head,” said the Saanich resident.

“I moved out of the way, then I lost my balance and I hit the ground. And then he (hit) me in the guts.”

Police say the man then fled the park and placed his dog inside of a car before driving away.

Penston says the man threw the dog “like a sack of tomatoes” into the trunk of the car and other witnesses of the incident told police that they also saw the man drive away.

Witnesses added that the man returned to the park shortly after to retrieve another one of his dogs, say police.

On social media, witnesses say that multiple families, including children, were in the park at the time.

One child wrote a note to Penston after the attack, saying, “Thank you for standing up for that dog and risking your own safety to help. I hope that the police catch that evil man before he can hurt more dogs. P.S. Great reflexes.”

Penston, who has lived in the area for roughly 30 years, says his family has never seen anything like this before.

""All the people and the ladies here and everybody couldn’t believe how he was treating the dog. He was just kicking it and kicking it and throwing it. It was the worst we’d ever seen,"" he said.

""I just couldn’t watch it anymore.""

Penston says that the punch only ""grazed"" him and that besides some slight soreness on his side, he is otherwise uninjured.

He says he hopes police will confiscate the man’s dog and arrest him for assault, as well as barring him from owning any animals in the future.

Police say that the man is described as a white male who stands roughly 5’ 10” with a heavy build. He has dark short hair and was wearing a grey T-shirt, blue jeans and black shoes at the time. He also has a tattoo on his right bicep.

His vehicle is described as a dark blue Volkswagen Golf four-door car.

The man’s dog is described as a medium-sized animal with a black spot over one eye.

“We are hoping that this person comes forward and identifies himself to police. However, at this point he has not,” said Saanich Police Const. Markus Anastasiades in a release Wednesday.

“As a result, we are looking for the public’s help in identifying him as well as to check the welfare of both of his dogs.”

According to the recall from Health Canada, the ""mattress support board or the cross bar supporting the mattress support board of the bassinet may become disengaged with an occupant inside.""

The recall affects the wooden bassinet product called the 'Bailey' with model number M0934 that was manufactured between August 2018 and September 2019.

Approximately 290 units of the affected product sold in Canada with 3,000 sold in the U.S.

While waiting for a repair kit, a notice on the company's website said owners of the recalled product should ""remove the current support legs and use the bassinet on a safe space on the floor"" or find an ""alternate, safe sleeping environment for the child.""

353,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/dengue-fever-prevention-efforts-stifled-by-coronavirus-pandemic-1.5021433,Dengue fever prevention efforts stifled by coronavirus pandemic,"['Victoria Milko', 'Aniruddha Ghosal']",2020-07-12 21:38:00-04:00,"JAKARTA, INDONESIA -- To slow the spread of the coronavirus, governments issued lockdowns to keep people at home. They curtailed activities that affected services like trash collection. They tried to shield hospitals from a surge of patients.

But the cascading effects of these restrictions also are hampering efforts to cope with seasonal outbreaks of dengue, an incurable, mosquito-borne disease that is also known as ""breakbone fever"" for its severely painful symptoms.

Southeast Asian countries like Singapore and Indonesia have dealt with concurrent outbreaks of dengue and coronavirus this year. In Brazil, where there are over 1.6 million COVID-19 infections, at least 1.1 million cases of dengue have been reported, with nearly 400 deaths, according to the Pan American Health Organization.

Dengue cases are likely to rise soon with the start of seasonal rains in Latin American countries like Cuba, Chile and Costa Rica, as well as the South Asian countries of India and Pakistan.

Dengue typically isn't fatal, but severe cases may require hospitalization. Prevention efforts targeted at destroying mosquito-breeding sites, like removing trash or old tires and other objects containing standing water, are still the best ways to curb the spread of the disease. But coronavirus-era lockdowns and other restrictions have meant that these efforts have been reduced or stopped altogether in many countries.

In northwestern Pakistan, plans to disinfect tire shops and markets that had dengue outbreaks in 2019 were shelved due to funds being used for the coronavirus, said Dr. Rizwan Kundi, head of the Young Doctor's Association.

Health workers who would destroy mosquito-breeding sites in India's capital of New Delhi are also screening people for the virus.

Having to identify thousands of virus cases has meant that dengue surveillance has suffered in many Latin American countries, added Dr. Maria Franca Tallarico, the head of health for the Americas regional office of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.

Experts say that disrupting such prevention efforts is ominous for the global battle against dengue.

The World Health Organization says 2019 was the worst year on record for dengue cases, with every region affected, and some countries were hit for the first time.

Aedes aegypti, the mosquito that spreads dengue, is most prevalent in cities, and experts warn that increased urbanization and warming temperatures due to climate change means that its range will keep increasing.

Experts say that while reduced travel means fewer opportunities for mosquitoes to bite people with dengue to become carriers themselves, the coronavirus pandemic has introduced other variables.

Staying home -- one way to slow outbreaks of COVID-19, especially in cities -- poses greater risks for spreading dengue, said Singapore's National Environment Agency (NEA). That's because the Aedes mosquito bites during the day, and with more people staying home, where mosquito populations are high, the more likely they are to be bitten.

The impact is already visible. Singapore recorded a five-fold increase in the mosquito larvae detected in homes and common corridors of residential areas during the two-month coronavirus lockdown period, compared with the previous two months. By July 6, the total of dengue cases in Singapore was more than 15,500. The NEA says the number of cases this year is expected to exceed the 22,170 cases reported in 2013, which at the time was the largest dengue outbreak in Singapore's history.

Oliver Brady, an associate professor at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said Central America and the Caribbean were at higher risk due to overlapping outbreaks.

Working with communities in Latin America to stop mosquitoes from breeding had been the most successful anti-dengue strategy in recent years, Tallarico said. But with strict limitations on movement, she said they didn't know whether these measures were still happening, and ""this is the big concern for us.""

A shortage of protective equipment also means limiting the number of first responders who can check on people with fever or cough, she said.

""My concern is that you have (many) more cases of dengue ... but the capacity of the system to notify (and) test is limited,"" she said.

Dengue patients need acute care, and this could lead to a ""double whammy"" that overwhelms health care systems, said Scott O'Neill, founder and director of the World Mosquito Program.

""The health care system is already crumbling. ... I am not sure how (India's) existing health care system will be able to handle this load,"" said Dr. S.P Kalantri, a public health specialist.

Global research into dengue also will be affected by the coronavirus pandemic, Brady said.

At the WMP Tahija Foundation Research Laboratory in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, which has been studying dengue for years, ""it became too difficult to enrol patients with the social-distancing measures,"" O'Neill said. The facility is now being used as a COVID-19 testing site.

Similarly, the National Institute of Malaria Research in New Delhi has stopped all field work after it was converted into a centre for validating COVID-19 testing kits, said Dr. R.C Dhiman, who studies mosquitoes and climate change.

In Bangladesh, where dengue season is just starting, the launch of a mobile app to help people report their cases was delayed by the pandemic, said Afsana Alamgir Khan, who oversees the country's dengue program.

In a video released Thursday by Mount Sinai Hospital, Pastor Benjamin Thomas asks others to wear face masks and follow physical distancing measures after he says he lost over 22 kilograms and all of his muscle while battling the novel coronavirus.

""COVID-19 I went through is real. I know still people do not want to wear masks and don't want to keep social distancing. It is very important. Take this thing seriously. You don't want to go through what I went through. It is very rough,"" Thomas said in the video.

Thomas, who is the pastor at Queens Church of God, was released from Mount Sinai on July 2 after spending over 100 days at the hospital.

""It was a very rough journey,"" Thomas said.

Thomas said thankfully none of his organs were affected by the virus except for his lungs.

However, his doctor said the virus still took a dramatic toll on Thomas.

""I really just told God there was nothing else I can offer him, he's got to take over,"" Dr. Robin Varghese said in the video.

""We've given him everything that modern medicine can throw at him.""

Varghese, who runs the cardiovascular surgery ICU that became a COVID unit during the pandemic, said he began trying new treatment options in mid-April when Thomas’ health was at its worst.

""He was in the worst shape, and many of our team members who were rooting for him, were also losing hope, as was I,"" Varghese said.

However, by the middle of May, Varghese said Thomas was making ""slow, very slow but steady progress"" in recovering from the illness.

""The whole team said there is no hope, they fully gave up on me. [But] I turned, I changed, I started to respond to the medicine,"" Thomas said.

Thomas is now back at his home in East Meadow, Long Island but still needs supplemental oxygen to breathe. Varghese said he will need the extra oxygen for a few weeks after his lungs were ""ravaged by the COVID-19 virus.""

""We're very happy that he continued to progress and he started to progress. We're thankful for all the people that were continuing to pray for him because we know that was a very important part of his recovery all with the care of our intensive care team,"" Varghese said.

Thomas said he is happy to be home with his family and looks forward to reuniting with his church, calling his recovery ""a miracle.""",[]

In a case study, published last week in The BMJ, the doctors profiled the case of a 57-year-old Japanese man who worked in customer service at a restaurant.

He first went to doctors in April, where he tested positive for influenza A, but as his condition failed to improve in the days that followed, he went to hospital where he eventually tested positive for COVID-19 as well.

The patient’s fever lasted four days while in hospital, while his difficulty breathing and low oxygen count in his blood began to improve after a week. The man remained in the hospital for four weeks, but was eventually discharged.

The doctors note that this case should be an indication to other health-care professionals to check for COVID-19 among patients with other respiratory infections.

“During the epidemic, the possibility of COVID-19 should be considered regardless of positive findings for other pathogens,” the doctors wrote in the case study.

Patients infected with other respiratory viruses along with COVID-19 are not unheard of, though it’s unclear how often that occurs.

Studies from New York City and Northern California show 2.1 per cent and 20.7 per cent rates of respiratory infections and COVID-19, respectively. A third study from Wuhan, China shows 4.35 per cent of the COVID-19 patients examined had also been diagnosed with influenza.

In Texas, Eleana Topp was diagnosed with COVID-19 and the flu at the same time back in March.

Soon after her diagnosis, Topp was placed on a ventilator and her family watched as her condition worsened to the point of multiple organ failure.

“In my mind, I said ‘She’s not going to the die from this, she’s going to survive,’” Daniel Topp, Eleana's husband, told CNN. “There’s no doubt that she was.”

After seven weeks, she was able to get off a ventilator and continue rehabilitation. She was able to return to her home last week.

However, the doctors behind the BMJ report note that there is no indication whether someone who has contracted another virus is more or less likely to contract COVID-19.

“There was no significant difference in the rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with and without other pathogens, the report states. “The presence of a non-SARS-CoV-2 pathogen may not provide reassurance that a patient does not also have SARS-CoV-2.”",[]
356,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/genetic-detectives-begin-work-to-trace-spread-of-covid-19-in-canada-1.5020869,Genetic detectives begin work to trace spread of COVID-19 in Canada,['Mia Rabson'],2020-07-12 07:17:00-04:00,"OTTAWA -- For the last four months, Canada's public health experts have been racing to stop the spread of COVID-19 by trying to figure out how everyone is getting it, and whom they may have given it to.

But even the best efforts have left doctors stymied about the source of more than one-third of this country's known COVID-19 infections. Not knowing where cases come from makes outbreaks that much harder to stamp out.

Now medical researchers and supercomputers are turning genetics labs into virus detective agencies, looking first to find the novel coronavirus itself within blood samples from thousands of infected patients, and then comparing all of those isolated viruses to each other looking for places they differ.

Every close match will draw a line from patient to patient, ultimately painting a picture of how the virus spread.

""This is the big effort over the next four weeks,"" said Andrew McArthur, director of the biomedical discovery and commercialization program at McMaster University.

""What's going to come out of there pretty soon is a glimpse of what just happened, how did it move around the province, how did it move between provinces or how big was Pearson (airport) in the early days of the airport being open.""

Knowing how the virus spread will show where there were weaknesses in public health measures early on, said McArthur. Being able to keep divining genetic codes from samples will mean when there are flare-ups of cases, they can be quickly compared to each other to see if they're all related or are coming from multiple sources.

It means, for example, a long-term care centre should be able to quickly know if its 10 new cases are because one case spread widely or arose from multiple carriers coming into the facility.

""That's a very different infection-control problem,"" said McArthur.

It also means that maybe, just maybe, the second COVID-19 wave most think is coming won't be as bad, or as hard to control, as the first, because the sources can be isolated very quickly.

""A second wave is likely,"" McArthur said. ""But we've never spent this kind of money and effort before, either, so maybe we'll beat it.""

The kinds of genetic technology being used for this project did not exist when SARS hit Canada in 2003.

This genetic mapping is constantly on the look-out for mutations. Thus far, SARS-CoV-2, the official name for the virus that causes COVID-19, has not mutated as quickly as many others do. Influenza, for instance, changes so much over a year the vaccine has to be retooled every summer to keep up.

But there are enough subtle changes still happening among the 28,000 individual markers that make up a genome for SARS-CoV-2 that cases can be traced backward and linked to the ones that came before. McArthur said it takes a lot of data storage, a lot of high-capacity computer analysis, and a lot of money, to run the comparisons among them all.

The federal government put $40 million on the table in April for genetic research on COVID-19. Half is to keep tabs on the virus as it spreads, look for any changes it undergoes, and map its pathway across the country. The other half is to look at the genetic structures of the patients who get infected, trying to answer the puzzling question of why some people die and others have symptoms so mild they never even know they are sick.

Genome Canada is administering the project, with six regional genomics agencies overseeing the work locally and labs like McArthur's doing the testing and analysis. The funding is intended to create genetic maps from 150,000 patients. Canada thus far has had about 108,000 positive cases, and the expectation is that almost every one of them will be gene-mapped.

The results will be loaded into a global site comparing all known infections of COVID-19, but also be analyzed for national and regional reports.

In New York, genetic sequencing was used to figure out that COVID-19 in Manhattan wasn't coming from China and Iran as imagined, but from Europe. In Canada, it is suspected that much of the virus came into this country from travellers returning from the United States in early March. But the work is only now beginning to confirm that belief.

McArthur estimates the first data will be available for Ontario in about four weeks, but warns it will take many more months to complete all of the tests. His lab sequenced 600 samples on Wednesday alone.

Overall, McArthur expects the genetics project to last for two years.

357,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/expert-says-studies-on-risk-of-virus-transmission-through-surfaces-don-t-reflect-real-world-1.5015069,Expert says studies on risk of virus transmission through surfaces don't reflect real world,[],2020-07-07 22:13:00-04:00,"TORONTO -- Is it necessary to wear gloves outside, or wipe down groceries or mail to keep yourself safe from potential COVID-19 exposure?

It’s a question that has been posed since the beginning of the pandemic.

Numerous studies have been carried out over the past few months to measure how long the virus can live on surfaces, looking at its lifespan on different materials and how infectious it remains for longer periods of time. Some studies have found the survival rate to be a matter of hours, while others have found that the virus, under some circumstances, can survive for days on surfaces.

Emanuel Goldman, Professor of Microbiology, Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics at the New Jersey Medical School, wrote in a comment published in the scientific journal The Lancet last week, that he believes the risk of virus transmission through infected surfaces has been “exaggerated.”

A “comment” does not present new data found through experiments or studies, but simply provides scientific commentary.

Goldman believes the results of all of these studies on the lifespan of the virus on surfaces have been used to direct courses of action for the general public that the data itself doesn’t call for.

“It’s not that the studies are wrong, it’s that they’re the wrong studies,” he told CTVNews.ca in a phone interview.

“So the belief that there was a risk from inanimate objects and surfaces stems from experiments that were done where virus was placed on surfaces, and then at intervals of times subsequent to doing that, the amount of virus that was left was measured. Well and good, but the problem with those experiments was that the amount of virus that they started with was much, much orders of magnitude larger than what you’re going to find in the real world.”

He said some of the studies measured the lifespan of the virus on surfaces by placing as much as “a hundred thousand to 10 million virus particles on a small surface area” -- which he believes is far higher than the amount of virus particles that would be present in the average sneeze.

He had not come across any scientific literature that specifically measured how many virus particles that caused COVID-19 were in a sneeze, but stated that similar research regarding the common flu found that there are around 10-100 viral particles within a droplet from an influenza patient.

Goldman emphasized that he doesn’t think these studies on the surface life of the virus are a problem themselves, but said the way their results have been interpreted and applied is.

“The supermarkets won't take returns of anything that you buy now because of this. You have to pack your own bags because they're worried about this. And it’s, in ways little and large, it's directed behaviour in a way that's not justified by the data,” he said.

“And even worse, it distracts and takes people away from what really protects you against this virus and that’s the masks. That's where the emphasis has to be. That's what's going to save us.”

He said that while it’s “not impossible” to contract COVID-19 in the grocery store by handling something that had recently been coughed on by an infected person, “there’s so many steps that would have to happen.

“First, someone infected would have to deposit the virus on the thing you bought, then you'd have to buy it right after. And after touching it, then you'd have to touch your mouth, your nose, [or] your eyes, and all that within a relatively short period of time.”

This means a person could handle a cereal box with virus particles on it and still remain safe if they were following the main public health recommendations -- wearing a mask in a grocery store and washing their hands at home before touching their face at all.

Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist, also told CTVNews.ca that transmission of the virus through surfaces was not “the main mode of transmission,” but said he doesn’t believe there’s an issue with being extra cautious by doing things such as wiping down groceries.

“If that's what gets people through the day, if that's what enables people to go get groceries, if that’s what enables people to open their mail, so be it, that's totally fine,” he said. “I think the pendulum is swinging away from that, but I would certainly not shame people for doing that at all.”

He said no one study alone is able to pinpoint an exact risk of transmission, and that one needs to look at the big picture to get an idea of the risks.

“At the end of the day, the data that's emerging now, when we sort of take a step back and look at who's getting infected, where are they getting infected and how are they getting infected -- this is generally people who are in close contact with one another, typically in indoor settings, when people are in close contact with one another for prolonged periods of time,” he said. “That’s who's getting the infection.”

New infection rates are also significantly lower in Canada than in countries such as the U.S., contributing to a lower risk of encountering surfaces that were coughed or sneezed on by an infected person within an hour or two of another person touching that surface.

Goldman acknowledged that disinfecting surfaces and tools and wearing gloves are things that are necessary in a hospital setting. But his worry for the general population is that the surface transmission discussion is a “distraction,” and that people might actually be less likely to follow any health guidelines if they feel overwhelmed by instructions to wipe down everything.

“You see now people not using masks, partly because it was such an overriding concern with including the surfaces. It just gets to be too much,” he said.

“Just use common sense and focus mostly on protecting your airways and your breathing.”",[]

One month after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 situation a pandemic, researchers surveyed more than 1,400 parents to see how their children were faring.

Not only did parents report that 79 per cent of kids were spending more time on screens, only 2.7 per cent of kids were meeting the recommended 60 minutes of physical activity per day.

“We've got a lifestyle of our children and youth that is sub-optimal to begin with. Twelve to 15 per cent meeting healthy sleep, healthy screen time, healthy physical activity guidelines. And that's dropped by close to 80 per cent during the crisis,” Mark Tremblay, study co-author and researcher at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Research Institute, told CTV News.

“This has been collateral damage to the lifestyles of kids.”

The study, published in International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity this week, also found that 41 per cent of children were sleeping more -- a positive finding, according to Tremblay, but one that may be attributed to boredom.

Fifteen-year-old Aneira Cleur says without school and extracurricular activities to keep them occupied, she and her friends have become “pretty lazy.”

“A lot of them are just lying in bed all day,” Cleur, who considered herself fairly active before the pandemic, told CTV News.

Her 13-year-old sister, Kerri, says that without the need to go anywhere or the ability to see her friends, she lost her motivation to leave the house.

""It was frustrating because there was what we little we could do,"" their father, Adrian Gay, told CTV News. ""They really weren't keen on venturing out when we forced them to. So it was tough.""

But as COVID-19 restrictions begin to ease across the country, and warmer weather draws more kids outside, experts warn it may not be enough to recondition kids for a healthier lifestyle -- especially in the event of a second wave.

""This could be the new normal for quite some time,” Trembley explained.

“We simply can't afford to shrug our shoulders and say, ‘It's okay this is just the way it's going to be.’ The consequences of that would be fairly serious.""

Trembley notes that, on average, Canadian parents were already struggling to encourage their children to meet daily activity guidelines and have less screen time.

Earlier this week, a study commissioned by ParticipACTION to support the annual Report Card on Physical Activity for Children and Youth, found that, before the pandemic, Canadian children were barely getting a passing grade for overall physical activity.

According to that study, only 39 per cent of children aged five to 11 and youths aged 12 to 17 met the national physical activity guidelines.

“Already we had a challenge to try and increase the proportion of kids that are benefiting from healthy movement behaviours,” said Tremblay.

""Now we're going to have to rehabilitate the population somewhat just to get back to that already rather weak baseline.”

Moving forward in the pandemic, Tremblay says it’s imperative that health officials focus on the promotion of healthy behaviours as well as disease prevention.

""Wouldn't it be great if, as a result of this rather horrible circumstance, that on a population level, families, and the communities they live in recalibrate themselves to ones where healthy active living becomes much more normative than it has been in recent years in Canada,” he said.

Experts recommend that parents incorporate physical activity into daily routines as much as possible and look for opportunities to be active as a family, while setting limits around screen time in the home.",[]
359,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/this-drug-can-treat-90-per-cent-of-cystic-fibrosis-patients-but-it-s-not-available-in-canada-1.4991938,"This drug can treat 90 per cent of cystic fibrosis patients, but it's not available in Canada",[],2020-06-19 15:28:00-04:00,"TORONTO -- Struggling to breathe is one of the main symptoms of the novel coronavirus that has recently swept across the country. But for Nicole Stringer, who suffers from cystic fibrosis, it's been the reality for her entire life.

For Stringer, every breath is a battle. Now, she's fighting for access to a drug that could change that.

The Kelowna, B.C. woman was born with cystic fibrosis (CF), a genetic disorder that causes mucus to clog her lungs and damages her organs. On top of that, Stringer is also infected with a superbug, a bacteria called Pseudomonas aeruginosa which can't be killed by antibiotics.

Stringer uses puffers, an oxygen machine and takes a hundred pills every day to control symptoms like fever and nausea. But she's still constantly in and out of hospital, and plagued by the knowledge that at any time, her lungs could fail.

Her best friend, also a CF patient, recently succumbed to the disease.

Stringer has tried every treatment -- including travelling to the U.S. to become the first Canadian CF patient to try an experimental treatment called phage therapy, which uses viruses to kill bacteria. No treatment so far has truly helped.

""I have developed resistance to almost all of the antibiotics that I can take,"" she told CTV News. ""So now I have lung infections that are just doing what they're going to do and I have nothing to fight them with anymore, so I am going to continue to get sicker.""

COVID-19 poses yet another risk to Stringer's life, and has kept her isolated indoors for months.

But she sees hope for her declining health in the form of a drug that is already improving the health of CF patients in the U.S.: Trikafta.

Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in a specific gene, which create a faulty protein. Trikafta works by targeting that mutation to help the defective protein work more efficiently, with signs it can slow or even stop the progression of the disease.

""Within a week's time many people have had less mucus, they can run up the stairs, they can play with their kids, so it is a drug that's life changing, it's transformational for people with a fatal genetic disease,"" Kelly Grover, CEO of Cystic Fibrosis Canada, told CTV News.

Trikafta is a combination of three drugs: elexacaftor, tezacaftor, and ivacaftor. The therapy can potentially treat up to 90 per cent of CF patients, according to a press release by Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, the company behind the drug.

However, Stringer can't access it, because it's not approved in Canada.

""To have something that … is life-changing that it's right there, but we can't grab it, is the most frustrating thing of my life,"" she said.

Trikafta has made all the difference to Stephi Lee, an American artist and online influencer. Several American patients have documented significant improvements on their YouTube channels.

""Listen to this,"" Lee says in one video. She inhales. ""I didn't even cough.""

Part of the frustration for Canadian patients is that the drug was fast-tracked for approval in the U.S. last year, where studies show it helps to improve lung function by up to 14 per cent.

Grover said it was ""horrendous"" that we haven't seen any progress towards approving the drug here, considering it was approved so quickly within the U.S.

""In the U.K. they are fast-tracking its approval, Ireland and Switzerland have said they will fund it as soon as it becomes approved,"" she said. ""And so every country seems to be clamouring to get its hands on this drug for people with CF, and in Canada we can't even get it into Health Canada for safety reviews. So we're very concerned.

""Patients are really being held hostage in Canada because of that.""

Cystic Fibrosis Canada is calling on Canadian governments and regulators to collaborate with each other and manufacturer Vertex in order to accelerate the approval of Trikafta in Canada, so that it can be made available to patients there.

But the real problem is price. In the U.S., the listed cost for Trikafta is US$311,000 per year.

According to Cystic Fibrosis Canada, in order to get to a Canadian price, the manufacturer must first apply for Health Canada approval of the drug, after which Canada's drug review and reimbursement processes kick in. The Patented Medicine Prices Review Board will determine the maximum price a company can charge for a new patented drug sold in Canada. What public and private insurers pay is negotiated with the company. A body called the pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance negotiates the price that consumers will actually be paying on behalf of the provincial, territorial and federal programs.

The estimated cost for one Trikafta patient in Canada could be more than $400,000 a year.

And Vertex hasn't even applied to sell it here, amid speculation it would not be approved at that price.

An evidence report put out on April 27 by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), an independent watchdog for drug pricing in the U.S., investigated Trikafta and three other CF treatments by Vertex.

ICER gave the drug their highest ""A"" evidence rating a vote of confidence in the drug's transformative effect on patients' lives but added that the price was far too high.

They estimated that the health-benefit price benchmark for Trikafta should be between US$67,900 and US$85,000 per year, which would require a 73 to 78 per cent discount from the drug's current listed price.

In a press release for the report, David Rind, ICER's Chief Medical Officer, said that ""despite being transformative therapies, the prices set by the manufacturer costing many millions of dollars over the lifetime of an average patient are out of proportion to their substantial benefits.

""When a manufacturer has a monopoly on treatments and is aware that insurers will be unable to refuse coverage, the lack of usual counterbalancing forces can lead to excessive prices,"" Rind said.

""Patients who receive the treatments will benefit, but unaligned prices will cause significant negative health consequences for many unseen individuals those throughout society who will experience financial toxicity and may have to delay care, forego care, or even abandon insurance as their out of pocket costs and premiums are driven upward.""

But Canadian doctors and patients say that the drug being unavailable in Canada doesn't fix the price problem.

""I think we need a long-term solution,"" Dr. Pearce Wilcox, a respirologist at St. Paul's Hospital, told CTV News. ""We recognize that medication like this and others are very expensive medications and that's the reality and the public system will have challenges in coming up with that funding.

""On the other hand … cystic fibrosis is a rare disease. So, the long term solution is we need some type of strategy that recognizes rare diseases and the challenges of costs for these medications.

""In the shorter term, there needs to be some of innovative approach,"" to allow patients to get access, he added.

The pharmaceutical company does provide a compassionate care program that allows the sickest patients to have access to medication at a discount, but many patients dealing with a lot of suffering in their day to day lives still will not qualify for that, Wilcox said.

""I think everybody has the right to a life-changing drug,"" Grover agreed. ""I think at this stage we need to get it into the queue, so that the public and private payers can negotiate with the manufacturer to [a] price that makes sense to the Canadian system. And right now we can't even get it into the queue to assess its safety.""

The population of Canadians with cystic fibrosis is around 4,300, ""so you're talking about thousands that this [drug] could help,"" Grover said.

Wilcox said he has been working with cystic fibrosis patients for more than 20 years, and has seen a lot of initiatives introduced over the years to improve care.

But Trikafta is in ""the game-changer category,"" for him in how much it can improve quality of life and slow the progression of the disease.

""There is a medication that has the chance of making a dramatic difference in their, their outcome, and yet … we have very limited access to this compound,"" he said.

For Stringer, the drug feels like her last chance.

""If I don't get Trikafta, I'm going to continue to get sicker,"" she said. ""I could be one infection away from dying. That's really all it takes, is one infection.

""The life that I have right now is not life,"" she added. ""I'm at home all the time, I need oxygen a lot of the time. I barely have enough energy to get up and go into my living room. I'm 28 years old and I don't have a life.""

Stringer made her own urgent appeal directly to Vertex, through Health Canada's Special Access Programme the only way a Canadian can access medication not yet available for sale in Canada but was turned down.

There is a government push to assist her, led by Conservative MP Dan Albas from B.C.

On May 4, he and 58 MPs signed a letter addressed to Health Minister Patty Hajdu asking what she is doing to ensure that Canadians get access to the drug.

In the letter, they mention that Vertex has ""signalled their willingness to negotiate and conclude a Price Listing Agreement with the pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance.

""During the negotiation period, they have offered to supply their drugs to Canadians suffering with CF for free,"" the letter continues.

""As the Minister of Health, please provide us with an update on what you are doing to support the negotiations with Vertex and ensure that Canadians have access to these life-saving and life-changing drugs.""

Stringer, and other patients like her, are waiting to see if anything comes of the letter, and if Trikafta will come to Canada or not.

In the meantime, Canadian patients with cystic fibrosis will have to remain in limbo, caught between hope and reality.",[]
360,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/as-the-race-for-a-vaccine-ramps-up-so-do-calls-for-vaccine-injury-compensation-1.4983341,"As the race for a vaccine ramps up, so do calls for vaccine injury compensation",[],2020-06-13 22:00:00-04:00,"TORONTO -- Canada may be at the forefront of the race to develop an effective COVID-19 vaccine, with a clinical trial already approved, but experts warn we have fallen short in developing a fund to compensate those who may be injured by vaccinations.

With immense political and public pressure to develop a vaccine, a process that can take years, researchers are carrying out trials at an unprecedented pace in efforts to bring a successful vaccine to market in a matter of months.

And although vaccine-related reactions are rare, experts say a new vaccine -- especially one developed using new technology -- may come with unknown risks.

At least 19 countries already have programs in place that compensate individuals injured by vaccines, but Canada does not.

In fact, it is the only G7 country without such measures in place, and experts are now calling on the federal government to prepare in advance of the COVID-19 vaccination program.

“If you do suffer an adverse event, a serious adverse event, one of those very rare events, you should be compensated,” said Jennifer Keelan, a retired researcher who worked at the University of Toronto’s Department of Public Health, told CTV News.

“An ideal process is to think about these things before you implement the mass vaccine program, rather than reacting.”

Adverse reactions to vaccines are rare, but have had deadly repercussions in the past.

In 1976, the U.S. government rushed to develop a swine flu vaccination over fears of the next big pandemic. The immunization program was halted after 10 weeks due to reports that the vaccination increased the risk for Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), a rare form of paralysis that starts in the feet and creeps up the body.

Though the associated risk was approximately one in 100,000, more than 450 people developed GBS after receiving the vaccine. Of those, 25 died.

Similarly, in 2009, the H1N1 influenza vaccine, while largely deemed safe, was linked with cases of narcolepsy in Europe.

Experts warn that vaccine manufacturers may demand legal protection against lawsuits regarding adverse reactions to a new vaccine.

In 2009, the Canadian government put forth an emergency process to release the H1N1 vaccine without waiting for Health Canada to review the results of clinical trials concerning the vaccine’s efficacy.

According to the Canadian Medical Association Journal, Canada agreed to indemnify the vaccine’s manufacturer, Glaxo-SmithKline, from potential lawsuits.

At the time, the federal government was said to be considering a no-fault compensation scheme, or a vaccine injury compensation program. However, no such program was ever created.

Quebec is the only province that offers such a plan for adverse reactions stemming from immunizations.

In other provinces and territories, any healthcare costs associated with an adverse vaccine reaction would be covered through the public health system or, if disability occurred, through disability income.

According to the Canadian Vaccination Evidence Resource and Exchange Centre, the only other recourse would be through litigation. However, there is a limited understanding of the number of vaccine-injury related lawsuits in Canada.

CTV News contacted the federal government to see if there was any consideration for such a program in light of the circumstances surrounding COVID-19. A request for comment was not returned.

“Some of these individuals may actually be front-line workers, personal support workers, health-care workers, or those working in long-term care centres who will be asked to receive this vaccine not only for their benefit, but to protect the patients, the people they are caring for,” Dr. Kumanan Wilson, senior scientist at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, told CTV News.

“Despite best practices being taken, if these individuals are harmed, we need a system in place to help compensate them in the event of injury.”

Wilson and Keelan have been calling for Canada to implement a vaccine injury compensation program for nearly 10 years.

In a 2011 report for the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs, the researchers noted that, “the history and experience with vaccine-related injuries in many other western countries also suggests that it is highly probable that Canada will be faced with circumstances.”

At the time, Keelan noted that a no-fault compensation program for vaccine-related injuries would not only benefit people who suffer harm, it might also give those who are waffling about whether to get a vaccine the incentive they need to go ahead.

""We want people to be vaccinated. Vaccines are incredibly safe and they are one of the most effective public health measures that we have for preventing vaccine-preventable diseases,” she said in a 2011 interview with CTVNews.ca.

“We want them to have confidence in our publicly funded vaccine.""​

In a report to the World Health Organization in December 2018, the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety wrote that no-fault vaccine injury compensation programs are considered a measure to maintain confidence in immunization programmes.",[]

""It is difficult to understand why precautions are necessary everywhere else – such as physical distancing and personal protective equipment – but not in our schools,"" Saskatchewan Teachers' Federation president Patrick Maze said in a news release.

According to the survey conducted by the Canadian Teachers' Federation (CTF), teachers are concerned about the mental health and wellbeing of students, equity supports for teaching and access to technology, the STF said.

While survey results were not broken down by province, the CTF said 1,538 STF members took part in the national study.

A total of 17,443 teachers participated in the survey.

Of the teachers surveyed, 74 per cent answered ""yes"" to a question asking if they have any concerns or questions about the mental health and well-being of their students in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Nearly 73 per cent said they have concerns or questions about getting students what they need to be successful with online instruction.

Also, 83 per cent of teachers said they are concerned about returning to school after the first phases of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In June, the provincial government released guidelines for the return to in-person classes.

""I was sick for about two weeks, I was in isolation within our home in a guest bedroom and there was about three days where I was gasping for air,"" Gullacher said.

The Gullacher family has been hit hard by COVID-19.

Paul’s father Butch is the only person from Regina to die from the virus, while his wife and kids also showed a variety of symptoms.

Gullacher’s wife, Aimee, lost her sense of taste and smell for 10 days. His daughter, Athena, had a fever and headache, but Gullacher says she showed her normal energy, and his son, Willem, had pink eye.

He says they did everything they could to avoid the virus.

""Prior to even my dad showing symptoms, we had been exercising social distancing, we were disinfecting door handles, we were doing all the things,"" Gullacher said.

Gullacher’s father had reduced kidney function and hadn’t travelled prior to contracting COVID-19.

He was admitted to hospital on March 19 and put into an induced coma a few days later. He battled the virus for weeks before dying on Apr. 10.

The 69-year-old was the fourth person in Saskatchewan to die from the virus.

""It’s funny that when my mom called me on the Thursday, I didn’t realize that I’d seen my dad for the last time already,"" Gullacher said.

The family still hasn’t been able to have a funeral for him.

""At the time it doesn’t really set in because everything is so unknown, everything is so sudden, it’s not totally clear to you how this is going to work out and you don’t think it’s going to happen to you,"" Gullacher said.

In the aftermath, Gullacher says he’s learned how precious his memories with his father have been.

""You need to cherish your family and spend time with your family now because there’s no guarantee that time is going to be available at the end,"" he said.

He’s disappointed that his father won’t be able to create more memories with his grandchildren.

""He fully unfolded as a human being when he became a grandpa, I’d never really had a ton of strong memories of my dad smiling as much as when he became a grandfather, his grandkids meant everything to him,"" Gullacher said.

Gullacher says his son believed he may have been responsible for his grandfather contracting the virus.

""All he knew is kids don’t get really sick and kids make their grandparents sick, that’s all he was seeing in media, so even though the timeline doesn’t work out for him to have infected him, he felt guilt,"" he said.

Cases in Saskatchewan have remained low during the pandemic and Regina hasn’t had an active case in almost a month.

Gullacher says his family’s experience should serve as a warning against letting your guard down.

""Because so few people have been infected here in Regina, it’s easy to believe that this is someone else’s problem, that it can’t effect us here,"" he said.

Since recovering, Gullacher says his family has continued to take precautions and remain close to home.

He also made the decision last month to donate convalescent plasma, which is being used in a clinical trail by Canadian Blood Services to prove whether antibodies can be effectively used to treat COVID-19 patients.

Gullacher hopes it can help save a life.

Guelph’s Precision Biomonitoring and Biomeme, a Philadelphia company, both usually work in DNA testing. Together, they developed a test for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The mobile testing platform can deliver results for up to nine samples in about an hour, the company said in a news release.

“This approval is the result of the dedication and commitment of our teams at Precision Biomonitoring and Biomeme, as well as ongoing collaboration with our validation partners,” Dr. Mario Thomas, CEO of Precision Biomonitoring, said in a news release. “This rapid test can now be distributed everywhere across Canada, especially in remote areas and workplaces where creating virus-free zones is vital. We can now bring the lab to the sample.”

Currently, people need to visit a testing centre and wait several days for results.

The SARS-CoV-2 Real-Time RT-PCR Test will be deployed across the country now that it's approved.

Lucy Van Doormaal, who is just three months old, has spinal muscular atrophy. Without treatment for the rare neuromuscular disorder, her parents don't think she'll make it to her first birthday.

""She just looks like any normal three-month-old, but she is eating through a feeding tube,"" Heather Kendall, Lucy's aunt, said. ""It's very different and at night she sleeps with a respirator machine.""

An antibody test when Lucy was five weeks old showed she could be a candidate for a ground-breaking gene therapy called Zolgensma. The price tag of that treatment is $3 million.

""They had heard of this treatment and it's availability, but $3 million seemed like an insane amount of money,"" Kendall said.

The single-dose treatment isn't covered under Canadian health care.

""Every day that goes by, that quality or that ability gets lost,"" Lucy's grandfather Brian Van Doormaal said. ""We need to raise that money as soon as possible.""

There are other treatments available, but Brian said they're also expensive and more long term.

The family is raising money through a GoFundMe for the treatment and to keep Lucy from getting worse. It raised $1 million in one week. Donations came in from across the country, even garnering celebrity attention from Ryan Reynolds and Jillian Harris.

""It's been very overwhelming in a very positive way,"" Lucy's mother Laura Van Doormaal said. ""We are uplifted by the community's response to Lucy's story.""

Kitchener's Play-a-Latte Cafe has also launched a fundraising campaign, selling cinnamon buns to raise money for the treatment.

""We heard her story and, just as parents, we felt for the family and wanted to do something, so this was a way for us to give back,"" owner Heather Lynn Patel said.

Kaysen Martin, an Edmonton toddler, has also been diagnosed with the disorder. Her family has also launched an online campaign to raise money for treatment.

Dino Givani Scrementi is the owner of Dino’s Athletic Direct, an athletic apparel shop on Wyndham Street North in downtown Guelph. He sells all the professional brands, like the NHL, NFL and NBA, as well as some local brands including the University of Guelph, OUA Gryphon’s.

Scrementi said the pandemic and the forced closure of his store has impacted him both emotionally and financially.

He’s being selling athletic apparel in the downtown for nearly 40 years.

“I couldn’t see anybody and I am all about love, people, hugging,” he said.

As many retailers shifted to online orders and curbside pick-up, Scrementi admits he’s old school.

“I am not an online presence store I am a people store,"" he said. ""You want something, come meet me, come see me.”

He’s very well known in the downtown neighbourhood.

“They call me Dizzy Dino, they call me Dill Pickle,"" he said.

The Dizzy Dino nickname refers to the clutter in his store. It’s a style that he says has worked for years and he isn’t willing to change.

“It’s like a mystery, people come in, they never know what they’ll find,"" Scrementi said. ""Sometimes they find stuff I didn’t even know I had.”

Scrementi says his landlord did give him a break during the pandemic. During the forced closure, he started working multiple other jobs in order to pay the bills.

The jobs included serving food at Osmow's, a Mediterranean restaurant next door to his shop. He's still working their part time.

“I’ve been working with Dino for the last three months, best guy, hard working guy,” Osmow’s owner Shah Rukh said.

The doors to Dino’s Shop are now open, along with many other retailers in the city. But with professional sports still on hiatus, he says his business continues to struggle.

Typically, the Blue Jays would be playing right now and their gear would be very popular this time of year.

“Football’s coming up. I don’t know if that’s gonna happen, but I hope it does because that’s huge for business,"" he said.

The 70-year-old says he’ll do whatever it takes to keep his doors open, even if that includes continuing his part time work at other businesses. He doesn’t plan on retiring for at least 10 years.

“As long as you make ends meet, that’s what me mother always said,"" he said. I don’t need anything else, I don’t need anything fancy.”

Dino also runs a children’s day camp every summer called ""Dino’s Sneakers 'N Sandwiches Camp.""

Barb Low has known Dino for 25 years. Her now 30-year-old son attending his camp as a child.

“He’s one of the most amazing people I’ve met,” she said.

This year, the camp is on hold due to lack of funds and other the pandemic related issues.",[]

Representatives for the municipalities, including Waterloo Region, said the municipalities need at least $10 billion to help with COVID-19 pandemic recovery. The money would prevent tax increases and service cuts, according to the municipalities.

Region of Waterloo Chair Karen Redman, Toronto Mayor John Tory and Guelph Mayor Cam Guthrie all expressed frustration on Monday at the lack of action from other levels of government. Guthrie is also chair of the Large Urban Mayors' Caucus of Ontario (LUMCO).

Redman said the region is looking at a year-end deficit of up to $17 million.

""Our choices will be to increase taxes or cut front line services and front line municipality staff,"" Redman said.

Without funding from the upper levels of government, Redman said the region, and other municipalities, will face some tough choices. The LUMCO said municipalities could be forced to cut family supports, reduce transit services and close parks without the funding.

""As the economy recovers, increasing property tax will happen at a time that people are least able to pay,"" she said. ""Strong municipalities will be key to facilitate local economic recovery.""

“There are also more cases with unknown sources now than there was a week ago.”

""Only the RCMP, and Alberta Health has the authority to enforce how visitors comply with physical distancing rules, but we want to be clear: from what we observed on the weekend – the sheer number of people, enforcement alone is not the solution.""

“I was just shocked,"" Greg Dickson said. ""There were so many people walking by that they were stepping on your toes. I’ve seen the beach busy before, never like this. It was just a crush.""

The town said it has asked the province for guidance on how to continue to operate while keeping its public spaces safe.

""The public has been told they can form family cohorts of up to 15, to stay-cation within the province, and to support their local economies,"" the statement reads. ""With this, larger crowds at destinations like Sylvan Lake (and we’re aware of many other locations), are bound to happen.""

Premier Jason Kenney addressed crowding during his relaunch update on Monday afternoon.

""That kind of conduct could jeopardize the progress that we have made,"" Kenney said. ""We are not done with COVID, but we are learning how to live with it and our future success depends entirely on not letting our guard down.""

Saturday report by Iran's Civil Aviation Organization came six months after Ukraine International Airlines Flight PS752 was shot down by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.

The Jan. 8 crash killed 176 people, including 55 Canadian citizens, 30 permanent residents and dozens of others with connections to Canada. Thirteen were residents of Alberta's capital city.

The report detailed a series of moments where the shootdown of PS752 by two Revolutionary Guard missiles could have been avoided, starting with the surface-to-air missile battery that targeted the Boeing 737-800 having been relocated and not properly reoriented.

Those manning the missile battery also could not communicate with their command centre, the report said. They also misidentified the civilian flight as a threat and opened fire twice without getting approval from ranking officials.

""If each had not arisen, the aircraft would not have been targeted,"" the report said.

But for a family member waiting for answers in Edmonton, the report doesn't provide closure.

""We don't trust any investigation, any report prepared or conducted by Iranian regime,"" Javad Soleimani told CTV News Edmonton.

His wife, 29-year-old Elnaz Nabiyi, had been one of the Edmonton residents on the plane.

Soleimani pointed to Iran's days-long denial of any involvement in the crash immediately after it happened in demonstrating the need for an independent investigation by international authorities.

""Do you trust Iranian regime or not?"" Soleimani asked.

""We know that they are working hard, but we expect more from the Canadian government and also international community.""

The plane's black box heads to Paris on July 20.

Western intelligence officials and analysts believe Iran shot down the aircraft with a Russian-made Tor system, known to NATO as the SA-15. The system is mounted on a tracked vehicle and carries a radar and a pack of eight missiles.

The report did not say why the Guard moved the air defence system, but noted the Ukrainian flight had done nothing out of the ordinary up until the missile launch, with its transponder and other data being broadcast.

An Iranian government spokesperson said in June six people involved had been arrested, three of whom at the time had been released on bail.

Global Affairs Canada spokesman Sylvain Leclerc did not comment directly on the report's findings, but reiterated calls by the foreign affairs minister for a fully and transparent investigation.

""Canada and its partners will continue working to ensure transparency, accountability, justice, compensation and closure for the families of the victims of this terrible tragedy,"" Leclerc said in a statement.

Soleimani is waiting.

""Discovering the truth and prosecuting and punishing all those people responsible for this atrocity is our first priority.""

The plane's black box heads to Paris on July 20.

Western intelligence officials and analysts believe Iran shot down the aircraft with a Russian-made Tor system, known to NATO as the SA-15. The system is mounted on a tracked vehicle and carries a radar and a pack of eight missiles.

The report did not say why the Guard moved the air defence system, but noted the Ukrainian flight had done nothing out of the ordinary up until the missile launch, with its transponder and other data being broadcast.

An Iranian government spokesperson said in June six people involved had been arrested, three of whom at the time had been released on bail.

Global Affairs Canada spokesman Sylvain Leclerc did not comment directly on the report's findings, but reiterated calls by the foreign affairs minister for a fully and transparent investigation.

""Canada and its partners will continue working to ensure transparency, accountability, justice, compensation and closure for the families of the victims of this terrible tragedy,"" Leclerc said in a statement.

Soleimani is waiting.

""Discovering the truth and prosecuting and punishing all those people responsible for this atrocity is our first priority.""

398,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/trudeau-morneau-apologize-for-not-recusing-themselves-from-we-decision-1.5021910?autoPlay=true,"Trudeau, Morneau apologize for not recusing themselves from WE decision",['Rachel Aiello'],2020-07-13 10:57:00-04:00,"OTTAWA -- Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Finance Minister Bill Morneau have issued apologizes for not removing themselves from conversations about granting WE Charity a sole-sourced contract to run the now-halted $900 million COVID-19 student volunteer program, given their personal connections to the organization.

""I made a mistake in not recusing myself immediately from the discussions, given our family's history, and I'm sincerely sorry about not having done that,"" Trudeau said.

Trudeau said he is sorry for how the rollout of the Canada Student Service Grant program went, and he regrets the “unnecessary controversy” it’s caused.

“The mistake that we made was on me, and I take responsibility for it. We will continue to work very, very hard to deliver the program,” Trudeau said, speaking about the ongoing controversy during his first national address on the federal government’s latest COVID-19 response plans from Rideau Cottage in two weeks.

Over the last two weeks, the controversy surrounding the government’s decision to allow the WE Charity to deliver a now-halted $900 million COVID-19 student grant program has grown considerably.

WE Charity backed away from administering the grants amid questions about Trudeau’s involvement, but also in light of a series of news stories about racialized former employees’ experiences with the organization.

The ethics commissioner also launched a probe into a potential conflict of interest with Trudeau’s decision to grant the organization the contract to administer the program, given the prime minister’s close personal ties to the charity.

“This was my mistake. This was me not stepping back from an organization that I should have known to not get involved with, even as prime minister, and allow the public service and non-connected ministers to move forward on delivering this program,” said Trudeau on Monday.

'I DIDN'T KNOW THE DETAILS'

Last week WE Charity confirmed that, over the years, Trudeau’s wife, mother, and brother have received a range of payments amounting to around $300,000 for speaking at WE events. Sophie Gregoire Trudeau is an ambassador with the organization and hosts a mental health podcast under its name. She received a ""one-time speaking honorarium"" of $1,400 for participating in a youth event in 2012, before Trudeau became leader of the Liberal Party.

On Monday, the prime minister faced a series of questions from reporters about whether he knew his family members got paid by WE, and said that, while he was aware of their professional speaking roles, he was unaware of just how much money his family members received.

""I have known, obviously, for many years that my mom has been an extraordinary advocate for mental health issues, a professional public speaker who works with a range of different organizations. Obviously I knew she worked with WE, I didn't know the details of how much she was getting paid by various organizations but I should have and I deeply regret that,” Trudeau said on Monday.

Trudeau said he also regrets bringing his mother, Margaret Trudeau, into the controversy, saying that it was “unfair.”

“I should have been thoughtful enough to recuse myself completely from any discussions around WE because of these connections from the very beginning, and I did not and I'm very sorry about that,” he said.

MORNEAU ALSO APOLOGIZES

Last week Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s office confirmed his daughters have connections to the charity and he also did not recuse himself from the decision-making table. The finance minister’s daughter Clare has spoken at WE events, and his daughter Grace is currently employed by WE Charity.

On Friday, Morneau also apologized for not removing himself from discussions about the student grant program.

“Given the fact that my daughter works for the organization in an unrelated branch, I now realize I should have in order to avoid any perception of conflict. I apologize for not doing so, and moving forward, I will recuse myself from any future discussions related to WE,” Morneau said in a statement.

STUDENTS LEFT IN LIMBO

Initially, WE Charity was selected to set up placements and administer grants to students and new graduates for their volunteer work this summer.

With the program halted, thousands of students are now in limbo without summer jobs and, for now, no chance for volunteer grants to help cover costs like fall tuition.

The grant to post-secondary students and recent graduates was designed to provide one-time payments of up to $5,000 for volunteering in pandemic-related programs, depending on the number of hours worked. For every 100 hours spent, a student will receive $1,000.

On Monday, Trudeau repeated his regret that his error in judgment has resulted in students hoping to help their communities being left in limbo instead.

“Because of the mistake I made in not withdrawing from these conversations when the public service recommended we move forward with the WE organization, it has gotten a little slower for young people who are facing a difficult time right now, to be able to get involved in their communities and make a difference,” Trudeau said.

Now, Trudeau says the government is looking to Service Canada as a potential avenue to run the program, despite doubling down on the statement that the public service had initially suggested outsourcing the program to WE Charity.

OPPOSITION PARTIES DIG IN

The Conservatives have written to the RCMP suggesting they look into the matter, while two House of Commons studies are underway into various aspects of the controversy.

Now, the opposition is looking to convene a third committee probe, with the intent to uncover as many documents as possible and aiming to call and a slate of cabinet ministers to testify.

Trudeau said a series of cabinet ministers will be testifying this week about the affair, and if he gets an invitation, he will consult with his House of Commons leadership team about attending.

“Obviously, the opposition parties have their job to do and they will keep doing it. I have my job to do as well, which is to make sure that Canadians are well supported through this pandemic and we have an economic restart that goes smoothly,” Trudeau said.

“Revelations that Justin Trudeau’s family was paid to speak at events for an organization, which later received a $900 million sole-source contract, are deeply disturbing,” said Conservative MP and ethics critic Michael Barrett in a statement about the push for a third committee study. “This new information has raised concerns about the way this Liberal government operates and whether the appropriate processes are in place to avoid conflicts of interest,” said Barrett.

Critics have pointed to the WE Charity affair as the latest in a series of ethical oversights Trudeau has had over his time as prime minister.

Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion’s ongoing investigation is now the third ethics investigation Trudeau has been subjected to, with the two previous times — his trip to the Aga Khan’s private island and in relation to the SNC-Lavalin prosecution — resulting in findings that Trudeau had breached federal ethics law. In both cases Trudeau apologized for his improper behaviour, and both times he said he had learned his lesson.

“I feel like it's Groundhog Day. We've seen so many instances where the prime minister gets caught… seems outraged that anyone could question him, and then as the scandal deepens then he apologizes,” said NDP MP and ethics critic Charlie Angus in an interview on CTV News Channel. He said what is most concerning is that no one around Trudeau seemed to try to stop him from getting involved given his close personal ties to the organization.

Angus said the controversy should have never happened and if the proper standards and protocols were in place, it wouldn’t have. He called it “one of the stupidest scandals in Canadian history.”

Asked if he was worried that the controversy puts his minority government on unstable footing after months of positive polling numbers, Trudeau said on Monday that he trusts Canadians will make judgments on his leadership based on the pandemic response as a whole.

“When we look at these things, proximity to the prime minister has an impact… The fact that it includes family members makes it very problematic for the prime minister,” said pollster Nik Nanos in an interview on CTV News Channel.

WE CHARITY WEIGHS IN

In a new statement on their website, WE Charity co-founders Craig Kielburger and Marc Kielburger say they want to “set the record straight” about the entire affair. The brothers wrote about how their organization was qualified to stickhandle the administration of the Canada Student Service Grant program, which had 35,000 applicants a week after launching. But, as their statement notes, “the program was immediately enmeshed in controversy,” and handed back over to the government along with the funding.

“WE has not profited from this contract in any way,” said the Keilburgers, adding that the last two weeks have been “extremely difficult.”

“The charity’s integrity and purpose has been called into question. It has had direct impacts on our staff, supporters, and beneficiaries. We have made mistakes that we sincerely regret,” says the statement.",[]
399,ctvnews,http://edmonton.ctvnews.ca/some-fans-say-the-lure-of-parties-will-be-strong-as-postponed-nhl-season-resumes-1.5021605,Some fans say the lure of parties will be strong as postponed NHL season resumes,['Rob Drinkwater'],2020-07-13 05:28:00-06:00,"EDMONTON -- As hockey fans gear up for a truncated season to begin next month, some in Canada's two “hub cities” say the temptation to celebrate - and flout physical distancing guidelines - may prove too great.

“I can't say no to a good time,” said Edmonton Oilers fan Jeet Jermana. “I'd be hard-pressed not to jump into a big party.”

On Friday, the NHL board of governors and NHL Players' Association said they had ratified the return-to-play plan, paving the way for the league to resume its pandemic-hit season later this summer.

Toronto and Edmonton were also officially unveiled as hub cities where all games will be played, beginning Aug. 1. Training camps start Monday in the 24 cities with teams still in the running for the Stanley Cup, including six in Canada.

In 2017, when the Oilers nearly advanced to the Western Conference final, Jermana was among the thousands of fans who partied in Ford Hall at Rogers Place arena and in bars along the popular Whyte Avenue district.

But with COVID-19 this year, where teams will play in empty arenas, Jermana said he'll likely watch more games at home, maybe with just a few friends.

That is, he said, until the Oilers advance and he and other fans won't be able to resist going out.

“Once it becomes the 'real playoffs' I think more and more the momentum will grab,” he said.

Matt Black of Hotel X Toronto, located west of the city centre where multiple media outlets have reported that several teams will be based, said the prospect of any accommodation for celebratory fan gatherings, even outdoors, seems unlikely.

Nevertheless, Black said he expects citywide excitement will be palpable, even with empty arenas.

“You look back to those scenes of Jurassic Park and Maple Leaf Square and all of that ... it would be great for people to be able to get together again but you just need to make sure that you're doing it in a safe manner,” said Black.

The players themselves aren't to have any contact with the general public.

Dr. Vinita Dubey, Toronto's associate medical health officer, said in an emailed statement that players and staff arriving from abroad will also have to serve a modified 14-day quarantine as well as undergo rigorous screening and daily testing protocols, wear masks in indoor settings, physically distance and wash hands often.

An Edmonton police spokesperson said the service wouldn't be able to comment over the weekend on what sorts of preparations they might make for crowds when the season resumes.

Geoff Grimble with the City of Edmonton said the city's civic events management team would likely discuss the issue during a scheduled meeting on Monday.

“The City of Edmonton's first priority is public safety and we'll continue to follow the advice and requirements of the Chief Medical Officer of Health to ensure fans, players, coaches and staff remain healthy,” Grimble said.

Oilers fan Brendan McLeod admitted he may be lured to a street celebration when - not if - his team advances, but said he still wants to maintain physical distancing.

“We have to get through this together or else it's not going to change,” said McLeod.

But Shadi Merhej, who said he enjoys both hockey and the Oilers, noted the sport doesn't have quite as strong attraction for him in the summer.

“It's daylight 'til 11 o'clock. You don't want to spend half your day watching hockey,” Merhej explained.

“I'd rather go for a bike ride, or rollerblade or golf.”

400,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/110-days-81-addresses-to-the-nation-what-pm-trudeau-s-covid-19-messaging-reveals-1.5019550?autoPlay=true,110 days. 81 addresses to the nation. What PM Trudeau's COVID-19 messaging reveals,['Rachel Aiello'],2020-07-13 07:15:00-04:00,"OTTAWA -- It became a scene most Canadians could recognize: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau emerges from Rideau Cottage and descends six steps to a podium, notes in hand. This was how the prime minister chose to speak to the country, day in and day out between March and July. In his morning updates, COVID-19 aid packages amounting to hundreds of billions of dollars were unveiled and public health advisories were driven home, but what else did Trudeau have to say?

CTVNews.ca has analyzed the 81 national addresses and following media availabilities that Trudeau held during the 110 days between entering a 14-day self-isolation, on March 12, to his June 29 announcement that, going forward, he would only convene the Rideau Cottage updates when he had big news to share.

The day after Trudeau entered quarantine on account of his wife Sophie having symptoms that were soon confirmed to be from COVID-19, the prime minister began what quickly became a daily routine: addressing the nation from Rideau Cottage, his family’s temporary home on the grounds of Rideau Hall.

Those morning addresses, mostly from the grounds of Rideau Hall, became a seven-day-a-week ritual, with few days off in the first two months. Then, as the public health crisis entered into the initial phase of reopenings, the routine was eased, with no press conferences on weekends and eventually only a few times a week.

Analyzing the transcripts of his English-language remarks from all those Rideau Cottage updates, as well as the few offsite, CTVNews.ca identified his commonly used phrases and terms, as well as his go-to nouns and adjectives, before asking political communication experts and a linguist to assess the words he was using to deliver his messages, and whether they were effective.

WHAT WORDS DID HE USE?

CTVNews.ca’s analysis found that the most repeated phrase was “right across the country,” followed by variations of “keep Canadians safe.” Others that topped the list included “make sure,” and “move forward.”

Speaking to the use of “keep Canadians safe,” former lead speechwriter for Trudeau, Jeni Armstrong, said she thinks it was a great choice.

“It's simple, it's direct, it appeals to the kind of worries that we all have about our families… It’s memorable and like I said, it is the kind of reassurance that I think people were seeking especially in the early days,” said Armstrong, who is now an instructor with the Clayton H. Riddell Graduate Program in Political Management at Carleton University after working as the director of communications for Finance Minister Bill Morneau and helping to author the Liberal Party’s 2019 and 2015 federal election platforms.

Other phrases that appeared often included: “long-term care”; “continue to work”; “public health”; “social distancing”; “people need”; “staying home”; and “coming weeks.”

CTVNews.ca also searched for the frequency of other key words, which may not necessarily be the words said the most. The word “recognize” came up 183 times over the 81 addresses, “virus” was said 127 times, “parliament” got named 108 times and “unprecedented” was said 63 times. Further, “racism” was said 53 times, “China” was found in the transcripts 45 times, and “budget” just nine times.

Armstrong said Trudeau has a personal verbal habit where he builds formulas for responding to questions, which could explain the frequency of the word “recognize”—which often was how he started an answer to reporters’ questions: “we recognize…”

“He'll often say—and this has been true for a number of years… ‘Canadians expect us to ABC, and we are doing just that.’ It's kind of a formula that he has,” she said.

Trudeau’s go-to verbs, in order of frequency: “need”; “get”; “make”; “continue”’ “know”; “keep”; “ensure”; “want”; “think”; and “help.”

As for adjectives, he most often said: “many”; “sure”; “safe”; “able”; “right”; “important”; “different”; “new”; “Canadian”; and “possible.”

Linguist Shana Poplack told CTVNews.ca that Trudeau’s word choices show he wants to evoke he is in charge and has things under control.

“If this is the message he's trying to relay, those words are consistent,” said Poplack, who is the director of the Sociolinguistics Laboratory at the University of Ottawa and Canada Research Chair in Linguistics.

Poplack also said what stood out to her were the phrases that didn’t crack the top of the list of things Trudeau said, despite them being so frequently said in society writ large these days, including “in these uncertain times,” and “the new normal.”

“That does not tie in with the message that he's trying to get across,” she said, suggesting it’s possible he didn’t want to highlight the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“That's why we see “ensure,” we see the word “safe,” reappearing... He also has to convince us that he's on top of it,” she said.

BUILT UP LEXICON OF PHRASES

What the frequent repetition of these and other phrases indicates, experts said, is that Trudeau and his relatively small team of speechwriters had developed a dictionary of key phrases to reinforce and repeat in his prepared remarks. The messaging was first built into his speeches, but after their near-daily repeating, they became a reflexive part of his vocabulary when responding to questions, too.

Poplack said these are referred to as “fixed expressions,” some of which are commonly used by all, others are created, as seen with terms for aid programs to establish a clear message. The use of such phrases can be seen across political lines and in past prime ministers’ speaking habits as well.

“For Paul Martin it was ‘let me be clear,’ for Stephen Harper it was ‘obviously’,” said Garry Keller, vice president at StrategyCorp and a past adviser to former prime minister Stephen Harper.

Armstrong said the repetition of the COVID-19 benefit-specific phrases also helped to build up familiarity with new programs. “Emergency Response Benefit” — referring to the Canada Emergency Response Benefit of $2,000 a month to out of wok Canadians — was in the top-five most said three-word phrases, and “wage subsidy” was in the top five two-word phrases spoken.

“What he's attempting to do there is to get people familiar with the name of any program… When you're working on that, repetition is your friend,” she said.

STRUCTURE SUITS THE PM

Strategic communication professional and political commentator Scott Reid said that the formula of “political communication by dint of news conference” has become a go-to form of communicating COVID-19 crisis updates around the world and across Canada, where provincial premiers have all taken a similar approach.

The format plays to Trudeau’s strengths, Reid said, contrasting the PM’s comfort and skill delivering on-message remarks without relying on rote responses to the communication approach of other world leaders including U.S. President Donald Trump, who Reid said failed at being consistent in his messaging and shut down his routine of regular press conferences long before Trudeau did.

“A crisis such as this, which has created a made-for-television daily news conference, it's almost perfectly built for his [Trudeau’s] talent set and instincts because he has a preternatural sense of self… He's extraordinarily conscious of his presentation and of his representation to the public, and that serves him extremely well in this situation,” said Reid, who also worked as an adviser to former prime minister Paul Martin.

Keller noted that opting to keep Trudeau’s addresses to the high-level details and letting a cadre of ministers follow after him to take reporters’ more detailed questions also meant that Trudeau was usually out of the spotlight by midday, rather than facing reporters and opposition MPs multiple throughout the entire day.

“It quite frankly has worked for them,” said Keller, adding that all of the opposition parties found it challenging to compete with.

BOOST TO APPROVAL RATING

The more frequent prime ministerial appearances also had positive returns on his approval ratings, according to CTV News’ pollster and Chair of Nanos Research, Nik Nanos.

“What I'll call the ‘relentless chain of press conferences’ … they've effectively done a bit of a reset on his brand,” Nanos said. “There's been a complete reset on Justin Trudeau’s personal brand. His brand is now strong again— it's not as strong as the honeymoon [phase]— but it's strong and the Liberal numbers are strong.”

Nanos Research asks Canadians weekly whether they feel the various federal party leaders have the qualities of a good political leader, and Trudeau’s trend line shows that Canadians surveyed are viewing him more positively since March than they have in the entirety of the last four years.

KEY MOMENTS LIKE 'SPEAKING MOISTLY'

These routine speeches also provided several key moments over the initial four months of the COVID-19 pandemic, from Trudeau’s infamous “speaking moistly” slip-up when describing how the coronavirus can transmit through droplets, to his conspicuously long pause when asked about Trump's handling of anti-racism protesters in the United States.

While the combination of “speaking” and “moistly” was swiftly removed from Trudeau’s lexicon, Armstrong said even when such moments inspire mockery, they are generally well-received.

“That ended up being really funny at a time when people needed to laugh right? And he's, he's very much able to laugh at himself in moments like that,” she said of Trudeau. She cited the first time that he spoke directly to children as another notable moment.

“Kids are an overlooked constituency… They're not even spoken to directly by people in power very often. But they are feeling and experiencing this moment, in a very, very profound way, and I as a mom, and as a citizen, and as a communicator, I really love that he acknowledged that,” she said.

WHY THE ADDRESSES ENDED

By the time Trudeau said he’d be cutting down his regular press conferences, the announcements he was making had already become incremental and small, while the questions he faced were predominately about non-COVID-19 news.

The political communication experts CTVNews.ca spoke with largely agreed that, while the near-daily addresses were key in reassuring Canadians that the federal government was on top of the rapidly unfolding crisis early on, continuing to come out and face reporters was having diminishing positive returns for the prime minister as other big news stories began to bubble up, notably the ongoing WE Charity controversy.

Another reason some suggest could explain why Trudeau’s team opted to wind down what some critics call “the morning show”? Canadians had begun tuning them out.

“I think that they've rightly recognized that should there be a second wave, should there be a need to start communicating again on a daily basis in a way that was happening in March for example, they don't want to kind of burn the goodwill and the listening potential of the audience by continuing to speak every day if there's not something new to share,” said Kate Harrison, vice president at Summa Strategies Canada and Conservative political commentator.

WILL SEE THIS FORMAT AGAIN

Going forward, the experts interviewed said to expect the format to resume should there be a new resurgence in the virus’ spread.

Reid said that if there is a second wave of COVID-19 infections, the public and the media has come to expect the prime minister will be front-and-centre.

“This is now how it is done. It has quietly become a matter of consensus among political leaders, media, public audiences, that this is how this gets prosecuted, and so it will recur, and it will overwhelmingly benefit political leaders who are capable of commanding the podium and follow those very simple rules of being thematic, being consistent, demonstrating empathy,” Reid said.

Methodology: For this project we used the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) in Python to run a word frequency and N-gram analysis on the transcripts. An N-gram analysis counts the occurrences of two or more words together. The code stripped the transcripts to leave only those words spoken by Trudeau in English.

401,ctvnews,http://edmonton.ctvnews.ca/n-w-t-ignored-in-alberta-monitoring-suspension-despite-agreement-leaked-emails-1.5021598,N.W.T. ignored in Alberta monitoring suspension despite agreement: leaked emails,['Bob Weber'],2020-07-13 05:19:00-06:00,"EDMONTON -- Alberta suspended environmental monitoring for oilsands companies without notifying the Northwest Territories, despite a legally binding agreement to do so.

The omission is revealed in a series of emails between the two governments obtained by The Canadian Press.

“We have been made aware ... that the Alberta Energy Regulator has indefinitely suspended several environmental monitoring requirements for major oilsands producers,” wrote Erin Kelly, the N.W.T.'s deputy environment minister to her Alberta counterpart.

“Do you have any information that can be shared about this?”

The May 15 email was written more than a week after Alberta's regulator suspended a wide array of monitoring over what it said were public-health concerns raised by the COVID-19 pandemic. Kelly said her government learned about the move from news reports.

Ten days later, Kelly had not received a response.

“This is concerning to many N.W.T. residents, who still maintain subsistence lifestyles,” she wrote May 25.

“With COVID-19 we have even more residents relying on food harvested from the land and it is almost certain that concerns related to reduced monitoring upstream will be brought up during (the upcoming legislative) session.”

Monitoring is expected to resume Wednesday.

The N.W.T. is downstream from the oilsands and in 2015 signed an agreement with Alberta that spelled out clear responsibilities on information-sharing, notification and consultation for cross-boundary waters.

In her second email, Kelly points to that deal.

“The (territory) has not been informed of or discussed new changes to monitoring as per (the agreement). I have yet to receive a response to my last email.”

An Alberta Environment and Parks email shows Kelly's second note provoked an “urgent” request within the department for a response to her concerns.

In answer to a request for an explanation for the lack of consultation, Alberta's United Conservative government provided a one-sentence email.

“There have been ongoing discussions and information-sharing with the N.W.T. on the status of ambient water quality monitoring at sites referenced in the Alberta-N.W.T. Bilateral Agreement throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, starting in March,” wrote Alberta Environment spokesman John Muir.

Joslyn Oosenbrug, spokeswoman for the N.W.T. Environment Department, said several meetings were held in June to address the territory's concerns.

“Alberta has committed to sharing information and discussing any changes to monitoring,” she wrote in an email. “Communication is ongoing, and includes emails and letters exchanged at the deputy minister and ministerial level.”

However, the territory wants a stronger voice in managing water flowing into its land. It wants a seat on several committees that determine how waters will be monitored “to ensure downstream interests are represented,” Oosenbrug wrote.

Marlin Schmidt, environment critic for Alberta's Opposition New Democrats, said the snub showed a “lack of respect.”

“It's really disappointing to me to see the government of Alberta is taking its relationship with other Canadians so lightly right now,” he said.

“When our government is complaining about the poor treatment that we're allegedly getting from other Canadians, we should be treating (them) with the respect with which we expect to be treated.”

The N.W.T. isn't the only interested group that wasn't consulted about the suspensions. First Nations in the oilsands area, environmental groups, Alberta's chief scientist and the scientific consultants who perform monitoring work all say they were left out of the decision.

The government has said the move was made in response to concerns from the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers about operators not being able to meet certain monitoring requirements while complying with COVID-19 orders.

Alberta has yet to release work plans or budget for this year's field season of a joint federal-provincial program responsible for environmental monitoring outside various oilsands leases. Industry, which funds the efforts, has been lobbying heavily for a less extensive and cheaper plan.

404,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/iran-report-blaming-mistakes-for-military-s-downing-of-ps752-dismissed-1.5020868,Iran report blaming mistakes for military's downing of PS752 dismissed,['Lee Berthiaume'],2020-07-12 07:07:00-04:00,"OTTAWA -- A representative of Canadian families and loved ones killed in Iran's shootdown of a Ukrainian airliner in January says a new report blaming a misaligned missile battery and other mistakes by the Iranian military for the tragedy underscores the need for an independent investigation.

The report released late Saturday by Iran's Civil Aviation Organization comes months after Ukraine International Airlines Flight PS752 was shot down by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.

The Jan. 8 crash killed 176 people, including 55 Canadian citizens, 30 permanent residents and dozens of others with connections to Canada.

Iranian authorities initially denied responsibility, only changing course days later after Western nations presented extensive evidence that Iran had shot down the plane. Iran has since been accused of stonewalling efforts to investigate the full circumstances around the crash.

Hamed Esmaeilion, a Toronto dentist whose wife Parisa and nine-year-old daughter Reera died on the plane, reiterated those allegations on Sunday following release of the civil aviation report.

""It raises more questions and more questions,"" Esmaeilion told The Canadian Press in an interview. ""It's very hard to believe this story.""

The shootdown happened at Tehran's main airport the same night Iran launched a ballistic-missile attack targeting U.S. soldiers in Iraq, its response to the American drone strike that killed Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad on Jan. 3.

At the time, Iranian troops were bracing for a U.S. counterstrike. The civil aviation report does not acknowledge that, only saying a change in the ""alertness level of Iran's air defence"" allowed previously scheduled air traffic to resume.

The report detailed a series of moments where the shootdown of PS752 by two Revolutionary Guard missiles could have been avoided, starting with the surface-to-air missile battery that targeted the Boeing 737-800 having been relocated and not properly reoriented.

Those manning the missile battery also could not communicate with their command centre, the report said. They also misidentified the civilian flight as a threat and opened fire twice without getting approval from ranking officials.

""If each had not arisen, the aircraft would not have been targeted,"" the report said.

Western intelligence officials and analysts believe Iran shot down the aircraft with a Russian-made Tor system, known to NATO as the SA-15. The system is mounted on a tracked vehicle and carries a radar and a pack of eight missiles.

The report did not say why the Guard moved the air defence system, but noted the Ukrainian flight had done nothing out of the ordinary up until the missile launch, with its transponder and other data being broadcast.

""At the time of firing the first missile, the aircraft was flying at a normal altitude and trajectory,"" the report said.

Esmaeilion, one of the founders of a group demanding justice for the victims of PS752, said one question that stood out to him after reading the report was why that particular flight was targeted and not several others that had taken off a short time earlier.

He suggested the report was yet another attempt by Iran to paint the tragedy as a mistake without allowing a full investigation.

""It's very hard to believe this story and this is the only scenario that makes it an accident,"" he said. ""It was wrongly calibrated 107 degrees, but why were the other eight planes safe? Why? It was calibrated wrong just for PS752?""

The report put the blame entirely on the crew of the missile battery. Six people believed to be involved in the incident have been arrested, a government spokesman reportedly said in June. He said at the time three had been released on bail while the other three remained held.

The report's release comes ahead of the long-awaited handover of PS752's voice and data recorders. Iran has promised but failed to hand over the so-called black boxes for months, but now says it will send them to France on July 20.

Global Affairs Canada spokesman Sylvain Leclerc did not directly respond to questions about the civil aviation's report, and instead pointed to Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne's past calls for Iran to conduct a full and transparent investigation.

Canada will continue to actively work with its international partners to hold the Iranian regime to account and to ensure Iran follows through on its commitments,"" Leclerc said in a statement.

""Canada and its partners will continue working to ensure transparency, accountability, justice, compensation and closure for the families of the victims of this terrible tragedy.""

The mural was done by Amos Kajner-Nonnekes of DESIGN, et cetera and his team.

“It adds a little pop of colour and whimsy to Old Strathcona,” said Kajner-Nonnekes. “We kind of specialize in enhancing spaces and turning spaces into people-friendly spaces through a little bit of urban design, some public art”

The mural is a reference to the classic, and infamous, Rainbow Road level in Mario Kart, something Kajner-Nonnekes wanted to evoke with the design.

“It’s that new whimsical level and it’s colourful and poppy and so cool. We wanted to bring that experience to Whyte Avenue.”

It occupies the Spur Line Alley north of Whyte Avenue between 104 Street and 105 Street.

“Something you don’t see very often is a mural on the ground, you can kind of walk through and see yourself going down this rainbow road,” said Kajner-Nonnekes.

The alley was originally changed from a parking area for vehicles to a public plaza by the city as part of the Whyte Ave Alley Project.

The city previously had some designs on the ground in the alley but they “didn’t really fill out the roadway” according to Kajner-Nonnekes.

The project took around 35 gallons of paint to complete and was delayed because of the uncertain Edmonton weather.

“We’ve been painting for the last 36 hours… my back and knees are sore but it’s been great.”

Kajner-Nonnekes also said that this project will be good for Whyte Avenue as people start to venture out again during the pandemic.

“Adding all this colour and all this space it really invited people in and invites them to experience Whyte Avenue in a safe and distanced way and have a new experience.”

The new mural was commissioned by the Old Strathcona Business Association and is something that Kajner-Nonnekes said has the Whyte Avenue feel.

“It’s always something a little weird, a little whimsical, and to come around the corner and see this magnificent pop of colour in an alleyway, something so Old Strathcona about that and so special.”",[]

Construction started in the fall of 2019 and is expected to be completed in the fall of 2022.

The project will add one lane of traffic in each direction as well as two noise walls.

The approximately 18 k.m. stretch being developed is between Gateway Boulevard and just north of Whitemud Drive.

“Depending on the section of the roadway they say there’s 60,000 vehicles a day but as high as 80,000,” said Darrell Trapp the project director with Carmacks. “I’ve even heard as high as 100,000 a day depending on the time of year and the section of roadway.”

Work requiring lane closure is being done at night to minimize the impact to traffic according to Trapp.

“Those works usually start after eight o’clock and we’ll have the roadway cleaned up and clear by before six o’clock a.m.,” said Trapp.

“Traffic counts are up so it’s a little bit more of a challenge to again work, accessing and egressing onto the Henday and you know keeping our guys safe with all this traffic.”

Trapp said there have been some incidents where barriers have been struck. Recent rainfall has also had an impact on work, but Trapp said the construction schedule isn’t “in jeopardy yet.”

“We anticipated being a lot further along with the roadworks than we are today.”

In the next few months Trapp expects there to be a third, new, driving lane available for northbound traffic.

“The northbound lanes literally could be put into service once the paint lines all the signs and everything are put up.”

Following that, crews would begin work on the southbound lanes, bridgework will continue throughout the winter.

“When we do the concrete deck overlays the traffic will all be put onto one bridge so both directions will be put onto the sister bridge,” said Trapp.

“Truck loads and the cars actually do flex the bridges and so the bridges bounce in a sense and that would weaken the concrete when it’s curing.”

It says the investigation will help determine if Alberta is adequately equipped to deal with a second wave of coronavirus, should one occur in Canada.

""A strong, coordinated response can help save lives, prevent wide-scale spread of disease and help jobs and the economy bounce back more quickly,"" the province says in a release.

The review is expected to look at:

Health system response

Economic response

Governance and decision-making

Procurement

Engagement with other governments and stakeholders

Communications

The government says the review will be similar in nature to the ones performed in response to the 2016 Horse River fire in Fort McMurray, the 2013 floods in southern Alberta and the 2011 Slave Lake fire.

Alberta NDP welcomes review

The Alberta NDP was glad to hear of the government's plans to conduct an independent review of the COVID-19 response but reiterated calls for public officials to answer questions about a number of outbreaks in Alberta.

It has sought answers from Premier Jason Kenney, Health Minister Tyler Shandro, Justice Minister Doug Schweitzer, Labour Minister Jason Copping as well as those in charge of companies and long-term care facilities where outbreaks occurred.

""This review must include accountability to the public,"" said NDP health critic David Shepherd in a release. ""The premier, his ministers, CEOs, all of them, must be subject to public questioning.

""The bottom line is the review of the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be done behind closed doors.""

The deadline for submissions is Aug. 10 and a successful candidate is expected to be chosen by Aug. 19 so the results can be completed by the fall.

According to the most recent data, there have been 8,596 cases of COVID-19 in Alberta. There are 592 active cases of the illness and 7,844 people have recovered.

While the daily case count announcements from provincial health authorities are the most eye-catching figures, there's other important numbers beyond newly confirmed cases, including hospitalizations and testing data.

This page will be updated daily as new information on Alberta, Canada and international cases of COVID-19 is made available.

Starting the week of June 29, the province will provide daily data updates Monday through Friday and not on weekends and holidays.

Follow the links below or scroll down to see how the COVID-19 situation is changing in Alberta as the pandemic continues.

HOW IS COVID-19 GROWING IN ALBERTA?

The province's daily case count announcement is among the most prominent COVID-19 statistics.

The number of new cases represents the number of patients who are newly infected with the coronavirus. The number of active cases in the province can go up or down depending on the number of new recoveries on a given day.

The above graph divides active cases into those who are sick, but not in hospital, and those patients requiring hospitalization. Hospitalized patients are further divided by those getting care in and out of intensive care units.

Recoveries are defined by Alberta Health Services as follows:

A return to health after 14 days of isolation for those with COVID-19 but who experienced only mild symptoms.

If hospitalized due to COVID-19, anyone who does not require additional hospitalization or treatment in the 10 days after they left the hospital.

If tested, such as a health care worker, two negative tests at least 24 hours apart.

Daily case counts include both lab-confirmed and probable cases. The case count for a given day is sometimes revised to more accurately reflect probable cases that were either later confirmed or determined not to be related to COVID-19.

WHERE IS COVID-19 HITTING ALBERTA THE HARDEST?

Since early April, the province has provided a geographic breakdown for both its five health zones as well as individual cities and community-level subzones within those cities.

Alberta Health Services divides the province into five health zones: Calgary, Central, Edmonton, North and South.

A map of those zones can be seen here, and it's important to note that the Edmonton and Calgary zones cover an area significantly bigger than the cities they are named after.

Sizable daily jumps in the new number of cases can't necessarily be attributed to the virus growing, as testing volume and reporting time also influence the data.

For more local data, the province's COVID-19 statistics page has an interactive map showing cases by city and community.

HOW MANY COVID-19 PATIENTS ARE IN HOSPITAL?

Tracking hospitalizations is an important indicator of how severely pandemic is affecting Albertans as well as how the coronavirus is taxing the province's health care system.

Alberta has the capacity for 295 intensive care unit beds and nearly 8,500 total beds, according to the province's modelling released in April.

So far, the number of hospitalizations and ICU admissions have both remained well below those maximum capacities.

Hospitalization data is often retroactively updated by the province as individual hospitals report data at varying times and speeds.

HOW IS ALBERTA TESTING FOR COVID-19?

Alberta has been the top province in Canada measured by per capita COVID-19 testing since near the start of the pandemic.

The province has now administered more than 500,000 tests Albertans.

It's important to distinguish between test volume (number of tests completed) and number of people tested as patients can be tested more than once.

The province has made seven notable shifts in testing policy.

March 23: The province announced testing was being focused on at-risk populations and health care workers. At the same time, testing returning travellers was deprioritized to only those showing symptoms.

April 7: Testing is opened to any symptomatic individuals in the Calgary Zone, which had seen significant spikes in cases in March and April.

April 13: Testing was expanded to any Albertan with symptoms consistent with the coronavirus.

April 17: The province announced it would start testing all staff and residents of continuing care facilities for COVID-19 regardless of whether or not they show symptoms.​

May 4: The testing criteria was expanded again to include anyone exeperiencing headache, muscle or joint aches, fatigue or severe exhaustion, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, unexplained loss of appetite, loss of sense of smell or taste, or pink eye.

May 11: The province opened testing to asymptomatic residents of the Calgary zone who work outside their home. Testing is to be done on a first-come, first-serve basis for up to 1,000 asymptomatic residents each day. The policy was in place until May 18.

May 29: The province announces all Albertans, including those who are asymptomatic, were eligible to be tested.

HOW IS COVID-19 BEING SPREAD IN ALBERTA?

The province divides the ways COVID-19 is being spread into three categories: travel-related cases, spread via a known source, and spread via an unknown source, or community transmission.

Initially, travel-related cases were responsible for many of Alberta's new COVID-19 cases. But since travel restrictions came into effect, the number of travel-related cases has largely flattened since early April.

Close contact with individuals known to be carrying the virus remains the most common way of spreading COVID-19 in Alberta.

Suspected community transmitted cases, where the carrier isn't immediately known, are an important indicator of how the coronavirus is spreading in a community as well as how successful measures like physical distancing have been in limiting transmission.

Identified cases are investigated by AHS and classified into one of the three categories. The classification can change pending further investigation.

WHICH AGE GROUPS HAVE BEEN MOST SUSCEPTIBLE TO COVID-19?

Since the onset of the pandemic, COVID-19 has affected the elderly more than other age groups as seen in high death and active case counts.

But, younger age groups are not immune, and by mid-June, cases among Albertans under the age of 40 had risen to form a majority of all active cases in the province.

HOW DOES COVID-19'S GROWTH IN ALBERTA COMPARE TO ELSEWHERE?

Conclusions drawn from comparing provinces are somewhat limited by widely differing testing volumes and practices among provinces, but the raw data does allow from some contrast.

The above graphs rank provinces by the number of tests they administer and how many confirmed cases they have, both adjusted to per 10,000 population of their respective province.

Tests are also not without their own biases. More tests will produce more positives, and it's easier to test everyone in a less populous province.

Rates adjusted for population provide a snapshot of the COVID-19 situation on any given day, but experts say the growth of the virus, which is unrelated to population size, is also an important indicator of future trends.

Alberta Health Services divides Edmonton up into 15 health subzones named for their home communities.

Since early April, the province has provided daily updates on the number of COVID-19 active cases, recoveries and deaths in each of those subzones as well as totals for the city itself.

This page is divided up into four sections: overall city data, subzone (community) level data, testing data and methodology.

Scroll down or follow the links below to navigate to each section.

CITY OF EDMONTON

The city of Edmonton is distinct from the Edmonton zone, which includes communities far beyond the city itself. You can see a map displaying the boundaries of the five AHS health zones across the province here.

Unless otherwise specifically indicated, numbers on this page are for the city itself and not the zone.

See the methodology section below for how a recovery from COVID-19 is defined by AHS.

COMMUNITIES

The 15 Edmonton AHS subzones cover the vast majority, though not all, of the area inside the city's coroporate boundaries.

You can see a rough map of the subzones below. For a zoomable version, visit the province's interactive data site and click on the geospatial tab.

Scroll down or follow these links to find data on each individual subzone:

Abbottsfield, Bonnie Doon, Castle Downs

Duggan, Eastwood, Jasper Place

Mill Woods South & East, Mill Woods West, Northeast

Northgate, Rutherford, Twin Brooks

West Jasper Place, Woodcroft East, Woodcroft West

Beaumont, Devon & Leduc, Fort Saskatchewan St. Albert, Sherwood Park, Stony Plain & Spruce Grove

TESTING DATA

Testing data for specific cities isn't yet available so these graphs display data from the Edmonton Zone as opposed to the city itself.

The Edmonton Zone had a population of just over 1.4 million people in 2018, according to AHS. The same year, the province estimated the city of Edmonton's population at just over 1 million people.

METHODOLOGY

Boundaries

The graphs above were assembled using two versions of the province's interactive data map, each with different borders.

The city-specific graphs draws data from the city of Edmonton as defined by its geographic corporate boundaries.

The community-level graphs draw data taken from the province's 15 Edmonton-area health subzones.

Their boundaries closely resemble the city's borders but with some exceptions. As a result, some areas within Edmonton's corporate boundaries, largely near the city's southern boundary, are included in suburban health zones.

Cases are attributed to the subzone of a patient’s primary residence. You can see population estimates for each subzone here.

Case Counts

The updated daily case count reflects the number of new, active cases (people who are now newly ill with COVID-19).

The daily change in active cases are determined by subtracting the number of newly recovered cases from the number of new cases. A positive value represents an increase in net active cases, with a negative value indicating the opposite.

The province often revises data, and reclassifies cases to other health zones or subzones which can cause a sudden rise or drop in cases for a given location.​

Reclassifications can occur for a number of reasons, including:

A patient's contact information was updated to reflect his or her proper address.

Further testing revealed a patient did not, in fact, contract COVID-19.

Data entry errors.

The province published new numbers daily March, April, May and June, with subzone data being available since early April. Starting the weekend of July 4, the province will release updated data on weekdays only, with no scheduled updates on holidays and weekends.

Recoveries

Recoveries are defined by Alberta Health Services as follows:",[]

Locals wanting to get to know or rediscover their city have plenty of options in and around the river valley and downtown for the whole family.

""It’s one thing to be able to showcase our amazing city to visitors and guests, and it is even more special when we get to rediscover our own backyard again,"" said Explore Edmonton Director of Communications Tammy Forbes. ""And even if we have to adapt to the current health restrictions and remain safe, the tourism industry is going to be vital as Edmontonians look for fun ways to rediscover their own city. Our greatest ambassadors are the people who choose to make this place their home.""

Here are 10 unique spots to check out during your summer staycation.

BOB AND DOUG MCKENZIE SCULPTURE

From your television screen to a bench in Ice District, Bob and Doug McKenzie are now in Edmonton for good.

The sculpture of Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas pays tribute to the sketch comedy duo's Great White North segment that had a memorable run on Second City Television in the 70s and 80s.

Edmonton sculptor Ritchie Velthuis made the piece that appeared in Ice District, in 103 Street and 103 Avenue, in late March.

SPIRIT OF STANLEY

Edmonton has had a lot of Stanley Cups over the year, and while this one wasn't won on the ice, it's by far the biggest and most prominent.

Located in front of the United Cycle on Gateway Boulevard, the Spirit of Stanley is the world's largest Stanley Cup replica at four metres and 850 pounds.

Fun fact: Each team took 45 minutes to engrave, according to its maker, IMARK.

NEON SIGN MUSEUM

An Edmonton classic, the Neon Sign Museum tells parts of the city's history in an artistic and bright way.

The City of Edmonton has collected 20 signs, restored and installed them on the Telus building and Mercer Warehouse on 104 Street.

Neon signs include the Canadian National Railway, the Princess Theatre, and with the goal of collecting 30 signs, there is a petition to save and move the Western Cycle sign there.

HIGH LEVEL BRIDGE AND WALTERDALE BRIDGE

These two are just nice to look at, especially at night. The City of Edmonton often changes the High Level Bridge's lights in the morning and night to celebrate certain occasions, or to send a message of solidarity as it did recently with Nova Scotia.

The Walterdale Bridge has only been around for three years but it's already arguably Edmonton's No. 1 spot for photos, featuring the breathtaking architecture, the river valley, and downtown Edmonton's growing skyline.

Gallery: Walterdale Bridge

KEILLOR POINT

Keillor Point was known as the End of the World before the City of Edmonton overhauled the North Saskatchewan River viewpoint in 2019.

The End of the World, located in the Belgravia neighbourhood, had become a safety hazard due to slumping in the embankment and deterioration of the pillars, the city said.

Still, it was a popular place to hang out and take pictures of the river, so the city spent $1.5 million to make it safer and more accessible, with stairs and a pathway.

BELGRAVIA BENCHES

Near Keillor Point, these benches in the Belgravia Dog Park are a cool spot to catch a sunset with views that include Fox Drive, the Whitemud Equine Learning Centre Association, Quesnell Bridge, the river — and your dog.

TALUS DOME

Explore Edmonton calls the Talus Dome Edmonton's ""most provocative piece of public art"" that ""always has people talking.""

You've probably driven by the 1,000 steel balls while crossing the Quesnell Bridge and raised an eyebrow, but the city encourages Edmontonians to take a closer look.

""Think fun house meets the compound eye of a fly,"" Explore Edmonton said. ""You can capture some pretty warped and funny reflections that will have you busting a gut laughing.""

Just don’t throw paint on it.

FORT EDMONTON FOOTBRIDGE

A footbridge on what feels like the middle of nowhere connects neighbourhoods in southwest Edmonton divided by the North Saskatchewan River.

Sit on the benches on and surrounding the bridge for up-close views of the river, or exercise on the trails on either side or the Wolf Willow Stairs just steps away.

""If you choose the latter, be prepared to sweat it out and hike up 200 stairs to get to this vantage point,"" Explore Edmonton said.

RIVER VALLEY SWING

As if it wasn't clear Edmonton's river valley was full of fun and surprises: a wooden swing overlooking downtown Edmonton.

It's been called a hidden gem and picturesque, but not many people know where it is. It's not clear who built it and put it there — the mystery adding to the charm.

It's tucked under somewhere around Dawson Park.

Tell your friends…unless you want it all to yourself.

WHITEMUD CREEK UNDERPASS

This is another gem not a lot of people have known about until now.

Underneath the Whitemud Creek on Anthony Henday Drive is an archway that wraps around a footbridge.

And since it doesn’t get a lot of foot traffic, it's turned into a lot more than that.

The little underpass has turned into a colourful retreat covered in graffiti and photographers admiring the rugged beauty.

It may looked abandoned on the outside, but it's getting a lot of attention on social media.",[]

“I come here a lot,” one passerby told CTV News. “It's pretty nice.”

The Whitemud Creek arch was once a site for coal mining.

In 2005 the province added the pedestrian bridge as a means for people to safely traverse from one side of the freeway to the other. Below the bridge is the creek which allows wildlife to also make the safe trek.

Local blogger Lincoln Ho believes the project is incomplete and unsafe.

""Crumbling infrastructure is always an issue especially underneath one of the busiest roadways in the city,"" said Ho.

He believes that because of very little foot traffic, “urban explorers” are taking part in extensive and often profane graffiti tagging.

“They're climbing on to parts of the bridge that aren't for pedestrians,” says Ho. “Somebody is going to get hurt and it's very hard to access for medical personnel.""

The crossing has also become a popular backdrop for social media posts, increasing its notoriety.

""So anybody who has featured this bridge on a TikTok has gotten very popular with it and so everybody is copying everybody else’s TikTok's and checking out this supposed hidden bridge.""

Neither end of the bridge is connected by trail, making it difficult to access. Still, that isn’t stopping admirers from making the trek to this urban escape.

""I actually have a friend from Toronto coming to visit and I'm going to bring her here,"" said one woman out for a hike.

""It's a beautiful piece of infrastructure,” said Ho. “Beautiful contemporary architecture style in there and it is a shame that it's just left abandoned.”",[]

Kaysen Martin, who is 23 months old, needs a $2.8-million gene-therapy drug called Zolgensma for his Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type 1 that affects the muscles used for lung support, swallowing, crawling, walking and head control.

His family is pleading for Alberta Health to cover the drug, but time is running out, because it can only be administered before a child turns two.

A GoFundMe page to raise the money for the drug has already raised more than $80,000, including a $5,000 donation from Reynolds.

Kaysen’s mother Lana Bernardin said the family was excited to see the donation.

“Definitely surprised that Ryan Reynolds saw us. I’m not sure how, but he saw us. So for sure, it was a really good, big surprise,” she told CTV News Edmonton.

Reynolds, who was born in Vancouver, has made many charitable donations in 2020. He and his wife Blake Lively donated to food banks across Canada, including a $5,000 to the Edmonton Food Bank in April.

The family has until July 17, Kaysen’s second birthday, to raise the money.

“Every little bit helps. Every donation, every share, it doesn’t matter the amount, it all helps,” Bernardin said.",[]

The Mountie found a stolen vehicle in the parking lot and attempted to arrest the thief at approximately 5:30 p.m., police said.

The man, 44, punched the officer in the head, stole their baton and struck them in the head several times.

A local resident, who did not want to be fully named for fear of retribution, says RCMP were already at the store when she and her husband arrived. He ran inside to buy diapers, so she was alone with two toddlers when she says the officer approached the thief.

“As soon as she went to detain him he kind of like uppercutted her, probably two or three times in the jaw. That’s when she went down,” Morgan recalled.

“She gets on her feet pulls her baton, whips it out, and goes to smack him with it and he just grabbed it out of the air — rips it out of her hand — and kind of cave man styled her in the back of the head with it. … She went back down and he gets on top of her again and just starts bashing her with this baton. Like he’s going for the skull every time.

“And she was screaming at the top of her lungs.”

The man fled when a passerby started yelling at him.

According to police, he left with the baton, threatened another driver with it and a knife and stole a Trailblazer.

He drove southbound on Highway 28; RCMP chased him and disabled the stolen vehicle.

The 44-year-old was arrested without incident and the baton was recovered, police said.

The RCMP officer was taken to hospital with serious but non-life threatening injuries and is now recovering at home.

Morgan considers her lucky to have survived the beating without help.

She says some members of the public watched the incident “like it was a joke.”

“It was heartbreaking because you want to do something but at the same time you can’t jeopardize my young children.”

The officer, she insisted, did nothing to escalate the situation.

“We should be helping each other not hating each other no matter what colour we wear. You see someone who has done nothing wrong and they’re being brutalized basically it’s something someone needs to step up and do something.”

The man is in custody and will be charged.

""I was sick for about two weeks, I was in isolation within our home in a guest bedroom and there was about three days where I was gasping for air,"" Gullacher said.

The Gullacher family has been hit hard by COVID-19.

Paul’s father Butch is the only person from Regina to die from the virus, while his wife and kids also showed a variety of symptoms.

Gullacher’s wife, Aimee, lost her sense of taste and smell for 10 days. His daughter, Athena, had a fever and headache, but Gullacher says she showed her normal energy, and his son, Willem, had pink eye.

He says they did everything they could to avoid the virus.

""Prior to even my dad showing symptoms, we had been exercising social distancing, we were disinfecting door handles, we were doing all the things,"" Gullacher said.

Gullacher’s father had reduced kidney function and hadn’t travelled prior to contracting COVID-19.

He was admitted to hospital on March 19 and put into an induced coma a few days later. He battled the virus for weeks before dying on Apr. 10.

The 69-year-old was the fourth person in Saskatchewan to die from the virus.

""It’s funny that when my mom called me on the Thursday, I didn’t realize that I’d seen my dad for the last time already,"" Gullacher said.

The family still hasn’t been able to have a funeral for him.

""At the time it doesn’t really set in because everything is so unknown, everything is so sudden, it’s not totally clear to you how this is going to work out and you don’t think it’s going to happen to you,"" Gullacher said.

In the aftermath, Gullacher says he’s learned how precious his memories with his father have been.

""You need to cherish your family and spend time with your family now because there’s no guarantee that time is going to be available at the end,"" he said.

He’s disappointed that his father won’t be able to create more memories with his grandchildren.

""He fully unfolded as a human being when he became a grandpa, I’d never really had a ton of strong memories of my dad smiling as much as when he became a grandfather, his grandkids meant everything to him,"" Gullacher said.

Gullacher says his son believed he may have been responsible for his grandfather contracting the virus.

""All he knew is kids don’t get really sick and kids make their grandparents sick, that’s all he was seeing in media, so even though the timeline doesn’t work out for him to have infected him, he felt guilt,"" he said.

Cases in Saskatchewan have remained low during the pandemic and Regina hasn’t had an active case in almost a month.

Gullacher says his family’s experience should serve as a warning against letting your guard down.

""Because so few people have been infected here in Regina, it’s easy to believe that this is someone else’s problem, that it can’t effect us here,"" he said.

Since recovering, Gullacher says his family has continued to take precautions and remain close to home.

He also made the decision last month to donate convalescent plasma, which is being used in a clinical trail by Canadian Blood Services to prove whether antibodies can be effectively used to treat COVID-19 patients.

Gullacher hopes it can help save a life.

“It really reminds me on the SNC Lavalin scandal, because it’s coming out in drips and drabs,” Scheer told CTV Morning Live.

Scheer said Conservatives are calling for all documents pertaining to Trudeau’s relationship with the WE Charity be made public. This follows confirmation that members of the Prime Minister’s immediate family were paid nearly $300,000 over four years for speaking at WE Charity events.

We want to see what this contract looked like,” Scheer said. “We want to know how many Cabinet Ministers knew he had this kind of relationship with this charity.”

In an emailed statement sent to CTVNews.ca, Chantal Gagnon, a spokesperson for the Prime Minister's Office, said Trudeau's relatives ""engage with a variety of organizations and support many personal causes on their own accord.""

PANDEMIC RESPONSE

Scheer’s Conservatives have proposed a “back-to-work bonus” which he said would allow employees to earn money and keep more CERB.

“We’ve been calling on this government to fix the gaps in their programs. Many people still don’t qualify for the wage subsidy; many businesses don’t qualify for the rental subsidy,” Scheer said.

REPRESENTING REGINA-QU’APPELLE

Scheer said he plans to continue running for Regina-Qu’Appelle MP, and enjoys reconnecting with the communities in his riding.

“Being leader of the party I was able to able to highlight the issues that are effecting Saskatchewan and my riding,” he said. “ “The feedback I got was [my riding] was really rooting for me, they really appreciated the opportunity to have a Prime Minister from Saskatchewan and fix some of the issues that Sask is facing, the inability to get pipelines built, the terrible harvest we had and still no response from the federal government.”

The storm continued on towards Assiniboia and near that community another touchdown occurred, around 6:23. Once again no damage was reported.

DID YOU KNOW

On Sunday, June 30,1912 the deadliest tornado in Canadian history hit the city of Regina. The Regina Cyclone started to develop at about 4:50 p.m., green funnel clouds formed and touched down South of the city. It tore through the residential area between Wascana Lake and Victoria Avenue, continuing through the downtown business district, rail yards, warehouse district and Northern residential area. There were a total of 28 fatalities.

Photos sourced from the Provincial Archives of Saskatchewan.

After things from the weekend settled down they ramped back up on Tuesday, July 7. A large line of storms from around the Swift Current area to Southern Montana moved across Southern Saskatchewan. This line of intense storms brought severe wind gusts, large hail and heavy rain. The Southwestern corner took the brunt of these storms once again.

Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) recorded the top wind gust at 141 km per hour at the Mankota station. Two other stations were in triple digits, Coronach at 139 km per hour and Val Marie at 117 km per hour. Nickel sized hail was reported in the Golden Prairie area and reports of trees being snapped came in from near Hazenmore.

Once this line of storms subsided a large area of low pressure developed and moved slowly through Central Saskatchewan. The Northwest side of this system dropped large amounts of rain and a good portion of that also slide through the Southwestern corner of the Province. The 24 hour accumulated precipitation, as of 11 a.m. Wednesday July 9, for North Battleford was 133.8 mm or around 5 inches. Localized flooding happened in North Battleford and Swift Current as city drains couldn't keep up to the downpours. The average rainfall for the whole month of July in North Battleford is 74 mm or 3 inches, they recieved almost double in 24 hours!

As we continue to move through the month of July we'll stay unsettled for the next couple of weeks. Now that moisture has blanketed the Province daytime heating will continue to produce the risk of thunderstorms on an almost daily basis.

Moisture breeds more moisture. If you're looking for a consistent nice day this weekend it will be Saturday. Temperatures will be seasonal and the sun will stick around all day.

Sunday afternoon the trouble starts to bubble up once again and we'll watch for more thunderstorms scattered through the Province.

“We knew it was going to be busy,” said SARCAN communications coordinator Nolan Hubbard-Richards.

“We knew that people were going to be accumulating more containers than normal. But, we were completely blown away with the reception of our reopening and how many people showed up on that opening day and continue to show up.”

Some customers have seen wait times up to two hours long at locations across Regina. Zena Bear waited outside of the Rochdale location.

“I’ve got five [bags], but I’ve got another six or seven in the car and they said, ‘just what we can carry,’ so I have another day of this.”

SARCAN continues its COVID-19 practices at all locations and customers are seeing them as a success.

“Everybody just kept their distance and did their own thing. So it was all good,” said Bear.

Hubbard-Richards says there is no way for SARCAN to be able to predict what days or times they will be busy. But, it does look like the long lines will continue to be the norm for the foreseeable future.",[]

Hibbin, realizing his front yard lights were no longer on, ran outside and yelled at a woman who had just ripped them from his flower bed.

He told her to drop the lights. She did, but began to run, he said.

“I went out to retrieve them, but went back in to grab my shoes so I could attempt to locate her,” Hibbin said.

He said he found her walking on a nearby road, but she was no longer wearing a white sweater.

Hibbin told her he had her caught on video, but she decided to run again.

“She dropped her smokes, so she stopped and attempted to apologize and said she would pay me back and that she had been drinking,” he said.

He said a cab driver had stopped on the road, asking if everything was OK. Hibbin explained the situation, but the woman ran into a nearby backyard.

He didn’t follow her because it could have been her home, and he didn’t want to be confronted by others, he said.

“I'm a quiet person, so I don't walk by myself at night, but that didn't seem to matter. I just wanted to find this woman,” he said. “I was blown away by how calm she was while taking my lights. Not a care in the world.”

In video footage, the woman is seen yanking the lights from Hibbin’s flower bed. The incident took place in the city’s southeast.

The entire fixture broke.

“When she pulled them off the wire, they snapped clean off in three different locations,” he said. “She just kept pulling at everything.”

Hibbin called the police. He said an officer came by Sunday to ask some questions, but he doubts the woman will be caught.

He said he understands people might think the theft is insignificant, but the lights were expensive.

“This all seems pretty petty, because they are lights, but my partner and I have spent a lot of money to make things nice, and it's as if you can't have anything without someone else ruining it,” he said.

Hibbin said he’s glad he had a camera installed. It allowed him to catch her, he said.

“If I didn't have that camera, I would have ignored the noise and found out a day later I was missing my lights,” he said.",[]

Merrell, the founder of the Sleep Apnea Society of Canada (SASOC), recently stopped in Saskatchewan during the journey.

He began his trip in Calgary on July 1 and is riding to Winnipeg.

“Some of the biggest problems in Canada are an inadequate number of sleep specialists and sleep facilities,” said Merrell.

“There is a big deficit in terms of funding from the provincial health care authorities. In some provinces, you may get some funding for treatment. In others, there is none at all,” he said.

Merrell said that sleep apnea affects 10 to 12 million Canadians, but almost 90 per cent of people are undiagnosed. A recent study has suggested that those with the condition are more susceptible to more dangerous cases of COVD-19.

“We're trying to deal with the COVID situation of course and all these things,” said Merrell. “If we can now start to suggest to individuals with sleep apnea that they have to be even more careful, then that's an important message we should try to get out""

Merrell is hoping that his ride encourages provincial governments to increase funding into sleep apnea.

Although sleep apnea is a relatively new condition, it affects people of all ages and genders – not just older males. Merrell reported even some young children have been diagnosed.

“People with sleep apnea have five to seven times greater risk of having an automobile accident,” he said.

Snoring and being chronically tired are the most common symptoms of sleep apnea. Dr. Merrell encourages people who experience those symptoms, or who are more than 40 years old, to get tested for the condition.",[]

Gilmer, 26 at the time, had just become the president of the Saskatchewan Coalition Against Racism.

“Well I certainly remember the siege on Kanesatake took place and almost instantly, there was organizing going on in the community to respond,” he said.

July 11, 2020 marks the 30-year anniversary of the beginning of the Oka Crisis, between the town of Oka and the Mohawk of Kanesatake.

During the conflict, people of both Indigenous and non-Indigenous backgrounds would gather at Victoria Park in Regina at what was called the Friends of Mohawk camp.

The camp became the hub for supporters in the city.

Demonstrations and rallies were held almost every day for more than two months in the park, in front of the government building on Scarth Street and at the legislature. Protesters occupied the Northern and Indigenous Affairs office for multiple days.

“People felt it was really important that a stand was taken locally in collaboration with numerous protests across the country,” said Gilmer.

For Danielle Ewenin, she had become the first Indigenous person to be the president of the University of Regina Students’ Union prior to the events of 1990.

“For me it was a struggle,” said Ewenin. “Holding that kind of profile meant also how our people were going to be perceived.”

Ewenin now works with the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women commission.

“People were afraid that if they didn’t do something and the police or armed forces did something to hurt the people in Kahnawake and Kanesatake,” said Ewenin. “People felt they had to do something to prevent that. They understood the oppression. They might not have the language for it, but they knew in [their hearts] what was happening. That made people move.”

Gilmer spoke often at rallies that summer.

“Say no to constitutional deals that ignore the first peoples,” he said in 1990. “No to golf courses that take precedence over land claim settlements.”

Gilmer, reflecting on the past, said it certainly was about more than a golf course.

“It was about the colonial history of Canada,” he said. “It was about the need for this country to come to terms with its past and find ways to move forward.”

In a Regina city council meeting in the summer of 1990, some councillors wanted the city to express its support for the Mohawks. However, most of the council voted against it.

“They didn’t want to deal with those motions because they would have to make a statement on where they stand,” said Ewenin to the press following the meeting.

She now says Canada was not ready for an Indigenous movement at the time.

“No, they weren’t ready for it. People were speaking out against the oppression,” she said.

Gilmer believes there was a societal shift that saw many non-Indigenous peoples join in the advocacy for Indigenous rights.

“It was ultimately an anti-colonial movement that was led by Indigenous people across the country, but there was many non-Indigenous people that became involved,” he said.

The actions of those who rallied still echo today.

For instance, people involved in the Black Lives Matter movement have been rallying to address racism and seek justice.

“I see it as a continuation of what was going on,” said Ewenin.

Gilmer said 1990 feels a lot like 2020.

“But on the one hand, the issues have never gone away but they seem to have risen to the forefront again,” he said.

Gilmer says the issues of police accountability and systemic discrimination were at the core of the rallies of 1990, just as they are today.

“Unfortunately, so many of those anti-racism issues we were dealing with in 1990 are still prominent today,” said Gilmer. “The difference today is that these issues can’t be swept under the rug anymore. 1990 was an important step in that direction.”

For Ewenin, her children and grandchildren are still fighting what she fought 30 years ago.

“I don’t think it’s fair. I don’t think it is right or just in this society,” said Ewenin. “They have a right to be able to pursue their lives.”

Gilmer said he thought attitudes would have changed by now.

“But it is inspiring to see so many young people today that are challenging institutional racism,” he said.

Similar movements saw education as the key to change. Ewenin thinks a shift in Canada’s way of looking at Indigenous people starts with education.

“We have a whole education system that is built on lies,” said Ewenin. “It has to be based upon Indigenous people’s stories and history. When you are taught those things, you realize we have a right to the land.”

Gilmer sees the events of the summer of 1990 as the spark to a societal shift in Canada.

“I think it really is pivotal in terms of Canadian history that those acts of solidarity, particularly the focus on Kanesatake, meant that Indigenous rights and anti-colonial struggle became front and centre for the first time,” he said.

Ewenin said Canada has a long way to go before these matters can be resolved.

“It's been 30 years since the royal commission and none of those reports have gone into change,” said Ewenin. “We are a country that has the most racist legislation and Canada is saying, ‘well, we can’t change it to fit the United Nations’ Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.”

Ewenin is optimistic about the future generations and their fight against injustices.

“As long as people feel their rights are not being acknowledged - that’s not a struggle or a fight that’s going to be given up. My grandchildren have inherited that. It’s not going to go away,” she said.

“Canada will get there.”",[]

Monday, too, lacks the ""get up and go"" of our midweek. That’s a by-product of the back-end of a trough, one which created some nasty weather through parts of the province. Much more on that when we get to the photos – there were some great ones sent by!

Digressing back into our day ahead, scattered thundershowers may trigger along the foothills and roll in late this afternoon or into the evening. Because we’re a touch cooler today, we expect these to be largely non-severe, save for the southern fringes of Alberta, where conditions may be warmer.

For our Tuesday to Thursday, we’re falling back into some westerly wind, and we’re diving back beneath the jet; the jet fences cold air in the north, but as part of this trough, it’s dug in beneath us, which keeps today 5° below our seasonal normal, as noted at 23° in our Day-Lites. When the jet migrates along with this deep trough and ascends back north of us, it allows for warmer air to circulate in, and we’ll see conditions return to normal, and to more stable straits, as well.

Here’s the forecast:

Today:

Partly cloudy, chance of afternoon thundershowers

Daytime high: 18°

Evening: partly cloudy, storm risk, low 8°

Tomorrow:

Mainly cloudy, scattered showers possible

Daytime high: 22°

Evening: mainly clear, low 11°

Wednesday:

Partly cloudy

Daytime high: 21°

Evening: mainly clear, low 10°

Thursday:

Mainly sunny

Daytime high: 25°

Evening: clear, low 11°

Friday:

Showers

Daytime high: 18°

Evening: clear, low 10°

Today’s photos only tell half of Sunday's story. We’ll look north, first, to the warned storms that ripped through yesterday and produced nickel-to-quarter-sized hail through Innisfail, Caroline, Olds, and areas west of Sundre, as well as gusts in Brooks and Priddis in the 80 km/h range. A series of funnel clouds were also being watched.

Speaking of, one of the funnel clouds looks to have touched down near Nanton. Environment Canada says that it’s received a preliminary rating of EF-0 as a landspout tornado, which is an accurate rating given the photographs show a surface dust cloud, but little to no connection otherwise. Thanks to the amazing photogs who snapped pics of this storm band and sent them in!

Players and coaches returned to the ice at the Saddledome to kick off a mini-training camp in preparation for their Stanley Cup playoffs play-in series next month in Edmonton.

As per NHL rules, each team is allowed to bring a cohort of 52 people to the hub city comprised of various trainers, medical staff, coaches and 28 total players.

The Flames currently have 35 players on their roster including four goalies, 11 defencemen and 20 forwards.

The players and coaches were separated into two groups for Monday’s on-ice session. The first group took to the ice at 10:00 a.m. while the second group takes the ice at 12:15 p.m. to wrap up the practice.

General Manager Brad Treliving says his club is as locked down as much as possible right now as management works to keep everyone in the same bubble and virus-free.

""The players life is they enter the building, they get a temperature check, a COVID test, they’re masked and they come on individually spread out on separate dressing rooms,"" Treliving said.

""When you are susceptible is when you leave the rink.""

Canmore RCMP, along with Kananaskis Public Safety and Kananaskis Emergency Services, were called to an area near Mount Yamnuska for reports a hiker had fallen.

The report indicated the 30-year-old man from Calgary was hiking in the scree section of the trail at about 2:10 p.m. Saturday when he fell approximately six metres.

While the injured male was being helped by a number of bystanders, several boulders came free from the slope and fell down on top of them.

The victim suffered a head injury as a result. The bystanders remained at the scene and administered first aid until help arrived.

Crews from both Alpine Helicopters and STARS Air Ambulance attended the scene but, unfortunately, the man died of his injuries.

The victim's identity is not being released as officials are notifying family.

""Unfortunately (Saturday) at Yamnuska was very busy for first responders,"" said Cpl. Sabrina Clayton of the Canmore RCMP detachment.

TWO OTHERS INJURED ON THE SCREE SLOPE

Leaders from the mountain climbing community say the section of trail is notoriously tricky if not treacherous.

""Injuries and accidents on Yamnuska go back as far as people have been heading up there to hike and climb,"" said Brandon Pullan, editor-in-chief of Gripped magazine.

""There’s no denying it, there’s a lot that can go wrong. It just takes one loose rock or a foot to slip. But if you are in the climbing or the mountain community, you should be prepared to lose people.""

RECENT FATALITIES

At the end of June a woman died in a fall on nearby Mount Fable.

Trina Ramanaden is remembered by friends and family as an avid hiker.

According to Kananaskis rescue officials. helicopters spotted her body on the southeast ridge of the mountain face.

Charles Mark, a resident of the nearby Stoney Nakoda First Nation says he is saddened to learn of the recent fatal incidents and says preparation and reflection is important before any mountain experience.

""You have to respect the mountain. Before you go up the mountain always offer tobacco and pray then you go up.""

RCMP are also advising extra caution especially for novice hikers and climbers.

""When in doubt, talk to a professional if you’re unsure about what equipment you might need the route you are going to be taking and just always be prepared for unfortunately anything that can happen in the backcountry,"" said Cpl. Clayton.

YAMNUSKA TRAIL CLOSED AS OF JULY 12

Following the multiple incidents on the popular trail, officials have temporarily closed the area until further notice.

“I can't say no to a good time,” said Edmonton Oilers fan Jeet Jermana. “I'd be hard-pressed not to jump into a big party.”

On Friday, the NHL board of governors and NHL Players' Association said they had ratified the return-to-play plan, paving the way for the league to resume its pandemic-hit season later this summer.

Toronto and Edmonton were also officially unveiled as hub cities where all games will be played, beginning Aug. 1. Training camps start Monday in the 24 cities with teams still in the running for the Stanley Cup, including six in Canada.

In 2017, when the Oilers nearly advanced to the Western Conference final, Jermana was among the thousands of fans who partied in Ford Hall at Rogers Place arena and in bars along the popular Whyte Avenue district.

But with COVID-19 this year, where teams will play in empty arenas, Jermana said he'll likely watch more games at home, maybe with just a few friends.

That is, he said, until the Oilers advance and he and other fans won't be able to resist going out.

“Once it becomes the 'real playoffs' I think more and more the momentum will grab,” he said.

Matt Black of Hotel X Toronto, located west of the city centre where multiple media outlets have reported that several teams will be based, said the prospect of any accommodation for celebratory fan gatherings, even outdoors, seems unlikely.

Nevertheless, Black said he expects citywide excitement will be palpable, even with empty arenas.

“You look back to those scenes of Jurassic Park and Maple Leaf Square and all of that ... it would be great for people to be able to get together again but you just need to make sure that you're doing it in a safe manner,” said Black.

The players themselves aren't to have any contact with the general public.

Dr. Vinita Dubey, Toronto's associate medical health officer, said in an emailed statement that players and staff arriving from abroad will also have to serve a modified 14-day quarantine as well as undergo rigorous screening and daily testing protocols, wear masks in indoor settings, physically distance and wash hands often.

An Edmonton police spokesperson said the service wouldn't be able to comment over the weekend on what sorts of preparations they might make for crowds when the season resumes.

Geoff Grimble with the City of Edmonton said the city's civic events management team would likely discuss the issue during a scheduled meeting on Monday.

“The City of Edmonton's first priority is public safety and we'll continue to follow the advice and requirements of the Chief Medical Officer of Health to ensure fans, players, coaches and staff remain healthy,” Grimble said.

Oilers fan Brendan McLeod admitted he may be lured to a street celebration when - not if - his team advances, but said he still wants to maintain physical distancing.

“We have to get through this together or else it's not going to change,” said McLeod.

But Shadi Merhej, who said he enjoys both hockey and the Oilers, noted the sport doesn't have quite as strong attraction for him in the summer.

“It's daylight 'til 11 o'clock. You don't want to spend half your day watching hockey,” Merhej explained.

“I'd rather go for a bike ride, or rollerblade or golf.”

It was the chance she needed, to live a happy life.

""I came so far from my addictions, I’ve been five months sober,"" said Little Light. ""It gave me a home, it gave me hope, it gave me a home to regain my life back.""

Little Light says she’s excited to welcome new residents in, over the next week, adding it will be a chance to build connections.

The comet will come closest to the Earth on July 22, when it will be about 103 million kilometres away from our plant, says NASA. The comet should become even easier to spot later in July though NASA warns comets are unpredictable.

From now until mid-July, you can see the comet about 10 degrees above the northeastern horizon.

RE: Open Letter: Rehabilitated grizzly cubs can boost Alberta grizzly bear recovery

We, the 73 (104) signatories of this letter, are deeply concerned about the three orphaned grizzly cubs in the Calgary Zoo, as well as Alberta’s grizzly bear population.

We would like to thank Alberta Fish and Wildlife for rescuing the three cubs and for the care that the Calgary Zoo has provided them.

Our group respectfully requests that Alberta Fish and Wildlife consider rehabilitating and releasing these cubs into the Alberta wilderness to boost the province’s grizzly bear population rather than condemning these bears to long-term captive care.

Many Albertans fully support this approach, given that grizzly bears are a threatened species in Alberta and rehabilitation and release into the wild is the most humane solution. Science shows that wild animals suffer immeasurably in captivity. The Calgary Zoo was one of the first zoos to treat polar bears with Prozac to mitigate the psychological trauma of captivity and the development of disorders.

The age and health of these three cubs make them ideal candidates for the only grizzly cub rehabilitation program in North America, namely the Northern Lights Wildlife Shelter in Smithers, B.C. Since its inception in 2007, this shelter has raised and released twenty-five grizzly cubs without serious incident.

Once successfully reared and capable of surviving in the wild on their own, the cubs would be released back into an appropriate area with as little human development as possible.

Our group believes that rehabilitating these three orphaned cubs is a critical first step to revamping Alberta’s commitment to grizzly bear conservation and recovery. Since 2013, when the last recovery plan expired, Alberta has been without a recovery plan to guide these efforts. It is time to revisit the 2016 draft plan and update it with the best-available science to improve habitat security and reduce human-caused mortality. This recent incident is a stark reminder of how quickly and tragically healthy grizzlies can disappear from the landscape.

While some grizzly bear populations in the lower 48 American states have increased dramatically, Alberta’s population has seen no significant increase since the species was designated as threatened in 2010.

As part of the grizzly bear recovery plan update, we urge the Alberta government to consider licensing one or more of the Alberta bear rehabilitation facilities for grizzly bear rehabilitation.

Thank you for putting the welfare of the cubs and Alberta’s grizzly bear population first. We look forward to a timely response to our requests.

Respectfully,

The Calgary brewery released its first sour beer this month as a celebration of 'Karen', the internet-coined name given to the stereotypical entitled, privileged white woman. The brewery's social media promotion of the beer used phrases that included 'Can we speak to a manager?' and the depiction on the label was of a fair-skinned woman with the crown of the Common Crown Brewing logo resting on her head.

The misguided attempt to be humorous drew swift criticism on social media as the name appeared to exonerate the actions of a select group who have stood in opposition to the Black Lives Matter movement.

On Friday, Common Crown announced its decision to remove the beer from store shelves and issued the following apology:

We wish to thank those who reached out and brought to our attention the error we have made in our recent release. We realize that our intent of the Karen label is insignificant at this juncture. Unfortunately, The Karen Cherry Sour missed the mark, and we promise to do better. Being tone deaf to racial developments is not an excuse, and we will work harder to stay informed and up to date on escalating situations. Thank you to those who sought to educate and inform us, and help us to recognize our error. We read through all of your comments and messages as a team. Moving forward, we will be working to do better, educate ourselves and collaborate with communities who support inclusion and diversity.

The Karen Cherry Sour has been pulled from shelves and is no longer available for sale. While this is just a small step in understanding our wrong, we are committed to moving forward and doing better.

Thank you.

CTV News reached out to the owner of Common Crown Brewing Co., Damon Moreau, for comment on the situation and he said the decision on the product name was made as a result of a team effort and the entire team apologizes for the mistake.

""We recognize the issue and the error,"" he said.

A majority of the product line was pre-sold and scheduled for delivery Friday, but Moreau says that's no longer happening. He says he's spoken with the company's licence holders that would have received the shipments and they have expressed their understanding of the situation.",[]

The regions will move into Stage 3 of the province's economic recovery, along with most public health units in Ontario, the provincial government announced Monday.

Region of Waterloo Public Health Region's Acting Medical Officer of Health Dr. Hsiu Li Wang said the region was notified on the move into Stage 3 on Monday afternoon.

""This will be a welcome update for many in our community,"" she said. ""We are able to move to Stage 3 because of the efforts of our residents to date.""

Dr. Wang said people will need to remain vigilant as more businesses open their doors.

""I ask all residents to please continue to follow the public health measures to slow the spread of COVID-19 in our community,"" she added.

Mandatory masking bylaws came into effect in the region on Monday. People need to wear masks in all indoor public spaces and on public transit, with some exceptions.

Waterloo Mayor Dave Jaworsky said the move into Stage 3 is ""welcome news for those businesses who have been waiting patiently.""

""We can't lost sight of the fact, however, that we are still in the midst of a pandemic and we cannot let our guard down,"" an emailed statement from Jaworsky said in part. ""This is still a serious issue and we must follow physical distancing.""

He also advised businesses to be deliberate in their plans to welcome people back through their doors and stick to guidelines from public health officials to avoid another shut down in the future.

""Only open when you're absolutely ready, don't rush it,"" he said. ""Nothing is more important than keeping everyone healthy.""

Indoor gathering sizes will increase to up to 50 people, a large increase from the 10 people currently allowed under Stage 2. Outdoor gatherings can be up to 100 people under Stage 3. People will need to maintain physical distance if they're gathering with people outside of their social circle.

The provincial government says certain activities won't be allowed because they are considered high-risk for the spread of COVID-19, including amusement parks, water parks, buffets, dancing at restaurants, and saunas and steam rooms.

Some regions, including the Toronto-area, Niagara and Windsor, will stay in Stage 2.

These regions will move into Stage 3 on Friday:

Region of Waterloo officials say the structure that was installed four decades ago is due for a facelift and is getting a complete restoration.

The Aporia is one of the earliest pieces of public art in the city, but its meaning has been up for debate.

“There’s actually very little information about what the sculpture is intended to represent,” said Ellen McGaghey of the Region of Waterloo. “The artist installed it back in 1980 and it’s been a bit of a mystery since that time.

“Certainly it has all sorts of names and that’s the beauty of great public art is that it engenders conversation.”

The restoration is expected to cost about $27,000 for the region, who say it will still respect the original intent of the artist.",[]

Accounting for both outbreak-related cases and non-outbreak cases, the Forest Heights/Forest Hill/Lakeside neighbourhood has the highest infection rate, at 992.9 per 100,000 people.

The Vanier/Rockway neighbourhood is next, with a rate of 945.6 cases per 100,000 people.

While both of those neighbourhoods have a high rate of outbreak-related cases, Vanier/Rockway also has the highest infection rate when adjusting for non-outbreak cases only.

Note: You can explore the map yourself by scrolling to the bottom of this article.

When looking at only non-outbreak cases, that neighbourhood has an infection rate of 260.2 per 100,000 people, with 41 cases.

Woolwich Rural North also has one of the highest rates of infection rate, with 212.9 infections per 100,000 people. There are 15 non-outbreak cases there.

The neighbourhood with the third-highest infection rate is Southwest Kitchener. There, the rate is 190.4 per 100,000 people.

Public health officials have reported 39 non-outbreak cases there, and 62 total cases.

On the region's website, officials note that the data is skewed because of previous testing guidance that prioritized certain groups.

The website also notes that, just because your neighbourhood may look okay on the map, it doesn't mean you're safe.

""There is broad circulation of COVID-19 in our community. You should assume you could get COVID-19 anywhere in Waterloo Region,"" the region's website notes.

Several neighbourhoods on the map are considered not reportable because they have five cases or fewer.

The data also shows that five cases have invalid or missing postal codes.

Since the pandemic began, there have been 1,299 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Waterloo Region. That includes 1,094 resolved cases and 116 deaths.

Region of Waterloo CAO Mike Murray reported the charges on Tuesday during one of the region's twice-weekly media briefing.

The charges were laid between June 23 and June 29 at a private residence in Waterloo and another in Kitchener.

In both cases, Murray says that more than 10 people were gathered.

""The emergency orders are still in effect, they are still being enforced, and the emergency orders do limit public gatherings to less than 10 people,"" he reminded the public during the briefing.

""I just encourage everybody to take the emergency orders seriously and take their personal precautions seriously.""

Over the weekend, the Ontario government extended its emergency orders until July 15.

Murray said during the briefing that the rules will continue to be enforced on Canada Day, when many people will be off work and may want to celebrate.

When asked whether these gatherings had anything to do with the situation where London party-goers had come to Waterloo Region, Murray said that the incidents were unrelated.

During the same time period when these charges were laid, enforcement officials had 142 site visits where they educated people about the emergency orders.

They also had 154 site visits where no action was required.

With these charges, the total now sits at 23 given out since the pandemic began.

Murray has said previously that in most cases, the fine would be given to the person facilitating the breaking of the emergency order, meaning the tenant or homeowner.

Contact tracing by the local health unit shows some of the people associated with the outbreak also went to events in Waterloo Region and Hamilton, according to Middlesex-London Health Unit Medical Officer of Health Dr. Chris Mackie.

Health officials say they're following up with anyone who's had close contact with the people who tested positive.

""The super-spreader events are something we really want to pay attention to and look closely at,"" Dr. Mackie said. ""It's why we're putting this messaging out and linking it directly to the Canada Day celebrations.

North, which started as Thalmic Labs in 2012, announced the news alongside a Google announcement on June 30.

The announcement from Google calls North, ""a pioneer in human computer interfaces and smart glasses.""

The company started with a focus on a device called Myo, a gesture-based device that strapped onto a user's forearm and allowed them to compute with their movements.

North then shifted its focus to Focals smart glasses, which the company says it will be winding down after the acquisition.

The company unveiled the product back in October of 2018, two years after receiving US$120 million in funding from investors like Amazon and Intel.

At one point the company had some 400 employees, but in February of 2019 it announced it was downsizing, something a Communitech spokesperson said at the time was ""not uncommon"" for a young company.

In its announcement, Google's Senior Vice President of Devices and Services, Rick Osterloh, says the decision was made to help it work towards ""ambient computing.""

""We’re building towards a future where helpfulness is all around you, where all your devices just work together and technology fades into the background,"" Osterloh explains.

CTV News reported earlier this month dozens of people were forced from homes in the area due to concern over the dam’s potential failure. The dam is located at Lake Wahtopanah on the Little Saskatchewan River.

In a news release on Monday, the province said it conducted onsite investigations using probes and water level monitoring to determine the safety of the dam.

Infrastructure Minister Ron Schuler said in a news release that people can now return home.

“The engineering assessment based on current conditions shows no substantial amount of damage to the dam from record flows over the past two weeks,” he said.

Record rains earlier this month caused high water levels on the Little Saskatchewan River, which impacted the following municipalities: Riverdale, Whitehead, Cornwallis, and the City of Brandon.

Staff at the Manitoba Emergency Measures Organization will contact municipalities about safe-return procedures.

The province noted it will still monitor the dam 24 hours a day until water levels have gone down. It also urges that all use of Lake Wahtopanah be suspended until the water recedes further.

490,ctvnews,https://winnipeg.ctvnews.ca/lights-camera-action-film-production-resumes-in-manitoba-1.5022117,"Lights, camera, action: film production resumes in Manitoba",['Kayla Rosen'],2020-07-13 10:59:00-06:00,"WINNIPEG -- Manitoba’s film industry is officially back in action, after halting productions due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

According to Rachel Rusen, Manitoba film commissioner and CEO of Manitoba Film and Music, the province’s low case numbers have made it possible for the industry to resume operations - granted it follows the necessary public health restrictions.

The first productions that are getting back to work are documentaries and TV movies, as they require smaller crews.

“This enables our Manitoba producers to implement the new protocols and have our Manitoba crews adapt to them first before scaling up to larger productions,” Rusen said in a statement.

As of last week, there were six shows in production in Manitoba, though two of these were feature animations that continued working throughout the pandemic.

Rusen noted some of the documentaries that have returned to production include: Science Fiction Makers, Dying to be Famous, and March of the Polar Bears.

Last Wednesday, July 8, marked the first day that crews started filming live-action scripted productions since the start of the pandemic, with the TV movie, called ‘A Secret to Keep.’

Rusen said there were also three projects in pre-production, also known as prep, last week.

“During prep is when a production office is opened; crews are hired; schedules are made; actors are cast; locations are scouted, permits obtained, equipment ordered, the costume department designs and builds wardrobe, the art department develops the look of the show that includes sets and props along with building any necessary sets,” she said.

Two of these projects are made-for-TV movies that will begin filming this week, and a feature film that is in prep for the summer.

HOW THE FILM INDUSTRY IS ADAPTING

Rusen said that even though things are resuming, the film industry has had to make adjustments. This includes hiring additional cleaners, bringing in health monitors for temperature checks, changing meal distribution plans, and limiting access to sets.

“Social distancing means shooting will likely take longer and that costs more; however that is the cost of being safe and being able to resume work,"" she said. ""The Manitoba film industry is committed to a safe and responsible return to production.”

Producer Cary Davis with Van Evera Productions, the company producing ‘A Secret to Keep’ along with production partner Neshama, said the biggest challenge was planning out how they would return for their first day of filming, because they managed to complete their prep while working from home.

“We drafted a set of protocols for working on set and shared this with all the different departments to get their input along with a registered nurse whom has extensive experience in a number of specialties including management of Intensive Care Units,” he said in a statement, noting that after a couple days of shooting things were going smoothly with the safety plan on set.

Davis added the COVID-19 pandemic has had a financial impact on the industry, as the public health protocols have created added costs.

“The biggest impact has been somewhat financially as these protocols do lead to significant extra expenses compared to pre- COVID filming,” he said.

“We all care a great deal about coming back to work safely and I’m happy that my partners in producing this project all came to the table to ensure we did so correctly.”

Arnie Zipursky, co-founder and producer for Neshama Entertainment ULC, said an “enormous” amount of thought and time has gone into what a safe set will look like.

“Manitoba has led Canada and our industry to be one of the safest locations in the world as the production community now commences since the pandemic shut down,” he said.

""I can't say no to a good time,"" said Edmonton Oilers fan Jeet Jermana. ""I'd be hard-pressed not to jump into a big party.""

On Friday, the NHL board of governors and NHL Players' Association said they had ratified the return-to-play plan, paving the way for the league to resume its pandemic-hit season later this summer.

Toronto and Edmonton were also officially unveiled as hub cities where all games will be played, beginning Aug. 1. Training camps start Monday in the 24 cities with teams still in the running for the Stanley Cup, including six in Canada.

In 2017, when the Oilers nearly advanced to the Western Conference final, Jermana was among the thousands of fans who partied in Ford Hall at Rogers Place arena and in bars along the popular Whyte Avenue district.

But with COVID-19 this year, where teams will play in empty arenas, Jermana said he'll likely watch more games at home, maybe with just a few friends.

That is, he said, until the Oilers advance and he and other fans won't be able to resist going out.

""Once it becomes the 'real playoffs' I think more and more the momentum will grab,"" he said.

Matt Black of Hotel X Toronto, located west of the city centre where multiple media outlets have reported that several teams will be based, said the prospect of any accommodation for celebratory fan gatherings, even outdoors, seems unlikely.

Nevertheless, Black said he expects citywide excitement will be palpable, even with empty arenas.

""You look back to those scenes of Jurassic Park and Maple Leaf Square and all of that ... it would be great for people to be able to get together again but you just need to make sure that you're doing it in a safe manner,"" said Black.

The players themselves aren't to have any contact with the general public.

Dr. Vinita Dubey, Toronto's associate medical health officer, said in an emailed statement that players and staff arriving from abroad will also have to serve a modified 14-day quarantine as well as undergo rigorous screening and daily testing protocols, wear masks in indoor settings, physically distance and wash hands often.

An Edmonton police spokesperson said the service wouldn't be able to comment over the weekend on what sorts of preparations they might make for crowds when the season resumes.

Geoff Grimble with the City of Edmonton said the city's civic events management team would likely discuss the issue during a scheduled meeting on Monday.

""The City of Edmonton's first priority is public safety and we'll continue to follow the advice and requirements of the Chief Medical Officer of Health to ensure fans, players, coaches and staff remain healthy,"" Grimble said.

Oilers fan Brendan McLeod admitted he may be lured to a street celebration when -- not if -- his team advances, but said he still wants to maintain physical distancing.

""We have to get through this together or else it's not going to change,"" said McLeod.

But Shadi Merhej, who said he enjoys both hockey and the Oilers, noted the sport doesn't have quite as strong attraction for him in the summer.

""It's daylight 'til 11 o'clock. You don't want to spend half your day watching hockey,"" Merhej explained.

""I'd rather go for a bike ride, or rollerblade or golf.""

The $44 million facility will be run by the University of Manitoba and is partnered with many other research and government organizations.

""We will be taking over control from the contractors this summer and early fall and will be able to do experiments starting this winter,"" said David Barber, the scientific director of the CMO

The research that will be done at the facility could affect future arctic shipping lanes and give a better understanding of how the Hudson's Bay affects Manitoba's weather.

WORLD'S FIRST SEAWATER FED OSIM

The marine observatory is home to a state-of-the-art ocean sea ice mesocosm (OSIM) that is the first of its kind in the world.

""It's like swimming pools that you can fill up with seawater from the ocean and freshwater from the Churchill River, and you can do controlled experiments on contaminants that could be liberated into the Arctic Oceans in the future."" said Barber.

The OSIM at the observatory is the only one in the world that can be filled with real seawater.

""This will be the only facility of its kind where seawater can be pumped in,"" said Barber. ""That means you can start looking at the base of the food chain like the virus and bacteria and go all of the way up to the zooplankton and algae.

Scientists will use the OSIM to look at how marine pollutants that ships carry, like oil, affect the arctic environment.

""If we had an oil tanker in the North Atlantic and it spilled its oil, how would we detect it, how would we clean it up, what would be the impact on the marine systems,"" Barber said.

OTHER HIGH TECH FEATURES

The Churchill Marine Observatory also features an environmental observing system, a string of high-tech moorings located on the ocean floor.

""They go from the Churchill Estuary out to the North Atlantic,"" said Barber. ""This provides us with an observing system to understand the natural conditions of the ocean sea ice atmosphere.""

Scientists can then bring the data back and use the OSIM to recreate and study the different kinds of sea ice conditions that occur naturally in that shipping lane.

The observatory also has a pier which will house its coastal research vessel, the William Kennedy.

The ship was acquired last year and allows researchers to study the coastal waters from Hudson's Bay all the way out to Baffin Island.

""The program is also designed around extreme weather because it changes the sea ice in Hudson's Bay, which affects the climate locally and regionally,"" added Barber. ""The climate in southern Manitoba is heavily constrained by whether there is ice in the bay or not.""

Churchill was chosen as the location for the observatory, not only because of the weather. The town is one of the only spots where you can dock a ship in the arctic.

The rail system lets researchers bring large equipment like boats and snowmobiles to the observatory.

Barber said around 50 scientists will visit the facility a year and that the observatory will continue to grow in the future.

""Future development will have to do to the internationalization of what we are doing here in Churchill and connecting it to other places in the circumpolar arctic.""",[]

As a partnership with the United States, somewhere between 10 and 100 American troops help out at the Canadian base in Winnipeg.

""There is a nice size American contingent here that are here for between 2-4 years,"" said Lt.-Col. Brian Hardeman of the U.S. Air Force. ""We are embedded in the community, and we are happy to be here.""

Hardeman said American troops go to school and play organized sports alongside Canadians.

As part of a bilateral agreement, the U.S. troops get to keep their licence plates, but that's been causing problems recently.

""Some of the dependent spouses and things of that nature have gotten some profanity at local business establishments, and some have been told to go back home,"" said Hardeman.

The Lieutenant-Colonel said there have been three ""outbursts.""

There was also an incident where two cars were keyed because of their American plates.

According to the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), the Americans are essential to the base and pose no risk of bringing COVID-19 into the community.

""Our American colleagues are very aware of this, and they certainly don't want to be a factor of the COVID-19 or a threat or a danger to us,"" said RCAF Col. Eric Charron, ""They wouldn't be serving in this capacity if they didn't believe that.""

Charron said he knows what being stationed in another country feels like firsthand, having lived in Germany and the Netherlands.

""Being accepted when you're in another country - a foreign country, it means the world,"" he said. ""The impression we make is going to last, and there are no second chances for a first impression.""

Charron said he has a reminder for Manitobans.

""We pride ourselves on being 'Friendly Manitoba,'"" said Charron. ""We pride ourselves that we are welcoming and accepting.""

Cars from the airbase can be identified by a window sticker of the Canadian Forces Base Winnipeg logo.

NDP MP Niki Ashton and Conservative MP James Bezan wrote a letter to Bernadette Jordan, the federal Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian coast guard, to take urgent action and provide support to the fishers.

“Commercial fishers in Lake Winnipeg and across Manitoba have no opportunity for income,” said Bezan.

“There was a promise made by the federal government. Minister Jordan and Justin Trudeau promised back on May 14 that there’s going to be almost $470 million that was going to flow to our commercial fishing industry across this country. And here we are, eight weeks later and not a single dollar has left the federal treasury.”

The MPs are specifically asking for the government to:

Make the Fish Harvester Grant Benefit and Fish Harvester Grant business programs accessible to fishers;

Identify a point person in Manitoba to work directly with fishers;

Involve the Freshwater Fish Marketing Corp. (FFMC) with making the programs more accessible; and

Work with fishers to ensure supply is available for foodbanks and other organization addressing food insecurity during the pandemic.

Ashton and Bezan also want the government to direct the FFMC, which is a Crown corporation, to find new markets to move higher volumes of pickerel and whitefish.

Liberal leader Dougald Lamont said this is an issue they’ve been working on.

“As provincial Liberals we actually made sure that Manitoba was part of the fish harvesting program,” he said.

“We made sure Freshwater Fish Marketing Corporation is going to be part of the federal food surplus program and we’re working with them actively to do that. That should actually mean that we could rescue the fall season.""

THE IMPACT ON MANITOBA’S FISHERS

Vince Crate, from Fish River Cree Nation, said the fishers in his community didn’t think it was feasible to go out on the lake this year due to issues regarding the expenses, demand and ability to sell the fish.

He said the demand for fish just wasn’t there this spring.

“In terms of fishing, there’s really been no fishing since the COVID crisis hit,” he said.

Crate noted the key drivers for the fishing industry are places like restaurants, which weren’t operational for much of the season.

“Fishing is the backbone of a number of First Nations and communities across our province,” said Ashton.

“This isn’t just about one fisher, it’s about their families, it’s about communities.”

In a statement, a spokesperson for the Office of the Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard said they recognize that this will be a different year for Canadian fisheries, which is why the federal government invested more than half a billion dollars into the seafood sector in the last two months through the Canadian Seafood Stabilization Fund, The Fish Harvester Benefit, and the Fish Harvester Grant.

The statement added they recognize harvesters’ earnings still might not be enough to establish a valid claim for Employment Insurance Fishing Benefits for the coming year, so they are allowing self-employed fish harvesters and sharepersons to establish a claim for EI Fishing Benefits based on insurable benefits in previous years.

“On May 20th Minister Jordan met with MP Ashton to discuss the concerns of Manitoba fish harvesters directly,” the statement said.

“The MP also sent a letter which received a detailed reply, again emphasizing that Manitoba commercial harvesters were eligible for the benefits our government has introduced in response to COVID-19. Manitoba fishers are not and have never been excluded from our support measures. The response also confirmed that FFMC will continue to provide vital support to its clients, and has committed to providing updates to harvesters on how its services will respond to EI changes in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic.""

At a news conference Tuesday afternoon, Mayor Brian Bowman along with Jay Shaw, who is with the city's emergency operations centre, announced the city will begin recalling approximately 195 Community Services Department employees to help bring the services back. The city previously recalled 400 employees in June.

Shaw said so far the city has recalled almost 700 workers and the remaining jobs are transit and community service staff.

The city said in late July and early August, all library branches will partially reopen, except for the Cornish Library, which is currently closed for renovations. The libraries will be open for holds pick-up service, phone reference service and to return borrowed library materials. The city will announce reopening dates and hours of operation in the coming weeks.

For those who are wondering when full services will resume, Shaw said there is no confirmed date for that yet.

""What we're trying to do is balance out the needs for safety of our staff and the public,"" said Shaw. ""I will strongly encourage you to continue to think about the new normal. Based on public health orders and where we are going, we need to be able to monitor as we get passed the Summer and into the Fall.""

He added that with the new normal, some of the changes might be more permanent as the city moves forward.

The city will also reopen the Pan Am Pool and the Cindy Klassen Recreation Complex on July 20. The two facilities will operate with limited access to the pools, walking tracks, and fitness equipment.

For those who are concerned about how people will social distance at these areas, Shaw said staff will be there to help enforce the rules.

""On occasion, someone forgets or maybe doesn't understand the rules, the staff are trained on how to approach those situations and generally what we find is when we tell someone 'hey we want you to stand here or there is a lineup' people are more than willing to comply. Everyone's chipping in,"" said Shaw.

He added that, for the most part, Winnipeggers have been very good at following the health guidelines.

Residents will have to register for swimming and fitness blocks, similar to current rules regarding outdoor pools. Details on registration will be released closer to reopening the city said.

Shaw said it is important that people book these swim and fitness blocks.

""I continue to encourage you to pre-register to avoid disappointment at the gates if the pools are full.""",[]

On Friday afternoon, Coun. Sherri Rollins, along with Michael Jack, the city's Chief Corporate Services Officer, presented a motion calling for the city to use recently gifted money to build one or more public washrooms and handwashing stations.

""I also have really been struck during the pandemic on access to washroom issues,"" Rollins said. ""I know that public washrooms are absolutely something that as Winnipeggers – as Winnipeg city council – we should be able to meet the needs of life, security, and dignity.""

In early June, the city was told it had been gifted $670,000 through the COVID-19 Community Response Fund for Vulnerable Populations (CRFVP). The money came with a catch, specifying a project that would use the funding had to be selected by mid-August and completed by February 2021.

""During an emergency, during a crisis like a pandemic, a lot of things happen out of order or in a way that isn't typical and these funding opportunities certainly came to our attention in a very atypical way,"" Jack told the city's protection, community services and parks committee.

Rollins and Jack are proposing the city use $620,000 of the funding to build one or more public washrooms that would be accessible 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. The location of these washrooms would be determined through consultation with End Homelessness Winnipeg and the public service.

The plan, if approved, says construction on the washrooms would be completed by February 2021.

The remaining $50,000 would be used to immediately rent temporary portable washrooms and hand washing stations in areas of the city that would best serve the homeless.

""Throughout this motion, you hear the echoed priorities of the homeless population – Winnipeg's most vulnerable – to access basic toileting facilities,"" Rollins told the committee on Friday.

""It is reflective of the point of time that we just went through, that we are likely going into again during the pandemic, on how key toilets are for residents, including those with disabilities, the necessity of toileting facilities especially in or in the vicinity of homeless encampments, and how important hand washing stations, toilets, showers, hygiene, and dignity is for residents.""

Jack told the committee there are a lot of unknown factors – including how much each unit would cost to build, but said he believes the funding would cover one to three public washrooms.

Jack said the Downtown Winnipeg BIZ estimates it would cost $12,500 annually to operate a public washroom, and said the city would look for ways to recoup that cost – suggesting sponsorships or advertising revenue.

He said as a last resort, they would need to look for funding in the city's operating budget.

""We would need to select a model that made the most sense and was hopefully the most cost-effective in terms of operating maintenance,"" he said. ""We would have to explore every single option.""

Rollins said the cost is worth it.

""There are costly consequences for public works when there are no hygiene and sanitation facilities,"" she said.

""Where homeless encampments are present, all along the riverbank, along Balmoral, has been replete with feces, urine, and rats in some cases, and that comes at a cost to not only the buildings – to schools sometimes – surrounding the riverbank, but to public works.""

The committee voted to pass the motion on Friday. It will now go to the executive policy committee for a vote before going to city council.",[]

The work, conducted by researchers at the Rady Faculty of Health Sciences and a virology lab at Universidad de Concepción in Chile, also found that if scientists don’t monitor how the virus is changing in different parts of the world, the testing could produce false negative results. Dr. Carlos Farkas, a postdoctoral researcher in pharmacology and therapeutics for the Max Rady College of Medicine and the Research Institute in Oncology and Hematology, was the study’s lead author.

To conduct the study, the research team used datasets to look at whole genome sequencing samples from people infected before March 27 with the virus that causes COVID-19.

According to a news release from the university, this team “was the first to combine genomic sequencing data from two worldwide sources in order to detect variants by geographic region.” The group found 146 different variants.

Dr. Jody Haigh, co-author and associate professor of pharmacology and therapeutics and a senior scientist at the Research Institute in Oncology and Hematology, said one of the major findings was that samples from Washington had a distinctive footprint of viral sequence changes.

“About 39 per cent of Washington State samples had this footprint. Asian and European samples were more diverse in terms of changes in viral sequence, but their footprints were clearly different from those in the U.S. samples,” Haigh said in the release.

The researchers noted when labs test for SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), they use small pieces of DNA that bind to the viral sequence and amplify viral RNA/DNA.

Farkas said in order for a robust positive test result, the DNA needs to exactly match the viral sequence.

“If researchers design these primers to bind to regions of the virus that they don’t realize have changed in a particular population, there may be poor amplification and the result can be false negatives,” Farkas said.

The study did find some changes in viral sequence in regions of the virus where the DNA was supposed to bind, which could explain why there have been some false negative testing results.

“Because SARS-CoV-2 is changing rapidly, researchers should be aware of its current local viral footprints in order to design DNA primers that don’t bind to regions of the virus that have changed. Other regions of the virus that don’t show these changes should be used for designing primers,” Haigh said.

The research team hopes its work will impact COVID-19 testing and vaccine development.",[]

Built in 1931, The Academy Uptown Lanes building's unique domes and ornate windows are an iconic part of the River Heights area.

""It's an integral part of the neighbourhood, and everyone knows it no matter what part of town they are from, said Ron Penner, the COO and senior VP of operations at Global Capital Management. ""One of the things many people did was take their kids here for birthday parties.""

Knowing the significance of the building, the team at Globe Capital Management were tasked with deciding what to put in it when the bowling alley moved in 2018.

""We spent some time thinking of what we can do,"" said Penner. ""We felt the neighbourhood was crying out for some multi-family. There's very little multi-family here.""

Construction broke ground last fall, and the original building is now just the historic shell.

Where two floors of bowling alleys once stood, steel girders now mark out the three levels.

""The main floor is going to have 5000 square feet of commercial space for stores, and then the upper floors are going to have 23 apartments,"" said Richard Morantz, the president and CEO of Globe Capital Management.

The apartments will feature modern amenities along with some historic charm like the vaulted steel beams.

According to Morantz, interest in the apartments is high.

""We've already leased six suites, and we've got a bunch of other inquiries and a waiting list,"" he said.

With the cost of renovations totalling $11 million, there's a lot on the line. So far, though, the historic building hasn't caused any problems.

""In anything like this, there are things you don't expect in a heritage building, but I have to say the process went very smoothly,"" said Morantz

The mussels, which are considered an invasive species, were found in Sipiwesk Lake, located north of Cross Lake, and is part of the Nelson River.

The government said this is the first time the mussels have been found in the lake.

The province said zebra mussels were first found in the South Basin of Lake Winnipeg in 2013. It expected that the mussels would move down the Nelson River naturally, and therefore the province designated the area as an aquatic invasive species (AIS) control zone in 2015.

The province then announced in August 2019 that the mussels were found in the Nelson River for the first time.

At that point, officials with the province notified nearby communities and stakeholders to tell them of the discovery.

Zebra mussels can cause a variety of problems for affected bodies of water as they can impact community drinking water systems.

They can also affect boat motors and shorelines. The mussels can also have negative impacts on water-based industries such as commercial fishing, lodge operators, and local tourism.

The province said the spread of zebra mussels and other invasive species is preventable and anyone who uses the water, whether it be boaters to beachgoers, the province said they can do their part.

There are bait and decontamination requirements that are in place at AIS control zones and people with boats, including canoes and kayaks, must stop at watercraft inspection stations when they are open.

The inspection stations are open until the middle of the fall.",[]

“It’s probably been about a good month and half, two months now that we’ve noticed various flavors not available,” said Munther Zeid, general manager at Food Fare.

But, it’s not just pop cans.

Luke Chapman, the interim president for Beer Canada, said the COVID-19 pandemic is changing the way Canadians consume beer.

He noted bars and tap rooms normally represent 20 to 25 per cent of total Canadian beer sales, but with the pandemic those sales are down, which has increased the demand for packaging materials such as cans and bottles.

“Based on what we have heard from both brewers and manufacturers, we are not at the crisis level yet but we have heard from some brewers that they are facing challenges sourcing aluminum cans,” Chapman said.

David Kaisaris, who owns the Riverside Beer Store, said the supply of canned beverages has been impacted by more than just the pandemic.

“It’s been a particularly difficult spring and summer because first we had COVID, then we had where our major supplier had a malware problem where they had to build, rebuild their whole SAP system over again,” he said.

Moosehead Breweries is also feeling the impact -- sending CTV News this statement: “We can confirm that we are seeing pressure on our can supply due to supplier production limitations, as well as increased demand from consumers for cans, both of which are adding to existing supply chain challenges resulting from COVID-19. We are actively working with all of our suppliers to minimize stock issues and impacts on our production.”

Chapman said the United States is experiencing the same market changes as Canada.

“So there’s been an increase in the demand for aluminum cans down there as well,” he said.

“It has resulted in certain brewers having to explore some further international markets to make up for the loss of supply.”

Zeid said he hopes there will be more product soon.

“We were told that there was a shortage at the beginning and that the U.S. was not allowing the export of aluminum tins and there’s a bit of shortage here and they’re trying to find another source,” he said.

The research, conducted in partnership with the University of British Columbia, was published on Friday in the academic journal Cell Host & Microbe. It said breastfeeding directly at the breast best supports the process.

“In this study, we looked at the breast milk and the stool of mothers and babies from a large national study called the Child Study,” said Dr. Meghan Azad, an associate professor at the University of Manitoba, who is involved with the study. “We did that because we’re interested in their microbiomes, so, the bacteria that live in and on our body that do so many important things.

“We think it’s really important to understand how that gets established very early in life.”

The research found some of the bacteria present in the mother’s breast milk are also present in the child’s stool.

“It tells us that maybe those particular bacteria are especially important,” Azad said. “Maybe they would be good candidates to be probiotics, outside of this spear of mothers and babies.

“It’s interesting because we know the microbiome is really important throughout our lives, so understanding how breast milk affects this early in life is important new information.”

Azad said the early development of the bacteria could help with a child’s health as they get older.

“We’ve shown that the bacteria in the infant's gut very early on, seems to be correlated with the risk of developing allergies and asthma very early in life,” she said. “In that early window of development, babies are still developing their immune system, and we know the gut bacteria is important for training their immune system to understand what is a harmful bacteria or pathogen, and what is a helpful one.”

Azad said there are 3,500 families participating in the study, with 1,200 samples used for this section of the study. They sampled the breast milk at three months of age, and sampled the stool at the same age, and then again at one-year-old. The babies are now eight-years-old, Azad said.

“There is lots more research to do to see how what we’ve found in this first study may be impacting the health of these children as they grow up,” she said.",[]

In many cases in Manitoba, reporting a sexual assault needs to be done in person, but soon students attending most post-secondary schools in the province will have more control when reporting sexual violence.

Mary Lobson is the project manager of Rees – short for Respect Educate Empower Survivors – the online reporting tool for sexual violence that will be released to nine post-secondary campuses in Manitoba this fall.

""We don't require any identifying information to actually make an account or use the platform,"" Lobson told CTV News. ""The only time you need to provide information is if you are wanting to reach out and get support.""

The website is designed to put users in touch with supports and information specific to their school, and the option to share their story.

""It's really up to the survivor how much information they want to share, to whom they want to share it and at what time,"" Lobson said.

She said each term, anonymous data sets will be given to schools to provide them with concrete numbers of when and where sexual assaults are occurring.

Allison Kilgour, a law student at the University of Manitoba and the advocacy coordinator for Students for Consent Culture, says this platform is a win-win.

""It's going to provide autonomy and choice and options and support for students, and it's also going to give institutions the ability to receive and track data that they never really had the option to track before,"" Kilgour said.

Lobson said Rees will also create consistency between schools that currently use different tracking methods. She said she hopes the platform will lead to more incidents getting reported and allow survivors to report assaults on their own terms.

Several players from teams around the league have decided to opt-out of the playoffs, but for Copp, that was never even considered.

""I haven't even thought about opting out once to be honest,"" said the forward. ""I love to play hockey, and I've been missing it for the last three months.""

Copp said being young, healthy and observing the NHL's strict guidelines, he isn't worried about getting the virus. He hopes the other players feel the same way.

""We all feel safe here, I feel like that helps us feel normal in the room even with the protocols,"" said Copp. ""We're able to see each other on the ice in a practice situation, that's the feeling we all desire at this point.""

Skating in Michigan during the pause, Copp said he's ready to play hockey.

""We are all professionals at this point, and we know how to get ready, whether it's three weeks or you get the whole offseason,"" he said. ""It's our job, and you have to be ready to go.""

Before the NHL went on hiatus, the Jets were on a four-game winning streak.

""To replicate that feeling is going to be hard, but hopefully, by having a good training camp and being ready to go and having an exhibition game, hopefully, all those things start to come back to us,"" said Copp.

Copp said the most important thing will be regaining the team's confidence.

Taking place in the two hub cities, Edmonton and Toronto, 16 teams will be battling it out over ten days to complete the initial round. The Jets will be taking on the Calgary Flames in a best of five series.

""Having five or six games a day, especially if they're playoff games and intense, it's going to be really fun to watch and be a part of,"" said Copp

“Without contact, it's unrealistic in terms of decision making for the players, and pressure, but we are doing what we can,"" said Valour FC head coach and general manager, Robert Gale.

With only a third of the roster from the inaugural season returning for a second year with the club, the limitations have made it difficult for players to build chemistry, other than some video conference socials held during the lockdown.

""You're not obviously going to get the ball skills not playing with your teammates as much,” recently acquired midfielder, Fraser Aird said.

“But keeping yourself physically fit during the whole thing out running and stuff like that is key because we never know what's going to happen so we need to be prepared for that.""

Further to the challenge of running practices while maintaining physical distancing, is the fact that no one knows exactly what the league will decide when it comes to when, where and how it plans to forego a season, if it even does.

“What's it going to look like? Is it a tournament? Will we get any games in? All of those factors are still unknown, so I think it's been a challenge,” Gale said.

The uncertainty has challenged some players’ ability to keep focused, with no season opener in sight.

“It's probably most mental (the effects), the whole pandemic thing and getting used to it and coming back to training not knowing what the outcome is going to be or when we are going to get the call,"" Aird said about the challenges of training during the pandemic.

With no firm start date, Gale says his staff has been taking a “scientific approach” in preparing for a potential season, using a “sliding scale” to gauge how hard to push his players.

""We had one for a potential June first start, a potential July first start, and a potential August first start,” Said Gale.

“Obviously as more information becomes available then we kind of ramp it up towards competition.""

On Thursday, Kelsey Wog was awarded the 2020 Lieutenant Governor Athletic Award for U Sports Female Athlete of the Year for the 2019-20 season.

Wog, who is in her fourth year at the university, captured four gold medals for the Bisons at the national swimming championships in February. Wog was preparing for the Olympic trials before the COVID-19 pandemic forced the postponement of the Olympics to 2021, as well as the Canada Swim Trials.

She was also named the 2020 U SPORTS Female Swimmer of the Year and Canada West Female Athlete of the Year.

""We are so proud of Kelsey and all that she has achieved at the University of Manitoba,"" said U of M director of athletics and recreation Gene Muller in a statement. ""This is an achievement our entire community should be proud of.""

According to the University of Manitoba, Wog is the second U of M athlete to win the national athlete of the year, and first since basketball player Terri-Lee Johannesson in 1997.

The winners are selected by a combined vote from the Canadian Athletic Foundation (75 per cent), and public voting (25 per cent).

After a successful first phase in its plan to return, the organization is now moving ahead with its second phase ahead of its July 1 start date.

Health and safety checklists related to COVID-19 for players, coaches, umpires, ballpark maintenance staff, as well as parents and spectators, are available on the Baseball Manitoba website. It has also created the new volunteer role of Health and Safety Coordinator which every team must have and who will attend every game to answer any questions and monitor the new regulations.

Among the new rules:

Players and coaches will need to maintain 2 meters of physical distance, including in the dugout;

Signage for physical distancing must be present at all fields;

Sanitizing areas will be established for spectators;

No chewing gum or sunflower seeds will be allowed on the premises in 2020;

Balls and equipment must be sanitized after every game; and

Facilities can operate at 50% capacity with people expected to remain two meters apart except for brief exchanges.

There are no rule changes to the game itself. Umpires can assume the traditional position behind the catcher, though, they have the option to stand 6 feet behind the catcher or behind the pitcher’s mound.

Players are encouraged to bring their own equipment, though it can be shared if it is sanitized between users.

If there happens to be an outbreak during the season, Baseball Manitoba executive director, Jason Miller, says it will be up to Manitoba Health to decide whether local leagues can move forward.

“If you’ve tested positive or have any symptoms you’re not to be at any baseball events. That’s clearly stated in our plan and on our signage,” said Miller.

“So, if that happens we will assess and we will take orders from the province as to how to proceed.”

The Winnipeg AAA league will kick off the season on July 1, with grassroots play expected to start later in July.

Miller says teams will only be playing games within Manitoba against other Manitoba teams, and while all national tournaments and championships have been cancelled, provincials may still be a possibility later in the season.",[]

“They say (it’s) going from zero to sixty,” said Basketball Manitoba Executive Director, Adam Wedlake. “We’re maybe going from zero to six - it’s pretty slow.”

Last week, Canada Basketball released its latest guidelines for Canadians to return to the sport, and it most notably excludes any kind of game scenario, whether competitive or in practice.

“It’s a return to the sport, basically in a training component.” Wedlake said. “The best way to describe it is social distanced practicing.”

Players will be expected to regularly monitor themselves for any symptoms of COVID-19 and will follow several strict guidelines upon return.

Players will be expected to:

practice with no more than two people at one basket

bring their own basketball and water bottles

refrain from passing their ball to other players

maintain physical distancing between other players and coaches.

“It will basically be shooting and ball-handling, dribbling drills and skills at least for the first few months.”

Wedlake believes these measures will remain in place until at least this fall, though the plan still needs to be approved by Manitoba health officials and Sport Manitoba.

The next challenge will be securing facilities for practices. Wedlake says Basketball Manitoba is keeping an eye on what the Manitoba High School Sports Association will decide when it comes to high school basketball in the fall, as gymnasiums used for practices are in schools.

“We’re a pretty heavy school-based sport,” Wedlake said. “What’s going to happen in the school system? Will there be school teams? Will the school system allow us to rent and get into their facilities on evenings and weekends?”

Manitoba Basketball isn’t the only entity with questions. The Manitoba Association of Basketball Officials has little information on how their jobs will change when play resumes. Supervisor of operations Mike Maryk says while local referees don’t have any major concerns to this point, there is speculation among officials as to what can be expected.

“You can look at potentially wearing gloves to avoid contact and stuff like that, but of course, how we communicate is with hand signals so it would certainly bring an interesting dynamic to it,” Maryk said.

While he contends having officials wearing masks during play would be near impossible based on the fact they obligated to have a whistle in their mouth throughout the game, he also wonders how sanitizing balls will come in to play.

“Depending on the level (you officiate) you let the captains check out the ball to see what it’s like, see if they like it,"" said Maryk.

“You would hate to be like ‘ok this stoppage we are going to switch and use this ball now while the other one gets taken out’ that would be a huge determent to the game, yet I say that and it could be the rule for all I know. Who knows what the foreseeable future brings?”

Basketball Manitoba is aiming to get players back on the court under these guidelines early next month, it does not expect games to be introduced into the return plan until much further down the road. Although Wedlake says the three-on-three game, or 3x3, may return sooner as it is mostly played outdoors. However, there is no timeline for when that may happen.",[]

Her sister-in-law warned her that the bear had already entered a nearby home earlier that night. The bear had gained access to the home by pushing an air conditioner out of a window, according to RCMP

Within a few hours, around 2 a.m. Monday, Mcleod said she heard a noise.

""I was kind of on edge because it was just the street over from me. I heard some banging outside and I peeked out and my garbage bin was flipped over.”

She didn’t see the bear at first and said that local security scared it away by driving by, but several minutes later she saw it again.

""I just happened to look outside because I was really paranoid because of what my sister told me. I looked outside and that’s when I got a glimpse of it walking right towards my front doorstep.

""I was like ‘oh my gosh, oh my gosh’ and I was so scared because I thought that the bear was going to try to come into my house.""

Mcleod said that the bear then sniffed around her garbage before security was able to scare it off again.

In the earlier incident, officers were advised by local security members that the bear had left the house and ran into the woods, RCMP say.

Police believe they found the bear a few hundred metres in the bush behind the home and it began running away as officers approached.

One resident of the home was injured while exiting the home and was taken to the medical clinic.

Conservation officers have set up a bear trap near the last known location of the bear, RCMP said.

Mcleod said she is still concerned because it hasn’t been caught yet. She hopes that the bear can be located and brought away from the community.

She and her daughter are getting out of town to their cabin because her daughter is too scared to sleep at home, she said.

Stanley Mission RCMP and the Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment are asking residents in the area to be careful and contact a conservation officer or the police if the bear is spotted.

They are also warning residents to be aware of items in the garbage or around their properties that may attract bears.",[]

Nearly 73 per cent said they have concerns or questions about getting students what they need to be successful with online instruction.

Also, 83 per cent of teachers said they are concerned about returning to school after the first phases of the COVID-19 pandemic.

ST-APOLLINAIRE, Que. - Quebec provincial police continued their search Sunday for the father of two deceased girls who were the subject of an Amber Alert earlier this week, a case that has gripped a small town southwest of Quebec City.

The bodies of Norah and Romy Carpentier, aged 11 and 6, were found in a wooded area of a Quebec City suburb on Saturday.

On Sunday, the manhunt for the girls' father, Martin Carpentier, 44, had authorities tightening the search in the woods.

“That's our priority now, to locate him as soon as possible,” said Sgt. Ann Mathieu, a provincial police spokeswoman.

Residents had helped with the searches until Saturday, but police asked people to stay away from the area Sunday to let police work.

“We're still asking residents to be vigilant, but the best way to help us is to take a look at their own properties,” Mathieu said.

The provincial police have been omnipresent since Thursday, when the Amber Alert was triggered. The search shifted to a manhunt Saturday after the bodies of the two young sisters from Levis, Que. were found.

The attention of the entire province has been on the case, especially in the town of just over 6,000 where it's playing out.

Police have transformed the parking lot of a community centre into a base of operations and helicopters have been taking off and landing at a nearby soccer field.

Cedric Lambert, a native of St-Apollinaire, which is about a 30-minute drive from Quebec City, said he never imagined he'd see this type of deployment in his quiet little corner of the province.

“Seeing police everywhere, helicopters, you wouldn't have believed it,” Lambert, 23, said. “Then to know that they found the little girls here is stressful.”

His partner, Marie-Myriam Dion, a mother of two, said she doesn't feel safe.

“I can't wait for them to find him,” she said. “I lock my doors at home as soon as I am alone.”

Lambert was concerned Carpentier could represent a danger, given he's been missing since Wednesday and couldn't very well return to town to buy food.

One local described the area as a prime hiding spot.

Gerald Rousseau, a St-Apollinaire resident for 40 years, lives about four kilometres from where the police are searching. He said there's plenty of places to hide in the densely forested area.

“There are plenty of small chalets around there, cabins, sugar shacks, trailers,” Rousseau said. “It's a good place to hide ... people come down on the weekends, but there aren't a lot of people coming down given what's happening, so there's often food left behind inside.”

He also did as police asked and surveyed his own property.

“I turned my own property over, I didn't find anything,” Rousseau said.

Police have said the girls and their father were believed to have been in a car crash on Highway 20 in St-Apollinaire on Wednesday evening.

Investigators said the car was heading east on the highway when it skidded into the median, flipped over and landed on the shoulder on the opposite side of the highway.

But police did not find any occupants inside the car when they arrived.

Lambert and Dion had joined the search on Saturday, criss-crossing the wooded area by car before the sisters' bodies were found, with autopsies to determine the cause of death still pending.

Those roads were closed Sunday as provincial police asked local residents to steer clear of the search area, saying their presence in the area on Saturday evening while acting on a tip was hindering officers.

“We know their intentions are very good, but what happened yesterday just complicated the work of the police officers,” Mathieu said.

Jocelyne Fortier lives in the neighbouring village of St-Agapit, where police have also looked.

“It's appalling, it's stressful,” she said. “We lock our doors, we don't know if it's dangerous or not.”

The car accident that triggered the investigation happened near her brother's residence. And the sisters remind her or her own nieces, about the same age.

“As soon as there are children involved, it's even more difficult,” Fortier said.

Carpentier was last seen wearing a grey T-shirt and jeans. He is listed as being five-foot-10 and weighing 130 pounds.

Anyone who sees Carpentier or has any information on his whereabouts to immediately contact 911.

This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 12, 2020.

528,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/n-w-t-ignored-in-alberta-monitoring-suspension-despite-agreement-leaked-emails-1.5021552,N.W.T. ignored in Alberta monitoring suspension despite agreement: leaked emails,['Bob Weber'],2020-07-13 05:03:00-04:00,"EDMONTON -- Alberta suspended environmental monitoring for oilsands companies without notifying the Northwest Territories, despite a legally binding agreement to do so.

The omission is revealed in a series of emails between the two governments obtained by The Canadian Press.

""We have been made aware ... that the Alberta Energy Regulator has indefinitely suspended several environmental monitoring requirements for major oilsands producers,"" wrote Erin Kelly, the N.W.T.'s deputy environment minister to her Alberta counterpart.

""Do you have any information that can be shared about this?""

The May 15 email was written more than a week after Alberta's regulator suspended a wide array of monitoring over what it said were public-health concerns raised by the COVID-19 pandemic. Kelly said her government learned about the move from news reports.

Ten days later, Kelly had not received a response.

""This is concerning to many N.W.T. residents, who still maintain subsistence lifestyles,"" she wrote May 25.

""With COVID-19 we have even more residents relying on food harvested from the land and it is almost certain that concerns related to reduced monitoring upstream will be brought up during (the upcoming legislative) session.""

Monitoring is expected to resume Wednesday.

The N.W.T. is downstream from the oilsands and in 2015 signed an agreement with Alberta that spelled out clear responsibilities on information-sharing, notification and consultation for cross-boundary waters.

In her second email, Kelly points to that deal.

""The (territory) has not been informed of or discussed new changes to monitoring as per (the agreement). I have yet to receive a response to my last email.""

An Alberta Environment and Parks email shows Kelly's second note provoked an ""urgent"" request within the department for a response to her concerns.

In answer to a request for an explanation for the lack of consultation, Alberta's United Conservative government provided a one-sentence email.

""There have been ongoing discussions and information-sharing with the N.W.T. on the status of ambient water quality monitoring at sites referenced in the Alberta-N.W.T. Bilateral Agreement throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, starting in March,"" wrote Alberta Environment spokesman John Muir.

Joslyn Oosenbrug, spokeswoman for the N.W.T. Environment Department, said several meetings were held in June to address the territory's concerns.

""Alberta has committed to sharing information and discussing any changes to monitoring,"" she wrote in an email. ""Communication is ongoing, and includes emails and letters exchanged at the deputy minister and ministerial level.""

However, the territory wants a stronger voice in managing water flowing into its land. It wants a seat on several committees that determine how waters will be monitored ""to ensure downstream interests are represented,"" Oosenbrug wrote.

Marlin Schmidt, environment critic for Alberta's Opposition New Democrats, said the snub showed a ""lack of respect.""

""It's really disappointing to me to see the government of Alberta is taking its relationship with other Canadians so lightly right now,"" he said.

""When our government is complaining about the poor treatment that we're allegedly getting from other Canadians, we should be treating (them) with the respect with which we expect to be treated.""

The N.W.T. isn't the only interested group that wasn't consulted about the suspensions. First Nations in the oilsands area, environmental groups, Alberta's chief scientist and the scientific consultants who perform monitoring work all say they were left out of the decision.

The government has said the move was made in response to concerns from the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers about operators not being able to meet certain monitoring requirements while complying with COVID-19 orders.

Alberta has yet to release work plans or budget for this year's field season of a joint federal-provincial program responsible for environmental monitoring outside various oilsands leases. Industry, which funds the efforts, has been lobbying heavily for a less extensive and cheaper plan.

The 116 new cases reported Monday is a slight decrease from the 129 reported on Sunday and the 130 reported on Saturday.

“Having seen a continued decline in the number of new COVID-19 cases as the province entered Stage 2, and with hospitalizations being at all-time lows, today we’re providing details about Stage 3 of our plan to continue the safe and gradual reopening,” Ontario Health Minister Christine Elliott said on Monday.

The province also reported that three more people have died due to COVID-19. Ontario’s total number of lab-confirmed cases of the disease now amounts to 36,839, including 2,722 deaths and 32,663 recoveries.

Where are the COVID-19 cases?

Elliott said that 29 of the province’s 34 public health units have reported five or fewer new cases of the disease on Monday, with 21 of them reporting no new cases at all.

According to Monday's epidemiology report, 38 of the new cases were found in Peel Region, six were found in York Region, 34 were found in Toronto and 15 were found in Windsor-Essex, a region that has been grappling with outbreaks among migrant workers.

Of the new cases in Ontario, 88 are between the ages of 20 and 59. There are nine patients who are 19 years old or younger and 18 patients who are over the age of 59.

The majority of total deaths to date have been reported in people over the age of 79. One person under the age of 19 who had COVID-19 has died in Ontario, but it is not clear if the death was caused by the disease or other health issues.

Eleven patients who died were between the ages of 20 and 39, while 111 were between the ages of 40 and 59, and 723 were between the ages of 60 and 79.

More than 1,800 people over the age of 80 have died of the disease, many of whom lived in long-term care homes.

As of Monday, there were 104 people in the hospital due to COVID-19. Twenty-eight of those patients are in the intensive care unit and 20 of them are breathing with the assistance of ventilators.

“The number of COVID-19 patients receiving care in hospital has dropped significantly from the highs of over 1,000 reported in May,” Elliott said in a statement posted to Twitter.

“ICU admissions and vented patients have also seen a persistent decline since the peak of this pandemic.”

COVID-19 testing in Ontario

In the last 24 hours, just over 20,000 COVID-19 tests were conducted by officials.

Ontario health officials have conducted more than 1.7 million tests for the disease since the pandemic was declared.

More than 7,000 tests are still under investigation.",[]

Canmore RCMP, along with Kananaskis Public Safety and Kananaskis Emergency Services, were called to an area near Mount Yamnuska for reports a hiker had fallen.

The report indicated the 30-year-old man from Calgary was hiking in the scree section of the trail at about 2:10 p.m. Saturday when he fell approximately six metres.

While the injured male was being helped by a number of bystanders, several boulders came free from the slope and fell down on top of them.

The victim suffered a head injury as a result. The bystanders remained at the scene and administered first aid until help arrived.

Crews from both Alpine Helicopters and STARS Air Ambulance attended the scene but, unfortunately, the man died of his injuries.

The victim's identity is not being released as officials are notifying family.

""Unfortunately (Saturday) at Yamnuska was very busy for first responders,"" said Cpl. Sabrina Clayton of the Canmore RCMP detachment.

TWO OTHERS INJURED ON THE SCREE SLOPE

Leaders from the mountain climbing community say the section of trail is notoriously tricky if not treacherous.

""Injuries and accidents on Yamnuska go back as far as people have been heading up there to hike and climb,"" said Brandon Pullan, editor-in-chief of Gripped magazine.

""There’s no denying it, there’s a lot that can go wrong. It just takes one loose rock or a foot to slip. But if you are in the climbing or the mountain community, you should be prepared to lose people.""

RECENT FATALITIES

At the end of June a woman died in a fall on nearby Mount Fable.

Trina Ramanaden is remembered by friends and family as an avid hiker.

According to Kananaskis rescue officials. helicopters spotted her body on the southeast ridge of the mountain face.

Charles Mark, a resident of the nearby Stoney Nakoda First Nation says he is saddened to learn of the recent fatal incidents and says preparation and reflection is important before any mountain experience.

""You have to respect the mountain. Before you go up the mountain always offer tobacco and pray then you go up.""

RCMP are also advising extra caution especially for novice hikers and climbers.

""When in doubt, talk to a professional if you’re unsure about what equipment you might need the route you are going to be taking and just always be prepared for unfortunately anything that can happen in the backcountry,"" said Cpl. Clayton.

YAMNUSKA TRAIL CLOSED AS OF JULY 12

Following the multiple incidents on the popular trail, officials have temporarily closed the area until further notice.

According to Alberta Parks, there is a high risk of rockfall in the area of the trail and some areas should not be attempted by the inexperienced.

In a statement provided to CTV News on Sunday, WE Charity said that extra staff had been hired “specifically to support the administration of the CSSG program and are not part of WE Charity’s permanent staff.

“With the Government funding no longer available, we had to make the incredibly difficult decision to end the contracts for those hired to deliver the CSSG program.”

Although the charity has been in the hot seat before, they came under increased scrutiny at the end of June when the federal government announced that they were partnering with WE to create the Canadian Student Services Grant.

The program was meant to help tens of thousands of Canadian students having trouble finding summer work during the pandemic by allowing them to volunteer up to 500 hours to earn the maximum $5,000 toward their post-secondary costs.

WE itself was promised up to $19 million in payment, depending on the number of students who were recruited to participate.

The deal was terminated on July 3 after allegations of a conflict of interest came up over connections between the charity and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his family.

WE Charity said in their statement that additional pay had been provided “based on tenure” and that contractors had been compensated for the time that they had worked.

The statement did not disclose how many staff had been laid off.

The statement added that since they had received 35,000 applicants for the program early on, they had initially recommended to the government that their contractors’ contracts be continued -- something that changed when the program was shut down.

“WE Charity made the decision to not take any of the funds that were allocated to pay for the work delivered for the CSSG program,” the statement said. “All sunk costs and remaining payments to contractors and vendors are being paid for by WE Charity.”",[]

Conservative finance critic Pierre Poilievre laid out the demand Sunday amid growing pressure on Trudeau and Liberal cabinet ministers to explain the genesis of the sole-sourced deal with WE, which was announced late last month before being cancelled days later.

""He needs to explain where exactly the idea came from,"" Poilievre said during a news conference on Parliament Hill in which he acknowledged the rarity of prime ministers appearing before parliamentary committees.

""Did the WE organization call him and suggest it? Did it come through the staff in his office? Did it come out of his own head? Did members of his family who had been paid by the organization suggest it to him. We need to hear directly from him on these questions.""

Trudeau announced the Canadian Student Services Grant on June 25, saying tens of thousands of students having a hard time finding summer work due to COVID-19 could volunteer up to 500 hours to earn the maximum $5,000 toward their post-secondary costs.

But the program came under immediate scrutiny after it was discovered that WE had been chosen to administer it. Trudeau said federal public servants had recommended the organization and that it was considered the only one capable of delivering the program.

Trudeau nonetheless faced accusations of cronyism and allegations of a conflict of interest over his past connections with WE. Those allegations have only grown after revelations his wife, brother and mother have been paid a combined $300,000 for appearing at a number of WE events.

The prime minister and Finance Minister Bill Morneau have both confirmed they did not recuse themselves from the cabinet vote that approved giving the contract to WE. One of Morneau's daughters has spoken at WE events while another does contract work for the organization.

Morneau's office has denied any link between his daughters' work and the WE agreement. The Conservatives and NDP have nonetheless asked Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion, who is already investigating Trudeau over the deal, to also look into a potential conflict of interest by Morneau.

The government and WE terminated the deal on July 3, which had promised the organization up to $19 million in payment depending on how many students participated. The federal employment and social development department has since taken over the program.

Poilievre said it is essential the prime minister appear before the finance committee personally to answer questions about the deal given that the controversy involves him personally and the House of Commons has been largely suspended due to COVID-19.

""Now there are two ways that this can be done,"" Poilievre said. ""Either the prime minister can agree voluntarily to show up and attend and respect the invitation of a parliamentary committee. That is what he will do if he has nothing to hide.

""Or Parliament can compel him to appear. Something that would take longer, but could be done -- and should be done -- if the prime minister hides from accountability.""

Such a move would need support from the Bloc Quebecois and NDP to even have a chance. Poilievre had yet to present his plan to the other parties on Sunday, but said: ""If the opposition parties are interested in getting to the truth, they will vote in favour of that motion.""

The Bloc Quebecois did not respond to requests for comment on Sunday while NDP finance critic Peter Julian was noncommittal.

""New Democrats believe in getting to the bottom of this and the more answers we get (including from Trudeau and Morneau) the quicker we can get those answers for the Canadian public,"" he said in a statement. ""Canadians want answers and they need to know this won't happen again.""

Even if the opposition parties agree to order Trudeau to appear before the committee using their superior numbers in the House of Commons, there is no guarantee it would happen, said University of Ottawa parliamentary expert Philippe Lagasse.

While the House of Commons can compel a member of Parliament to appear before a committee, Lagasse says that MP -- in this case the prime minister -- would likely ask the Speaker to rule on whether the request is appropriate or not.

""The House can say: 'In this case, we really need to hear from this person and therefore we're going to force them to appear,""' Lagasse said. ""But that would require a ruling from the Speaker in all likelihood because there would be some differences of interpretation.""

None of which addresses when Parliament would have a chance to address the issue, Lagasse said, given that the House of Commons is only scheduled to sit a total of three days between now and Sept. 21.

Authorities were called to a North York apartment building, in the Weston Road and Finch Avenue area, just after 10 a.m. on Saturday morning.

Police said when they arrived they located two children, a six-month-old girl and a four-year-old boy, suffering from stab wounds inside an apartment unit.

A video sent to CTV News Toronto by a viewer shows a woman being led into the back of a police cruiser in handcuffs. It also shows what appears to be the children being carried into an ambulance.

The children were rushed to SickKids Hospital with serious injuries, police said. Their injuries were initially deemed life-threatening but police later said their condition improved and are expected to survive.

Const. Alex Li said the 36-year-old mother, who was arrested at the scene, has been charged with two counts of attempted murder, two counts of assault and two counts of aggravated assault.

The identity of the woman will not be released, police said, to protect the identity of the victims.

""This is a very serious stabbing and we're taking this very seriously,” Li said. “We have deployed our available resources to look into the matter... You can expect an active crime scene.""

""Having young children myself, I couldn't imagine that type of trauma and injury,"" Li said.

Dixon took the lead shortly after a caution flag and beat Will Power by 2.5386 seconds. They were followed in order by Alex Palou, Ryan Hunter-Reay and Colton Herta.

Dixon has won each of the three IndyCar races in the pandemic-delayed season. He's the first IndyCar driver to start a season with at least three consecutive victories since Sebastien Bourdais reeled off four straight to start the 2006 campaign.

The only other drivers to open an IndyCar season with at least three straight victories are A.J. Foyt (seven in 1964) and Al Unser (three in 1971).

This marked the first time spectators were allowed in an IndyCar event this season after they weren't permitted in races at Fort Worth or Indianapolis. IndyCar is treating each event separately and following local and state health regulations at each track as it decides whether to allow fans.

""It's so cool to be back on a track with fans,"" Dixon said. ""And there's tons of them here today.""'

Dalton Kellett of Stouffville, Ont., was 20th.

Saturday's race took drivers 55 laps around a course that's just over 4 miles long with 14 turns.

Dixon qualified ninth Saturday for his worst starting position of the young season, as he'd started second in Fort Worth and seventh in Indianapolis. He wasn't a factor early in this one as Josef Newgarden was in command for the first half of the race.

Newgarden had grabbed the pole position earlier in the day and seemed on his way to winning at Road America for the second time in three years until he stalled coming out of his second pit stop and fell back in the pack. He ended up 14th.

Power owned a narrow lead over Dixon when Jack Harvey went off the track to produce a caution flag with 17 laps remaining. Dixon pulled ahead of Power coming out of the pits on the restart and stayed ahead after two more caution flags.

The second caution flag came when Conor Daly slid off the course after making contact with Pato O'Ward, knocking Daly out of the race and wrecking his Chevy. The final one came when Dalton Kellett went off course.

Dixon's latest victory was the 49th of his career, putting the New Zealander him behind only Foyt (67) and Mario Andretti (52).

Road America's setup made it an ideal venue for IndyCar to start allowing fans. The sprawling, 640-acre layout surrounding the course allows fans to practice social distancing and roam the property rather than crowding into a grandstand.

""Since we've been here before, we know there's plenty of room,"" said Jason Shelley of Indianapolis, who said he usually attends four or five IndyCar races each year. ""It's kind of like watching a race in a state park, so this is the one place where I feel comfortable and safe because I know I can get away from people. I'm not going to be stacked on top of people. That's why we came.""

Steve Lemon, a fan from Kankakee, Illinois, who usually attends about three races a year, said that ""if it had been an oval, we wouldn't have gone.""

Fans received temperature checks at gates and received masks and hand sanitizer as they entered.

Wearing a mask was encouraged but not required, and a stroll through along the Road America property indicated the majority of spectators were spending at least part of the time unmasked.

""All the staff and drivers and everybody are wearing masks, but I don't think the fans are quite as good about it,"" said Jim Cossaart, a spectator from Bristol, Vermont. ""Human nature, I guess.""

IndyCar also plans to have spectators next weekend for a doubleheader in Iowa, where the oval track has grandstands. IndyCar is hoping fans will fill 50% of the speedway's capacity for the Indianapolis 500 on Aug. 23.",[]

In screenshots from a now deleted post, the driver made the unfounded claim that the coronavirus is “not dangerous to those with good immune systems” and that people don’t need a vaccine “that will make us even more sick.” He says he came to these conclusions after doing some ""research.""

“Today, I no longer disinfect my bus because it is a false pandemic in order to better control people,” he wrote.

There is no evidence to support the driver's claim that the COVID-19 pandemic is ""false."" More than 12 million people around the world have become infected with the novel coronavirus; some 548,000 have died.

The Societe de transport de Montreal (STM) said in an email to CTV News that all buses are cleaned daily by maintenance teams, but “of course, we also ask our employees to follow public health and hygiene guidelines.”

The STM took to Twitter to add that ""One bad apple doesn't spoil the bunch."" The agency says it employs 11,000 people, ""and the very vast majority of them are doing a tremendous job following strict measures and recommendations in place since the beginning of the pandemic, to protect clients, colleagues and themselves altogether.""

Though the STM wouldn’t reveal how it intends to move forward with this particular driver, it said “it is our best practice to meet with employees to remind them of the instructions in force.”

A photo posted to the driver’s Facebook page suggests he’s also against the wearing of masks – which is set to become mandatory on all public transit in Quebec as of July 13. When Premier Francois Legault made the announcement last week, he said it would be up to bus drivers to refuse entry to passengers who aren’t wearing masks. No other enforcement measures will be in place.

The driver admitted that at the beginning of the pandemic, he showed up to his shifts 30 minutes early to disinfect his bus.

“I made a barrier to stop passengers from speaking to me… and I washed my hands a minimum of 20 times per day,” his post said. ""But with time, I found that something was wrong.""",[]

Musk, who has made premature predictions about the advent of completely autonomous cars before, offered the updated timetable in a pre-recorded message to a Shanghai tech fair.

""I'm extremely confident that 'Level 5', or essentially complete autonomy, will happen, and I think will happen very quickly,"" Musk said.

""I remain confident that we will have the basic functionality... complete this year.""

In years past, Musk had said Tesla may develop the technology for a completely autonomous vehicle by 2018, and then last year he said it may come by early 2020.

The California-based electric carmaker became the world's most valuable auto manufacturer earlier this month and its shares have soared this year thanks to strong output figures despite disruptions from the coronavirus epidemic.

The complexity and autonomy of self-driving car technology is classified up to ""Level 5"". Lower levels feature some combination of autonomous decision-making by the vehicle, along with as-needed human intervention.

But Level 5 denotes a car that requires no human intervention at any time, allowing the passenger to sleep or watch a movie while the car handles all navigation as well as adjustments to avoid collisions.

Tesla already enables partial autonomy for its cars, but analysts say the road to full autonomy faces considerable legal and regulatory hurdles, not to mention getting consumers to feel comfortable entrusting their cars with full control.

Instead of closing the gap to front-runner Mercedes this season, Ferrari's SF1000 car looks slower than last year and is also in danger of slipping behind other teams.

""The SF1000 didn't measure up, even compared to expectations,"" was Ferrari's blunt assessment.

Ferrari failed in qualifying at the season-opening Austrian Grand Prix, with Charles Leclerc only seventh -- having taken the most pole positions in 2019 -- and Sebastian Vettel a dismal 11th.

Leclerc's second-place finish in that race was more about his composure amid crashes than the car's speed. Vettel, who finished 10th, was so irked about lack of balance he called the car undriveable.

It means that Ferrari team principal Mattia Binotto is facing increasing pressure, given that the team was already way behind Mercedes in the drivers' and constructors' titles in 2019.

His decision making also faced scrutiny after a sudden change of strategy, three days before the first practice session in Austria.

He announced a different direction in terms of aerodynamic development, which effectively meant there could not be any car upgrades until the third race in Hungary next week.

But then hierarchy intervened.

Ferrari CEO Louis Camilleri felt it was necessary to stop slipping back further and some of the aerodynamic package -- scheduled for Hungary --will be introduced in Austria.

""This is certainly not the grid position that a team like Ferrari should have and we have to respond immediately,"" Camilleri said. ""It's clear that we have to improve on all fronts.""

This weekend's race is the second of eight races during a hectic 10-week European swing.

The GP itself is changing names yet is still being held at the Red Bull Ring in Spielberg -- surrounded by the Styrian mountains it is now being named after.

Different name, same objective for Red Bull driver Alexander Albon.

While Lando Norris secured his first career podium last weekend -- the youngest British driver ever to do so in F1 at the age of 20 -- Albon narrowly missed out on a first podium for the second time in three races.

Both times Hamilton was directly involved.

With a few laps left last Sunday it was Albon was on better tires than Hamilton and his Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas, who won the race.

Albon made a hasty but clean move on the outside Hamilton, who appeared to slightly nudge his car left against Albon's passing wheel. Albon span off track while Hamilton was given a five-second time penalty, moving him from second to fourth.

Last November in Brazil, in the penultimate race of 2019, they chased second place on the second-last lap. Hamilton tried to pass Albon on the inside and clipped his car, sending Albon spinning down to 14th.

Albon was frustrated after Sunday's race, which proved doubly disheartening for Red Bull as Max Verstappen retired early when in second place.

But team principal Christian Horner sees cause for optimism.

""I believe the potential is there to fight Mercedes. Perhaps not over a single lap but over the course of the season,"" he said. ""Our race pace looked pretty decent with Max and Alex, so I think we've got the basis of a good car.""

It remains uncertain whether drivers will again take the knee in support of racial equality on Sunday. Hamilton wore a Black Lives Matter T-shirt last time, when 14 of the 20 drivers took the knee.

""I want people to feel excited to be a part of the change,"" Hamilton said. ""To me it was an emotional and poignant chapter in the progress of making F1 a more diverse and inclusive sport.""",[]

In a ruling Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Paul Borman wrote that GM's alleged injuries were not caused by FCA violating federal racketeering laws. He wrote that GM has not stated a claim that can be granted, so the case must be dismissed.

GM said it disagreed with the ruling and will pursue legal remedies.

The ruling came after a federal appeals court on Monday overturned Borman's order that the CEOs of both companies meet in person to talk about settling the case. But the court denied GM's request to assign the case to another judge.

In the lawsuit, GM alleged that Fiat Chrysler bribed officials of the United Auto Workers union to get lower labour costs, giving FCA an advantage over its Detroit-area rival. GM alleged that FCA CEO Sergio Marchionne wanted to pressure GM into merging by weakening GM with higher labour costs.

In his ruling, Borman wrote that GM's “pay to harm” theory initially had appeal “but fails on a closer look.”

GM alleged that FCA used bribes to get the UAW to deny GM concessions that were given to Fiat Chrysler. But Borman wrote that the UAW wouldn't give the concessions to any company that didn't pay bribes. Therefore, GM's labour costs weren't any higher than they would have been without the bribes.

“In other words, FCA's UAW workers were the direct victims of the bribes because they were paid less, and GM suffered only an indirect competitive harm,” Borman wrote.

GM failed to show facts backing up the claim that it was harmed by Fiat Chrysler's actions under federal racketeering laws, Borman ruled.

FCA denies that it directed any prohibited payments. Its former labour chief, Al Iacobelli, is in prison after pleading guilty in 2018 to conspiracy and tax crimes in a scheme worth more than $1.5 million. He admitted that he turned the budget of a company-sponsored training centre into a slush fund.

Earlier, Borman described GM's lawsuit as a “nuclear option” that would be a “waste of time and resources” for years if he allowed the case to move forward. That prompted GM to ask an appeals court to change judges.

Federal agents have been rooting out corruption in the senior ranks of the UAW. The first wave of convictions in 2017 involved key FCA employees who used money from a jointly run training centre to reward union officials.",[]

Michael Taylor, a 59-year-old U.S. Army Special Forces veteran, and his 27-year-old son Peter Taylor are wanted in Japan on allegations that they helped Ghosn flee the country in December while he was out on bail and awaiting trial on financial misconduct allegations.

The Taylors are urging a judge to order their immediate release from jail while they challenge Japan's extradition request, arguing among other things that their health is in danger behind bars because of the coronavirus pandemic. Their lawyers say the men don't pose a risk of flight or danger to the community.

The defence says the Taylors were unlawfully arrested and argue they can't be extradited because “bail jumping” is not a crime in Japan and, therefore, helping someone evade their bail conditions isn't a crime either.

“Even assuming the Taylors were properly arrested, holding them without bail on a tenuous charge in a jail that has been plagued by COVID-19 violates their Fifth and Eighth Amendment rights. This is especially the case because neither is a risk of flight and there are undoubtedly conditions under which they can be released,” their attorneys told a judge in a filing this week.

Authorities say the Taylors helped sneak Ghosn out of the Japan on a private jet with former Nissan boss tucked away in a large box. The flight went first to Turkey, then to Lebanon, where Ghosn has citizenship but which has no extradition treaty with Japan.

Ghosn said he fled because he could not expect a fair trial, was subjected to unfair conditions in detention and was barred from meeting his wife under his bail conditions. Ghosn has said he is innocent of allegations he under-reported his future income and committed a breach of trust by diverting Nissan money for his personal gain.",[]

Trump suggested Bubba Wallace should apologize after the sport rallied around him after the noose was found in his assigned stall at Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama. Federal authorities ruled last month the noose had been hanging since October and was not a hate crime. NASCAR and the FBI have exclusively referred to the rope -- which was used to pull the garage door closed -- as a noose.

It was the only garage pull out of 1,684 stalls at 29 inspected NASCAR tracks to be fashioned as a noose.

NASCAR President Steve Phelps has bristled at suggestions the noose was a hoax. Wallace was shown a photograph of the noose, never personally saw it, and was told by NASCAR officials he was the victim of a hate crime.

""Has @BubbaWallace apologized to all of those great NASCAR drivers & officials who came to his aid, stood by his side, & were willing to sacrifice everything for him, only to find out that the whole thing was just another HOAX?"" Trump tweeted. ""That & Flag decision has caused lowest ratings EVER!""

The tweet came after Trump used a pair of Independence Day speeches to dig deeper into America's divisions by accusing protesters who have pushed for racial justice of engaging in a ""merciless campaign to wipe out our history."" The remarks served as a direct appeal to the Republican president's political base, including many disaffected white voters, with less than four months to go before Election Day.

Wallace responded on Twitter with a note to ""the next generation and little ones following my foot steps"" in which he urged people to use their platform and not be detracted by ""hate being thrown at you.""

""Love should come naturally as people are TAUGHT to hate,"" Wallace tweeted. ""Even when it's HATE from the POTUS .. Love wins.""

White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany defended the president's decision to wade into the Wallace case, likening it to actor Jussie Smollett's claims he was a victim of a hate crime. McEnany criticized the press in a White House briefing, calling Trump's tweet a ""complete indictment of the media's rush to judgement.""

McEnany declined to explain why the president thought Wallace should have to apologize given he didn't report the noose. McEnany refused to say whether or not the president supports NASCAR's ban on the Confederate flag.

NASCAR did not directly address the Trump tweet in a Monday statement.

""We are proud to have Bubba Wallace in the NASCAR family and we commend his courage and leadership,"" NASCAR said. ""NASCAR continues to stand tall with Bubba, our competitors and everyone who makes our sport welcoming and inclusive for all racing fans.""

Andrew Murstein, co-owner of the Richard Petty Motorsports team that fields Wallace's car, called Trump's tweet ""a late, misinformed, and factually incorrect statement."" He also said it was unwarranted and cited the photo NASCAR released of the noose.

""A picture is worth a thousand words,"" Murstein said in a statement. ""Bubba has reacted in a truthful, professional, level headed manner. The NASCAR community and those in the know all stand by him.""

Wallace led the push for NASCAR to ban Confederate symbols at tracks. Two weeks later, the noose was found at the first race some fans were allowed to attend since the shutdown. On the same day, a plane pulling a banner of the Confederate flag that read ""Defund NASCAR"" was circling the track and protesters outside the speedway displayed their flags.

Two NASCAR drivers came to Wallace's defence Monday. Seven-time NASCAR champion Jimmie Johnson, currently sidelined with the coronavirus, posted an image of Wallace's No. 43 that had been used by drivers in an earlier .IStandWithBubba campaign. Rookie Tyler Reddick tweeted but later deleted a reply to Trump that read: ""We don't need an apology. We did what was right and we will do just fine without your support.""

LeBron James and Chelsea Clinton were among those outside of NASCAR who backed Wallace on social media, with James stating he stands with Wallace.

NASCAR's complex relationship with Trump dates to early in his campaign when former chairman Brian France brought a contingent of drivers to a rally in Georgia.

France later sent a memo to NASCAR employees stating his political beliefs were his own and he was not speaking on behalf of the organization. France was replaced as chairman following his arrest for driving while impaired in 2018.

Other members of the France family welcomed Trump to Daytona for the season-opening race in February. Many drivers and owners mingled with Trump and posted selfies with the president.

Wallace, who was born in Alabama, has taken an active role in the push for racial equality. He has worn a shirt saying ""I Can't Breathe,"" and raced with a Black Lives Matter paint scheme in Virginia.

Ramsey Poston, a former NASCAR consultant and now head of crisis management firm Tuckahoe Stategies, said Trump's tweet is harmful to NASCAR's push for inclusion. Wallace is one of just a handful of non-white drivers. Daniel Suarez is Mexican and Aric Almirola is of Cuban descent. Kyle Larson, who is half-Asian, was fired in April for using a racial slur.

""The brewing cultural war within NASCAR for equality has just erupted and the sport's efforts to separate from its past just got tougher,"" Poston said. ""The president's comments are essentially a rallying call for people who support the Confederate flag to challenge the sport's recent flag ban and create chaos.""

While Trump claimed NASCAR's ratings are down, they are actually up. Michael Mulvihill, executive vice-president at Fox Sports, tweeted that Fox viewership is up 8% since the sport returned from the pandemic hiatus on May 17. NBC took over the broadcast rights this past weekend and said its ratings for Sunday's race were up 46% from last year's event at Indianapolis.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-SC, pushed back against Trump's NASCAR tweet on Fox News Radio, saying NASCAR is trying to grow the sport by removing divisive symbols.

""I don't think Bubba Wallace has anything to apologize for,"" Graham said.

The probe covers more than 614,000 Cobalts from the 2008 to 2010 model years and HHRs from 2008 and 2009.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says it has 208 complaints from owners about gasoline leaks. Thirty-nine owners have told the agency about gas puddles or drips from leaky fuel lines toward the left rear wheel well. The agency says in documents posted Tuesday that the leaks are caused by corrosion of metal fuel lines near polymer blocks that hold the lines to the body. The leaks are beneath an insulation heat shield near the exhaust pipe and muffler.

The agency says it doesn't have any reports of crashes, fires or injuries. It says the probe will determine how often the problem happens and assess potential safety issues. Investigations can lead to recalls.

GM said in a statement that it's co-operating in the investigation. The company said owners who see a leak or smell gas should contact a Chevrolet dealership.",[]

“It really reminds me on the SNC Lavalin scandal, because it’s coming out in drips and drabs,” Scheer told CTV Morning Live.

Scheer said Conservatives are calling for all documents pertaining to Trudeau’s relationship with the WE Charity be made public. This follows confirmation that members of the Prime Minister’s immediate family were paid nearly $300,000 over four years for speaking at WE Charity events.

We want to see what this contract looked like,” Scheer said. “We want to know how many Cabinet Ministers knew he had this kind of relationship with this charity.”

In an emailed statement sent to CTVNews.ca, Chantal Gagnon, a spokesperson for the Prime Minister's Office, said Trudeau's relatives ""engage with a variety of organizations and support many personal causes on their own accord.""

PANDEMIC RESPONSE

Scheer’s Conservatives have proposed a “back-to-work bonus” which he said would allow employees to earn money and keep more CERB.

“We’ve been calling on this government to fix the gaps in their programs. Many people still don’t qualify for the wage subsidy; many businesses don’t qualify for the rental subsidy,” Scheer said.

REPRESENTING REGINA-QU’APPELLE

Scheer said he plans to continue running for Regina-Qu’Appelle MP, and enjoys reconnecting with the communities in his riding.

“Being leader of the party I was able to able to highlight the issues that are effecting Saskatchewan and my riding,” he said. “ “The feedback I got was [my riding] was really rooting for me, they really appreciated the opportunity to have a Prime Minister from Saskatchewan and fix some of the issues that Sask is facing, the inability to get pipelines built, the terrible harvest we had and still no response from the federal government.”

""Why can't we spend a normal day together?!""

That's the stage of Summer we're at weather wise. Storm season has just begun and it's already been really active, days will feature normal parts but they'll rarely stay that way.

During the course of the storm season in Saskatchewan we get an average of 13 tornados, last weekend we had three in one day! On Saturday, July 4 during the afternoon and evening a cyclical tornadic supercell thunderstorm moved through Southern Saskatchewan. This big baddie of a storm not only produced three separate tornadic events but also threw softball sized hail from the sky. Surprisingly the reported damage from these storms was minimal

The first tornado touched down near Glenbain, Sask. around 4:30 in the afternoon, no damage was reported from this event. Number two happened just 10 minutes later at 4:40 near Kincaid. This time it stayed on the ground for approximately 40 minutes and moved Eastward towards Woodrow. Damage to a home and farm property was reported and investigated from this event. The storm continued on towards Assiniboia and near that community another touchdown occurred, around 6:23. Once again no damage was reported.

DID YOU KNOW

On Sunday, June 30,1912 the deadliest tornado in Canadian history hit the city of Regina. The Regina Cyclone started to develop at about 4:50 p.m., green funnel clouds formed and touched down South of the city. It tore through the residential area between Wascana Lake and Victoria Avenue, continuing through the downtown business district, rail yards, warehouse district and Northern residential area. There were a total of 28 fatalities.

Photos sourced from the Provincial Archives of Saskatchewan.

After things from the weekend settled down they ramped back up on Tuesday, July 7. A large line of storms from around the Swift Current area to Southern Montana moved across Southern Saskatchewan. This line of intense storms brought severe wind gusts, large hail and heavy rain. The Southwestern corner took the brunt of these storms once again.

Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) recorded the top wind gust at 141 km per hour at the Mankota station. Two other stations were in triple digits, Coronach at 139 km per hour and Val Marie at 117 km per hour. Nickel sized hail was reported in the Golden Prairie area and reports of trees being snapped came in from near Hazenmore.

Once this line of storms subsided a large area of low pressure developed and moved slowly through Central Saskatchewan. The Northwest side of this system dropped large amounts of rain and a good portion of that also slide through the Southwestern corner of the Province. The 24 hour accumulated precipitation, as of 11 a.m. Wednesday July 9, for North Battleford was 133.8 mm or around 5 inches. Localized flooding happened in North Battleford and Swift Current as city drains couldn't keep up to the downpours. The average rainfall for the whole month of July in North Battleford is 74 mm or 3 inches, they recieved almost double in 24 hours!

As we continue to move through the month of July we'll stay unsettled for the next couple of weeks. Now that moisture has blanketed the Province daytime heating will continue to produce the risk of thunderstorms on an almost daily basis.

Moisture breeds more moisture. If you're looking for a consistent nice day this weekend it will be Saturday. Temperatures will be seasonal and the sun will stick around all day.

Sunday afternoon the trouble starts to bubble up once again and we'll watch for more thunderstorms scattered through the Province.

“We knew it was going to be busy,” said SARCAN communications coordinator Nolan Hubbard-Richards.

“We knew that people were going to be accumulating more containers than normal. But, we were completely blown away with the reception of our reopening and how many people showed up on that opening day and continue to show up.”

Some customers have seen wait times up to two hours long at locations across Regina. Zena Bear waited outside of the Rochdale location.

“I’ve got five [bags], but I’ve got another six or seven in the car and they said, ‘just what we can carry,’ so I have another day of this.”

SARCAN continues its COVID-19 practices at all locations and customers are seeing them as a success.

“Everybody just kept their distance and did their own thing. So it was all good,” said Bear.

Hubbard-Richards says there is no way for SARCAN to be able to predict what days or times they will be busy. But, it does look like the long lines will continue to be the norm for the foreseeable future.",[]

Hibbin, realizing his front yard lights were no longer on, ran outside and yelled at a woman who had just ripped them from his flower bed.

He told her to drop the lights. She did, but began to run, he said.

“I went out to retrieve them, but went back in to grab my shoes so I could attempt to locate her,” Hibbin said.

He said he found her walking on a nearby road, but she was no longer wearing a white sweater.

Hibbin told her he had her caught on video, but she decided to run again.

“She dropped her smokes, so she stopped and attempted to apologize and said she would pay me back and that she had been drinking,” he said.

He said a cab driver had stopped on the road, asking if everything was OK. Hibbin explained the situation, but the woman ran into a nearby backyard.

He didn’t follow her because it could have been her home, and he didn’t want to be confronted by others, he said.

“I'm a quiet person, so I don't walk by myself at night, but that didn't seem to matter. I just wanted to find this woman,” he said. “I was blown away by how calm she was while taking my lights. Not a care in the world.”

In video footage, the woman is seen yanking the lights from Hibbin’s flower bed. The incident took place in the city’s southeast.

The entire fixture broke.

“When she pulled them off the wire, they snapped clean off in three different locations,” he said. “She just kept pulling at everything.”

Hibbin called the police. He said an officer came by Sunday to ask some questions, but he doubts the woman will be caught.

He said he understands people might think the theft is insignificant, but the lights were expensive.

“This all seems pretty petty, because they are lights, but my partner and I have spent a lot of money to make things nice, and it's as if you can't have anything without someone else ruining it,” he said.

Hibbin said he’s glad he had a camera installed. It allowed him to catch her, he said.

Merrell, the founder of the Sleep Apnea Society of Canada (SASOC), recently stopped in Saskatchewan during the journey.

He began his trip in Calgary on July 1 and is riding to Winnipeg.

“Some of the biggest problems in Canada are an inadequate number of sleep specialists and sleep facilities,” said Merrell.

“There is a big deficit in terms of funding from the provincial health care authorities. In some provinces, you may get some funding for treatment. In others, there is none at all,” he said.

Merrell said that sleep apnea affects 10 to 12 million Canadians, but almost 90 per cent of people are undiagnosed. A recent study has suggested that those with the condition are more susceptible to more dangerous cases of COVD-19.

“We're trying to deal with the COVID situation of course and all these things,” said Merrell. “If we can now start to suggest to individuals with sleep apnea that they have to be even more careful, then that's an important message we should try to get out""

Merrell is hoping that his ride encourages provincial governments to increase funding into sleep apnea.

Although sleep apnea is a relatively new condition, it affects people of all ages and genders – not just older males. Merrell reported even some young children have been diagnosed.

“People with sleep apnea have five to seven times greater risk of having an automobile accident,” he said.

Snoring and being chronically tired are the most common symptoms of sleep apnea. Dr. Merrell encourages people who experience those symptoms, or who are more than 40 years old, to get tested for the condition.",[]

Gilmer, 26 at the time, had just become the president of the Saskatchewan Coalition Against Racism.

“Well I certainly remember the siege on Kanesatake took place and almost instantly, there was organizing going on in the community to respond,” he said.

July 11, 2020 marks the 30-year anniversary of the beginning of the Oka Crisis, between the town of Oka and the Mohawk of Kanesatake.

During the conflict, people of both Indigenous and non-Indigenous backgrounds would gather at Victoria Park in Regina at what was called the Friends of Mohawk camp.

The camp became the hub for supporters in the city.

Demonstrations and rallies were held almost every day for more than two months in the park, in front of the government building on Scarth Street and at the legislature. Protesters occupied the Northern and Indigenous Affairs office for multiple days.

“People felt it was really important that a stand was taken locally in collaboration with numerous protests across the country,” said Gilmer.

For Danielle Ewenin, she had become the first Indigenous person to be the president of the University of Regina Students’ Union prior to the events of 1990.

“For me it was a struggle,” said Ewenin. “Holding that kind of profile meant also how our people were going to be perceived.”

Ewenin now works with the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women commission.

“People were afraid that if they didn’t do something and the police or armed forces did something to hurt the people in Kahnawake and Kanesatake,” said Ewenin. “People felt they had to do something to prevent that. They understood the oppression. They might not have the language for it, but they knew in [their hearts] what was happening. That made people move.”

Gilmer spoke often at rallies that summer.

“Say no to constitutional deals that ignore the first peoples,” he said in 1990. “No to golf courses that take precedence over land claim settlements.”

Gilmer, reflecting on the past, said it certainly was about more than a golf course.

“It was about the colonial history of Canada,” he said. “It was about the need for this country to come to terms with its past and find ways to move forward.”

In a Regina city council meeting in the summer of 1990, some councillors wanted the city to express its support for the Mohawks. However, most of the council voted against it.

“They didn’t want to deal with those motions because they would have to make a statement on where they stand,” said Ewenin to the press following the meeting.

She now says Canada was not ready for an Indigenous movement at the time.

“No, they weren’t ready for it. People were speaking out against the oppression,” she said.

Gilmer believes there was a societal shift that saw many non-Indigenous peoples join in the advocacy for Indigenous rights.

“It was ultimately an anti-colonial movement that was led by Indigenous people across the country, but there was many non-Indigenous people that became involved,” he said.

The actions of those who rallied still echo today.

For instance, people involved in the Black Lives Matter movement have been rallying to address racism and seek justice.

“I see it as a continuation of what was going on,” said Ewenin.

Gilmer said 1990 feels a lot like 2020.

“But on the one hand, the issues have never gone away but they seem to have risen to the forefront again,” he said.

Gilmer says the issues of police accountability and systemic discrimination were at the core of the rallies of 1990, just as they are today.

“Unfortunately, so many of those anti-racism issues we were dealing with in 1990 are still prominent today,” said Gilmer. “The difference today is that these issues can’t be swept under the rug anymore. 1990 was an important step in that direction.”

For Ewenin, her children and grandchildren are still fighting what she fought 30 years ago.

“I don’t think it’s fair. I don’t think it is right or just in this society,” said Ewenin. “They have a right to be able to pursue their lives.”

Gilmer said he thought attitudes would have changed by now.

“But it is inspiring to see so many young people today that are challenging institutional racism,” he said.

Similar movements saw education as the key to change. Ewenin thinks a shift in Canada’s way of looking at Indigenous people starts with education.

“We have a whole education system that is built on lies,” said Ewenin. “It has to be based upon Indigenous people’s stories and history. When you are taught those things, you realize we have a right to the land.”

Gilmer sees the events of the summer of 1990 as the spark to a societal shift in Canada.

“I think it really is pivotal in terms of Canadian history that those acts of solidarity, particularly the focus on Kanesatake, meant that Indigenous rights and anti-colonial struggle became front and centre for the first time,” he said.

Ewenin said Canada has a long way to go before these matters can be resolved.

“It's been 30 years since the royal commission and none of those reports have gone into change,” said Ewenin. “We are a country that has the most racist legislation and Canada is saying, ‘well, we can’t change it to fit the United Nations’ Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.”

Ewenin is optimistic about the future generations and their fight against injustices.

“As long as people feel their rights are not being acknowledged - that’s not a struggle or a fight that’s going to be given up. My grandchildren have inherited that. It’s not going to go away,” she said.

The two women travelling in the car were injured. One was taken to hospital in Moose Jaw by local EMS, while the other was taken to hospital in Regina via STARS Air Ambulance. No other injuries were reported.

Police said alcohol is not believed to be a factor in the collision.

562,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/morneau-didn-t-recuse-himself-from-decision-on-we-contract-despite-daughters-connection-to-charity-1.5019302,"Morneau didn't recuse himself from decision on WE contract, despite daughters' connection to charity",['Rachel Aiello'],2020-07-10 14:21:00-04:00,"OTTAWA -- Finance Minister Bill Morneau did not recuse himself from the federal cabinet decision to grant WE Charity a contract to deliver a now-halted $900 million COVID-19 student grant program, despite his two daughters having connections to the organization. Now, the NDP are calling for an ethics investigation.

In a statement to CTV News, Morneau’s office said that there is “absolutely no link” between his daughters’ involvements with the charity and “any work that WE does with the Government of Canada.”

The statement confirmed what website Canadaland first reported: that the finance minister’s daughter Clare has spoken at WE events, and his daughter Grace is currently employed by WE Charity.

“Clare has spoken at WE events, as well as many other public events, in the context of the release of her book on young refugee girls. She has never been compensated for that work,” said Maeva Proteau, press secretary for Morneau.

As well, Morneau’s daughter Grace is a “contractual employee of WE in an administrative role in the travel department,” a job she has had since 2019 following her internship, according to Morneau’s office.

“She got this position on her own merits. There is absolutely no link between her employment and any work that WE does with the Government of Canada,” Proteau said.

Proteau confirmed that Morneau did not recuse himself from the discussions about the decision to offload the program meant to administer grants to students and new graduates for their volunteer work this summer.

NDP WANT INVESTIGATION

In light of Morneau’s statement, the New Democrats are calling for Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion to investigate Morneau. In a letter to the commissioner obtained by CTV News, NDP MP and ethics critic Charlie Angus says he thinks the finance minister’s decision to not recuse himself from conversations about outsourcing the program to We Charity merits more scrutiny.

“The Act has clear stipulations that prevent public office holders from making or participating in a decision related to the exercise of an official power, duty or function if the public office holder knows or reasonably should know that, in the making of the decision, he or she would be in a conflict of interest,” writes Angus.

“It would seem apparent that Minister Morneau would recognize that the fact that his family member was an employee of this organization necessitated him to recuse himself regarding this extraordinary decision to outsource nearly billion-dollar commitment of public funds in a single source contract,” Angus writes.

With the program halted, thousands of students are now in limbo without summer jobs and, for now, no chance for volunteer grants to help cover costs like fall tuition. The grant to post-secondary students and recent graduates was set to provide payments that amount to less than minimum wage for volunteering in pandemic-related programs, depending on the number of hours worked. For every 100 hours spent, a student would receive $1,000.

“The recommendation to have WE administer the program came from the public service,” Morneau’s office said.

APPEARED 'TOO CLOSE': LIBERAL MP

With Dion already looking into Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s ties to WE Charity and his decision to not recuse himself from the contract discussions, the Conservatives are now calling for an RCMP probe, and for a full accounting of what all cabinet ministers knew about the extent of the Trudeau family’s connections to the charities. Trudeau’s wife, mother and brother were paid a range of amounts to speak at WE events over the years.

In an interview on CTV News Channel, Liberal MP Nate Erskine-Smith said that while he can’t speak for the state of mind either Trudeau or Morneau were in, he was “skeptical” about how the project was announced.

“I was glad to see the government reverse course in response to feedback… The prime minister and the finance minister appeared to me to be too close to this as far as decision-making goes, but ultimately this is in the hands of the ethics commissioner,” he said.",[]
563,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/the-challenge-of-our-lifetime-federal-deficit-to-hit-343-billion-this-year-1.5015467,'The challenge of our lifetime': Federal deficit to hit $343 billion this year,['Rachel Aiello'],2020-07-08 10:05:00-04:00,"OTTAWA -- The federal deficit is projected to hit $343.2 billion this fiscal year, due in large part to massive economic aid and stimulus plans—that are on-par with Second World War level spending— that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government has rolled out in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

The deficit projection released Wednesday is up dramatically from the latest pre-pandemic economic update in December 2019, which pegged the deficit at $28.1 billion in 2020-21.

In addition to direct government spending, the new figures in the government’s fiscal snapshot show the negative impact the global pandemic has had on the economy.

Citing the “extraordinary borrowing” the federal government is currently engaged in, the government says the federal debt will exceed $1.2 trillion by the end of the fiscal year, up from $765 billion in the previous fiscal year.

With unemployment rates set to remain high into next year, the government is also projecting a $71.1-billion decline in tax revenue, including a $40.8-billion loss in income taxes.

“This spending level is on par with, but lower than the peak deficit (as a per cent of GDP) experienced by Canada during the Second World War. This is truly the challenge of our lifetime. As temporary investment measures come to an end and GDP recovers over time, deficits are expected to retreat,” reads the snapshot, in part.

In total, the federal government has spent more than $231 billion in health and safety measures as well as on direct aid to Canadians and businesses over the course of the pandemic so far.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau unveiled the revised economic picture inside the House of Commons, which is gathered for a special sitting. He spoke about how this current fiscal situation is an opportunity for Canada to rebuild and reshape the economy.

“We need to invest in an economy that is greener and more diverse,” Morneau said. “This pandemic has identified clear gaps and it’s giving us a chance to reset. We witnessed the ways in which people were falling through the cracks… In the coming months, we will need to come to these problems with dedication, compassion, and ingenuity.”

During a press conference with reporters during a largely virtual “lockup,” ahead of tabling the 168-page snapshot, Morneau called the pandemic “an enormous shock to our system.”

“We faced an enormous shock to our system,” Morneau told reporters. “It’s hard to know where we will be in a month, two months, or six months. What we know for sure, is that if Canadians work together, we can continue on what we've seen as a month-by-month improvement of our situation, and our economic outcomes will be related to our success working together on our on our health challenges.”

He also suggested a silver lining in regards to Canada’s increased debt-to-GDP ratio. With current public debt charges at around one per cent of GDP, the cost to service the now ballooning debt is actually $4 billion lower this year than expected, given the historically low borrowing rates.

Due to the COVID-19 spending, the federal government now projects its debt-to-GDP ratio will rise to 49.1 per cent in 2020-21. In the pre-pandemic December economic update, Canada’s debt-to-GDP ratio was at 30.9 per cent and was projected to remain on track to reduce incrementally over the next few years.

“Even after our historic investments, Canada will continue to hold its low-debt advantage. This, combined with historically low interest rates, gave us the balance sheet to deploy our fiscal firepower to support Canadians through this,” Morneau said, though noted that his and likely future governments will have to face up to the deficit.

SHARPEST DROP SINCE GREAT DEPRESSION

The government is emphasizing the “challenge of a generation” that the COVID-19 pandemic is posing, and noted the serious and ongoing impacts. Over the last few months, federal job numbers have already showed 5.5 million Canadians are either out of work, or have lost wages; and a growing list of businesses are set to shutter their doors permanently.

Citing economists, in the snapshot the government says the overall economy is expected to contract by 6.8 per cent in 2020, which is its sharpest drop since the Great Depression, before rebounding by 5.5 per cent in 2021.

Based on forecasts by more than a dozen private sector economists, the government is projecting an unemployment rate of 9.8 per cent in 2020 and 7.8 per cent in 2021.

All of this is contingent on how the ongoing health crisis is managed, the government notes throughout the snapshot, emphasizing the economy’s health is largely in the hands of Canadians’ efforts to stave off a second wave of the novel coronavirus.

The snapshot also includes several scenarios for future economic outlooks, depending on what happens with the pandemic, from a gradual but uneven recovery to a virus resurgence scenario which would result in a “deeper and longer-lasting negative impact on the economy.”

While the government optimistically believes the worst of the economic impact is behind us, it will be a long time before a rebound, even under the most positive pandemic scenario that would see a vaccine discovered within the year.

Speaking to reporters in advance of the revised economic picture being made public, Trudeau said that the situation would have been much worse had the federal government not brought in massive aid measures.

“When the pandemic first hit, a lot of people lost their jobs overnight. They didn't know how they were going to feed their families, or pay their bills. Faced with this unprecedented challenge our government had two options: We could sit back and let Canadians fend for themselves... or we could swiftly and substantially choose to support Canadians. We chose to support Canadians,” Trudeau said.

MORE THAN $230 BILLION SPENT

The report — which is not a federal budget or a fiscal update — shows that, since March, the federal government has spent more than $231 billion on health and safety measures as well as direct aid to Canadians and businesses.

Though, the government cautioned in the document that the cost estimates for many of the aid programs have been “difficult to establish, given that they are brand new programs, launched in a highly volatile economic environment,” and said further updates will come as the data comes in.

Of that figure, $19.8 billion is considered spending for health and safety measures, and includes the $14 billion earmarked to go to the provinces and territories for their “safe restart” plans. The direct support totals $212.2 billion and includes the suite of emergency response aid programs, as well as the support for local community organizations on the front lines of delivering key services to Canadians.

It also details the cost of a range of non-COVID-19 policy actions taken by the federal government since the 2019 economic update, which in total for the 2020-21 fiscal year amounts to just over $9 billion.

The government says the pandemic aid spending — on everything from support for seniors and farmers, to stocking up on personal protective equipment and vaccine development — is “the most comprehensive and substantial peacetime investment in Canada’s history.”

The biggest-ticket items to date, which the government said could still evolve over time, include:

The $2,000-a-month Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), which nearly 8.2 million Canadians have applied for, totalling $53.5 in aid payments but an overall estimated budget of $80 billion;

The 75-per-cent emergency wage subsidy, which has seen 252,370 unique applicants and $18.1 billion spent. Though, the program is expected to be reworked in some way soon, as the CERB nears end of its course, and as a result the government is projecting in the end it will end up costing $82.3 billion to pay employers to keep staff on;

The Canada Emergency Student Benefit, which provides $1,250 a month to most eligible students, more to those with dependents. To date $1.4 billion has been paid out to more than 600,000 applicants; and

The Canada Emergency Business Account, which offers businesses loans of up to $40,000. According to the new figures, 688,000 applicants have received these loans, totaling $27.4 billion.

As well, in an effort to buoy businesses big and small, in addition to the direct spending offered, the federal government has made available $600 billion in liquidity and government-guaranteed loans which Morneau has said he hopes will bridge key job creators in this country to better times. This included $85 billion in tax and customs duty payment deferrals, to help companies free up some of their funding for other expenses.

In his Commons remarks, he notes that nearly nine out of every 10 dollars in COVID-19 aid delivered to Canadians and businesses is financed by the federal government.

The snapshot also looks at how Canada’s economic response compares to that of other countries, and outlines the plummet that consumer confidence and mobility trends have taken over the last four months.

In an interview on CTV News Channel reacting to the news, Parliamentary Budget Officer Yves Giroux said he was “scared and disappointed,” after seeing the snapshot.

The deficit is almost $100 billion larger than his office estimated the deficit was on track to hit $256 billion this fiscal year.

“We still don't have any sense of what is the government's game plan to get the Canadian economy back on track again,” Giroux said. “It's a much bigger deficit than even I expected, and that's why it's really scary to see these big numbers.”

He is calling on the federal government to look at ways to rework the Employment Insurance program to help those who have maxed out their benefits but remain out of work due to no fault of their own, as several industries are set to take months longer than others to rebound.

The snapshot includes information from the Canadian Federation of Independent Business that shows that while the construction, agriculture, manufacturing and personal services sectors are closer to being considered fully open, large portions of the hospitality, arts and recreation, social services, retail, and real estate sectors will take a lot longer before the majority of businesses are fully open for business.

Today’s snapshot comes after opposition parties and economists called for a look at the federal books, and after resisting a more robust update, the government now says it is planning to release a larger fiscal outlook in the fall.

The overall economic numbers are the first offered by the federal government since the December 2019 update, which was the only one since the Liberal formed a minority government in the last election.

They are limited to the current picture within this fiscal year, ending March 31, 2021, given further predictions could be inaccurate given the ongoing volatility, according to the government.

The 2020 federal budget date was scheduled to be March 30, but that was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic surging at the time.

OPPOSITION REACT TO 'DIRE' PICTURE

Reacting to the figures in the House of Commons, outgoing Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer called the snapshot “an extremely dire picture,” and criticized the government for lacking a plan to get Canada’s economy back on stable footing.

“Coming out of the pandemic, every single country on the planet will be desperately competing for the same opportunities and the same investments, so where is the prime minister’s plan to set us apart?” Scheer said.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is now calling on the federal government to look to offshore tax havens to drum up revenue to try to offset the ballooning debt and deficit, as well as imposing a “wealth tax” to raise revenue.

“Let’s ask the wealthiest to bear the brunt of the pandemic, not the families and the working people who are struggling to get by,” Singh said.

Green Party Parliamentary Leader Elizabeth May called on the government to move on the promised aid for people with disabilities that has been caught up in procedural limbo and has yet to be implemented, despite being promised several weeks ago.

It’s likely to now be a years-long endeavour to navigate Canada out of the red. While the fiscal snapshot includes a chapter on the government’s debt-management strategy, given the limited time frame the document covers, there is no plan to return to balance included.",[]
564,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/it-s-extremely-dire-legions-at-risk-of-closing-forever-1.4995224,"Legions across Canada could close permanently, asking feds to help",[],2020-06-22 22:00:00-04:00,"OTTAWA -- Royal Canadian Legion halls across the country have been shuttered for months due to COVID-19, and now a number of them are facing the prospect of never being able to reopen.

With most ineligible for the host of federal aid programs being offered to help keep other businesses and charitable organizations afloat, hundreds of these facilities could be forced to shut their doors forever without federal intervention.

Legions are often seen as the heart of many communities -- where Remembrance Day celebrations are held and meals are made and delivered to those in need -- but because the pandemic has put a pause on events, it’s cut off crucial income streams like facility rentals that allow legions to keep their doors open to veterans and others.

It’s estimated that about 124 of the 1,381 Royal Canadian Legion branches across Canada are likely to close permanently, and another 357 are facing financial hardship.

“We're a 95-year-old organization. And in that 95 years, we have prided ourselves on being self-sufficient, we have not reached out for funding. But these are unprecedented times,” National Executive Director Steven Clark said.

The Royal Canadian Legion has written to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s office twice, informing him of the gaps in the current federal aid offerings, and says they have yet to receive a response. The Prime Minister’s Office disputes that claim, confirming at least one response has been sent.

A government source told CTV News a reason the legions can’t get funding is because their programs are not directly related to the fight against COVID-19, though thousands of businesses have been able to access billions of federal aid dollars to make ends meet amid the pandemic.

In an email to CTV News, spokesperson for the Office of the Minister of Families, Children and Social Development Jessica Eritou pointed to the Emergency Community Support Fund as something legions that support veterans “may” qualify for to adapt their programs, and committed to “work with organizations to ensure they have the support they need to support Canadians.”

However, that program is offered to help adapt programming in the era of COVD-19 and the Royal Canadian Legion says that it’s their understanding based on conversations with federal officials that it can’t be used to cover operational costs, which is their biggest need right now.

They are calling on the federal government to expand the program’s parameters or allow them to access some other funding option to help pay for costs like rent and utilities.

While some branches may have employees on their payroll and could be eligible for some assistance, most are volunteer-run.

“We've had, of our 1,381 branches 167 have applied for federal assistance programs, but unfortunately only 55 have received that funding so it's still a very small percentage,” Clark said.

Local branches have been given some emergency reserve funding from the national headquarters, and have turned to crowdfunding initiatives but still the money is running out. While millions of dollars are donated every year through the National Poppy Campaign, this money can’t be used to cover the operational costs associated with keeping these facilities open.

While legions have been struggling for years to attract new members, having to close due to the pandemic could prove to be the final straw for many.

The branch in Kenora says it can only last a few more months before its closure becomes permanent.

“It’s extremely dire. We were good for the short haul, but as this keeps going, and we don’t know really where the light at the tunnel is going to be, we’re just not going to be able to survive,” said President of the Kenora Legion Jerry Lava.

“We’re depleting our savings now to make sure we can maintain our expenses. We’ve mothballed pretty well everything in the branch we could,” Lava said.

In a statement to CTV News, spokesperson for Veterans Affairs Canada John Embury said that the department’s response to the pandemic “is ongoing, and we will continue to explore ways to ensure that we’re providing Canadians and our community partners with the support they need.

Branches like this are the first point of contact for veterans and offer them crucial services and support, and that’s why so many are worried about what the future holds.

“I come to the legion and I meet old friends, and the comradery. It’s a place where you come and tell your story,” said Joel VanSnick, who is the Royal Canadian Legion’s district commander for the Ottawa-area which includes 62 branches.

“Once our legions are shut down, they’re gone... Where are veterans going to go to meet?” he said.",[]
565,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/inside-the-covid-19-commons-liberals-pass-key-spending-before-summer-sittings-1.4987560,Inside the COVID-19 Commons: Liberals pass key spending before summer sittings,['Rachel Aiello'],2020-06-17 04:36:00-04:00,"OTTAWA -- The federal government has passed billions of dollars in spending measures during a special House of Commons sitting, with the backing of enough opposition MPs to not prompt formal standing votes.

The conclusion of the special sitting marks the end of more routine gatherings of MPs, with the next time the House convenes set for early July.

Through a series of oral approvals, MPs signed off on approximately $87 billion in funds to tie over federal departments and, in this case, COVID-19 aid programs until the fall. The agreement to pass the funding was given “on division,” meaning no recorded vote was required.

The two spending bills were the first chance since the pandemic shut down the regular sittings for MPs to indicate whether or not they still have confidence in the Liberal minority, though the sitting came and went without that opportunity being taken.

The Liberals’ commitment to an extension of a key COVID-19 aid program, the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, was what secured them the support needed to pass the supplementary estimates -- otherwise known as supply or the next cycle of scheduled and new federal spending.

Because of the Liberals’ minority standing, they needed to have the backing of at least one of the other parties in order to pass the spending measures, and the stakes were considerably higher in this instance because any votes that have to do with money, such as the federal budget or the estimates, are traditionally considered confidence votes.

In any parliament, a government lives so long as it maintains the confidence of the House of Commons. This confidence is demonstrated each time a key vote passes.

Approving the funding comes after both the Bloc Quebecois and NDP signalled they were not interested in seeing MPs line up to cast ballots amid a pandemic -- which could have happened if the Liberals lost Wednesday’s confidence votes and a snap election was called.

JUST 40 SITTING DAYS IN LAST YEAR

Wednesday’s sitting marked the 40th day there has been some form of an actual of House of Commons sitting in the last year, which did include the usual suspension over the summer of 2019 and then the fall federal election campaign.

Though after that October vote, the Liberals waited until December to reconvene the House.

CTVNews.ca asked Government House Leader Pablo Rodriguez last week about the limited number of sitting days and, as a result, the limited number of government mandate items that have been able to progress. He said the time taken pre-pandemic to adjust to the minority reality was necessary and no one could have anticipated a global health crisis would hit.

“We suggested a very ambitious agenda, a very complete throne speech, with everything that comes with it, and then we had COVID,” Rodriguez said. “But even with COVID, we adapted.”

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said once again Wednesday that the agreement to sit under the current structure was reached with the backing of the NDP and Greens, and defended the Liberals’ approach to Parliament.

“Three different parties came together to make a determination of what Parliament would do,” Trudeau said.

“Every time something doesn't go their way an opposition party cries, ‘oh no’ and it's a dictatorship all of a sudden. It's sort of irresponsible and it undermines I think the strength of our democracy that we've been able to show through this crisis,” said the prime minister during his Rideau Cottage press conference.

SPECIAL COMMITTEE COMING TO AN END

Before the special sitting got underway, MPs held their second last meeting of the special all-party COVID-19 committee of MPs. The committee is the first real experiment with a hybrid parliamentary sitting in the House chamber, but that experiment is nearly over.

As has been the case in the 23 of these meetings so far, MPs offered up statements and riding-specific petitions, before going through a question period-style session where the Liberals were grilled on the shortcomings in their COVID-19 plans and on other key policy matters.

In the motion passed on May 16, which put in place the structure of the summer sittings, MPs voted to cease the special committee after Thursday’s meeting. Its end will also mark the end of some form of MPs meeting four days a week, with them not all together until the first of four special sitting days in July.

As of June 18, the special committee will cease to exist, leaving just the four gatherings— July 8, July 22, Aug. 12, and Aug. 26— before the prospect of a more ‘normal’ House of Commons could convene come Sept. 21.

And as Trudeau announced on Wednesday morning, the July 8 sitting will also be where Finance Minister Bill Morneau will present “an economic and fiscal snapshot.”

STUDYING REMOTE VOTING, RULE CHANGES

One of the major limitations that has yet to be worked out is how to allow MPs to vote remotely.

This question is one that the Procedure and House Affairs (PROC) committee has been diving deeper into and evaluating how a formal hybrid House of Commons session could occur, the rule changes required to allow that, and what it would take to implement a remote voting system. The committee has been given a June 23 deadline to report back to its colleagues.

The government—with the support of the NDP—has argued that Parliament has continued to function through the pandemic, noting that under the new structure, the government has faced more questions from the opposition than it would have under normal House sitting parameters.

However, the Conservatives, and to a certain degree the Bloc Quebecois, have characterized the special committee as essentially a knock-off of Parliament and called for a more robust resumption of sittings that would have allowed for more accountability on the massive government policies being rolled out, while respecting the health and safety of all on Parliament Hill.

So, it remains to be seen whether the recommendations out of PROC could result in a change of plans when it comes to the summer and fall sitting schedule.",[]
566,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/conservative-leadership-race-enters-final-push-1.4830847,Conservative leadership race enters final push,[],2020-02-27 17:21:00-05:00,"OTTAWA -- The four Conservative leadership candidates are kicking off the final stretch of COVID-19-style campaigning, with just two months to go before all ballots are cast.

After going head-to-head in two debates on June 17 and 18 the leadership hopefuls will continue to try to separate themselves from the rest of the pack.

Erin O’Toole, Peter MacKay, Leslyn Lewis, and Derek Sloan battled it out in French on June 17, doing their best to deliver their platform pitches despite not one being fully bilingual. On June 18, Toronto played host to the first and only English-language debate.

Co-chairs of the Conservative Party leadership election organizing committee Dan Nowlan and Lisa Raitt were chosen to moderate.

Under the original leadership race timeline, the party was set to hold its debates in April, but those were cancelled when the entire race was put on pause due to the pandemic.

Given the public health concerns at play, there was no live audience, and physical distancing measures were in place.

Another pandemic-prompted workaround, the voting process will be conducted through mail-in ballots, which party members need to send back to the party by August 21.

The race resumed on April 29 “with adjustments to accommodate current circumstances,” a month after it was initially suspended, with LEOC saying at the time that it wouldn’t be possible to meet all deadlines necessary in time for the originally-planned June 27 announcement of a winner.

While all ballots need to be submitted by August 21, it’s yet to be determined how quickly they will be scrutinized and a winner declared. The date and format of how the party will announce its new leader once the results are tallied will also depend on the health guidelines and government orders in place at the time.

VERIFIED CANDIDATES

To reach this phase, each contender had to raise $200,000, put forward an additional $100,000 as a compliance fee, and gather 3,000 signatures from members. This secures their name on the ballot.

Erin O’Toole:

A three-time Conservative MP from Ontario and former cabinet minister. Prior to entering politics O'Toole was in the Royal Canadian Air Force for a decade and later worked as a lawyer. O'Toole placed third in the 2017 leadership race, and since re-entering has taken policy positions that appear to be appealing to the base of the party. He's described himself as the ""true blue"" candidate.

O'Toole says he's running because ""the country needs a strong Conservative party."" He's taking the position of uniting Conservatives.

Peter MacKay:

A former federal cabinet minister from Nova Scotia and the last leader of the Progressive Conservatives pre-merger with Stephen Harper’s Canadian Alliance in 2003. After deciding not to run in 2015, MacKay was working at a Toronto law firm and was a frequent political commentator. Since throwing his hat in the ring he's faced questions over some conflicting positions.

MacKay says he is running ""to keep the Conservative movement united and to defeat Justin Trudeau in the next general election.""

Leslyn Lewis:

An Ontario lawyer who was an unsuccessful 2015 federal election candidate. Lewis lost after being put into a race at the last moment when the previous candidate quit once a video of him urinating in a cup while working in someone's home surfaced. She came to Canada as a child from Jamaica and has received the backing of Campaign Life Coalition, as well as the support of a prominent Christian activist, who called her a ""breath of fresh air"" as a woman who is against same-sex marriage and abortion.

Lewis says she is running because ""Canadians can and should expect much more from their leaders,"" and because she is seeing ""opportunities for future generations falling away.""

Derek Sloan:

A rookie Ontario Conservative MP elected for the first time in 2019. Prior to entering politics he worked as a lawyer and small business owner. Since entering the House of Commons he's stated that he believes the ""cause of sexual orientation"" is ""scientifically unclear,"" and has also received the backing of social conservative organization Campaign Life Coalition.

Sloan says he believes the country is ""under siege by a tide of political correctness that seeks to destroy Canada,"" and vows to ""take a stand for Canada against radical progressivism.""

NO LONGER IN THE RUNNING

Marilyn Gladu:

A two-time Conservative MP from Ontario, who was first elected in 2015. Prior to entering politics she worked as a chemical engineer. As a parliamentarian she's advocated for palliative care and, during her time as the health critic, she voiced concerns about the Liberals’ rollout of marijuana legalization.

Gladu said her vision included: ""Canadian policy rooted in a better balance of fiscal common sense and social compassion.""

Rudy Husny:

A longtime Conservative party member and former staffer. Husny worked for PricewaterhouseCoopers in Montreal before trying his luck twice at running as the Conservative candidate in the riding of Outremont in 2011 and 2015. Husny worked as a senior adviser to the Minister of International Trade in between his two unsuccessful bids. After 2015, he spent time both in the private sector in the Gulf region and in outgoing Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer's office. Husny was the only Quebec candidate, and he had already established that he would tell MPs looking to bring forward anti-abortion bills that it's ""not the priority.""

Husny said he was running ""to bring generational change to our party, to our politics, and to our country.""

Rick Peterson:

A businessman from Alberta and past leadership candidate. He came 12th in the 2017 leadership race and touted his bilingualism and openness to diversity as assets. He proposed a 15 per cent flat personal income tax and a roll back of Liberal gun laws.

Peterson said he was running to ""help restore and reinvigorate the investment climate and job creation."" He billed himself as the candidate with a ""bold vision"" that included tax reform and a climate plan.

Jim Karahalios:

An Ontario lawyer who has advocated for the elimination of carbon taxes. He's also married to Ontario Progressive Conservative MPP Belinda Karahalios and is suing the provincial PC party over allegations that the 2018 race for party president was “rigged” to keep him out. He received the backing of social conservative group Campaign Life Coalition.

Karahalios said he was running to fight against what he called a ""top-down coronation"" for ""the well-connected establishment candidates.""

PROMPTED BY SCHEER RESIGNATION

The leadership race got underway on January 13, giving hopefuls 45 days to declare. The hunt for a new head of the party was prompted by Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer announcing on Dec. 12 that he was stepping down as leader but would be staying on until a replacement is named.

Under Scheer, the Conservatives increased their seat count to 121 seats in the 2019 federal election, but in the weeks following the election, Scheer faced a steady stream of criticism for his performance and personal stance on same-sex marriage and other social issues. He was also questioned about his expenses and use of party funds in the lead-up to the federal campaign.",[]

The app will compile confirmed positive COVID-19 cases and notify Canadians when they’ve been in proximity to someone who has the virus.

The government intends to make the free app available for download in early July and said that the program will be compatible with 30 million smartphones in Canada, meaning a significant portion of the population could use the app and be notified directly if they’ve come into contact with anyone who has tested positive for COVID-19 in the last 14 days.

Trudeau described the app as one that people can download and forget about, though it is set to face scrutiny over the fine print of its privacy and permissions settings, as Privacy Commissioner Daniel Therrien says he’s yet to offer his recommendations about the app to the government.

In making the announcement the prime minister said the case monitoring and exposure notification application a “crucial” public health step as more Canadians begin resuming some semblance of normal life, including returning to work.

“I want to stress that this will be completely voluntary. It will be up to individual Canadians to decide whether to download the app or not. But the app will be most effective when as many people as possible have it,” Trudeau said.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford said Thursday afternoon that the app will be part of the province’s overall tracing strategy.

“If we can trace, we can track it,” Ford said, adding that his government will have more to say in the coming days about the “made-in-Ontario” app.

Health authorities in Ontario will be the first to distribute the unique codes to people who test positive for COVID-19.

Trudeau said there are other provinces, including British Columbia, that are working with the federal government on the app, but it will be available to anyone in Canada who wants to use it.

“It'll actually allow us to have a better sense of when there are spikes or resurgences of a virus in a particular area or not because more people will be getting that notification and calling their local public health authorities, so any level of uptake would be useful,” Trudeau said, adding that he hopes Canadians view the app as an easy added layer of protection.

HOW IT WILL WORK

The app was originally developed by the Government of Ontario and the prime minister said that the Canadian Digital Service —a federal body—will work with Shopify and Blackberry on the new software, which Apple and Google have teamed up to offer, using Bluetooth technology to register when devices may come into proximity with one another.

The technology will be owned and operated by the Government of Canada.

The plan with the app is to have a health-care professional help Canadians who test positive upload their status anonymously into the national network.

Then, other users who have the app will be alerted if they have been exposed to someone who has tested positive, encouraging them to reach out to their local public health agency.

The app will also provide users with information on the latest jurisdiction-specific public health information.

“There will be a database of randomized codes associated with each smartphone that has this app that will be divided into two columns: those who may have tested positive, and those who have not tested positive. So if your phone gets in proximity for a certain amount of time, at a certain closeness to another phone, it'll register that it has had contact with that anonymized number,” Trudeau said.

The app will be available for Ontarians to download on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store in the coming weeks.

ONE APP ACROSS CANADA?

As it was first billed, the federal government’s intent was to come out with a single contact tracing app that would be “recommended strongly” to be used across the country, but as Health Minister Patty Hajdu signalled earlier this month, that plan has faced pushback from some provinces that preferred to conduct contact-tracing “the old-fashioned way,” or who had already launched their own digital tracing methods.

The traditional contact tracing currently being done involves people making calls for various public health agencies to help track down anyone who may have come into contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases.

If all provinces don’t sign on or endorse the app, Canada could end up with a patchwork of applications being used across the country and, as a result, limited efficacy when it comes to interprovincial spread.

In an effort to lobby all Canadians to come on side, Trudeau said the app will be customized to each province that signs on.

“It will be one app that whether you download it and live in Ontario and travel to B.C. or travel to the Northwest Territories— if that becomes an option—it will work everywhere across the country. So, it's one app for all Canadians,” he said.

Asked about the role contact tracing can play, infectious disease specialist Dr. Abdu Sharkawy said something more than the old-fashioned approach is needed.

“We look at the contact tracing ability that we have now, and we're using a 1985 form of technology, with phone calls and fax machines, for a 2020 pandemic. We need something that is going to be a bit more sophisticated a bit more efficient,” he told CTV News Channel ahead of Trudeau’s announcement.

“You can do as many tests as you want, but if you don't have the ability to identify who is in contact with a positive case, you don't really have an opportunity to stem the tide and prevent an outbreak from occurring, and community transmission to become something that's much more severe,” Sharkawy said.

PRIVACY CONCERNS

Beyond the hurdles of getting public health agencies in every corner of the country to sign on, the federal government will have to address Canadians’ privacy and security hesitations in order to get the rate of downloads needed to make this effective.

There are also concerns that have been raised around the adequacy of current privacy laws to protect Canadians should a breach occur.

Trudeau said Thursday that “the privacy of Canadians will be fully respected,” and that the government has spoken to the privacy commissioner about the application.

However, in a statement to CTVNews.ca, Therrien’s office said they were “recently contacted by Health Canada” about the app.

“We have requested and are awaiting necessary information and, until such time as we receive that information, we have not provided our recommendations to the government. We are working diligently and responsibly to develop that advice,” said Therrien’s office.

The federal government is also establishing an external advisory council “to provide guidance during the roll-out of the app with a view to ensuring it operates in a transparent way and in the public interest.”

In May, Therrien issued a joint statement with provincial and territorial privacy commissioners, calling for governments to ensure that any applications being developed or recommended respect Canadian privacy laws.

Among the privacy watchdog’s recommendations: ensuring the app was voluntary; its scope and ability to monitor users’ behaviour must be science-based; the data collected is de-identified as much as possible; and that it is subject to independent oversight.

“At no time will personal information be collected or shared, and no location services will be used,” Trudeau said, calling the app “totally secure and completely anonymized.”

Tech analyst Carmy Levy said in an interview on CTV News Channel that while he’ll wait and see how the app functions when it’s downloadable, it is a positive step to see the app won’t use location services. But he said that even with “all reasonable efforts” being taken to strip away identifiable information, to a certain degree nothing is fully anonymous.

“We are opening up a bit of a privacy Pandora's box. Are we taking reasonable precautions? Yes… But kind of have to balance that and gauge, what are we getting back in return for this risk? Are we allowing ourselves to get ahead of the pandemic?”

Ryerson's Cybersecure Policy Exchange released a report on contact tracing earlier this month and it found that based on a survey of 2,000 Canadians in mid-May, a majority of those surveyed were supportive of making some form of anonymized app mandatory.

Thursday marks 100 days since the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and it was on this day that Canada officially recorded more than 100,000 cases of COVID-19, as provinces continue to ramp up testing to understand accurate levels of infection in the country.",[]

If that major and unprecedented moment in Canadian politics occurs, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland would become Canada’s acting prime minister.

That’s according to an official order made on March 13, the day that Trudeau’s office announced that his wife Sophie had tested positive for COVID-19.

The prime minister remains in self-isolation but on Monday Trudeau said he and his children remain symptom-free, while his wife’s symptoms are mild.

Trudeau has been working from home, chairing cabinet meetings, holding regular public addresses, and participating in international calls with world leaders from his home office.

“In the event that the Prime Minister is unable to perform the functions of his office,” a threshold left undefined, Freeland would take charge, reads the order issued by the Privy Council Office.

In line with public health advice, Trudeau has not been tested for COVID-19 as he is not symptomatic, but given the rapid and concerning spread, the federal cabinet has been given instructions on the roles they’d play if the situation evolved.

Following Freeland, the next five ministers in line are based on seniority: Veterans Affairs Minister Lawrence MacAulay; Indigenous Services Minister Carolyn Bennett; President of the Privy Council Dominic LeBlanc; Industry Minister Navdeep Bains; and Finance Minister Bill Morneau.

The order also goes on to outline how ministerial roles would shift to see all portfolios covered should Freeland become Canada’s acting prime minister, or if other ministers are no longer able to do their jobs.

If Freeland takes on Trudeau’s job, LeBlanc would become deputy prime minister, for example. Should federal Health Minister Patty Hajdu be unable to fulfill her duties, Bennett, who is a doctor, would take on that job.",[]

All eastern Ontario health units, including Ottawa, are included in this list.

In Stage 3, the government says nearly all businesses will be allowed to reopen and the maximum size of public gatherings will increase.

Businesses that can reopen include indoor dining in restaurants, bars, concession stands, and other food and drink establishments; gyms and fitness studios, with safety protocols in place; playgrounds, community centres and libraries; and beauty salons can resume services that involve customers' faces like facials and some piercings.

Casinos can reopen but table games will not be permitted. Nightclubs can only reopen to serve food and drink. Dancing is not allowed in Stage 3.

Indoor gatherings will increase to a maximum of 50 people and outdoor gatherings will increase to a maximum of 100 people. Physical distancing is still required, so gathering limits are subject to the amount of space any individual indoor or outdoor area has available.

Despite the larger cap on gatherings, Ontario's ""social bubbles"" remain at a maximum of 10 people.

Some businesses that will not be reopening in Stage 3 are those considered ""high-risk"" for large crowds congregating, difficulties with physical distancing or challenges with keeping up with COVID-19 sanitation requirements.

The businesses and activities that will not be open or allowed in Stage 3 include:

Amusement parks and water parks;

Buffet-style food services;

Dancing at restaurants and bars, other than by performers hired by the establishment following specific requirements;

Overnight stays at camps for children;

Private karaoke rooms;

Prolonged or deliberate contact while playing sports;

Saunas, steam rooms, bath houses and oxygen bars;

Table games at casinos and gaming establishments.

Ottawa was among the first regions allowed to ease restrictions when Stage 2 came into effect June 12.

Since then, the number of active COVID-19 cases has remained relatively steady.

Ottawa Public Health announced 161 new laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 between June 12 and July 13; however, at least five cases were also removed from the total case count as they were deemed to be in residents from outside of Ottawa.

10 new cases were announced on Monday, bringing the number of active cases to 59. Two people remain in hospital with one in the ICU.

During Stage 2, there were two days where no new cases were announced by OPH. Six new COVID-19 related deaths were announced in the past month. Ottawa is currently on its 17th straight day of reporting zero new COVID-19 deaths.

Changes have also come to everyday life, with masks being made mandatory in enclosed public spaces in Ottawa by public health order. A mandatory mask by-law will be discussed at Ottawa city council on Wednesday, which includes fines for non-compliance.

Under the public health order, you are allowed to temporarily remove your mask indoors if you are receiving services, eating or drinking, participating in fitness or water-based activities, or for an emergency.

""If not now, when?""

Local business owners were eager Sunday to find out what it Stage 3 would mean for them.

Some have had to keep their doors closed since the start of the pandemic.

""The services that we do are generally pertaining to the face, and that’s prohibited in phase two,"" said Kim Bui, co-owner of Pure Beauty Studio, which remains closed.

She’s hopeful the next phase will allow her to reopen her business.

""We should be able to reopen because, if not, our livelihoods are at stake. We have families to feed, roofs to keep over our heads, and just a business that simply is a dream really.""

Meanwhile, other businesses have been able to reopen amid Stage 2, but owners say it has come at a cost.

""Right now, we’re just hoping to stay relevant; we’re hoping people will support us and drop by,” said Curtis Houlden, owner of Tail Gators on Merivale Road.

Houlden said he has been able to reopen a small patio four days a week, but it isn’t financially sustainable and he hopes that will change soon.

""I’m always trying to look at the positive, but the reality is, to answer that question, for sure I’m frustrated, because if not now, when?""",[]

However, seeing a show won't be the same as it used to be. There are strict limits on the number of people allowed inside buildings.

Stage 3 allows for a maximum of 50 people indoors, who must physically distance. If the show is outdoors, up to 100 people are allowed to gather.

Performers are also required to physically distance except when necessary for the purpose of the show.

Gladstone Theatre manager Don Fex is getting ready for Friday.

""I think everybody around the building and who is connected with the building is just super excited to get back to work,"" he said. ""Not being able to do this for as long as we have is definitely taking a toll on us.""

The Mayfair Theatre survived the shut down by selling naming rights to their seats.

""For a donation you could buy your name on a seat,"" said co-owner Josh Stafford. ""Whether it was for a name, a business, for a dog. I genuinely thought we’d sell, oh we’ll sell 10 or 20 at a 150 bucks apiece and we’ll make a couple hundred dollars. We sold everything.""

Getting ready for Friday is a tight turnaround, Stafford said.

""It's going to be a heck of a lot of work. We need to get candy; we need to wrangle back our employees; we need to get posters and movies.""

The National Arts Centre's most recent update said performances and events would be cancelled until August 31.

""This decision is the right thing to do to keep our community safe and healthy. Our audience expects nothing less of us,"" the NAC said on its website.

In a statement to CTV News, movie theatre giant Cineplex said they could not guarantee they would be reopening right away.

""The news is certainly welcome by the team here at Cineplex,"" the company said. ""That said, we are still reviewing what's being proposed in Ontario so I can't confirm what it will mean for our cinemas across the province just yet. While we are certainly excited for the day our operations can resume, our top priority has always been the health and safety of our employees and guests and ensuring that their time with us is safe, comfortable and welcoming.""

But that wasn't all.

The customer, whom Frost described as a regular and a Canadian military service member, gave Frost a gift of $1000 in cash.

Like many restaurants, the Wellington Diner has been dealing with the challenges of running a business during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Speaking to CTV News Ottawa on Monday, Frost said he'll be sharing the financial gift with staff who have worked tirelessly during the lockdown.

In October 2019, ClubLink formally applied to the City of Ottawa to bulldoze the golf course and build more homes.

The City later filed the paperwork to bring the case to court. The City wants ClubLink to withdraw its building application or offer the land to the City for free.

The City insists the community must be maintained with 40 per cent greenspace because of an agreement signed in the 1980s between the City of Kanata and developers.

The court will also hear from the Kanata Greenspace Protection Coalition, a group of residents who live in the area and are trying to stop the development from going forward.

CTV News has reached out to ClubLink for comment but has not heard back.

In the past, the company has said redevelopment would be a better use of the property because the golf course has seen a decline in use in recent years, while costs to maintain the course continue to rise.",[]

Transportation Services General Manager John Manconi says the concern is not the cracked wheels on the vehicles, but the fact the cracks have occurred so early in the system’s life.

The TSB announced on Friday that it is conducting a “Class 3” investigation after cracks were found on a total of four wheels on three separate vehicles during maintenance and inspection activities.

Speaking on CTV Morning Live Monday morning, Manconi said Rideau Transit Maintenance, Alstom and OC Transpo started investigating as soon as the cracks were discovered.

“The investigations started immediately and that’s with a team of experts both on the consortium side, the city side and now we have TSB also,” said Manconi.

“Which is good because that offers different lenses and checks upon checks, which is what you want with a safety element such as this.”

Alstom, the builder of the rail cars, is required to do regular inspections on all wheels until the source of the wheel cracks are discovered.

“The good news is that they have not found any additional cracked wheels and the inspection regime is working. Every single vehicle gets inspected after its been in use.”

Manconi told CTV Morning Live that there are several “checks and balances” on the rail system, including Transport Canada, an independent oversight body that reports to Council, and a Chief Safety Officer that reports to him.

“That Chief Safety Officer and myself we can ground the fleet, we can bring it to an immediate stop if we have any safety concerns or any concerns without asking anyone,” Manconi said.

“The first thing we asked when we heard of a potential cracked wheel, we asked for documentation from RTG from the safety experts that says there’s no risk to the public. The TSB has asked for the documentation and our independent experts and our Chief Safety Officer. We’ve seen that twice now in terms of the vehicles can continue to be in use if they’re inspected.”

Manconi says he understands people may be frustrated following another issue with the Confederation Line since its launch on September 14.

“I just want to reassure the public - the system is safe, the inspections are ongoing and there’s a lot of oversight on it.”

Manconi says Alstom will continue to conduct inspections on the rail wheels until the “issue is put to bed.”",[]
579,ctvnews,https://ottawa.ctvnews.ca/photo-radar-cameras-turned-on-in-ottawa-school-zones-1.5021553,Photo radar cameras turned on in Ottawa school zones,[],2020-07-13 04:44:00-04:00,"OTTAWA -- Photo radar cameras are now keeping an eye on speeders in school zones in Ottawa.

The City of Ottawa’s automated speed enforcement pilot-project begins today, four months later than scheduled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The speed camera technology will be deployed on roadways adjacent to school zones to catch speeders going over the posted speed limit.

Eight locations have been designated for photo radar cameras. The city has purchased four photo radar cameras, with two set up in fixed locations.

The two fixed camera locations are on Bayshore Drive near St. Rose of Lima School and Innes Road near Ecole secondaire catholique Beatrice-Desloges.

The other two cameras will rotate among the six other sites approximately every 45 days. The locations are:

Oglivie Road (Gloucester High School)

Smyth Road (Vincent Massey Public School, Hillcrest High School and Ecole secondaire catholique Franco-Cite)

Meadowlands Drive West (St. Gregory School)

Watters Road (St. Francis of Assisi School)

Longfields Drive (Ecole elementaire catholique Pierre-Elliott Trudeau, St. Mother Theresa High School and Longfields-Davidson Heights Secondary School)

Katimavik Road (Holy Trinity Catholic High School)

The city says a motorist photographed speeding through the area will likely get a ticket. The amount of the fine will be based on how much the driver was exceeding the posted speed limit. There are no demerit points associated with infractions from the speed cameras.

Phil Landry, Director of Traffic Services, told CTV News data show these cameras do reduce speeding.

""Our hope is that speeds will go down and people will drive at a more reasonable speed especially in these school zones where you’ve got lots of kids and others that are walking to and from school,"" he said.

Ottawa Police Sgt. Mark Gatien said the cameras will mean more officers will be free to respond to other calls.

""We have many many other locations that we can go to that have issues as well,"" he said.. ""So these will take our place and its just something that we are looking forward to. And it just helps us out immensely.""

Speaking on CTV Morning Live Monday morning, Councillor Tim Tierney said the introduction of photo radar comes after complaints to Councillors.

“I’ll tell you what the number one call to Councillors offices is – it’s not potholes and lightbulbs, it’s speeding bar none,” said Tierney.

“So there’s a case to be made for photo radar. We’re looking to see how this can work.”

The Ontario Government gave municipalities the power to introduce photo radar in school zones.

“Whatever money is made off photo radar doesn’t go back into the general coffers,” said Tierney when asked about how photo radar is perceived as a cash-grab.

“It actually goes to our risk safety program that we have, trying to decrease the number of fatal or serious injuries within the city.”

Speaking to CTV News Monday afternoon, Mayor Jim Watson also fired back at the notion that photo radar is a cash-grab.

""Many people will claim that this is a money grab. Well, one hundred per cent of the funds raised from this project from people who are speeding will go into other community safety projects in the city of Ottawa,"" he said.

Ottawa’s automated speed enforcement pilot-project was scheduled to begin in March, but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the school closures.",[]

The Société de transport de l'Outaouais (STO) says there will be a two-week grace period to allow riders to get ready, with masks becoming officially mandatory as of July 27, according to STO's website.

The Quebec government mandated masks on all public transit in the province as of July 13. Riders age 12 and up will be required to wear masks, unless they are medically exempt.

The STO did not say on its website how the order would be enforced. Spokesperson Alexandre Meloche Dorris told CTV News in an email that they're waiting for more information from the Quebec government.

""We remain in discussions with the government, and will ensure that our clients and colleagues are informed of the details,"" Meloche Dorris said.

Masks became mandatory on OC Transpo on June 15, but the transit service does not deny boarding to anyone without a mask.

Masks becoming required on public transit in Gatineau comes the same day Quebec Premier François Legault is expected to announce that masks will be mandatory inside all enclosed public spaces in the province starting on Saturday.",[]

Rick Chiarelli is arguing a report by the City of Ottawa's integrity commissioner was ""unfair"" because he was unable to participate in the process and he is accusing the commissioner and the City of failing to accommodate his health conditions.

On Friday, Integrity Commissioner Robert Marleau released a report recommending “the most severe of sanctions” against Coun. Chiarelli after investigating allegations of improper conduct toward women applying for jobs in his office.

The report recommended council suspend Chiarelli’s salary for three consecutive 90-day periods, which amounts to more than $79,000 in pay.

The allegations against Chiarelli, which were first reported by CBC Ottawa in September 2019, involved comments that left the complainants “uncomfortable, embarrassed and troubled,” the report said.

The report details three complaints from people who had interviewed for a job in Coun. Chiarelli’s office. Marleau received two other complaints from former employees of his office, which he said would be dealt with in a separate report.

Chiarelli has denied any wrongdoing. In his most detailed response to the allegations last October, he denied the allegations and claimed they were part of a coordinated political attack. He told CTV News in November he would be vindicated.

Statement claims commissioner failed to accommodate ailing councillor

The councillor's office issued a statement to the Ottawa Citizen on Friday, arguing the report was ""unfair"" because Chiarelli was unable to participate due to medical issues.

""The report is unfair because it was completed without consideration for Councillor Chiarelli having the opportunity to comment, not because he was unwilling to participate but because the Councillor was unable to due to ongoing medical issues which led to him requiring Open-Heart surgery then followed by severe complications which were documented,"" the statement to the Citizen said. ""Medical notes were provided to the Integrity Commissioner on several occasions which he failed to mention in his Interim Report despite having them at that time but those are now recorded in the final report.

""On April 14, the Councillor also experienced another medical emergency which was determined to be a TIA aka mini-stroke which led to some temporary memory loss and a recommendation from the neurosurgeon extending his medical leave and not to participate in anything stressful until the end of July.""

Marleau's report says, in item 31, that Chiarelli was ""afforded the opportunity to provide written responses, information, and documentation, to be interviewed on invitation and to represent his position in response to the allegations.""

Marleau said he had issued a summons for Chiarelli to appear and provide testimony under oath but he doubts that it was brought to Chiarelli's attention.

Marleau told council in May, he would continue his investigation without Chiarelli's participation.

On Sunday afternoon, CTV News Ottawa was provided with the same statement given to the Ottawa Citizen on Friday, but the councillor's office included three additional paragraphs accusing Marleau and the City of Ottawa of failing to accommodate Chiarelli's health.

""While the Integrity Commissioner does acknowledge at item 80 of his report that Councillor Chiarelli has experienced significant health challenges and acknowledges receiving medical certificates he has repeatedly failed to take into consideration how these serious health challenges have prevented him from being able to participate,"" the additional statement to CTV News says. ""Namely an open-heart operation and serious bacterial infection that lasted several months for which the Councillor has shared information about openly with the public as well as Mr. Marleau as well as other complications.

""Mr. Marleau has repeatedly ignored medical professionals opinions not on an expected return to work date at the end of March but an appointment for Medical re-assessment and further concluded that the Councillor was unwilling to participate in early May when he had been provided a medical certificate with an expected return to work date of late June this was later extended to the end of July.

""This clearly shows that the Integrity Commissioner and the City of Ottawa have failed in their duty to accommodate the Councillor in regards to his health condition as it relates to his participation in this investigation.""

Director of Strategic Affairs & Communications in Chiarelli's office, Chantal Lebel, sent the statement to CTV News on Chiarelli's behalf.

The final sentence of the statement says a judicial review was filed with the court on Friday, ""as this process was filled with bias, no natural justice and was based on no tangible evidence except hearsay.""

Chiarelli requested a leave of absence from council in October, citing a doctor’s note that he had fainted, but his colleagues denied the request. He had open-heart surgery in December and was subsequently treated for a bacterial infection, according to a tweet on his account in January, reportedly sent by his wife.

Since council denied his request for medical leave, Chiarelli has shown up to some council meetings in order to maintain his seat. Under Ontario law, a municipal council seat is declared vacant if a councillor does not attend meetings for three consecutive months.

Council will consider Marleau's report Wednesday and decide whether to penalize Chiarelli.

The proposed new bylaw gives Ottawa Bylaw officers the power to issue fines ranging from $200 to $400 to people caught not wearing face masks in indoor public places during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Council will vote Wednesday on a proposed mandatory face mask bylaw, that will remain in effect until at least August 26. Medical Officer of Health Dr. Vera Etches announced last Monday that face masks will be mandatory in all indoor public places starting Tuesday, July 7.

While the bylaw includes a fine for non-compliance of wearing a face mask in indoor places, Ottawa's general manager of emergency services says Ottawa Bylaw officers will focus on education and not enforcement.

""Our objective here, should Council approve the report, is to supplement what Dr. Etches has been telling us. This is an individual responsibility and we all have to as a community step up,"" said Anthony Di Monte.

""Yes, we're putting a bylaw in that's giving us new tools; our focus is definitely education and communication with people to try to attempt them to ensure that they wear a mask.""

Di Monte said the Bylaw Services officers would ""not"" be patrolling for people not wearing masks to issue fines, adding the bylaw is a ""tool within our toolkit"" for people who ""continuingly"" refuse to wear a face mask.

In a report for Council, city staff said the proposed bylaw for mandatory face masks will focus on indoor locations where the public has access as they re-open. Visitors must wear a face mask at: restaurants and other eating and drinking establishments; retail locations; places of worship; sports facilities; museums, theatres and other entertainment venues; public areas in hotels and other short-term rental premises; and public areas in hospitals and other health facilities. The mandatory face mask bylaw will also apply to City of Ottawa buildings and facilities, including libraries.

On June 15, face masks became mandatory on all OC Transpo buses, the O-Train, in stations and on Para Transpo Vehicles. The new City of Ottawa face mask policy would cover violations on OC Transpo property.

Staff say, ""As with any bylaw, or with any new public health measure, the primary objective is to educate and inform, and gain voluntary compliance.""

""However a bylaw does provide a means to impose penalties through tickets should such action be deemed necessary, such as in the case where a warning is insufficient or with repeat offenders.""

The proposed fine ranges between $200 and $400 for not wearing a face mask.

The report for Council says the ""requested fines will be a reasonable amount, in keeping with the set fines of most other City bylaws, in the range of $200-400, based on the individuals or Corporations, subject to the approval of the Ontario Court of Justice.""

""The bylaw will have a fine component to it, but frankly I hope we never have to use that,"" said Keith Egli, Chair of Ottawa's Board of Health.

""What we've seen in the last couple of days with our businesses and with the customers is heartening, and shows we're on the right track.""

If approved by Council, the bylaw will take effect immediately and remain in effect until the next regularly scheduled Council meeting on August 26. Staff says Council may extend the bylaw for an additional period of time.",[]

Police also claim an officer was assaulted while making an arrest. The officer's injuries were minor.

The 17-year-old, who cannot be named under the Youth Criminal Justice Act, is facing charges that include driving while impaired, dangerous driving, assaulting a peace officer, taking a motor vehicle without consent, and driving while under suspension.

590,ctvnews,https://ottawa.ctvnews.ca/tips-to-protect-your-data-amid-furor-over-tiktok-1.5020973,Tips to protect your data amid furor over TikTok,['Ted Raymond'],2020-07-12 11:15:00-04:00,"OTTAWA -- A widely popular app, with more than two billion downloads, is coming under increased scrutiny about its security practices and permissions, prompting at least one tech expert to tell users to delete it immediately.

TikTok lets users record and post short video clips. It's proven incredibly popular, especially with teens and people in their early 20s.

However, security experts and some U.S. politicians have issued warnings about the app's origins and about what it does in the background when it is and is not being used, prompting some companies to tell their employees to remove it from their phones.

Carmi Levy, the director of content marketing at the London, Ont.-based Info-Tech Research Group tells Newstalk 580 CFRA's ""The Goods with Dahlia Kurtz"" that TikTok collects far more data than it needs and he's advising smartphone users to delete it.

""This app is bad news,"" Levy says. ""We're just not paying attention. Everyone is so focused on sharing cute little videos of their dogs dancing to fun music that they don't realize that, in the background, this app is probably one of the worst of the worst that we've ever seen in the era of smartphones.""

Levy says the popularity of TikTok with young people is part of the reason he's warning people about the risks.

""It is a relatively young demographic that doesn't see smartphone apps as a risk,"" he says.

Levy points to the permissions TikTok asks the user to approve before they can use it.

""The app is deliberately built to access everything on your phone. When you install it, it pops up a little message saying, 'Do you give us the right to access your contacts, your schedule, your camera, your mic, your location services?' Everything. Of course, you say 'yes' because you want to use it.""

Levy also warned that a Chinese company called ByteDance makes the app, which leaves them open to influence by China's communist government.

TikTok has said it stores user data on U.S.-based servers that aren't subject to Chinese law. It has also denied sharing user data with the Chinese government and has insisted it would not do so, if asked.

Nevertheless, Levy still warns that the data the app collects is far broarder than it needs to be.

""This app collects so much information on us,"" Levy says. ""It's not just within the app; it's everything else that we're doing. You post something on Facebook: TikTok knows. You tweet something: TikTok knows. You go to the store to buy something: TikTok knows.""

Earlier this week, Amazon told its staff to delete the app in a companywide email, before backtracking about five hours later, saying the directive was a mistake.

Below are some of Levy's tips for keeping your data safe.

'Is it reasonable?' Check your permissions

Levy says apps of all kinds ask for permission to use certain things, like your microphone, camera, or location. Just because an app wants to access those things does not make it dangerous, but he says to consider whether the request is reasonable.

""Ask yourself, when you're installing an app, what are the reasonable things this app should be asking for in order to do its job?"" He says. ""It makes sense for Google Maps to ask for access to location services. Similarly, if it's a scheduling or collaboration app, it should probably have access to our calendar and contacts. There should also be controls within the app to allow us to turn those accesses off if we wish but still use the app.

""The problem with TikTok is it asks for everything, even if the services aren't related to what the app is trying to do.""

Get rid of apps you're not using

Levy suggests reviewing your apps regularly, and being more cynical about downloading new ones.

""We need to start looking at what we download and what we use it for, and we need to be a lot more careful about what we say yes to and what we hold on to over time,"" Levy says.

Levy says apps that are not on your smartphone's front screen are used less often.

""If you're not using that, get rid of it,"" he says. ""If you're not using them regularly, they're still most likely collecting information in the background.""

Be choosy about new apps

""Look at each app not just as something cool that all your friends are using,"" Levy says. ""Only download the things you're going to use. Worry that these apps are, in fact, spyware. Assume an app is spyware until it proves otherwise. When you're on the app store, read the page. See where it comes from, see how many times it's been downloaded, look at what other people are saying about it, look online and read the reviews.""

He also warns that some apps will install more than one icon, and you may not know you're installing multiple apps if you just rush to download something.

Review your settings, app by app, regularly

""Go into your settings. It will actually tell you which apps are accessing which services. Go through them one at a time and ask yourself, 'am I really comfortable with that?' Turn off the accesses that are not comfortable for you,"" Levy says.

""Apps are always doing stuff in the background that we may or may not know about, so we've got to keep them honest and do regular maintenance.""

Levy suggests setting an alarm in your calendar once a month to remind yourself to review your apps.

""When it pops up, take an hour or half an hour, and just go through your devices for things that look funny because, chances are, if they look funny to you, they are problematic and you're going to want to shut them down now.""

Medical Officer of Health Dr. Vera Etches announced that Ottawa Public Health is mandating the use of masks in indoor public spaces to help limit the spread of COVID-19.

Ottawa Public Health has tips for washing, re-using, storing and discarding a cloth mask or face covering after using it on its website.

The health unit says masks or face coverings become contaminated, especially when touched by your hands.

Removing the mask:

Ottawa Public Health says, ""after washing your hands with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, remove your mask by pulling the ties or ear loops away from your ears.""

Washing the mask:

If your mask has a removable, non-reusable filter, make sure to remove and throw out the filter before machine washing or hand-washing your mask.

When using a washing machine, Ottawa Public Health says put the cloth mask directly into the washing machine or in a bag that can be emptied into the washing machine. Throw out the bag after you have used it to store your mask.

Wash your hands again with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer after handling your mask.

Wash the masks with other laundry using a hot water cycle.

For hand-washing the cloth face mask, Ottawa Public Health says use laundry detergent and water as hot as you can stand, then dry thoroughly.

If you are discarding damaged or worn out masks, drop them in a lined garbage bin.

Ottawa Public Health says do not leave any discarded masks in places where others can come in contact with them such as shopping carts, public seats, but stops or on the ground.

Reusing your face mask

Ottawa Public Health says cloth masks may be re-used throughout the day, ""if not soiled and undamaged.""

When removing your face mask, public health says ""with clean hands, remove the mask from your face and fold it in half so that the outer space is inwards (so that the contaminated outer surface is not contacting anything during storage) and place it in a clean, sealable bag until ready to use it again the same day.""

Can I wear my cloth mask all day?

Ottawa Public Health says a mask can be worn all day as long as it does not become damaged, damp or dirty.

""Do not share your mask with others,"" the health unit says.

""Remove your mask with clean hands when you are safely able to do so and wash your hands using soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.""

Storing your face mask during the day

Ottawa Public Health reminds people ""do not place your used mask into your pocket.""

When reusing a mask, place it in a clean, sealable bag until ready to use it again the same day.""

Ottawa Public Health says disposable masks should not be washed, reused or recycled.",[]

599,ctvnews,https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/raptors-veteran-kyle-lowry-believes-the-nba-restart-will-work-perfectly-1.5022431,Raptors veteran Kyle Lowry believes the NBA restart will 'work perfectly',['Lori Ewing'],2020-07-13 16:22:00-04:00,"TORONTO -- Kyle Lowry has been a big contributor to the NBA's return to the court as part of the players' association restart group. He strongly believes it will work.

Speaking to the media for the first time since the NBA shut down on March 11 due to COVID-19, the Toronto Raptors veteran was feisty. He chastised one reporter for having bad WiFi. He pretended not to hear another. He said the best thing about the four month layoff was not having to ""talk to any of you guys.""

But the 34-year-old guard was serious when it came to the coronavirus, which is raging across the U.S. like a prairie grass fire. He's confident in the safety of the NBA's campus at Walt Disney World.

""Protocols are unbelievable, I think our protocols and our health and safety measures have been top-notch, I think this thing will work perfectly,"" Lowry said. ""I think the league, the players' association has done a phenomenal job of making sure that we're doing everything that we can possibly do to make sure that we're healthy, we're safe and we're in an environment where we can be successful and to do our jobs at a high level.""

In the time since the NBA chose to play at Disney World, Florida has become a COVID-19 hot spot, setting a record by topping 15,000 new cases on Sunday.

Major League Soccer also chose Disney World for its MLS is Back tournament, but stumbled out to a rocky start, with two teams withdrawing due to positive tests, and numerous game delays.

Lowry is a ""big fan of how everything has come together"" for the NBA, and said the weeks spent on a cruise ship with the U.S. basketball team at the 2016 Rio Olympics -- the team opted not to stay in the athletes village -- helped prepare him for the Florida campus and its restrictions.

""That experience was pretty awesome, being around those guys, but it kind of really prepared me for this type of living,"" said Lowry, wearing a backwards blue baseball cap on a Zoom call Monday. ""To live on a boat and be in a smaller room and not have as many amenities, that time really prepared me for this.""

He has no complaints about the living arrangements, which could be home to the Raptors for nearly three months.

""Listen, I'm living good,"" he said. ""I'm healthy, my family is good, I get to play basketball, I can't really complain. I get meals and I'm happy. I'm able to do my job and provide for my family and to get out there and entertain and try to give some enthusiasm back into the world with our basketball abilities.""

Raptors coach Nick Nurse said the fact Lowry was a big part of the team's restart plans trickles down to the rest of the team.

""Having him as the guy who's kind of setting the example, he'll say to these guys, 'Take this stuff seriously, take these protocols seriously, let's be smart and let's do it,"" and I think it certainly resonates with the rest of the team,"" the coach said.

""Let's be smart"" will be key to the restart's success. New broke Monday that Houston Rockets forward and former Raptor Bruno Caboclo inadvertently broke quarantine and must now self-isolate in his room for eight days.

Nurse praised Lowry both for his leadership in the restart and on the court.

""It's clearly Kyle's team. His care factor is way up there, his intelligence factor is way up, we're in good hands with him being the leader of this team,"" Nurse said. ""When a guy plays the way he does, the leadership by example -- that phrase is probably over-used, but it's certainly the case. For basketball in general, the way you play is like the first kind of characteristic of being a great leader.""

Lowry, who has two young sons Karter and Kameron, said it will ""suck"" to be away from them for the next few weeks -- families aren't permitted at Disney World until the second round of the playoffs.

But he said his boys understand the sacrifices required right now to play basketball.

""They understand that their dad has to go to work,"" Lowry said. ""The one thing I always say is FaceTiming technology, as you guys see on this Zoom thing, it's changed the game, so I can talk to my kids every single day. They can FaceTime me, they call me to talk, it's kind of interactive, we make sure that I know what's going on with their day, they're consistently asking me questions, and asking me to buy them Roblox (an online game).

""That's all they really care about is Roblox, and my money and spending it.""

The four-month break gave Lowry the rare chance to be home with his sons, and he cherished the time with them, and the opportunity to be able to tuck them into bed at night.

""That was the longest time I've ever been able to enjoy my actual home (in Philadelphia), my family, my friends,"" he said. ""But it was different. Times were different. You wanted to be more careful, you wanted to be in a situation where you want it to be safe, and understand that you have to be safe with your family.

""But right now, it feels great to be able to get back on the basketball floor with your guys, your teammates, getting the camaraderie back together, and knowing that you're about to do your job.""

The Raptors know that loneliness will be one of the biggest challenges of these unprecedented next few weeks, and so the team put up family photos in each player's room. They've all be appreciative, including Lowry, who said it was reminiscent of the family wall in the Raptors' locker room at Scotiabank Arena, which is plastered with photos of players' kids, spouses, parents and grandparents.

""That's just one thing that the Raptors organization has always kind of implemented is family, your family,"" Lowry said. ""So it's cool. Nice gesture.""

A theme of the NBA's restart will be social and racial justice. The Raptors arrived at Disney World in two buses painted with ""Black Lives Matter"" in big block letters. Lowry participated in a huge protest last month in Philadelphia.

""We are in a time where we need to keep that conversation going. We need to be heard from. We need to speak loud and clear,"" he said. ""We need to understand that things need to be done for the situation to be changed, laws to be changed.

""For me to be a part of that, that's who I am. I grew up a Black man in America. It's definitely a tough thing to grow up that way, because you never know what could possibly happen to you. You never know if you're going to make it out. For me to be able to talk to you guys is a blessing. So for me to be able to do that, it's my right, my duty and my honour to represent the Black culture.""

Toronto FC played its first match since March on Monday, taking on DC United in Florida where the league has put teams in a bubble. The match was played without fans in the stands and the usual loud cheering that goes with a full stadium.

""It kinda sucks,"" said fan Vlad Islamov. ""(The) best way to explain, there are games playing so you can watch it, while you watch it at home, it is boring.”

CTV News Toronto checked on a few of the footie hot spots where fans usually get together to watch a match, but some had closed due to the pandemic. Others like Cafe Diplomatico in Little Italy, where fans jammed the patio during the World Cup, say it was a business decision to not turn the TC screens on today.

Bartender James Russomammo says that with only half the seats on the patio open due to COVID-19 restrictions, the restaurant needs to turn them over.

""We didn't put the screens back up, we weren't able to get as many tables open as we usually have, so (with) the screens down, more people can use the patio, quicker table time. To come and have dinner it's an hour and a half (to) two hours and if you stay to watch a game, it's going to be three hours""

Jennifer Phillips tuned into the match on TV at home today, but says she would rather be around people.

""I was watching a little bit this morning, it was good but you still miss the comradery of people being in the bars and patios, just the feel of it is more energizing.""

Vlad Islamov says it is not the same when you are not surrounded by like-minded people.

""Soccer is an experience. It does miss out, not being able to go to a bar and not having fans around me, you just miss out on that fundamental watching experience.

But the fans generally say that this is better than nothing.",[]

June 19

Most regions in Ontario are clear to partially reopen on Friday, with strict health and safety measures in place.

However, there are some exceptions, including Toronto, Peel and Windsor-Essex. Those three areas have been held back from reopening the services listed below due to the number of infections they have been reporting recently.

The city initially cancelled all of its planned summer camps in May amid concerns about the spread of the virus but it later announced plans for a modified program dubbed “CampTO.”

As part of the program, the city is offering identical day camps for children between the ages of six and 12 at 130 locations across the city.

The day camps will feature all the usual activities, such as sports, arts and crafts and drama and music, but they will also take public health advice into account.

That means there will be smaller groups, daily symptom checks, efforts to ensure physical dispatching where possible, a prohibition on field trips and a pre-camp call to go over the new procedures.

Campers will have to bring two to three clean masks each day and wear them whenever indoors in order to comply with a bylaw that went into effect last week.

“This is a very important day for us. I thought that we were going to maybe be in a position where we just have no camps this summer and that would have been most unfortunate but thanks to the effort of our staff and the cooperation from our medical officer of health and her team we got some camps pulled together and they are not just random camps; they are great camps that are going to be great for kids,” Mayor John Tory told reporters on Monday morning after touring one of the camps at the Parkway Forest Community Centre in North York.

About 4,500 campers signed up

There were already 68,000 registrations for city-run summer camps when the decision was made to cancel them in May.

So far there have been about 16,650 registrations for the new CampTO program, though many of those signed up are participating in multiple one-week camps.

The city says that the number of individual children participating in the program is only about 4,500 so far, with nearly 2,500 of them starting camp today.

“Listening to the gleeful screams and laughter behind me is just music, it is music to our ears and it is a sign that at least children in Toronto can get off their phones and be in a camp playing with each other,” Don Valley North Coun. Shelley Carroll said on Monday morning.

“CampTO is a lot about getting kids ready for our new COVID-19 world. It (the virus) is with us for the next several months and kids need to get use to how they can keep themselves safe in a group setting and they can learn that at CampTO while they are having fun. I think it really will make them ready for the school year and whatever that may entail.”

Tory said that only about 70 per cent of the summer camp spots have been filled so far, leaving extra capacity for any parent who wants to sign their child up at the last minute.

The camps all last for one week and will run until mid-August.

“A lot of people I am sure were taking a cautionary approach to this but I can assure you having seen it myself this morning that these camps have taken every possible precaution in close cooperation with the medical officer of health to make sure they are safe,” Tory promised on Monday. “Nothing has been left to chance.”

Both Gabriella Walker and her sister Alexis wore masks as they waited in line to have their temperatures taken. The sisters are enlisted at the camp being held at the Pan Am Sports Centre in Scarborough.

“It’s a little bit weird considering this Corona stuff,” said 12-year-old Gabriella.

Despite that, the girls say they are excited for the summer activities to begin, though their mother is apprehensive.

“I’m worried that they won’t listen to social distancing rules, a little,” Elizabeth Walker told CTV News Toronto.

Surveillance footage obtained by CTV News Toronto shows a group of people gathered in a parking lot at 251 Woolner Avenue, in the Jane Street and St. Clair Avenue area, at 10:20 p.m. on Friday.

A dark coloured sedan with blue headlights approaches and seconds later, gunfire erupts off the frame and people, including a child, duck and cower behind vehicles.

Investigators say at least one suspect inside the vehicle shot “indiscriminately” at people outside.

Three victims suffering gunshot wounds were located by police and paramedics at the scene, and two others made their own way to hospital.

One of those victims, 21-year-old Mohamed Sow, suffered critical injuries.

Sow died of those injuries in hospital on Saturday evening, police said.

Four other people injured in the shooting are expected to recover.

The first was in 1918, during the Spanish flu when Stallworthy was just three years old. The second, today, when she turned 105 during Covid-19.

She admits she doesn't remember much about her first pandemic birthday, but this was one she will never forget.

Dozens of people gathered down the street from the Kingston Road home where Stallworthy has lived for more than half a century, and then, on foot, paraded past her house to offer their best wishes. Sitting on her front porch, Stallworthy watched as person after person came to pay their respects from a safe social distance.

""It's just tremendous,"" Stallworthy told CTV News, ""I'm absolutely blown away.""

Stallworthy was born on July 12, 1915, in London, England. Before moving to Canada in 1951, she'd already lived through two world wars and the great depression. One of the first things she did upon settling in Toronto, was to join the congregation of Kingston Road United Church. ""I've been working my bottom off ever since,"" Stallworthy said with a laugh. To this day, she remains active in the church.

And it's her faith that she credits with getting her to 105, an age she admits she never thought she'd reach. When asked for the secret to her longevity, Stallworthy replies, ""I think it's my belief in good old God.""

Sunday's birthday parade was organized by her fellow parishioners. Granddaughter Sheri Gardiner told CTV News, ""she just loves people, and I think it's pretty obvious today that people love her too​.""

Finding a way to safely celebrate a 105th birthday during Covid-19 can be a challenge.

""I feel as if I'm living my life in a bubble,"" Stallworthy said.

The normally active and social centenarian says she's been trying to stay social but at a safe distance from those who visit. And she says while she heard stories about the 1918 pandemic from her mother, Covid-19 gives her pause. ""Well this one is so different, I'm not sure how we're going to come out of it.""

Stallworthy has been married twice, and along with remaining active in her church, she's a lifetime member of the Girl Guides and speaks to students about her experiences during the war each Remembrance Day.

Those at her birthday celebration marvelled at how active she remains at her age. Stallworthy says with a smile, ""life has to be lived. And you have to get up in the morning and say 'thank God I'm alive,' even though it hurts a little everywhere.""

As for what she might do to celebrate her 106th birthday next year, Stallworthy thinks for a second, and then says she'd like to fly to British Colombia, to visit family- including a new great-grandson she has yet to meet.

But for this birthday, Stallworthy sat back, and blew kisses from her porch- celebrating a milestone most will never achieve, and looking back at a life most could never imagine.

""It's been an incredible journey, and I feel that I'm the luckiest woman in the world to have gone through it.""",[]
608,ctvnews,https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/loophole-in-toronto-face-covering-bylaw-allows-some-employees-to-go-maskless-1.5018106,Loophole in Toronto face covering bylaw allows some employees to go maskless,[],2020-07-09 18:29:00-04:00,"TORONTO -- A Toronto resident who says he was “aghast” at the sight of two employees not wearing masks at a hardware store appears to have uncovered a loophole in the city’s new face covering bylaw.

The resident, who asked not to be identified, says he was shopping at a store near Dupont and Shaw streets when he noticed two employees working the cash register not wearing masks.

“I asked where their masks were and why they aren’t wearing masks,” he said in an email to CTV News Toronto. “They replied that they didn't need to wear them.”

He explained that the employees then pointed to a plexiglass screen in front of the cash register to create separation between staff and customers.

“They said that their manager had informed them that this constituted an area protected by a physical barrier,” he said.

He described the experience at this particular store as “reckless” and “cavalier” while adding that the alleged behavior will do nothing except “exacerbate a spike in the infection rate in a few short weeks to come.”

And while the experience may have left the customer unsettled, it appears the employees and the store were not breaking any rules.

The bylaw, which took effect on Tuesday, makes wearing masks mandatory in all public and enclosed indoor spaces in the city in an effort to reduce to spread of COVID-19. This means face coverings will be required on public transportation such as the TTC and ferries to the Toronto Islands, as well as inside shops, grocery stores and malls.

However, in an email to CTV News Toronto, the City of Toronto said that there are a few exceptions to the rule.

“Certain members of the public and employees may not be required to wear a mask or face covering, in relation to specific bylaw exemptions (e.g. children under the age of two and people with certain health conditions, employees in designated areas or protected by a physical barrier).”

The city goes on to say that the bylaw was drafted to allow each business owner the ability to craft and adopt a policy that “meets the City bylaw requirements and reflects the unique nature of their business, customers and employees, and the layout of their specific enclosed public spaces.”

Speaking with CTV News Toronto following the response from the city, the customer says that the justification for the lack of masks at the store has left him feeling “queasy.” Particularly because employees would still need to handle purchased items, receipts and cash that are then handed over to customers.

“If you’re talking about a self-contained area that you need a door to get into, that’s one thing. Their plexiglass barrier was not even totally enclosed,” he said. “But these people are going to be working for four to six hours a day, interacting with hundreds of people. And because we now know that COVID-19 may be airborne, a little bit of plexiglass is not going to save you.”

The customer said that while no rules appear to have been broken, he fears that other businesses might exploit these “loopholes” in a way that goes against the “spirit” of the mandatory order.",[]

In a statement issued Friday, the organization said Toronto Animal Services is currently in the process of removing the cats from the home and caring for the animals, which have a number of health issues, including upper respiratory infection and ear mites.

""Only a day after rescuing cats from a hoarding situation in North Bay, Toronto Cat Rescue has been called upon to help with a desperate situation here in the city,"" the news release read.

Toronto Cat Rescue said it is working to bring between 50 and 70 cats into its program.

""The cats have already been assessed and are known to be suffering from upper respiratory disease, ear mites, thin body condition and dermatitis,"" the news release read.

""These are health issues that can be resolved with proper medical care, and the special loving care that only our foster homes can give. We expect that because of the condition that these sweet cats are in, it will take months of care and attention to get them into good shape.""

The group noted that foster homes in Kitchener-Waterloo have already taken in some of the cats and Toronto rescues are also working to take in some of the animals as well.

""Hoarding is a serious and complex problem,"" the rescue group's statement continued, noting that only six cats are allowed in a single household under City of Toronto bylaws.

""It is impossible to responsibly care for many more, and 150 cats cannot endure living together in one house.""",[]

While many other facilities, including splash pads and outdoor pools, have been permitted to reopen as part of Stage 2, playgrounds are still off limits in Ontario.

Speaking to CP24 on Saturday morning, Tory said he believes playground equipment will be on the list of things that can reopen when regions move to Stage 3.

""We will be making sure those playgrounds are safe. We wouldn't open them if they weren't safe. But they will be part of (Stage) 3 and I think that is coming soon if all stays the way it is,"" he said.

While restaurant patios, hair salons, and shopping malls have reopened as part of Stage 2, a large swath of businesses and facilities remain closed around the province, including indoor swimming pools, fitness studios, movie theatres, and amusement parks.

The provincial government has not said when regions can advance to Stage 3 but has indicated that health officials will need to see a consistent decline in new cases and hospitalizations before moving forward.

The number of new and active cases of the virus has continued to trend downward in the province over the past month.

The rolling five-day average of new cases on Friday dropped to 134, down from 176 one week prior.

Hospitalizations also continue to remain at record-low levels, with 117 patients receiving treatment in Ontario hospitals, including 34 people in intensive care units.

At the height of the pandemic, more than 1,000 people were hospitalized with COVID-19.

Tory said playgrounds will be regularly disinfected when children are given the go ahead to use the equipment again.

During a special meeting Thursday evening, trustees voted to ask TDSB Chair Robin Pilkey to write to Education Minister Stephen Lecce to express their concern about the current plan.

The provincial government announced in June that school boards would be expected to prepare plans for three scenarios -- full resumption of regular in-class instruction with strict public health measures, an online-only learning, and a hybrid model blending in-class and remote learning.

In a report, the board stated that the hybrid model “places a tremendous burden on parents and caregivers --and, in particular, women, families with young children and low-income families, and, stands to further jeopardize the economic recovery.”

“We want to ensure that all students can return in September in the safest way possible, but we must also recognize that if the Ministry of Education does not permit them to return every day, it will put many of the families of 247,000 TDSB students in a very difficult position — not to mention the families of thousands of TDSB staff,” Pilkey said in a statement.

In addition, trustees are asking the province to provide emergency funding for all extra costs brought on by COVID-19. These include additional staffing, additional transportation, IT devices, mental health and well-being supports, cleaning supplies and repair/maintenance.

Board trustees are also requesting the province to delay the implementation of its new math curriculum until schools are no longer impacted by COVID-19.

In June, Ontario announced that coding, computer storage measurements and personal finance terms will be introduced starting in Grade 1, as part of a bid to improve sliding EQAO math scores.

Following the announcement, the unions representing public English and French teachers in elementary and high school said in a statement that implementing the curriculum this fall is unrealistic and counterproductive.

“The changes to the math curriculum are substantial and will require significant time, collaboration and new resources to be properly implemented,” the unions said in joint statement.

The board noted in a report that it supports the unions statement.

A delay will allow staff to focus on the health and safety of students and allow for additional professional learning, the board said.

“We recognize that the Ministry of Education has made a change to the math curriculum and expects it to be in place this September, but as students and staff — still dealing with pandemic-related issues — return to school, we want them to focus on this critical transition and not on learning a new way to do math,” Pilkey said.",[]

""At a time when there are no people coming, when there are no flights coming and when the hotels are basically empty, this is going to be a big deal,"" Tory told CP24 in an interview on Friday evening after the decision was announced.

""It's going to fill up at least two hotels and probably more for several weeks.”

In April, the city projected a $1.5 billion loss in revenue this year because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The mayor described that figure as a ""best-case scenario.""

The NHL and NHL Players' Association announced that they have ratified return-to-play protocols, which include Toronto and Edmonton as hub cities, and a four-year extension to the current collective bargaining agreement.

""While we have all worked very hard to try to address the risks of COVID-19, we know that health and safety are and will continue to be our priorities,"" NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said in a statement.

""We know that all of our fans are excited about our return to the ice.""

TSN hockey insider Bob McKenzie said the agreement gives players and team owners a six-year runway to repair the significant economic damage done by COVID-19 to the league.

""I'm sure there are players that don't love everything about this return to play or this CBA. And I'm sure there are some owners that don't love it either,"" McKenzie said.

""But when you weigh the decision that had to be made in terms of two years of economic Armageddon, and then an uncertain future after that versus six years of knowing how you're going to manage the economics of the game, well, obviously that was the choice that both the owners and the players made.""

The mayor credited the league and Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment for making this happen. He said both organizations went through a painstaking process to satisfy all medical officers of health in all levels of government.

""There were a lot of requirements. Nobody was going to let this happen without making sure that you can keep all the players and all the officials and everybody safe, but also all the people of those cities, Edmonton and Toronto,"" Tory said.

He believes the modified NHL season will be a good national unifier.

""It is going to put the spotlight on Toronto across North America in terms of the hockey world. When people do start visiting again, they'll once again see our city like they did when the Raptors were in the finals last year,"" he said.

613,ctvnews,https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/ontario-bar-owners-fight-to-keep-offering-takeout-wine-and-spirits-1.5015884,Ontario bar owners fight to keep offering takeout wine and spirits,['Salmaan Farooqui'],2020-07-08 13:35:00-04:00,"TORONTO -- Bar and restaurant owners who deal in specialty alcohol say they've carved out a new business model around Ontario's relaxed rules for takeout liquor, and they'll fight to make the system permanent.

In late March, the Ontario government allowed all restaurants to sell takeout alcohol alongside food to help them weather the COVID-19 lockdown. Some outlets that sell rare wines and spirits say customers are jumping at the chance to take home products that government-run liquor stores rarely carry.

Shamez Amlani, co-owner of La Palette, a French bistro in downtown Toronto, said his restaurant is selling more wine than it has in 20 years of business. Amlani said he sold 120 bottles in a single day near the start of the pandemic.

""Before, (my supplies) would have lasted me for months and months, but now I can go through them in a couple weeks,"" he said, adding his customers are drawn to the value of takeout wines versus the cost of dining in.

""If you were to spend $40 to $50 in a restaurant, you'd get the house wine or maybe the second-cheapest wine. But now, if you were to pull out $40 to $50, you're getting access to some pretty thrilling product that you might otherwise not know about.""

Glenn Wesley, the owner of Bathurst Local, a Toronto bar that specializes in imported sake, wine and craft beer, said his restaurant will rely on takeout sales even after the pandemic is over because the extra income will help it recover financially from the lockdown.

In fact, the bar has rebranded as an e-commerce platform where it offers provincewide shipping for its drinks.

""I'd expect it to be a vital point of anyone's business model for the foreseeable future,"" said Wesley.

He said he'd also expect the industry to push back against any moves to scale back takeout alcohol laws as lockdown measures are lifted.

""I would be really surprised if they took it away at any point,"" said Wesley. ""It's the new norm, and I don't think there's been a problem with it so far. Customers have really loved it, and so what would be the reason behind taking it away?""

A spokeswoman for the Ministry of the Attorney General reiterated that the takeout law is a temporary measure that ends on the last day of 2020, but did not say whether an extension is being considered.

""As Ontario carefully moves towards recovery, the government continues to work with licensed establishments to support a thriving hospitality industry in Ontario,"" Jenessa Crognali said in a statement.

""The health and well-being of Ontarians continues to be our top priority.""

But as more restaurants build a customer base around takeout alcohol, some owners said they won't let things go back to normal without a fuss.

Stuart Sakai, who runs Sakai Bar in Toronto, said his bar gives customers a personal experience when buying drinks.

He said customers pay a marked-up price to experience the environment when they dine in, and part of that can be carried over when taking drinks home from a small restaurant.

""The thing I've enjoyed doing very much is trying to continue that experience,"" said Sakai, who says 500 people subscribe to a newsletter that advertises his imported sake offerings.

""When they come and pick it up, maybe we chat about it for a while, they still get that experience part of it. I think people do very much enjoy that.""

Sakai said takeout sales might only be a supplemental form of income in the long term, but like other restaurant owners he said he'd like to see the new rules made permanent.

Amlani, who runs the French bistro, said he had spoken with his local member of provincial parliament about takeout laws even before they were implemented.

""I don't see why we should go back to what it was before,"" said Amlani.

""I will fight to keep this once Jan. 1 comes rolling around.""

Peter Yu and his wife are currently learning what it’s like to be buyers in the Yonge Street and Eglinton Avenue area.

“There’s a lot of competition still in the market. It’s not what we were anticipating, but it’s a process we’re working through,” Yu said.

The couple started looking into purchasing a home in the city in May. They missed out on one house already after they were out bid by five per cent.

As COVID-19 pandemic lockdown restrictions have lifted, findings from the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board show a fired up market.

Sales in the month of May compared to June spiked up to 89 per cent, and the average selling price for all homes in June was $930,869 — up 11.9 per cent compared to last year.

Bosley Real Estate Broker Davelle Morrison told CTV News Toronto Tuesday that there are many people who have decided they want to buy a home after being cooped up for months.

She said people living in condos are looking for homes, and people with homes are looking for cottages.

Morrison said she’s aware of several properties in the GTA which received multiple offers and is aware of one place in Toronto’s west end that received dozens of bids before it sold over the asking price.

“We got a bit of pent up demand and now the number of showings is basically back to pre-COVID levels. Everybody is ready to get out of their house and they want a new home,” Morrison said.

Morrison’s advice for buyers is to get a mortgage broker, have finances lockdown and do research.

Together for a decade, Grégory Thinet and husband Jason Chow would love to upgrade from their two bedroom condo and buy a house.

They want a backyard, and have more space for pets and family.

“It’s been very frustrating to find our little piece of heaven because of how crazy the situation is in Toronto,” Thinet said.

The couple both have steady employment, but said they have yet to put in an offer because many properties sell for two to three hundred dollars above the listed price and therefore are out of reach.

“We’re hopeful. We’re always hopeful,” said Chow.

“This is our next step in our life, and we’d like to take it, but we can’t right now.”",[]
615,ctvnews,https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/what-you-need-to-know-about-toronto-s-mandatory-mask-policy-1.5006032,What you need to know about Toronto's mandatory mask policy,['Katherine Declerq'],2020-06-30 14:35:00-04:00,"TORONTO -- Toronto will be making it mandatory to wear face masks while inside enclosed public spaces starting on Tuesday.

The motion was presented to city council last week—with the support of Toronto Mayor John Tory and Medical Officer of Health Dr. Eileen de Villa—in an effort to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 as more businesses start to reopen in the city.

Here's what you need to know:

When do you need to wear a mask?

According to the mayor, the masks will be mandatory in all public and enclosed indoor spaces. This means they will be required on public transportation such as the TTC and ferries to the Toronto Islands, as well as inside shops, grocery stores and malls.

Toronto residents will not need to wear masks while at home, eating on a restaurant patio and at most workplaces where physical distancing is possible. It would also not apply to child-care centres.

“It is about public spaces where the general public has free and ready access, to try and limit the risk,” de Villa said.

While not mentioned in the bylaw, health officials have previously said that residents should wear a mask anytime where it is challenging to social distance from others.

What happens if I can’t wear a mask for health reasons?

All health officials and politicians agree that if someone is suffering from a medical condition that makes it difficult to breathe or function while wearing a mask, they should not wear one. They ask that those people try their best to remain physically distanced from others while in public spaces.

Children under the age of two also do not have to wear a mask.

When will the bylaw take effect?

The bylaw will take effect on July 7 and last until the first city council meeting of the fall, which is scheduled for the end of September or early October. At that time, council will either extend the bylaw, amend it or discontinue it.

What does this mean for schools reopening in early September?

Local health officials say the decision about whether or not children or teachers wear masks while in school is up to the provincial government. The Ontario government, in response to the mandatory mask policy, has said that it is actually up to each individual school board to decide on classroom policies.

“Each board right across the province has the flexibility,” Ontario Premier Doug Ford said on Tuesday. “Everyone is going to have different guidelines.”

Will there be a fine for not wearing a mask?

The mayor admitted there would not be “aggressive enforcement” when it comes to the mask policy, but rather his government will focus on education.

“To be candid about it we don’t really have the resources to go around and look at every store and look at every person that is in one of those places,” he said. “We are going to rely on people by and large to get educated and to do the right thing.”

At the same time, Tory said that it is up to every business to have a policy in place to ensure compliance, suggesting a “no shirt, no shoes, no mask, no service” model.

Who else is doing this?

The mayors of Brampton, Mississauga and Caledon also announced on Tuesday they intend to pass similar bylaws requiring masks to be worn inside public spaces.

Brampton Mayor Patrick Brown said the bylaw in his city could be in effect by July 7.

No timeline has been provided for the bylaw in Mississauga or Caledon.

Why is it not mandated provincially?

The Ford government has said they will not be requiring the wearing of masks, but rather will encourage their use. Speaking on Tuesday, the premier said that the needs of regions like Peel and Toronto will be different from those in northern Ontario, which is why he can’t make masks mandatory.

“But each region has the authority to make their own rules,” he said. “I will support them on any decision that they make.”

Why is this policy necessary?

Experts have said that wearing a mask will prevent the wearer from spraying droplets on others, helping curb the transmission of the disease if they are asymptomatic.

De Villa said that requiring masks in indoor settings is essential to preventing the spread of COVID-19, but that compliance will need to be as high as 80 per cent in order to work.

“The reality is that the virus continues to circulate and that we still need to be careful,” she said.

616,ctvnews,https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/ontario-premier-fears-opening-border-will-spark-second-wave-of-covid-19-1.5019365,Ontario premier fears opening border will spark second wave of COVID-19,[],2020-07-10 14:34:00-04:00,"TORONTO -- Premier Doug Ford says that he is opposed to reopening the border with the United States any time soon, especially given the recent surge in COVID-19 cases in many southern states.

In March, Canada and the U.S. agreed to temporary close the border to non-essential travel while keeping it open for commercial traffic.

Since then the agreement has been extended on a number of occasions with the latest iteration lasting until at least July 21.

At this point it is unclear whether the border closure will be extended again, though Ford said at his daily briefing on Friday that he has already told Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland that he is not supportive of opening it up this month.

“I said very clearly I am not in favour of opening up the borders July 21. As long as the goods and products are flowing which they have been (we should keep it closed). I love our American neighbours but not right now,” he said. “Come and visit us when things cool down especially south of the border.”

The U.S. recorded nearly 60,000 new cases of COVID-19 on Friday, including a near-record 11,433 in Florida alone.

In Canada, meanwhile, transmission of the virus continues to wane and over the last week there have been about 380 new cases per day on average.

Ford said on Friday his hope is that government officials will continue to be “very cautious” when it comes to reopening borders, particularly the one to the south.

“I talked to a very smart doctor the other day and I said ‘Doc when do you think the second wave is coming?’ and he said ‘Doug, as soon as you open up the border to international travel that is when you are going to get hit.’ So that is concerning,” he said.

There have now been more than three million confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the United States, making it the hardest-hit country in the world.

There have also been more than 133,000 deaths.

Speaking with CP24 earlier on Friday, infectious disease specialist Dr. Issac Bogoch said that Canada is now at the point where it has the pandemic mostly under control and the United States is “the complete opposite.”

He said that so long as that is the case, the border should be closed.

“If we reopen our border we are going to import more cases to Canada and we could undo everything we have done here which would be really upsetting,” he said. “I think it should be closed for the foreseeable future.”",[]

Premier Doug Ford announced the ""Ontario Made"" program during a news conference on Friday saying the initiative would help residents better identify products made in the province.

“As we fight to get through the economic downturn, now more than ever, we need to support our own,” Ford said. “We can’t forget that as a province our collective buying power is massive. We generate 40 per cent of the Canadian economy. We are titans of industry – and I know that every Ontarian is proud of what we do.”

The $500,000 in funding for the campaign would come from the $50 million Ontario Together Fund, which was launched in April. The highlight of the program is the creation of a ‘Ontario Made’ logo that manufacturers can use to identify their made-in-Ontario products.

Developed by the Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters, the province says that the organization will meet with major Ontario retailers to promote the program in their stores as well as increasing visibility for customers.

Additionally, the launch of the program will include a new online portal which will connect consumers and supply chain partners to manufacturers of products made within the province.

“Ontario is Canada’s economic engine and workshop and our quality is second to none,” said Minister of Economic Development Vic Fedeli.

“This [program] will help in Ontario and beyond. We all have a role to play and we thank the CME for leading this important initiative,” Fideli added.

The announcement comes as Ontario works to restart the economy following months of closure as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Now more than ever we need to support our own.

Toronto's top doctor answers virus-related questions,[],2020-07-08 21:47:00-04:00,"TORONTO -- Toronto Public Health recorded 57 new COVID cases over the past two days, bringing the city's total to 14,735.

Of those cases, 12,935 have recovered, while 1,110 have died.

On Tuesday, the masks became mandatory in indoor settings. Peel Region is also set to make face coverings mandatory on Friday.

""I do think that using masks is a very simple and relatively inexpensive intervention and an action that we can all take in order to best protect our community and to find that way for us to co-exist safely with COVID-19 in our community,"" Dr. Eileen de Villa, the city's medical officer of health said.

De Villa stopped by CP24 on Wednesday to answer COVID-19 questions from viewers.

CP24: Do you sense the residents in the city understand how important masks are in fighting the spread of COVID-19?

De Villa: I think I've been so impressed with the residents of Toronto. We've all worked so hard together to get where we are. And it's clear that we all want our city back and we want to have some sense of normalcy. My sense is when I go outside, I do see more and more people wearing masks, and people are really trying to maintain that physical distancing, even as they are wearing masks, which is the right thing to do. I've been super impressed thus far, and I hope to continue to see more people and now hopefully joined by the people of the city of Mississauga.

CP24: Why are apartment condo elevators and public spaces exempt from mandatory masking bylaw? There are all kinds of people who use elevators and don't wear masks. There are bylaws on social distancing and elevators but nothing regarding masks.

De Villa: There are some exceptions to the mask bylaw, but that doesn't change the fact that masks are still officially the recommendation. And it is certainly the advice that's being put out there for landlords and property managers who are in charge of maintaining condos and apartment buildings.

This is the kind of thing that actually makes sense for our community, whether you're living in a multi-unit dwelling or whether you live in your own home. We're certainly putting out that information and making it available for landlords and property management types to be able to use and create that kind of environment. I hope that by having it in these other public spaces, it becomes part of our habit and part of how we just do and how we live in our city regardless. It becomes just how we do and how we co-exist with COVID-19 until we get treatments or a vaccine to protect us.

CP24: Speaking of exemptions, is there a concern that people who can't wear masks may take some heat from people for not wearing them?

De Villa: I understand that people will have questions. People will be concerned in certain settings, and that's understandable. But, I've seen a great deal of understanding amongst Torontonians. And the expectation isn't that you have to have some kind of sign or that you need to justify what the reason is. I think the issue is, how do we co-exist with COVID-19? How do we co-exist with each other?

And if we can offer those who cannot wear a mask some space, let them go and do whatever it is that they need to do in public space quickly, and then move on. I think that's really the best thing that we can all do. It's how we co-exist safely with each other and with the virus in our community.

CP24: With the emerging evidence from the World Health Organization that the virus could be airborne, how will this change safety measures moving forward? Why do you think this potential of an airborne virus wasn't caught sooner, and would it have made a difference?

De Villa: I think these are interesting debates that are ongoing, and it tells you that we're dealing with a new virus. There's still some uncertainty here because this is again a virus that was only discovered in January. There is still much understanding within the scientific community that has to be formed. We've learned a lot for sure, but there is still much more that we need to learn. What I think we're getting at is that it may linger in the air for a little bit longer or travel a little bit further, especially if it's aided by air conditioning flow that kind of thing.

But at the end of the day, physical distancing is still important. And it's still the mainstay of protecting oneself and each other from a spread of coronavirus. It just bolsters the argument for masks because if we can protect ourselves and protect each other by stopping the spread of our germs, then frankly, the airborne issue becomes a non-issue or less of a problem.

Wear those masks when we can't physically distance, wash our hands and do the best we can until we have treatments and a vaccine.

CP24: Do you have any concern about running people going outdoors exercising who are not wearing shirts or coverups from the waist up who are sweating profusely? Droplets are falling off bodies, whether walking, jogging, or cycling, passing others. Do droplets not travel? Is this airborne-related?

De Villa: When it comes to COVID-19 risk of transmission outdoors, it is definitely reduced. It's a question of just practicing good respect and courtesy. If you're going to do that and sweating profusely or spreading droplets in one form or another, try to pass people quickly give them their space. But by and large, the risk of coronavirus or COVID-19 transmission in the outdoors is significantly reduced, just because you've got big air and constant wind movement. So not a lot of what we would call dilution.

CP24: Where can we go to socialize safely?

De Villa: It is hard to stay isolated at home, and we are social creatures, and that counts a lot for health as well. Having the opportunity to interact with each other. With our social circles, we are allowed to have a social circle of up to 10 people. And with those in your social circle, you can get closer, and you don't need to maintain that physical distance. Hugs and physical contact are allowed within that social circle. If you have a bigger social circle, you need to continue maintaining that physical distance. Socializing outdoors, mainly if physical distance is maintained, creates a circumstance where you can still have fun connect with others, but do so in an environment that's definitely lower risk.

CP24: How concerned are you when you see the surge of COVID-19 cases in the United States in the past few weeks?

De Villa: It gives rise to concern. I worry about what has been happening in some of their hospital systems. We're seeing their healthcare system in Texas and other states getting overwhelmed, and that's always a concern. These are the kinds of lessons and experiences we should be heeding to continue to have our progress. We don't want to slide back into negative circumstances. I would encourage us to watch what's happening and to continue our progress by keeping up with those public health measures, keeping up with the physical distancing, the wearing of masks when that's not doable, hand-washing, avoiding touching your face and staying home when you're not feeling well.

CP24: When will serology testing be available to Toronto residents?

De Villa: What's being referred to is a blood test to determine whether you have been already exposed and might have some degree of immunity to COVID-19. These tests are in development. Some are technically available but not yet available to us here in Ontario. I understand that our provincial counterparts are working on this and working to make it available and determine the circumstances when the test can be used and, therefore, who gets access to it. Stay tuned. My understanding is that there's work happening on that right now. We'll look forward to telling people when we hear more about it.

CP24: How effective is the test in fighting the spread of COVID-19?

De Villa: You can think about whether that might create circumstances where people can understand, can they now go into an environment where they might not otherwise have been able to go because there's concern that they're infectious or that there's a risk. I think that there are a number of uses. The question is, how expensive is the test? How reliable is the test? And therefore, how best should it be used? I know that our provincial counterparts will be working on that and figuring those important questions out.

CP24: Actor Tom Hanks who recovered from the coronavirus, recently shared that a recent test showed his COVID-19 antibodies are fading. What does that say about being immune from the virus?

De Villa: What we're hearing about in respect of immunity after having had a COVID-19 infection is that we're still learning. We're still trying to understand this new virus. The interesting thing is, is that you would expect with as, with most viruses that after you have an infection, you'll have immunity for some degree of time. The real question is, how long? How long does this immunity last? And that's a question that we have yet to answer given that the virus has only been with us for a number of months. We don't really have all that much experience. It's one of those areas that we need to continue to watch and continue to monitor.

CP24: When will you allow tennis players, especially the seniors, to play doubles games, which is pretty safe because of at least two meters distancing? She says playing singles is for the young, and most seniors have no stamina to play it.

De Villa: I do believe that that comes in stage three as part of the province's reopening plan. And I appreciate and understand that people do want to get out there. As I understand it now, though, if somebody is in your social circle, that doubles game would be allowed for those within your social circles. If you're lucky enough to be in those circumstances, then you can go and do that.

CP24: A viewer says, I am a senior, and I have a hard time with a face mask, but can have, and have been wearing a face shield. Are face shields considered a face covering?

De Villa: I understand and appreciate that many people prefer having a face shield over a mask or a face covering because you're just able to breathe easier. You don't have that same coverage over your nose and mouth. But at the end of the day, a face shield is not a substitute for a mask or a face covering. You just don't get the same sort of protection for others. You don't get the same prevention of the spread of germs. While I appreciate that you get that coverage over your eyes with a face shield, it really isn't meant to be a substitute for a mask or a face covering.

According to a report by Canada’s national statistics agency issued on Wednesday, about eight in 10 Ontario respondents—or about 78 per cent—said they would wear a mask if physical distancing were not possible.

Fewer than 70 per cent of respondents from other regions reported that they would wear a mask in crowded places, with Quebec residents at the bottom of the list at about 52 per cent.

The majority of Ontario respondents also said they have been avoiding large gatherings (89.4 per cent) and remaining two metres away from others (87.3 per cent).

The data shows that only 65 per cent of respondents in Quebec, which borders Ontario, say they keep a two-metre distance from others.

Statistic Canada also found that Canadians living in rural areas were less likely to report that they would wear masks in public compared to those living in urban areas—a fact that may be governed by the sheer difference in the number of COVID-19 cases in Ontario and Quebec compared to the rest of the country.

As of Wednesday, more than 92,000 of Canada’s 106,166 lab-confirmed COVID-19 cases can be found in those two provinces.

While there are regional discrepancies for some health safety measures, the majority of Canadians appear to agree that hand washing is a priority.

More than 90 per cent of survey respondents across all regions said they wash their hands more frequently now in an effort to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus with Ontario leading at 95.4 per cent.

Statistics Canada said that this data suggests “this measure has been widely adopted by most Canadians.”

About four in 10 workers in Canada feel unsafe returning to work

The survey found that about 38 per cent of Canadian workers reported not feeling safe enough to return to work due to the pandemic.

“The most commonly-reported reasons for not feeling safe were fear of contracting the virus and fear of infecting family members,” the survey said.

In Quebec and Ontario, more than 40 per cent of workers reported feeling unsafe about returning to work compared with the approximately 25 per cent in other regions.

The online survey was conducted by Statistics Canada between June 15 and June 21 and is the third poll since the pandemic was declared in March. In the report, Statistics Canada noted that “not all Canadians were equally likely to report that they would follow precautions in the context of activities resuming.”

Men were generally less likely than women to report whether they would follow COVID-19 health precautions, the report found, and young Canadians between the ages of 15 and 24 were less likely to report whether they would wear a mask or remain physically distanced from others.",[]

Ford said he is involved in active talks with Ottawa to secure funding for municipalities strapped for cash due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Municipal leaders said earlier this week that an aid package from both upper levels of government is needed to prevent tax increases and service cuts.

The premier said he is not willing to settle for the current federal offer because it is more than a billion dollars short of what's needed to help shore up Ontario communities.

""If I walked away, the municipalities wouldn't be too happy with the amount that the federal government's offering right now,"" Ford said.

The premier said Ontario represents 38 per cent of Canada's population, and he believes it should receive the equivalent to that in the federal deal.

""I don't rush a bad deal,"" he said.

Some municipalities have expressed frustration in recent months that they are stuck in the middle of a lingering stand-off between the federal and Ontario governments over the aid package.

The municipal leaders have said $10 billion is needed for communities across the country, including Ontario, and federal and provincial governments must resolve their differences before cuts and fee hikes are needed.

A spokeswoman for Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said the federal government recognizes municipalities face serious financial pressures.

""We have offered $14 billion to support Canadians and we hope we can soon conclude an agreement with all the premiers that will ensure this funding is delivered to those who need it,"" Katherine Cuplinskas said in a statement.

Meanwhile, Ford's government introduced a sweeping new piece of legislation Wednesday it said will help the province's economy recover from the pandemic.

The omnibus bill -- dubbed the COVID-19 Recovery Act -- proposes to change 20 pieces of current legislation that govern the province's schools, municipalities, and justice system.

Municipal Affairs Minister Steve Clark said if passed, the bill would speed up environmental assessments, offer new consumer protections and help address unemployment.

Ford defended the bill and said it will help change an environmental assessment process that has been on the books for decades.

""We aren't going to dodge (environmental assessments) or anything,"" he said. ""We're going to make sure we strengthen them, but we're going to do them quicker, smarter.""

Clark said the bill would also create an economic agency -- Invest Ontario -- to help attract more international investment to the province.

The 188 page bill also includes measures announced by Education Minister Stephen Lecce this week to end school suspensions for students in junior kindergarten to Grade 3.

Clark said with limited days of sitting at the provincial legislature, it made sense to combined the different changes into one package.

NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said the bill isn't actually a pandemic recovery plan at all, and is short on rent relief, solutions for long-term care, and details on schools required to truly help Ontarians.

""I'm worried that Doug Ford is using the COVID-19 recovery as cover to plow ahead with changes that have nothing at all to do with recovering from this pandemic,"" she said.

Green party Leader Mike Schreiner said changing environmental regulations is not necessary to get the economy moving.

""Caring for nature, farmland and water is a vital part of the economic recovery, not something we sacrifice,"" he said in a statement.

The government also tabled a motion on Wednesday to extend the province's state of emergency until July 24.

The current state of emergency declared at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic is set to expire July 15.

Ford's office said the government wants to extend the measure to ensure there is no gap between that declaration ending and a new bill extending Ontario's emergency measures taking effect.

Solicitor General Sylvia Jones introduced that bill on Tuesday, saying the province will need to keep some emergency measures in place in the months ahead.

Ontario reported 118 new cases of COVID-19 on Wednesday, and nine new deaths due to the novel coronavirus.

The total number of cases now stands at 36,178, which includes 31,805 marked as resolved and 2,700 deaths.

The province also reported 202 newly resolved cases, and completed more than 22,832 tests for the novel coronavirus over the previous 24 hours.

The number of people in hospital because of the virus, in intensive care units and on ventilators all slightly decreased.

Health Minister Christine Elliott said 30 of the province's 34 public health units reported five or fewer new cases, with 18 reporting none.

“I nearly passed out. I thought where am I going to get the money to pay that bill,"" Kenny Wong said, speaking to CTV News Toronto.

Wong said he bought the property in February and he received the bill in June.

“It’s $38,000 and that's the outstanding water bill from the previous owner,"" Wong said.

Wong explained that on closing the deal for the property, his lawyer didn't check to see if the utility bills were paid in full. The home was vacant for a year and a half and he now believes a water pipe must have burst while the home sat empty.

“I called Alectra Utilities and they said due to privacy reasons I’m not entitled to know anything [about the previous owner] which is really frustrating, but they are demanding I pay the $38,000 outstanding.""

Wong feels the utility companyshould have known something was wrong and questioned why a bill would get that high.

“Why didn't they do anything about it? I mean that is really, really off the charts to add up to those kinds of dollars,"" Wong said.

When CTV News Toronto reached out to Alectra a spokesperson explained that they tried to collect the money from the the seller, but were unsuccessful.

“Mr. Wong was not informed about the water account arrears until the sale had closed,"" the spokesperson said. “It is the purchaser’s responsibility to ensure they understand any costs and arrears related to the property they are buying.”

Wong did purchase title insurance and has filed a claim hoping it will cover the cost of the bill. Alectra has now assigned an agent to Wong's s case and hopes the two sides can reach a reasonable resolution.

The most common reason for high water bills in the GTA is a running toilet. A single leaky toilet can waste more than 900 cubic metres of water in a month creating a water bill of more than $2,600.",[]

“One of the greatest things we have seen is the number of new families who are looking to get into boating to connect with their families,"" Rick Layzell, a member of the Boating Ontario Association, tells CTV News Toronto.

Layzell says families are looking for new ways to have fun while keeping physically distant from others and that boating is one of the best ways to do that.

Andre Ganton is with United City Yachts, a company that specializes in selling large pre-owned boats, and says that many people are trying out boating for the first time while others are selling their smaller boats to upgrade up to larger one.

“My feeling is we are going to have one of our best years in a decade,"" Ganton says. “Boating is just naturally a socially distant activity. You can get on the boat, you can head out on the water, you can drop anchor and go swimming.”

And RVs sales appear to be just as popular. At the Camping in Style RV Centre in Whitby, sales manager Erroll Knight says there is a huge interest in large RVs as well as tent trailers.

“We have a great country and this summer is a great opportunity to see it in an RV,” Knight says.

The RV boom is not limited to Ontario. Knight says many Canadians across the country eager to hit the road, while staying away from the crowds.

“The amount of people looking to get out of the city and go to a campground is everybody’s goal right now,"" Knight says.

The only issue for families looking to get into boating or RVing is supply. Many boats and RVs are produced in the United States where sales are also going up, so there is growing concern that suppliers may not be able to keep up with demand.",[]

However, there are a few things you should know before you decide to rent a cottage or a vacation home to keep you and your family safe.

“Right now people have been locked up in their homes so now they are looking for somewhere to go and it's often nearby,"" Airbnb Canada Spokesperson Nathan Rotman told CTV News Toronto.

In the wake of the novel coronavirus, Rotman says Airbnb has adopted strict measures to ensure that their listings are clean and safe for guests.

“There are protocols of how to clean your home to make sure it is completely sanitized as well as making sure there is a buffer for guests,” Rotman said.

Meanwhile, some owners of rental cottages in Port Stanley, Ont. say they are anxious to have visitors from the Greater Toronto Area and are asking renters to bring their own personal belongings and groceries as well as limiting the number of guests.

“We are going to have our renters sign a contract simply stating the cottage is sanitized from best of our ability and that they assume all responsibility while renting from us,” owner Kate Deshaw explains.

Ideally, the property should already be disinfected but to be safe, you can also do a thorough wipe-down yourself, making sure to clean high-touch surfaces like counters, faucets, doorknobs and refrigerator handles.

You will also want to check the cancellation policy carefully and expect additional cleaning fees. You should bring sanitizer, masks and practice social distancing.

Also, don't travel if you're already sick. If someone develops symptoms during your stay, take precautions.",[]

Family and friends, all together for the first time in months, gathered outside Erin Mills Lodge Nursing Home on Thursday to cheer and express their love to Jovita Lee, who smiled and waved at her physically distant visitors.

“It was bitter sweet because, of course, we couldn’t get too close, we couldn’t hug her or touch her but it was just a relief to be able to see her,” Lee’s granddaughter Sarah Barnett told CTV News Toronto on Thursday.

“To see all of us together at once and to see us singing happy birthday to her, I think that really lifted her spirts and for the first time she was able to lift her head up higher and just waive to everyone.”

Lee’s fight against COVID-19 was not easy. Her family says that she and her roommate were the first two people in their long-term care home to get the disease.

Lee, who had been moved into the home only two weeks before the pandemic hit, had trouble eating and was fighting a high fever.

Despite the outbreak at the facility being over, her family says it still took a significant toll on her. Her granddaughter said Lee now needs to use a wheelchair, has trouble lifting her head and is very low energy.

Barnett describes her grandmother, who came from the Philippines to Canada in the 80s, as a fun-loving person who loves the Toronto Blue Jays, parties, dancing and being in the spotlight, and so Thursday’s surprise was the perfect one.

“She loved to dance, loved having parties. Every year, she wants a party so she could invite everyone and feed everyone,” Barnett said.

Barnett said her grandmother, who loves to be around family, had a tough few months and lost some friends at the long-term care home due to COVID-19 after 17 people died at the home.

Now, Barnett said she’s glad things are starting to look better.

“She was already in an unfamiliar place and then shortly after to not see her family at all for three months [was hard],” she said. “[Thursday] was the first time she had seen us all together since moving to the home and overcoming the virus.”",[]

“I just decided to start this ‘Colours for COVID’ initiative because my husband’s a doctor working in a COVID-19 assessment centre at Mount Sinai,” Logan Lass told CTV News Toronto. “It was just a way for me to give back and really just help the community.”

Lass has been selling tie-dye clothing through her Instagram account, @ColoursForCOVID.

“I had a bunch of friends reach out and say, ‘I want a sweater! I want a hoodie!’” she explained. “I was like, why don’t I actually make these and raise money for a good cause. And so I’m donating 100 per cent of all net proceeds to Sinai.”

So far, Lass has sold more than 150 hoodies and has raised more than $4,000. Each hoodie costs $55.

“From us, just as customers, I think one, it’s great to support a friend who’s doing this,” Allison George, a coworker of Lass who purchased a hoodie, said. “I think it actually is a literal way to give comfort to people during a pandemic.”

“The response to Colours for COVID has been amazing,” Dr. Elliot Lass, Logan’s husband, said. “So many of my coworkers have supported it and I’m so proud of Logan.”

The funds raised are going to the Mount Sinai Health System, with donations helping with personal protective equipment.

Canadian volunteers with GlobalMedic are now working to assemble and send emergency food kits to those in need.

About 1,400 families in areas that were affected by Category 5 Hurricane Dorian will be receiving these kits.

The hurricane swept through the island, causing catastrophic damage, on Sept. 1, 2019.

In the months that followed, many people in the Bahamas were left strongly affected by not only the hurricane, but also the sharp decline in the tourism industry due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Some residents were just starting to get their lives back in order six months after the hurricane hit when all of a sudden no one was able to travel to the island anymore, leading to many people losing their jobs.

The global shutdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has slowed, and in some cases stopped, any progress made in rebuilding on the island, according to GlobalMedic.

Rahul Singh, the executive director of GlobalMedic, said these volunteers are now trying to help feed those in need, which he calls a step in the right direction.

The emergency food kits being assembled by the volunteers include grains, beans, rice, peas, and grits. The kits will be loaded onto a shipping container on Wednesday before being railed onto a boat in Halifax and then shipped out to the harbour in Freeport, Bahamas.",[]

Many parents, however, are getting creative, including Sepideh Coady, a mother of two young children.

“Right now we’re not going to the playground. We have to accept it,” Coady tells CTV News Toronto. “And we have to use whatever we have at home to keep them engaged and keep them moving.”

Coady is a yoga and pilates instructor, and has found a way to include her kids, ages two and four, in the physical activity.

“I’m telling you, it’s not easy. It’s challenging,” Coady said. “But I’m getting used to working out with them around me. And sometimes, engaging them. The more I engage them, the happier they are and they learn.”

One of the DIY (do-it-yourself) activities Coady came up with for her kids is an obstacle course in the living room, using items already in the house.

“I had these leftover cups from their birthday, and yesterday I thought, ‘let’s do some obstacle training!’” Coady said, laughing. “We’re connecting, we’re doing something together, and it’s a successful experience.”

Coady says that other activities she’s hoping to take on with her children in the coming weeks range from cooking to cleaning together.

“We have lots of time,” she says. “At the end, they’re happy, they’re entertained and they learn some life skills.”

Quieter DIY activities

When it’s time for some quieter activities, like arts and crafts, DIY expert Denise Wild says parents can make learning tools on their own.

“You can even have kids help you make these tools, and that way they’re crafting and creating and getting involved with their own education,” Wild said. “Use what you have at home, or search online. Pinterest is a great source for ideas and inspiration, and there are so many learning downloads right now that are available for free to use.”

Wild has the following DIY activity ideas for different age groups:

Pre-schooler: A mindfulness tub

“You create a little bin with lots of little goodies to help your child learn to regulate their emotions, whether you’ve got flash cards, maybe it’s Playdoh, some beads, puzzles and books. Anything that you can either do with your child, or your child can do on their own,” says Wild.

Kindergartener: A binder of printables

“If you just go online and even search ‘free learning printables’ or free learning downloads, you’ll find a lot of really great stuff,” says Wild. “If you put them into plastic sleeves, you can use a dry erase marker so that you can do the project over and over again.”

Elementary school student: Creative writing prompts

“So for older kids you can come up with questions and engage them in conversation. Encourage them to be thinking differently,” Wild explains. “I’ve got something that says ‘who do you admire?’, ‘if you could travel in time where would you go?’, and these are great for just discussing as a family or for having your child work on their creative writing.”",[]

Randy VanDerStarren was granted rare access to 60 locations in Toronto for the project, including attractions, sports fields, buildings and places of worship, to name a few.

Dubbed “TOgether,” the photos will be compiled into a book which will compare pictures of empty places in the city normally teaming with people and images of the same spaces as they reopen and see people return.

“You could get depressed, if you actually looked at all these empty buildings,” VanDerStarren told CTV News Toronto Monday. “I have a very rare lens that I get to look through to see that vitality come to life again.”

The ‘TO’ in ""TOgether"" is for Toronto and the project wouldn’t have been possible without VanDerStarren’s partner, Deputy Mayor Michael Thompson, who helped get permission to enter some the most tightly controlled places.

“While it was difficult with respect to the process, the fact of the matter is that we knew that the darkness that existed in the city as a result of COVID and everything being shutdown wasn’t permanent, but we really needed to capture that,” Thompson told CTV News Toronto.

“And at the same time, we needed to be aware as to what happens when we’re back again. We’re alive, we’re energized.”

Money raised throught the project is being directed to DonateTO –which is helping community organizations through the recovery.

VanDerStarren is volunteering his time for ""TOgether,"" and said being granted the access has been an honour and privilege.

”I hope the work we do not only captures these locations, but does it in a way that you, as a viewer, as readers will look at the book and will look at the gallery that will come out of this and say ‘that’s my city, and I’m part of its recovery, I’m part of overcoming this virus’, he said.

VanDerStarren said he hopes to finish taking the pictures of Toronto’s reopening by the fall and show off all the comparisons by the end of the year.",[]

“We were sitting in my backyard, and we were just talking about the amount of stuff we’re seeing on the news at the moment, and trying to find a way for us to make a change, or at least try to,” Leszek told CTV News Toronto.

“Just seeing everything you kind of feel the need to do something about it a bit,” adds Ishikura. “And like, do your part.”

The Grade 9 students from Humberside Collegiate came up with an idea for a fundraiser – they would sell posters supporting the Black Lives Matter movement to their family, friends and neighbours.

“We reached out on Facebook asking if there were any designers who were able to volunteer to help us out to create a fundraiser, and we had an amazing designer reach out to us and say she was more than happy to,” says Leszek.

“We gave her some ideas, and she was able to recreate them in her own way, and it was really helpful,” adds Ishikura.

In the end, the girls had three posters. They shared the posters with CTV News Toronto over a ZOOM call.

“The first one, which is the rainbow fist, that’s kind of the Pride one with the Black Lives Matter movement,” Leszek explains. “And then we have ‘This Home Believes Black Lives Matter’ and the BLM one that shows that we’re all together and we’re going to fight for change together.”

The fundraiser took off. Ishikura and Leszek began selling the posters for $15 each, and quickly raised nearly $3,000.

“We decided to donate it to Black Lives Matter Toronto because we thought it was important to do something local,” explains Ishikua.

The teens have been hand-delivering the posters to those who purchase them, often making the deliveries by bicycle. They say it has been exciting to see their posters in the windows of people’s homes.

“When people walk down the street and they see these posters everywhere, they know they have allies,” says Leszek. “We’re supporting them, there for them, and that we’re all working together to try to create change.”

Eleonor Lentini purchased one of the posters, saying she wanted to support the students’ initiative and efforts.

“I have two sons. I want them to hear the message,” Lentini says. “A lot of racism comes from the home. It starts from the home and it branches out, and we’re proud to place [the poster] on our window.”

Lentini also tells CTV News that she’s impressed by what Ishikura and Leszek are doing at a young age.

“These ladies are our future,” she says. “I just loved the fact that Callie and Sofi are in Grade 9 and took this on. There’s so much that the youth can do.”

Ishikura and Leszek have been friends since long before high school, having met in daycare at age two.

“We’ve been best friends ever since,” says Leszek, smiling.

“I think [the fundraiser] has brought us closer together!” adds Ishikura.

The teens hope that using their voices to support the Black Lives Matter movement will inspire other young people to use theirs, too.

“I know we’re fortunate. We’re lucky, and so we felt we needed to do something to help others,” Leszek says. “So much of the population is under 18 and they sort of feel powerless throughout this. We can show them that there’s things you can do to make a difference.”

“Right now, with everything happening, the only way to make change is if everybody makes change.”

The posters can be purchased at Cookery on Roncesvalles Avenue in Toronto for anyone who would like one of their own.",[]

“Prom would have been tomorrow and commencement the day after, so there is really no sense of closure in a way,” said Nelson Lee, who is graduating from Marc Garneau Collegiate .

Nelson is the student council president at his Toronto high school and had been planning the end-of-year celebrations long before the pandemic.

“It doesn’t feel as fulfilling,” he said about missing out on so many school events, graduation and other extracurricular opportunities.

He has been accepted to the University of Toronto’s Engineering program. He’s excited about the next chapter, but acknowledges it won’t be normal.

“The university has sent out a lot of information about they will proceed in September, for the larger classes they will be online and smaller seminars will be in person,” he said. “I think it’s a great combination for the best of both worlds at this time.”

In the meantime, with limited options due to the pandemic, he’s taking courses offered by UofT to prepare him for his first semester.

“Just to keep myself engage and push myself to learn new things during this time.”

Students organize virtual prom

Zaiboon Azhar wanted to make sure her classmates had the opportunity to celebrate their achievement. The Woburn Collegiate graduate was part of a national committee that organized a virtual prom with an open invitation to every high school student across Canada.

“The idea was to give the class of 2020 some sort of prom, graduation experience because it is difficult being all alone at home for months without access to your friends - we wanted to make these seniors feel special,” Azhar said.

The online event called ‘Prom is On’ was held in May and raised more than $150,000 for Kids Help Phone.

Azhar will attend the University of Toronto in the fall to study international relations.

Schools honour students with virtual graduation

Some schools are hosting virtual graduation ceremonies to celebrate their students achievements.

Bayview Middle School is hoisting a virtual graduation Tuesday evening, giving staff and students one last opportunity to connect.

“It means a lot to me because I will see my teachers talk one last time, just knowing I’m going to be present there with all my classmates and peers,” Grade 8 student Nadine Al-Junaidi said.

Nadine’s classmate Pradyumn Jha is equally excited about the opportunity to see friends one last time before going their separate ways to different high schools.

“For the past three years I’ve been thinking about this moment and having it virtual is showing how in these unprecedented times we’re being innovative and its better than no graduation,” Pradyumn said. “I’m looking forward to the new experiences and meeting new people, the new environment.”

Transitioning to high school can be anxious and exciting for students under normal circumstance. However, with the province recently announcing measures for the school year that include smaller class sizes and remote learning at home, these students don’t know what to expect.

“I’m a little bit nervous about what grade nine will hold and we still might be doing online learning, so I will have to see how it will go,” Nadine said. “It’s not how I hope to start high school career.”

If anything, these graduates say the pandemic has taught them to persevere.

Currently, high school students in Ontario are asked to choose between more practical, hands-on applied courses and more theoretical academic courses in core subjects like math, science and English.

The practice has been a subject of much debate, with critics arguing that the streaming process has disproportionately impacted racialized and low-income students, resulting in lower graduation rates and test scores.

Speaking at Queen’s Park on Thursday afternoon, Ford said academic streaming “can exclude a student form a world of opportunities later in life.”

He went on to state that the phasing out of streaming will begin in September 2021, starting with Grade 9 math courses. A new math curriculum for the de-streamed class will be unveiled at a later date, the government said.

“Our Black, Indigenous and racialized students face more social and economic barriers to success than their fellow students and that’s just not right,” Ford said. “They deserve the same shot at their dreams as any other young person.”

Ford also said that it was “unfair” and “not right” to ask students to make a decision at the age of 14 that could determine the course of their high school and post-secondary careers.

No further details have been provided regarding a timeline for the de-streaming of other core subjects or what the new curriculum will look like.

Ontario’s Advocate for Community Opportunities Jamil Jivani praised the policy, saying that he was streamed as a teenager and knows first-hand the impact the process can have on students.

“I was put into applied courses. And I know that very few people who experience streaming in our schools ever make it to a place like this, standing before you at an official podium alongside the premier of Ontario,” Jivani said. “By the grace of God I am here.”

Every student – irrespective of the colour of their skin, socio-economic status, heritage, or orientation – deserves to achieve their full potential.



We are breaking down barriers that have held students back for too long.

Teachers’ unions and advocates of the change have said that while they approve of ending streaming, they want to know more about what kind of supports will be available for both students and teachers.

Advocacy group People for Education, who has been lobbying for an end to streaming for years, said earlier this week that further details are needed about how students with different learning styles will be supported during the transition.

“You can’t just flip a switch,” spokesperson Annie Kidder said.

The change also comes as teachers are struggling to learn a new math curriculum for students in Grade 1 to Grade 8 in September 2020 while also adjusting to a new yet-to-be-decided educational format that would deal with the risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Ford government is also proposing additional and mandatory anti-racism and anti-discrimination training before the end of the calendar year.

A day earlier, the government has also introduced a bill that would ban the suspension of students in junior kindergarten up until Grade 3 for “non-serious offences.” The motion is part of a larger omnibus bill that is meant to help the province deal with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic once the state of emergency has been lifted.

If passed, the suspension ban would go into effect this September.",[]

Ford, who made the comments as parts of Ontario experience a prolonged heat wave, said he would like to amend the Long-Term Care Home Act to make it mandatory for homes to have air conditioning installed.

He said he will personally call the owners of homes in Ontario without air conditioning and plead with them to have it installed.

""Put yourself in that position, these poor vulnerable people, the elderly people are sitting there and what can they do?"" Ford told reporters on Tuesday. ""I want to track these guys down.""

""This is all about the dollars. It's unacceptable.""

Health Minister Christine Elliott said she agrees with the premier and that Ontario needs to take ""whatever steps"" necessary to make the province’s vulnerable citizens comfortable.

CTV News Toronto has reached out to the Minster of Long-Term Care for comment and has also requested detail on how many facilities do not have air conditioning.

On Monday, the Ministry of Long-Term Care confirmed that fans were allowed at facilities across the province, despite fears that they could disperse COVID-19 droplets.

But, according to experts, the costliest tax mistakes made by Canadians are usually related to missed deductions and a lack of understanding about whether they need to file.

Here are five costly mistakes to avoid when putting together your return this year:

NOT FILING AT ALL

If you didn’t make a single dime during the tax year, failing to file a tax return will only leadto more money being left on the table.

“One of the most common mistakes is not filing because you don’t think you have enough income, or you didn’t have an income at all,” Lisa Gittens, senior tax professional at H&R Block, told CTVNews.ca by phone earlier this month.

“As long as you are living in Canada you should be filing.”

According to Gittens, students, young adults, stay-at-home parents and the unemployed are the most prone to this mistake, which prevents them from claiming certain tax credits and benefits that all Canadians are entitled to, regardless of their income bracket.

This includes the Canada child benefit, the universal child care benefit, and the GST/HST credit, and provincial credits like the Climate Action Incentive. Keep in mind that both parents must file a tax return in order to receive the Canada child benefit.

You can also claim things like medical expenses, educational expenses, and child care expenses if you didn’t make any income. And, as Gittens notes, the more expenses you can write off, the greater chance you'll get a refund.

Gittens notes that it’s especially important for students to file their returns in order to build credit with the CRA.

“Many students don’t file because they have no income, but once they graduate and start earning income, they have no credit with the CRA,” she explained.

NOT CLAIMING MEDICAL EXPENSES

Medical expenses not covered by provincial health services or benefits plans are another commonly neglected area, especially for low- and middle-income Canadians.

“When your medical expenses are high in comparison to your income you get a medical expense supplement that refunds a portion of the medical expenses you claimed,” said Gittens.

This type of expense can include eye exams, dental expenses not covered by insurance, medical supplies and travel expenses. This year, certain cannabis products are now considered eligible for the medical expense tax credit, if you have a prescription.

You can claim your total eligible medical expenses, minus three per cent of your income or the set maximum for the tax year ($2,352), whichever is less.

For future tax years, Gittens recommends completing all of your miscellaneous medical exams and yearly check-ups towards the end of the year to capitalize on the return and make it easier to organize your receipts.

“When you get all of those eye exams and dental exams taken care of at the end of the year the receipts are all there for you to claim on your taxes,” she said.

MISREPORTING INCOME FROM YOUR SIDE JOB

Whether you are making extra money by driving an Uber, hosting people at your Airbnb, or earning a little side cash online, you want to make sure you are recording those earnings as self-employed income.

“You’ll want to be sure that you’re also contributing to the Canada Pension Plan based on those earnings,” notes Gittens.

If you plan on claiming any expenses related to that income (i.e. expenses related to your vehicle, house, or travel expenses), make sure that you have the receipts to back it up.

MISSING INVESTMENT INCOME

Before filing, make note of your investment streams and make sure you have received a statement for each of them. These annual statements should show the total income you earned during the tax year and the total expenses incurred, such as investment adviser fees (which are deductible).

“Income sometimes gets missed because people don’t understand how much they’ve earned on their investments each year,” Armando Minicucci, tax specialist at Grant Thornton, told CTVNews.ca by phone.

“This is generally the most common area where individual tax payers are reassessed.”

FILING TOO EARLY

The early bird doesn’t always get the worm, especially when it comes to taxes.

“Those early filers who are hoping to get their refunds right away tend to miss certain documents, whether it be T4’s from their employers or investment slips from the bank,” Michael Davis, senior tax specialist at H&R Block, told CTVNews.ca by phone.

Not only could this cause you to make an amendment to your return, it could put you at risk of incurring penalties for misreporting your income if you make a habit of it.

“If you fail to report the same kind of income in back-to-back years it could result in penalties,” said Davis.

April 30 is the last day to file your 2019 income tax return. If you owe the CRA money, it must be paid by this date. Otherwise, you’ll face a late-filing penalty and daily interest chargeson your balance.

If you are self-employed, you have until June 15 to file your return. But keep in mind that if you owe taxes, you’ll still be required to pay your balance by the April 30 deadline.",[]
640,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/the-cra-has-completely-redesigned-the-t1-personal-income-tax-return-form-1.4821920,The CRA has completely redesigned the T1 Personal Income Tax return form,['Nicole Bogart'],2020-03-02 06:00:00-05:00,"TORONTO -- Your income tax package has an entirely new look this year thanks to the Canada Revenue Agency’s decision to revamp the T1 Personal Income Tax return form.

The T1 General Form, also known as the Income Tax and Benefit Return, is the main document used to file your personal income taxes and acts as a summary of all the other forms you complete for your income taxes.

Depending on how you’ve filed your tax return in years past, you might be familiar with the general layout of the form.

But during the 2020 tax season the form will look quite different – most notably, doubling in size.

WHAT IS A T1 GENERAL FORM?

The T1 is used to summarize all of the other forms you complete for your income taxes.

It shows your provincial tax (except in Quebec), total income, net income, tax payable, deductions, and non-refundable credits.

When you file your taxes, this form is used to apply for things such as the Canada Child Benefit, or the GST/HST credit.

If you file your taxes online using tax software, you may not recognize the name of the T1 form because it’s often filled out automatically.

“If you use tax software or go to your tax professional all of the calculations are done in the background,” Lisa Gittens, senior tax professional at H&R Block, told CTVNews.ca by phone.

“The purpose [of the redesign] was to simplify the preparation and that process has already been simplified if you’re using online software.”

In other words, unless you are dedicated to filing your taxes by pen and paper, you won’t even notice the change.

WHAT’S DIFFERENT?

As the CRA puts it, “Your income tax package has a new look.”

The first thing you will likely notice is that the form has doubled in size from four pages to eight. Additionally, some of the line numbers that were previously three or four digits long are now five digits long.

The CRA notes that the form has been updated to include the use of plain language “where possible,” reduce the number of forms, update worksheets to simplify certain calculations, and increase font size and white space.

The form now also includes the calculation of federal tax.

“Most Canadians aren’t going to notice much of a difference, other than the extra pages and new line numbers,” Armando Minicucci, tax specialist at Grant Thornton, told CTVNews.ca.

“Two of the new pages are from adding the non-refundable tax schedule to the form.”

Page one of the form still asks for your basic personal information, such as your name, address, e-mail address, province of residency, marital status and information about your spouse or partner.

The second page now asks whether you have any income that is exempt under the Indian Act. If you do, you will not be required to complete the T90 form, “Income Exempt under the Indian Act.”

The rest of the T1 form requires the same information as previous years, including various deductions such as RRSP contributions and child-care expenses, the calculation of your net income and your taxable income.

Gittens notes that the calculation of these reductions is the most important part of the T1 form and remains completely unchanged from previous years.

The remainder of the form is dedicated to calculating your federal tax.

April 30 is the last day to file your 2019 income tax return. If you owe the Canada Revenue Agency money, it must be paid by this date. Otherwise, you’ll face a late-filing penalty and daily interest charges on your balance.

Other changes to CRA services this tax year include a new online tool that allows you to check the estimated processing time for your tax return and other tax-related requests, and the ability to pay your balance via PayPal.

CTVNews.ca will have stories on tax season every Money Monday. Look for it in our 5 Things to Know.

Whether you are working with a tax specialist or using software to file your taxes, it’s important to be aware of any changes that could affect your refund.

But first, let’s start with the basics.

IMPORTANT DATES AND DEADLINES

As usual, April 30 is the last day to file your 2019 income tax return. If you owe the Canada Revenue Agency money, it must be paid by this date. Otherwise, you’ll face a late-filing penalty and daily interest charges on your balance.

The CRA notes that even if you can’t pay your full balance owing on or before April 30, you can avoid the late-filing penalty by filing your return on time.

If you are self-employed, you have until June 15 to file your return. But keep in mind that if you owe taxes, you’ll still be required to pay your balance by the April 30 deadline.

The deadline to contribute to your registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) is March 2.

CHANGES TO CRA SERVICES

Right off the bat, you might notice a few changes to the T1 Personal Income Tax return form. Most notably, it’s doubled in size from four pages to eight.

But this doesn’t mean you’ll be required to put in extra work. The length accounts for increased font size and new formatting, as well as the CRA’s decision to include the calculation of federal tax. There is also a new numbering system.

“Most Canadians aren’t going to notice much of a difference, other than the extra pages and new line numbers” Armando Minicucci, tax specialist at Grant Thornton, told CTVNews.ca.

The CRA has also released a new online tool that allows you to check the estimated processing time for your tax return and other tax-related requests.

You now also have the option of setting a personal identification number through the My Account portal to quickly identify yourself when calling the CRA.

GETTING ORGANIZED

If you haven’t done so already, experts suggest signing up for the CRA’s My Account portal to ensure that all of your personal information is up to date and accurate. This portal not only stores important tax income documents, it allows you to check the status of your refunds, outstanding balances, and RRSP or TFSA contribution limits.

More importantly, if you have misplaced any of your documents or T-slips, you should be able to access them in My Account.

Next, organize your paperwork.

· Employment and income slips (T4s, T4As, T5s, T3s, etc.)

· Receipts to back up claims for things like medical or childcare costs, charitable donations, or moving expenses

· Disability certificates, mortgage and property tax statements

· Self-employed or rental income and expense information

· Student tuition and interest documents

Reporting investment income tends to be the trickiest area for taxpayers, according to Minicucci.

“Income sometimes gets missed because people don’t understand how much they’ve earned on their investments each year,” he said. “This is generally the most common area where individual taxpayers are reassessed.”

You should have received an annual statement from any investments you held in 2019 showing the total income you earned during the year and the total expenses incurred, such as investment adviser fees (which are deductible).

NEW AND IMPROVED TAX BREAKS

Enhanced CPP Contributions: You can now claim a deduction for any enhanced contributions to the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) or the Quebec Pension Plan (QPP).

“Employees were required to contribute 0.15 per cent of pensionable earnings commencing last January to a maximum annual contribution of $80.85,” explained Minicucci.

“Regular contributions to CPP result in a non-refundable tax credit. The deduction for enhanced contributions is a tax deduction, not a tax credit.”

Canada Workers Benefit: Formerly known as the Working Income Tax Benefit, this benefit provides a refundable tax credit for individuals and families that are in the workforce but have income below certain thresholds.

The maximum benefit is $1,335 for individuals with earned income of $12,820 or less. For families, the maximum refund is $2,335 with an income threshold of no more than $17,025. However, if you are enrolled in a full-time education program, you’re not eligible.

Home Buyers’ Plan: In 2019 the Home Buyers’ Plan RRSP withdrawal limit increased from $25,000 to $35,000 for withdrawals made after March 19.

New homeowners also qualify for the $5,000 first-time Home Buyers’ Tax Credit if they have purchased a home in the tax year—a tax credit Minicucci warns could be overlooked by many first-time buyers.

Cannabis as a Medical Expense: Certain cannabis products are now considered eligible for the medical expense tax credit, providing you have an authorization.

Climate Action Incentive: The perks of this incentive program range depending on which province you live in. Albertans are now eligible to claim this incentive, whereas residents in New Brunswick will not. Residents in Ontario, Saskatchewan and Manitoba will receive a large amount this year compared to the previous tax season.",[]
642,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/how-to-protect-your-personal-information-online-during-tax-season-1.4804898,How to protect your personal information online during tax season,['Nicole Bogart'],2020-02-17 06:00:00-05:00,"TORONTO -- Tax season can be a particularly precarious time for Canadians.

Not only is there pressure to file your tax return accurately and on-time, you’re doling out vast amounts of sensitive personal information online while doing so.

Practising good personal data protection etiquette online should be top of mind for consumers year-round. But it becomes increasingly important during tax season, when cybercriminals tend to prey on consumers who are more likely to fall for scams that ask for their personal information.

Here are some important security measures to keep in mind while handling your personal information online this tax season:

BE WARY OF SCAMS

Canadians have faced an influx of online scams and robocalls purporting to be from federal organizations including the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) over the last few years.

These scams often threaten consumers with the imminent threat of arrest or lawsuit before asking for a litany of personal information, such as social insurance numbers.

In 2019, Canadians lost more than $1.4 million to CRA scams, according to numbers provided to CTVNews.ca by the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre (CAFC). In fact, as of Feb. 2, the CAFC had confirmed 34 successful instances of CRA fraud in 2020, costing consumers over $10,000 total.

“A lot of the scams take place over email and SMS,” Christine Beauchamp, director of the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security, told CTVNews.ca in a telephone interview.

“They have a variety of messages that make them seem very legitimate and professional. You might not be able to tell right away whether or not they’re legitimate.”

When it comes to online scams in particular, the CRA says it will never:

Ask for prepaid credit cards or gift cards.

Collect or distribute payment via e-transfer or bitcoin.

Send an email with a link that asks you to divulge personal or financial information, unless you have called the CRA to ask for a form or a link for information. In this case, a CRA agent would send you an email during the call with that information.

Beauchamp adds that users should never click on links included in suspicious emails, especially if it’s not a secure link.

Sites with a secure connection will display a lock symbol in the left hand side of the URL bar in your web browser. Secure sites will also start with “https” (the “s” stands for secure).

USE SECURE PASSWORDS

Your income tax return contains a wealth of incredibly sensitive personal information -- perfect for anyone who wants to steal your identity.

“If there is one password you want to keep incredibly strong and unique, I would say it’s definitely the one that’s associated with your tax return file,” Beauchamp said.

Whether you are filing online through the CRA’s website, or using a third-party program to help you with your return, make sure that you use a password that is eight to 10 upper- and lower-case letters mixed with numbers. That’s the formula experts say is most secure.

When choosing numbers to add to your password, be sure not to use anything that is easily identifiable, such as your address or date of birth.

If you have a hard time remembering your passwords, Beauchamp suggests stringing together three or four random words you’ll remember, which is often as strong as an alphanumerical password.

SAVE YOUR FILES SECURELY

When filing your taxes online, be mindful of where you save the PDF copy of your return and any supporting documents.

If possible, Beauchamp recommends storing these files on an encrypted external hard drive or a secure drive in the documents section of your computer. Files that are saved on your computer’s desktop are not as protected as those stored in the documents folders.

Experts don’t recommend storing these kinds of personal documents in the cloud.

Keep in mind that you should be filing your return from a secure internet connection and not from a public Wi-Fi connection.

Public Wi-Fi networks are highly susceptible to Man-in-the-Middle-style attacks, which allow eavesdroppers to intercept data transmissions and read them.

EDUCATE YOURSELF

The CRA has an entire website dedicated to helping Canadians protect themselves against fraud, including information about the most common scams.

The government’s Get Cyber Safe websitehas additional information about filing your taxes online safely.

Tax season is prime time for scammers,['Nicole Bogart'],2020-02-10 06:00:00-05:00,"TORONTO -- Canadians who have grown tired of unsolicited emails and phone calls from scammers claiming they owe money to federal agencies will have their patience tested this tax season.

The Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre (CAFC) is expecting to see a surge in these scams between March and April, when cybercriminals tend to prey on consumers who are more likely to fall for scams that ask for their personal informationduring tax season.

According to numbers provided to CTVNews.ca, 470 Canadians lost more than $1.4 million to these scams last year alone.

Another 3,210 complaints of scammers posing as the tax agency were reported to the CAFC in 2019, but the CAFC notes that thousands more go unreported.

Jeff Thompson, a senior RCMP intelligence agent working for the CAFC, says that scams that mention the CRA are just the tip of the iceberg.

“There’s the telephone CRA scam that we continue to get reports about, but we’ve seen a huge shift with [scammers] claiming to be Service Canada reporting fraud on your SIN number,” Thompson told CTVNews.ca in a telephone interview.

Thompson said CRA-related scams often involve phishing campaigns sent by email or text message, many with the promise of a tax return in the form of an e-transfer -- something the CRA says it will never do.

But despite increased effort by Canadians authorities and government officials to crack down on these types of scams, including a large scale bust involving more than 40 illegal call centres in India last March, experts fear the market for fraud outpaces authoritative efforts.

“It is a little bit like a drop of a bucket -- a game of whack-a-mole. You take out one group and another pops up,” Avner Levin, director of Ryerson University’s Privacy and Cybercrime Institute, told CTVNews.ca in a telephone interview.

“All they need is a handful of successful scams to make money. And if you’re talking about sending out an email or a text message the costs are negligible.”

Avner says some relief may come from more stringent requirements placed on telecom providers by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), including call-blocking technology that prevents some “spoofed” numbers from reaching Canadians customers.

“This isn’t an issue you can solve on your own by blocking calls on your own device. You need the telecom companies to get involved and do their part,” Avner said.

Meanwhile, as scammers ramp up for busy season, Avner’s best piece of advice is simple: don’t answer your phoneif you don’t recognize the number.

“The scam is in the social context… the person gets on the phone and intimidates you, stresses you out, convinces you to do things you wouldn’t do,” he said.

“You’ve got to find ways to disengage and disconnect. The more you stay on the line and have a conversation with them, even if you think you’re impervious to this, they will chip away at it.”

In a statement to CTVNews.ca, a CRA spokesperson said education is key when it comes to protecting Canadians from these types of scams.

The CRA says it will never:

Use aggressive language or threaten to arrest or deport you .

Ask for prepaid credit cards or gift cards.

Collect or distribute payment through e-transfers or bitcoins.

Send an email with a link that asks you to divulge personal or financial information, unless you have called the CRA to ask for a form or a link for information. In this case, a CRA agent would send you an email during the call with that information.

The CAFC notes that users should never click on links included in suspicious emails, especially if it’s not a secure link.Sites with a secure connection will display a lock symbol in the left hand side of the URL bar in your web browser. Secure sites will also start with “https” (the “s” stands for secure).

But Levin notes that consumers should continue to be vigilant after filing their taxes, noting that cybercriminals are ready to strike at any time.

“There is some risk when you’re filing your taxes, but afterwards, when you’re awaiting a return, we also see a huge spike in these types of scams,” he said.

Here are some quick tips to charge your phone faster,"[""Cillian O'Brien""]",2018-10-09 06:10:00-04:00,"Smartphone batteries often seem to run low when we need them most – so we’ve gathered some tips on charging them up pronto.

If you need a fast charge there are ways to get that battery closer to 100 per cent.

For iPhone and Android users alike, the less your phone processor is doing, the faster it will charge. So putting it into airplane mode can help, but will mean no internet or cellular connectivity.

Aside from turning your phone into a virtual paper weight, there are more shortcuts to a faster charge.

The phone screen is the biggest battery drain, so resist the urge to keep looking at it, if you can.

But if the temptation is too much, and you can’t do without the web while it’s charging, just turn off the battery-draining Bluetooth, wifi, GPS and NFC features instead.

Older phones charge faster when they’re powered down completely, but this is no longer true on new phones.

Tech reporter Amber Mac told CTVNews.ca that phone manufacturers have made fast charging a priority in recent years.

“While many smartphone buyers look for the best camera or screen, I am always interested in the device with the best battery life,” Mac told CTVNews.ca, praising the all-day battery life of her own smartphone.

“If I do need a boost, it has fast charging so that in 30 minutes or so I can get up to 50 per cent of my battery life back again.”

While Apple’s smartphones don’t have a fast-charge feature built in, iPhone users can charge their devices quicker by using a different wall plug.

IPhones are sold with Apple’s small five-volt/one-amp power bricks, but iPads come with larger five-volt/2.4-amp bricks that actually charge the company’s phones faster.

Electricity is measured in watts, which is a product of voltage (in number of volts) and current (in number of amps).

Some chargers supply more voltage or amperage than others, meaning they will charge your phone faster.

That means, if you want to charge up your Apple device as fast as possible, you’ll need a Lightning-to-USB-C cable and a 12 watt USB-C power adapter.

Other phone brands offer special fast chargers, but they are typically incompatible between different manufacturers.

Newer Android devices also have a battery saving mode that users can activate to shut off background apps and conserve power while the phone recharges.

Anyone who’s tried to charge their phone in a hot car knows that the handsets run the risk of overheating and some models will stop charging. So keep it cool for a speedier charge.

Similarly, if your battery is in a cold environment, you may notice the charge start to decrease.

For a fast charge it’s best to plug into a wall socket, but if that’s not an option, an active laptop is the next best thing.

And if all else fails, leave the house with a portable charger. It won’t charge any faster, but it will charge your phone on the go.",[]
645,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/5-things/tech-tuesday-5-things-cybersecurity-experts-would-never-do-1.3126790,"5 things cybersecurity experts avoid doing on their smartphone, computer",['Nick Wells'],2016-10-25 06:43:00-04:00,"You already know you shouldn’t share your password with a stranger, but cybersecurity experts say there are other routine tasks you may be carrying out -- including using your debit card online or downloading free apps to your phone – that could seriously jeopardize your online security.

""I already assume my smartphone is infected,"" Gary Miliefsky, the CEO of SnoopWall, a cybersecurity company based in New Hampshire told CTVNews.ca.

And if a cybersecurity expert’s phone is infected, yours may be too.

From avoiding downloading email attachments to disabling geo-tagging, you may be leaving yourself wide open to hackers. So what simple steps can you take to protect yourself online?

CTVNews.ca spoke to two cybersecurity experts, Miliefsky and technology analyst Carmi Levy, to find out the top 5 things they would never think of doing on their smartphone or computer:

1. Never use your debit card for online shopping

Online retailers are increasingly offering customers a chance to use their debit card to pay for transactions, making life easier for those who don’t have credit cards or for those who don't want to add to their credit debt.

Even PayPal now has an option for users to add their debit cards to their accounts.

This tops Miliefsky’s list of things he would never do on his computer or smartphone.

""If you use a credit card, you're much safer because of the fraud and identity theft investigations and protections designed around credit cards,"" he said.

Miliefsky says he understands people wanting to only use the cash they have readily available, but a hacked debit card is a much more time consuming process to get fixed.

Longer fraud investigations and future identity theft concerns are the major reason to avoid using them online, he says.

2. Never download an app before reading the privacy permissions

When downloading an app, many will skim through the permissions it asks to be granted – such as accessing your contacts or your location.

Both experts suggest reading the privacy permissions and doing some research on the apps' creator before you download it.

Miliefsky lists a keyboard emoji app found on the Google Play store that has hundreds of thousands of downloads as an example. This simple emoji app asks to read all your text messages, listen in on ingoing and outgoing calls and track your movement.

Both Miliefsky and Levy say free apps are particularly troublesome for wanting to control your phone's contents. Many apps also don't list where all the information they gather from your devices is stored.

""We’re essentially giving up all of our rights to in order to play these games,"" said Levy. ""We're allowing companies carte blanche to have our information.""

Instead, research the apps you download and avoid those that wants to oversee a large amount of your phone's content.

3. Never download email attachments

It may sound like a hassle, but Miliefsky suggests never downloading an email attachment.

""If there were no hyperlinks or attachments in an email, how could you get infected in emails?"" he said.

He says people have become used to downloading attachments from people they recognize recognizable, and hackers can exploit that.

Instead, consider using a third party program such as Dropbox – a secure file hosting service – allows you to scan all incoming attachments and ensure you’re not downloading something potentially harmful.

For an extra layer of protection, Miliefsky recommends getting rid of email signatures that feature hyperlinks. Those links can be corrupted and instead of directing the recipient to its intended target, can instead direct them to a site a hacker controls.

4. Never share a password

A fairly straightforward piece of advice, but both Miliefsky and Levy suggest never sharing important passwords online or using the same password twice.

Miliefsky recommends never entering any of your passwords on sites you don't recognize or sharing it with others, while Levy suggests avoid having them stored on your computer.

""Breaking in to your computer, eavesdropping on your computer, getting passwords is just too easy,"" Miliefsky said. ""Just don’t share your password.""

Levy agrees, adding that many users use the same password multiple times, making you an easier target to hack.

""You’re willingly trading off security for convenience when you do this,"" he said.

5. Never enable geo-tagging, GPS and Wi-Fi

A geotag is an electronic tag that lists the geographical location a photo, video or device is located. You may already have enabled your location on your phone and not know it. To disable the feature, simple check your camera settings and disable ""geotags"" or ""location tag.""

But it’s important to be aware if you’ve enabled geo-tagging because you could be giving outsiders a virtual map to your whereabouts if they get their hands on your device, Miliefksy says.

He gives an example of children taking photos on their phones or iPods without realizing the photo is storing their location. If the phone or computer taking that photo has already been hacked or gets hacked, then whoever has control of it can easily discover where you live or where your kids are, he says.

Beyond geotags, using free Wi-Fi is another no-no.

Smartphone users tend to leave their Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connection on when it’s not needed, Levy says, which can allow hackers easily taking control devices when you’re out in public.

Hackers can set up fake internet connections in coffee shops to use on unsuspecting customers and easily access that data once the device is connected.

""Even if you’re logging in to a sanctioned network like a one at a coffee shop,"" said Levy referring to Wi-Fi logins at coffee shops like Starbucks. ""The sad truth is these are places that sell coffee, not specialize in Wi-Fi security.""

Both suggest using those, and similar functions on your phone – such as enabling Bluetooth or Near Field Communication, which can pair your device with another -- only when it’s necessary or when it’s on a secure connection.

The only safe connections are those where you know who is in charge of the connection such as your employer or your home router.

While the expert advice may seem ominous, Levy says the idea is to reinforce how important security for our digital devices is, and how it tends to get overlooked.

""I don't want to freak people out, but at the same time I want to frighten people into treating security with a little more seriousness than they already do,"" he said. ""Sometimes you need a bit of a poke to wake up and smell the coffee.""",[]
646,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/5-things/5-things-to-know-about-tesla-s-new-cheaper-model-3-1.2894819,"5 things to know about Tesla's new, cheaper Model 3",[],2016-05-10 06:28:00-04:00,"Tesla Motors has long been touted by CEO Elon Musk as the car company of the future, one that promises to bring an electrical revolution to the automotive industry.

Right now, the California-based business only has a handful of vehicles on the road compared to the likes of Ford, General Motors and the other industry giants. But if Musk has his way, Tesla’s recently announced Model 3 will drastically change that.

Here are five things to know about the affordable car that you can plug into your wall.

“It’s going to be awesome”

…At least according to the FAQ page. Details on the vehicle are a bit sparse at the moment, but the company promises to share more as they get closer to production, which is supposed to begin at the end of 2017.

Right now, here’s what we know:

The base model of the car is supposed to cost $35,000 (USD)

It will have seating for five adults

It will accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in under six seconds

It has two trunks (front and back)

It will come equipped with Autopilot capabilities (that will likely cost a few thousand extra)

It will travel approximately 345 kilometres per charge (more on that below)

We also know what the car will look like, barring any redesigns before its actual release:

You can take it on a road trip – depending on where you want to go

Tesla says the Model 3 will be able to cruise approximately 345 kilometres on a full battery. At that sort of range, you can safely drive to work, run some errands and drive back home before needing to charge your car (which you can do by basically just plugging it into the wall).

Will the car cut it on a road trip? Here’s an idea of where 345 kilometres will take you in Canada.

The car can handle a decent day’s drive, but if you plan on taking a long trip, you’re likely going to need to stop overnight to let your Model 3 charge – unless your route is lined with Tesla’s “Superchargers.”

These free-to-use power stations are scattered throughout the world and can charge vehicles in “minutes instead of hours,” according to Tesla’s website. They estimate it takes about 40 minutes for an 80 per cent charge and 75 minutes for 100 per cent charge.

There are 17 Tesla Supercharger stations in Canada right now – eight in B.C. and Alberta and nine in Ontario and Quebec – with more Supercharger stations planned for 2016. This would make trips from Vancouver to Calgary or Toronto to Montreal doable in a single (albeit fairly long) day. And with hundreds of chargers across the U.S., cruising from coast to coast would be simple if you’re heading south of the border.

Tesla vehicles have some ridiculous-sounding features

Scenario: It’s 2022 and you’re navigating the ragged roads of the dystopian future nightmare our world has become. The gas-mask-clad bandits who haunt the highways hop out from behind the bramble, clouding the air with a poison blast.

“Nice try,” you think to yourself as you engage the vehicle’s Bioweapon Defense Mode.

Reality: Who knows what situation Musk had in mind when he developed the feature, but Teslas actually do have a “Bioweapon Defense Mode.” The cars come equipped with an air filtration system that can scrub the air of pollutants, which the company demoed by placing one of its cars in a bubble filled with extreme concentrations of airborne particulate matter.

According to the Telsa blog post, about two minutes after engaging the system, the air quality inside the vehicle dropped from beyond hazardous to good and breathable. The system even seemed to scrub about 40 per cent of the pollution outside of the car.

“In other words, Bioweapon Defense Mode is not a marketing statement, it is real,” states the Tesla marketing team. “You can literally survive a military grade bio attack by sitting in your car.”

The Model 3 will also have an optional feature available called “Ludicrous Mode” – something that lets the machine accelerate even faster. It’s currently available for Tesla’s other models (for a not-small chunk of change), and decreases the 0-to-60 time by about 10 per cent (or the time to 155 mph by 20 per cent, if you ever happen to reach those speeds).

Tesla will also make ludicrous amounts of revenue from the Model 3

After one week, 325,000 people had pre-ordered the Model 3 – and at $1,000 a pop for a reservation, that’s already more than $300 million in cash. And if every one of those people follows through with their order, selecting only the base model (Tesla estimates with add-ons, orders will average closer to $42,000 USD), that would already be more than $11 billion in sales.

But profit isn’t exactly a familiar concept to the automaker – it took 10 years for Tesla to turn its first quarterly profit, and it’s been reported that the company actually loses more than $4,000 on every car it sells.

That’s not to say the business model is unsustainable, however. A lot of the money Tesla has made so far selling its Model S and Model X vehicles has been reinvested into projects like its Gigafactory in Nevada, which will “produce more lithium ion batteries annually than were produced worldwide in 2013.”

Tesla has grandiose dreams of cranking its car production up fivefold, which will be necessary to satisfy the unprecedented demand for the Model 3.

But you won’t be getting a Model 3 any time soon

One thing is for sure, this is the car of the future – in the sense that most people won’t be seeing one for at least a few years. While early orders might be fulfilled by late 2017, those ordering now might not get behind the wheel by the end of this decade.

Musk himself recommended “ordering a Model 3 soon if you want 2018 delivery,” though even that looks like a best-case scenario. While the company is ramping up production, cranking out half a million cars per year by 2018 is a lofty goal for a car company that only delivered about 50,000 vehicles 2015.

So if you’re itching for an affordable electric vehicle that actually exists in the present, here are some other options to check out (prices in USD):

Mitsubishi i-MiEV: $23,845 MRSP, 100 km/charge

Chevrolet Spark: $25,995 MRSP, 132 km/charge

Nissan Leaf: $29,860 MRSP, 135 km/charge

Ford Focus Electric: $30,045 MRSP, 122 km/charge

647,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/5-things/5-ways-to-boost-security-when-using-your-fitness-tracker-1.2754367,5 ways to boost security when using your fitness tracker,[],2016-02-02 06:00:00-05:00,"Wearable fitness trackers are becoming increasingly popular, as users turn to these devices to help them monitor indicators of their health and physical activity. But as you strap on your device and head out for the day, one security experts suggests taking a few extra steps to increase the security of your personal data.

Fitness trackers including Fitbit and the Apple Watch are surging in popularity, and are proving to be popular gifts.

On Christmas Day, Fitbit's app was the most downloaded on Apple's app store, suggesting that the fitness trackers were a hot seller during the holiday season.

For those who aren't familiar with them, wearable fitness trackers are devices that can be attached to an individual, and will collect information about the user's physical activity levels.

Commonly collected data include total steps taken, total stairs climbed, total hours of sleep and total calories burned in a day.

This data is often uploaded to a user's personal account, typically registered with their personal email, where they can check their progress over time. Many wearables also allow users to connect with others, to compare and share their progress.

While these devices can help individuals keep track of their activity levels and stay motivated to reach their fitness goals, people should take steps to make sure this information is secure, says ESET Senior Security Researcher Stephen Cobb.

Cobb says that people who use fitness trackers should remember the kinds of often very personal information they're uploading to their accounts.

He pointed to a major security breach last year, when toy-maker VTech, which makes smart watches for children, discovered that the personal information from approximately five million customer accounts related to kids' profiles had been compromised.

""You might say, 'What does it matter if somebody gets my personal information?'"" Cobb told CTVNews.ca. ""There are two things to worry about, really: One, it's just not really nice if a stranger, potentially a criminal stranger, gets your personal information, and two, there may be attempts to use that information in some sort of scam or scheme.""

He suggests people who wear fitness trackers consider taking the following steps to increase the security of their personal information they're uploading to their registered accounts:

1. Give your device a name that is not recognizable, or easily traceable to you. So, for example, don't call your fitness tracker ""John Clark's Fitness Tracker."" Instead, create a user name for your device which is hard for somebody to track back to you, Cobb said.

2. When creating an online account to store your personal data, use a unique, strong password that is difficult for anyone to guess. Cobb said this is especially important for people who have accounts with multiple services online, and who use the same email and password for each one. People who do this face extra security risks, because if there is a security breach at one company, hackers potentially have access to all of your other accounts, he said.

3. When accepting friends to follow through your fitness tracker, be aware of exactly what information you're sharing and with whom you are sharing it. ""The social aspect of fitness trackers is very interesting, and has the potential to improve the value you get from the tracker,"" Cobb said. ""But just like social networking, you want to be very careful who you accept as friends… don't accept people unless you're absolutely sure who they are, and you're clear on what you're sharing.""

4. Read the privacy policy that accompanies your fitness tracker, so that you are clear and comfortable with how your information may be used by the company, and how you can limit it, if at all.

5. Keep an eye on the news about these devices. This is especially important, as fitness trackers are relatively new, Cobb said. As they increase in popularity, the risk associated with them may change, he said.

In an email to CTVNews.ca, Fitbit said it has always been committed to protecting consumer privacy and keeping data safe.

""Fitbit has committed to never share users' personal information with others unless the user directs us to,"" the email said.

The company says it uses ""privacy by design"" principles, to ensure that transparency, consumer choice and security are prioritized in the design of all Fitbit products. It notes that Fitbit users are in full control of when, or if, they share any of their data, and that these sharing settings are set to private as a default.

""It is the user's choice to share their data,"" the company said.

In addition to using a unique password for every online account, Fitbit also recommends users take steps to keep their computers free from malware. More information on Fitbit security can be found on its website.

In an email to CTVNews.ca, an Apple spokesperson highlighted some of the security features that come with the Apple Watch, including ""Activation Lock,"" which requires the user to enter their iCloud Apple ID and password when activating the device. Doing so can help protect the wearer in the event their Apple Watch is stolen, by securing their personal information, the spokesperson said.

""When your phone is locked with a passcode or Touch ID, all of your health and fitness data in the health app is encrypted,"" the spokesperson said. ""Any health data backed up to iCloud is encrypted both in transit and on our servers.""

More information about Apple's privacy policy and encryption policies can be found on its website.",[]
648,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/5-things/tech-tuesday-the-best-home-security-cameras-1.2709732,Tech Tuesday: The best home-security cameras,['Simon Cohen'],2015-12-22 06:00:00-05:00,"Going away for the holidays? Or maybe there’s someone on your list who’s away on business a lot? Then it’s time to think about the biggest trend in smart home devices: remote monitoring video cameras.

Unlike the more commercially oriented multi-camera systems that require complicated wiring and set-ups, these products are designed to use your home WiFi network in combination with a cloud-based storage system and can usually be set up in minutes. While some require subscriptions to enjoy all of their features, some do not. And though they may offer peace of mind, they are not a substitute for a professionally monitored home security system.

Here are some of the leading players in the space and what you need to know before investing in them.

Nest Cam ($219, plus optional Nest Aware subscription starting at $10/month)

The Nest Cam (formerly Drop Cam) is a versatile home monitoring camera that can capture 1080p video, with a wide 130-degree field of view and the ability to see clearly even in low-light situations. These specs aren’t uncommon -- many of its competitors can make the same claims -- but its software and optional cloud-based recording features make the Nest Cam the most popular device of its kind. Once set up, you can view real-time footage from the Nest Cam, use its digital zoom to get closer to the action, or communicate through the camera’s built-in speaker and microphone. You can make your Nest Cam’s feed public and share it with friends and family, making it a clever alternative to FaceTime or Skype for family events.

But if what you really want is to record what’s going while you’re not there, you’ll need the Nest Aware subscription plan, which will run you $10/month for 10 days’ worth of recording, or $30 for 30 days. $120 a year certainly isn’t chump change -- especially if it’s on top of an existing security system monitoring plan -- but it does enable Nest Cam’s best features, such as personal alerts based on criteria like movement (the company claims its software can tell the difference between irrelevant movement like trees moving in the wind and important movement like a person walking through the room). It also gives you impressive extras like the ability to isolate a particular area of the image for alerts, e.g. a precious work of art, or your child’s crib; and time-lapse recordings which let you select any chunk of previously recorded footage and condense it into a 6, 15, 30, 60 or 120-second video. The other thing to keep in mind is that, with Nest Aware, your camera can record continuously for the entire 10-or-30 day stretch if you choose -- no SD card in the world is big enough to store all of that. It also means that your footage is more secure (assuming you trust that hackers won’t make their way into Nest’s cloud servers) and not vulnerable to fire, theft or other mishaps.

It’s not a perfect solution. You still need to connect the Nest Cam to a power outlet via its 10-foot micro USB cable, which may limit where you can place it, and once placed, its angle or tilt can’t be changed remotely. If your power goes out, so does your recording because of Nest Cam’s reliance on the cloud and its lack of a battery backup.

Samsung SmartCam HD Pro ($219)

Let’s say you love everything about the Nest Cam but that Nest Aware subscription is a deal-breaker. Samsung feels your pain and is hoping to woo would-be Nest Cam buyers with its identically priced (and similar looking) SmartCam HD Pro. The camera offers an almost identical list of features to the Nest Cam, including two-way voice, low-light video, 1080p resolution, a wide field of view and real-time streaming, but it eschews cloud-based recording and alerts in favour of micro-SD-based on-board recording. Naturally this limits the sheer amount of video you can save depending on the card you buy (the camera does not come with one) but it also means a one-time cost instead of a monthly fee. You even get Samsung’s version of the Nest Cam’s Activity Zones, which lets you trace out an area of interest in the camera’s field of view. Unlike the Nest Cam, the SmartCam HD Pro comes with a series of built-in sound effects that can be triggered from your smartphone or tablet, which play back through the camera’s built in speaker -- very handy if you need to interact with your home without using your own voice: a simple siren sound might be all you need to scare away an intruder.

On the downside, cloud recording isn’t offered at all, which limits how you can use the SmartCam, and it suffers from the same limitation of placement as the Nest Cam thanks to its power cord, though just like the Nest Cam, it can be wall-mounted if you wish.

Ezviz Mini ($84.99)

Spending over $200 on a security camera might be affordable if you only need one or maybe two in your home. But what if you need a lot more, or your budget simply can’t stretch that far? Thankfully there are cheaper options like the Ezviz Mini. It can’t match the more expensive cameras feature-for-feature (it lacks face detection and alerts can only be triggered by movement, not sound) but it can easily provide you with basic functionality. You get 720p streaming and recording which won’t be as sharp as 1080p, and its lens has a narrower field of view (115 degrees), but it can handle low-light situations and it comes with a 16GB micro SD card (and supports up to 64GB). Most importantly, the Ezviz doesn’t make you choose between local storage and cloud support. You can have both and in fact, the camera comes with a free one year subscription so you can really get the feel for it. If you continue after the trial period, it’s only $5/month or $50/year.

Some reviewers have suggested that the Ezviz’s app for iOS or Android lacks polish and the learning curve may be steeper than its pricier competitors, but that might be easily overlooked considering this product is less than half the price of the other cameras.

Canary All-In-One Camera ($249)

Going to the other extreme is the Canary All-in-One Camera. It’s more expensive than many of the others, but arguably the most capable too. If you’re looking for a single device that could theoretically replace an entire home security system, the Canary comes closest. By this point, you know the drill: 1080p video with low-light capability, that streams directly to your phone or tablet. The Canary uses the cloud-only model of the Nest Cam, but gives 12 hours of recording away for free, on an ongoing basis. Subscription plans that start at $4.99/month can increase this to 30 days. Unlike the other cameras, the Canary must sit on a flat, centrally located surface because its attractive cylindrical shape doesn’t allow for wall mounting. What the Canary does have that the others do not is an ear-splitting 90 decibel alarm that can be activated remotely, and a suite of extra sensors such as an air-quality sampler, a motion detector, a humidity sensor, a temperature gauge and a 3-axis accelerometer. This might seem extreme, but if you’re trying to keep tabs on a secondary property like a cottage, they could provide critical information in the event of a fire, flood or other disaster. It also boasts the widest field of view at 143 degrees -- which means the Canary can see more, and doesn’t need to be shoved in a corner to give you a clear view of what’s going on.

The Canary is also equipped with a handy geofencing system which lets you assign multiple devices to the system’s “awareness” of who’s home, automatically arming or disarming the system depending on whether these devices are in the house or not -- perfect for smartphones that tend to go where we go, not so great for tablets that often get left at home.

Netatmo Welcome ($219)

Like a cross between the Canary and the Samsung SmartCam, Netatmo Welcome is a home security camera with another cylindrical, non-wall-mountable design, and uses micro SD cards exclusively for recording footage from its 1080p-capable, 130-degree field of view camera. It comes with an 8GB card, but you’ll need to buy more as this will fill up quickly. The Welcome’s claim to fame is that it’s the only camera on the market (currently) that does facial recognition. When you set it up (using your WiFi or wired network) you create profiles for each person in your house and then “train” the camera to recognize these people. It’s a process that takes some time, but works well in the end. The Welcome can then be set to send you alerts based on the faces it sees. Want to know when your youngest child comes home? Or perhaps you simply want to know when an unrecognized person is in your house… either way, Welcome will tell you. It can also be triggered by movement of any kind, something which reviewers have suggested creates a bit of a problem for users: the Welcome can detect even the slightest of movements and unlike the Nest Cam, it doesn’t seem to distinguish between noteworthy ones and non-relevant ones. This can mean a lot of false-alarms if you place Welcome in a high-traffic area. Of course, if you place it elsewhere, it may not see much.

The question is, as cool and unique as face detection is, is it worth $219, especially considering what the Welcome lacks: no cloud storage option, no two-way communication, no audible alarm and no way to adjust the sensitivity of its movement-based alerts?

Netgear Arlo ($199)

Of all the security cameras we’ve covered so far, all of them have one thing in common: They need to be wired to a power outlet, even if they communicate over WiFi. That creates some limitations on placement, and can mean some pretty unsightly wires. So the Netgear Arlo, despite its limited feature set, is very attractive to buyers looking for a wireless option. On the downside, you need a separate base station to connect Arlo cameras to the Internet, but it’s included at this price point. The video quality, at 720p, is poor by comparison to the 1080p that is the norm for most other cameras. It does not have a mic or built-in speakers so nevermind two-way communication -- you simply don’t get sound of any kind. As for advanced features like face detection or burglar alarms? Fuggedaboudit. With only 110 degrees of field of view, it can’t capture as much of the action as the others mentioned here.

But what the Arlo does offer is unlimited placement flexibility thanks to its use of C123A batteries instead of AC power -- these last for about 3-4 months depending on usage. It’s also completely weather-proof, which means it can be used outdoors too -- even during a cold, Canadian winter. The included magnetic wall mount is very clever: Its semi-spherical shape means you can easily adjust where the Arlo is pointed throughout a wide range of angles (though any small bump could easily move it).

Moreover, Netgear gives you 7 days of cloud video recording for free (which is good, because there’s no on-board storage) and you can add up to 15 cameras to a single base station. Additional cameras cost $179 each, though you may get a better price if you buy more than one.

There’s only one type of alert: Movement -- it’s adjustable, so this will help with false alarms, and you can create rules for each camera that dictate what they should do when they detect movement (e.g.: Nothing, record a 20-second clip, send an email alert etc.). The one thing to keep in mind with the Netgear Arlo is that, because it is battery powered, you can’t use it to record continuously 24/7. It’s designed to only record short clips when it sense movement, or stream live video for short durations to your phone or tablet. This may limit its value for people who want to constantly check-in on kids or pets.

Homeboy ($189 USD – no Canadian pricing option)

If you like the idea of the Netgear Arlo’s wire-free installation option, Homeboy’s family of WiFi security cameras can go one step better: Not only are they wire-free, with the ability to mount almost anywhere indoors, they don’t require a separate base-station because they connect directly to your WiFi router. This simplifies the setup and the amount of gear you need. Homeboy’s cameras eschew the Arlo’s disposable lithium batteries for internal, rechargeable ones that last about 90 days between charges with typical usage. Just like the Arlo, Homeboy captures video clips, which it stores in the cloud, and does not offer live streaming. The company’s free plan offers 12 hours of video storage, with unlimited downloads, but you can increase this to 30 days of storage for $4.99 US a month.

There are two major drawbacks to the Homeboy at this time: First, its camera sensor only delivers a low-res 640x480 video image with only 52 degrees of horizontal view. You’ll still see what’s going on, but you’ll have to be very strategic with where you place it, as it won’t be able to show you a whole room at once and you won’t be able to make out any fine details. Second, it isn’t weatherproof, so consider the Homeboy indoor-only.

On the plus side, the Homeboy has a built-in mic, which means its recordings include audio—something the Arlo notably lacks. Homeboy also offers an intriguing way to increase its recording smarts: It’s compatible with the web-based IFTTT service (If This Then That), which gives users the ability to create smart-home “recipes” for their connected gadgets. For example, you could simply let Homeboy send you alerts based on its built-in motion detection, or, you could trigger it to record whenever your Nest Protect thermostat smells smoke. Conversely, the Homeboy can be used to trigger your other smarthome devices, perhaps by turning on your WeMo lightbulbs when it detects motion (not only to give an intruder a scare, but also to throw some more light on what Homeboy is recording).

The company is promising to enhance its security options in 2016 by giving users the ability to have their cameras professionally monitored by a security company.

Finally…

No matter which home security camera you buy, we urge you to think carefully about security. There have been several articles published recently about the risks that web-connected camera pose to possible intrusion and the advice they offer is worth repeating here:

Make sure your home network is secured using a unique password (not the default one that comes with your router) and is based on a strong scheme like WPA2

Do not use the default password on the camera system you buy--create a new one and don’t share it

Consider the vulnerability of the video footage you are recording. The Nest Cam records only to the cloud or your phone, which means that if stolen, thieves do not get your footage. The Samsung SmartCam however, records unencrypted video to its SD card, which anyone could view if they stole it. Make sure the product you buy has sufficient protections in place for your needs

JASPER NATIONAL PARK, ALBERTA

The stargazing in Jasper National Park is so inspiring they put a soundtrack to it. During the park’s Dark Sky Festival every October, the outdoor Edmonton Symphony Orchestra Strings perform during the “Symphony Under the Stars” show. Jasper was designated a “Dark-Sky Preserve” by the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada in 2011 due to optimal dark sky viewing amid very little light pollution.

GARIBALDI PROVINCIAL PARK, BRITISH COLUMBIA

This park is conveniently located a short drive from the resort town of Whistler, B.C., and is a popular hiking and camping site. “Its high altitude and low light pollution make it an excellent stargazing spot for adventurers, nature lovers and amateur astronomers alike,” said the Space Agency on its website.

GRASSLANDS NATIONAL PARK, SASKATCHEWAN

Located near the border of Montana and Saskatchewan, Grasslands National Park was designated a “Dark-Sky Preserve” in 2009. In fact, it’s the darkest of the dark-sky preserves in the whole country, the Space Agency says. “Visitors can marvel at the Milky Way, constellations and other astronomical phenomena that are very difficult to see near urban areas,” the website reads.

WHITESHELL PROVINCIAL PARK, MANITOBA

Whiteshell might not be a designated “Dark-Sky Preserve,” but it still offers an awe-inspiring experience, says the Space Agency, thanks in part to the “astronomy-related wonder” that is West Hawk Lake. The lake is situated in a meteorite crater several million years old. “Catch a delightful sunset on the lakeshore before looking up at night for a sight of the Milky Way,” the Agency says.

CHARLESTON LAKE PROVINCIAL PARK, ONTARIO

Each year from July to mid-August, stargazers in the northern hemisphere can catch a glimpse of the Perseid meteor shower, and Charleston Lake is a hot spot for viewing, the Space Agency says. They even have astronomers present during viewing parties that can help provide amateur viewers with an optimal experience.

MONT-MÉGANTIC INTERNATIONAL DARK-SKY RESERVE, QUEBEC

Located about 40 km from the town of Lac-Megantic, Mont-Megantic National Park is the site of the International Dark-Sky Association’s first International Dark Sky Reserve, a separate designation from the Canadian Space Agency’s dark-sky preserves. The scientific observatory is located at the summit of Mont Megantic.

TORNGAT MOUNTAINS NATIONAL PARK, NEWFOUNDLAND

Amateurs be warned: Torngat Mountains National Park might be too challenging for the casual outdoor lover. Located in a remote location near the tip of the province, the park is only accessible by boat or charter plane. “The scenery is worth the extra effort, as northern lights are very bright and frequent,” the Space Agency says. “Inuit culture, astronomy and captivating landscapes collide for an unforgettable excursion.”

HOPEWELL ROCKS PROVINCIAL PARK, NEW BRUNSWICK

The stunning New Brunswick tourist spot is typically visited for its beaches and the fascination with the high- and low-tide viewing of the Hopewell Rocks, also known as the Flower Pot Rocks, a wonder of millions of years of tidal erosion. It’s “the perfect spot for those who are interested in both geology and astronomy,” says the Space Agency.

PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND NATIONAL PARK, P.E.I.

This small, 27 square km national park features low light pollution and is a pleasant seaside escape, whether you’re stargazing or not. The Canadian Space Agency says the nearby Cavendish Beach is also a good option for nighttime stargazing.

KEJIMKUJIK NATIONAL PARK, NOVA SCOTIA

Designated a Dark-Sky Preserve in 2010, Kejimkujik National Park -- also known as “Keji” -- offers public stargazing events twice a year called the “Dark Sky Weekend.” The park also has a close relationship with First Nations traditions, so visitors can learn about the importance of astronomy in Mi’kmaq culture while they stargaze.

WATSON LAKE, YUKON

Home to the Northern Lights Space and Science Centre, Watson Lake provides an educational experience with its stargazing. Lucky visitors might catch a glimpse of the aurora too.

IQALUIT, NUNAVUT

With short daylight hours in the winter, Iqaluit is a prime location for stargazing and viewing the northern lights. “You can enjoy a colourful night sky from October to April,” says the Space Agency, “but be sure to bundle up: it can get extremely cold during those months.”

WOOD BUFFALO NATIONAL PARK, NORTHWEST TERRITORIES

The largest Dark-Sky Preserve in the whole world at nearly 45,000 square km, Wood Buffalo National Park sits mostly in Alberta, but crosses into the southern edge of the Northwest Territories. The park is also home to the largest herd of free-roaming wood bison. In other words, you can see more than stars at Wood Buffalo National Park.",[]

“I never dreamed I’d get to do my bucket list,” the octogenarian told CTVNews.ca via telephone from Las Vegas after completing a helicopter tour of the Grand Canyon, which even included a picnic with champagne. “I never dreamed even that I would be on Instagram. I mean, that’s still a dream to me -- which I love.”

With more than three million followers on Instagram, and counting, the 89-year-old has taken the internet by storm with her colourful -- and often racy -- outfits and crass commentary.

“I’ve always been a baddie,” the native Kentuckian said with a drawl.

Baddie’s already been to Niagara Falls, Ont. (“I love Canada!” she exclaimed), mixed drinks in New York City and hung out with the NFL’s Dallas Cowboys. Also on the cards for her ten-stop bucket list adventure, which is being sponsored by Hotels.com and ends on Nov. 12, is shimmying to samba in Rio de Janeiro, drinking the night away in Dublin, taking in the Moulin Rouge in Paris, and (hopefully) nabbing herself a perfect prince in London’s Buckingham Palace -- and Baddie said he doesn’t even have to be a top tier royal like Harry or William.

“Any old prince will do,” she laughed.

Baddie’s wild saga from a quiet, pastoral life in America’s heartland to the heights of social media stardom began less than four years ago, when she was still commonly known as Helen Van Winkle. Her great-granddaughter Kennedy Lewis, now 21, had snapped a photo of Baddie jokingly modelling her tie-dye shirt and cut-off denim shorts. When Lewis posted the photo of her great-grandmother wearing her clothes online, the likes and follows just started pouring in.

“It blew up,” Lewis said. “It’s been crazy!”

Winkle now counts celebrities such as Miley Cyrus and Rihanna amongst her fans and followers, and she’s even inked lucrative deals to appear in ads and showcase products on her social media accounts.

“I’ve been very fortunate,” she said.

Lewis, who acts as Baddie’s manager and millennial whisperer is joining her great-grandmother on her globe-trotting bucket list adventure.

“She’s a wonderful traveller -- she takes good care of me,” Baddie said. But she added that Lewis can’t always keep up with her “more adventurous” great-grandmother.

“She likes to lay by the pool and I like to do other things,” Baddie said. “I want to get up and go!”

According to a study released by Hotels.com, a fifth of people under the age of 30 are inspired to travel based on their parents’ and grandparents’ past adventures. Forty per cent of millennials, moreover, would prefer to complete their bucket lists with their parents or grandparents over celebrities (11 per cent), siblings (28 per cent) or travelling solo (25 per cent). One in eight even confessed that that their grandmother is cooler and more well-travelled than they are.

On Instagram, Baddie makes no secret of her love for playing the field. Her Instagram tagline -- “stealing your man since 1928” -- even announces it to the world.

“I’ve been single for 30 years and I have dated a lot,” she said. “I love men, but they do take up a lot of your time.”

Lewis says that she’s grown “pretty used to” Baddie’s man-eating ways.

“She flirts a lot,” Lewis said with a laugh. “She encourages me to go out with lots of men.""

Often seen wearing cannabis leaf prints and accessories, Baddie is also vocal proponent for the nationwide legalization of medical marijuana, saying that she uses cannabis pills and oils to manager her arthritis.

“I’m very much for medicinal marijuana,” she said. “It’s great -- it really is.”

Now that Canadians have fully embraced the “glamping” or glamourous camping trend, countless businesses offering luxurious accommodations have popped up to give visitors the nature experience without the inconvenience.

One such opportunity involves cuddling up in a snug, wooden pod with modern amenities in the charming countryside of southwestern Ontario. Long Point Eco-Adventure, located in picturesque Norfolk County, approximately a two-hour drive from Toronto, offers three different types of comfortable lodging to satisfy every budget.

The cozy pods and spacious suites allow visitors to rest their weary heads in peace after an action-packed day of kayaking, mountain biking, axe-throwing, zip-lining or stargazing at the adventure resort’s observatory.

Camping pods

For anyone looking to save a buck or two and can handle a little less space, Long Point Eco-Adventure’s camping pods may be the perfect tent alternative. The adorable dome-shaped wooden pods include a queen sized bed or two twin beds and include hardwood floors, stylish bedding, a sliding glass door and a private deck.

Travellers will have to use the resort’s communal washroom and shower facilities if they opt to book this simple but charming accommodation. There is also no electricity in the camping pods, so don’t expect to charge an iPhone while residing in this rustic pod.

Cost:

$89/night for low season weekdays

$109/night for low season weekends and high season weekdays

Wilderness pods

For nature-enthusiasts who appreciate space and privacy, the camping pods’ upgraded relative, the wilderness pod, may be just the thing. For a little more money, visitors will sleep on a queen-sized bed and relax in a homey living room complete with a table for dining.

The wilderness pods’ most attractive feature, perhaps, is the private flush toilet and sink; although, patrons will still have to use the shared shower facilities. On top of running water, guests will enjoy all of the same features as the camping pods along with electrical outlets for any of their charging needs.

Wilderness Suites

For the ultimate lap of camping luxury, guests can book one of the resort’s spacious wilderness suites for a true glamping experience. The tent-like structure could be considered more of a hotel room substitute than a tent alternative. With a choice of a king-sized bed or the family-friendly two queen-sized beds option, visitors will have more than enough room to spread out and relax.

The well-equipped suite includes all of the same features as the other two cheaper accommodations, but with the added bonus of a mini fridge and a private outdoor shower.

We’ve had enough. We’ve seen a lot of beautiful sights and I know there are so many more out there to see, but the key to any great adventure is knowing when to wrap it up.

Our plan had always been to travel for six months and I feel a little disappointed we’re stopping at five. But there would have been no prize for making it to the six-month mark (at least I think there wasn’t) and there’s no shame in heading home early.

We know we’ve been lucky to take this trip at all, even if it involved selling our house and putting our lives on hold.

But the problem with long-term family travel that no one tells you about is the “family” part. Also, the “long-term” part. So really the “long-term family” part; the “travel” part has been fine.

We love our children, really we do. They are smart and funny and they’re useful for carrying stuff. We’re pretty sure they love us too. But no matter how much your family means to you, it’s really, really hard to spend every minute of every day with them. You get on each other’s nerves and I’m here to confess it doesn’t get any easier as the weeks tick on.

There have been some exhausting moments with these kids. Like the time our boy threw his stuffed animal in the air while waiting for the train outside Disneyland Paris and it landed on the tracks and his daddy angrily jumped down to retrieve it only to be greeted by an even angrier French soldier with a very large gun. He yelled in words that Daddy couldn’t interpret but understood just fine.

Or the time this same boy lost his e-reader in the back seat of a Spanish taxi, then lost his sister’s e-reader hours later by “hiding” it under a suitcase where it wasn’t found until two weeks later. (The e-reader left in the taxi was retrieved as well after Mommy engaged in some high-level negotiating in some low-level Spanish.)

Or the myriad number of times our two kids descended into fisticuffs while in public -- almost invariably in a fancy restaurant with white tablecloths -- with the short, sharp battles ending in howls and tears and vows of revenge. From us parents, mostly.

Of course, there have also been plenty of spectacular moments too. Like hiking the cliffs of Ireland and the moors of England, and seeing the boiling hot geysers of Iceland. The kids have touched fish in the Mediterranean, ridden camels in Morocco and ponies in Paris, and stayed in a cave home dug into a cliff. They’ve climbed up castle walls, ridden to the top of the London Eye and seen the Eiffel Tower from down below.

And though they may not realize it, they’ve learned a ton about European history too, about medieval warfare, the Titanic disaster, the Irish famine, and the Moorish invasion of Spain. They’ve even learned a bit about European hygiene. (“Tell me again, Momma, about how the bod..., the bahdet.. the buttwasher works, please?”)

But in between all that wonder, there have been some pretty trying parenting moments and plenty of frustration. When you’re at the point of thinking the primary goal of your trip is no longer enjoyment but endurance, that’s a pretty good sign it’s time to pack it in.

I’m well aware there are lots of families who travel the world for much longer, because I met and spoke with many before we left. They talked about how travel helped mature their children, teaching them independence, and to see that there are other ways of life that are so much different from their own.

And I know there are some families who go through even bigger changes and make being global nomads a permanent way of life. I tip my hat to these families; they’re braver than we are. Maybe it’s different when you’ve committed to a full year of handling travel logistics, cranky kids, fussy eaters and homeschooling stress. Maybe they’re just better travellers than we are. Maybe they’re better parents.

Or maybe our kids might not be cut out for this. Our boy has always just gone along with whatever we have planned -- mostly because he often has no idea what’s going on at all. He usually has his nose in a book and I’m not even sure how much of this trip he’s absorbed at all, since most days he can’t even keep track of which country he’s in.

But our daughter is a quieter girl who has never really liked change. From the start, she told us she wasn’t eager to go. We knew that when we left. But isn’t our job as parents to encourage our kids to try new things, to push themselves beyond what they think they are capable of, to broaden their worlds? If we only ever keep things comfortable for them, how can they grow?

We hoped that once the kids saw a few of the great cities of Europe and landscapes they’d never seen before, they’d begin to see why we were so excited to show them this stuff.

But even after all the fun moments we’ve had, my daughter would still tell you she’d rather be home. She recently admitted she has decided she doesn’t like to travel. (Except airplane liftoffs. Those will always be fun, she says.) It kind of breaks my heart to hear that, that my daughter doesn’t love travel the way I do, especially since I’ve always sought out adventure and learning anything new.

But one of the hardest lessons one has to accept as a parent is that your kids aren’t you. They aren’t always going to love the same things you love, no matter how badly you want them to. My daughter is naturally a bit of a homebody, and this trip hasn’t changed that about her, even if I hoped it might.

So for the sake of family harmony, we’re heading home. It’s been a terrific journey and one we’re proud to say we got through without any disasters, injuries, or arrests. We’ve lost some socks and some hair along the way but we’re coming back with a ton of great photos and memories, two kids and each other, which is all we really need.",[]
653,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/5-things/why-trying-to-find-your-passion-might-be-the-wrong-approach-1.3999643,Why trying to 'find your passion' might be the wrong approach,[],2018-07-05 06:01:00-04:00,"Telling young people to “find their passion” in life in order to find happiness might not be the best advice after all.

New research has found that the way one views “life passions” can in fact prevent them from developing other, potentially rewarding interests.

The researchers from Yale-NUS College (a collaboration between Yale University and the National University of Singapore) wanted to examine theories on where a person’s “passions” came from.

“Are interests there all along, waiting to be revealed? Or must a spark of interest be cultivated through investment and persistence?” they wondered in a paper set to be published in the journal Psychological Science.

There appear to be two schools of thought on interests, they write. The first, called the ""fixed theory,"" holds that people are born with inclinations toward certain interests, such as math or music, and that passion simply needs to be discovered and then cultivated.

Others take a ""growth theory"" approach and tend to believe that interests can be developed slowly and that it’s possible to find many areas of interests, not just one “life passion.”

The authors say that the “fixed theory” approach may eventually be limiting and stifle a person’s curiosity about other interests.

For their research, the authors performed five studies to measure how the two different mindsets influenced learning.

For example, in one study, researchers broke Singapore college students into two groups: those with interests in “techy” topics, such as engineering or technology, or arts topics. Both groups were asked to do two readings: one about their field of interest and one outside that field.

They were then asked how likely they were to want to learn more about the topics in each article, and whether they could see themselves pursuing a career in the topics.

They were also asked how much they agreed with statements such as “Your core interests remain your core interests and don’t really change,” and “Even if you have very strong interests, they can change dramatically” to see whether they subscribed to the fixed theory or growth theory on interests.

The results showed that those students who had a fixed mindset were less likely to find the articles outside their usual scope interesting compared to those who had a growth mindset.

The authors say the danger of encouraging passions is that it can limit learning.

“The message to find your passion is generally offered with good intentions, to convey: Do not worry so much about talent, do not bow to pressure for status or money; just find what is meaningful and interesting to you,” they write.

“Unfortunately, the belief system this message may engender can undermine the very development of people’s interests.”

The authors say their research is particularly relevant in countries such as Singapore, where students begin to specialize in their education early in life.

There can be certain advantages to a “fixed theory” mindset, since it can allow a person to pursue an interest intensely without distraction, the authors say.

But the danger is that many presume that pursuing a passion should be relatively easy and provide constant inspiration. That thinking can lead people to abandon their passion if they ever face difficulty or setbacks.

“Urging people to find their passion may lead them to put all their eggs in one basket but then to drop that basket when it becomes difficult to carry,” they write.",[]

It seems a spoonful of sugar can do more than help the medicine go down. It can also help keep bee populations up, which is vital for humanity’s survival.

If you don’t bee-lieve me, just ask the fans of Sir David Attenborough.

A Facebook community page dedicated to the famous English naturalist and narrator of renowned nature documentaries such as, ‘The Blue Planet’ and ‘Planet Earth,’ sought to raise awareness about the plight of the bee.

“In the last 5 years the bee population has dropped by 1/3. If bees were to disappear from the face of the earth, humans would have just 4 years left to live,” the group wrote in a Facebook post earlier this month.

The fan group shared a simple tip that anyone can use at home. The post said that bees can often look like they’re dead or dying, particularly at this time of year, when in reality, they’re just tired.

“They simply don't have enough energy to return to the hive which can often result in being swept away,” the group wrote.

For anyone who comes across an exhausted bee, the Facebook group recommends mixing a simple solution of two tablespoons of white, granulated sugar with one tablespoon of water. Bees require carbohydrates from sugars in nectar or honey to convert into much-needed energy.

They also suggest placing the mixture on a spoon within reach of the tired bee. Additionally, they asked readers to share the Facebook post to increase awareness. The post has been shared more than 455,000 times as of Friday morning.

Pollinators like honey bees play a critical role in maintaining healthy ecosystems by pollinating flowering plants, fruits and vegetables. According to the World Wildlife Foundation, more than three-quarters of the world’s food crops are dependent on pollination.

A single bee colony can pollinate approximately 300 million flowers each day, according to Green Peace.

In Canada, pollinators are responsible for one in every three bites of food Canadians eat and $2 billion worth of crops, according to the partnership of agricultural organizations known as Bees Matter.

Although Statistics Canada says the number of honey bee colonies has actually increased 3.6 per cent from 2017 to a record high of 721,106, populations have been in decline in other parts of the world due to the destruction of natural habitats, diseases, and pesticides.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species shows that nearly 24 per cent of Europe’s bumble species are threatened with extinction. In the U.S., honey bee hives have decreased from 6 million in the 1940s to approximately 2.5 million, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Other ways to help:

In addition to feeding bees sugar, the WWF recommends planting pollinator-friendly plants such as, primrose, buddleia, and marigolds. The organization also suggests leaving an area of the garden untended to allow bees to buzz around in the long grass or make nests in compost heaps or hedgerows.

Certain pesticides and chemicals can pose a risk to pollinators, particularly when plants are in bloom. The federal government recommends limiting pesticide use and following pollinator-friendly best practices. These include avoiding crops or weeds where bees may be present and limiting “drift” exposure caused by spraying chemicals.",[]

Skotnicki believes that advertising from the multi-billion dollar personal hygiene industry has encouraged daily cleansing routines that have resulted in 40 per cent of people worldwide finding they have sensitive skin.

A practicing dermatologist for 20 years and the co-author of Beyond Soap, Skotnicki told CTV’s Your Morning that body washes, facial cleansers, and even water can all contribute to skin irritation and aging.

“Our skin is like a brick wall, and the mortar, or our wall, is fats or lipids,” says Skotnicki. “Soap and water, even just water, remove the mortar.”

In order to soothe sensitive skin, stave off signs of aging, or just to get a healthy glow, Skotnicki has some tips for re-thinking personal hygiene.

1. Throw out your products: The average woman applies 16 products to her face before leaving her house in the morning. Many of these products contain irritants, like fragrance and detergents, and they end up doing more harm than good. “Think about ‘less is more,” Skotnicki recommends. Her daily skincare regimen consists solely of SPF and cleansing with micellar water, a mild cleanser diluted with water.

2. Cut down on bathing: Sitting in a bath allows water to erode the skin’s natural protection. Skotnicki recommends limiting baths to under ten minutes and opting for showers whenever possible. She also recommends showering once a day at the most.

3. Focus on the ‘bits’: Getting in the shower and lathering your entire body in soap is completely unnecessary. “Washing your whole body because you think it’s healthy is damaging and it’s probably causing things like allergies and eczema,” Skotnicki says. She says to focus on cleaning parts that are actually dirty or smell, such as armpits and groin. Stick to mild, fragrance-free body washes over bar soap.

4. Skip your morning skincare regimen: Unless you’ve been out all night, Dr. Skotnicki says cleansing your skin in the morning is overkill. A splash of water is sufficient to clean your skin off, and a bit of SPF is the only anti-aging product you need.

5. Let kids be (dirty) kids: Young children are often the most dramatically affected by over-washing. Twenty-five per cent of young people suffer from eczema, a once-rare skin condition that can be caused by washing away the skin’s natural defences. Skotnicki recommends only bathing children several times a week and to avoid sitting them in baths for long periods of time.",[]
656,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/why-you-should-never-wash-your-chicken-1.3952379,"Why chicken should never be rinsed, but rice probably should be",[],2018-05-31 06:00:00-04:00,"If you rinse your raw chicken before you cook it just to be safe, please stop. You’re just making things worse.

Though there are plenty of families and home cooks who insist that step No. 1 when preparing any kind of chicken is to wash it and pat it dry, public health officials say that’s a really bad idea.

Health Canada advises against rinsing meat. The FDA advises against it. U.K.’s Food Standards Agency advises against it. And yet, the message still doesn’t seem to be getting through.

Even years after public messaging campaigns began advising against bringing raw poultry anywhere near a kitchen sink, judging by a recent episode of CTV’s The Social, there are still plenty of home cooks who insist on rinsing off meat before cooking it

Keith Warriner, a food science professor at the University of Guelph, says the problem is that for years, home cooks were told to do just that.

The 1951 edition of the Joy of Cooking advised rinsing out a chicken before roasting it. So did Julia Child on her legendary TV show. Martha Stewart recipes call for it -- in fact many recipes still suggest it. So it’s no wonder home cooks are having a hard time breaking the habit, says Warriner.

“It’s really only been since the ‘90s or the 2000s that public health officials started saying, ‘Oh wait, this is actually more dangerous than we thought.’ So now you just have to de-program people,” he told CTVNews.ca in a phone interview.

Rinsing off meat or poultry is actually pointless, Warriner says, since any bacteria that might be on the meat surface are going to be burned off during cooking anyway. Meanwhile the washing process runs the very real risk of spreading bacteria.

Spray from the tap can “aerosolize” bacteria, and tiny droplets can find their way onto the sink, work surfaces and utensils as far as 50 cm away.

The pathogen that’s of most concern when it comes to chicken is called campylobacter.

“Just 500 cells of campylobacter will give you profuse diarrhea for a week,” he said, adding that not much more is needed for E. coli or salmonella infection either.

To put that into perspective: about 1 billion bacteria can fit onto a single pinhead.

When such a small amount of bacteria is needed for infection, cleaning a sink after rinsing a chicken might not be enough.

“The sink is the hotspot for bacteria in the kitchen,” Warriner said. “Sponges, particularly, harbour huge numbers of bacteria and are magnets for contamination. So when we clean surfaces with these sponges, we just spread them around.”

Rinsing meat isn’t worth the risk, he says, particularly since cooking kills bacteria anyway.

“That’s why we always go back to the point that you don’t need to rinse meat; there’s no benefit,” he says.

FRUITS & VEGETABLES

Okay, well if we shouldn’t rinse meat, what about fruits and veggies? Most of us are told to wash produce under running water before eating or preparing them, but Warriner isn’t convinced it does much good.

If it’s pesticides that worry you, he says there are only trace amounts on most produce anyway and what’s there isn’t likely to come off with a simple rinse. Pesticides sprays are actually designed not to wash off easily.

Yes, there are produce washes and soaps on the market that promise to do better, but Health Canada doesn’t recommend them. It says produce soaps are simply “not necessary.” The U.S. FDA goes even further and advises against such soaps, saying the products are not approved for food use.

Warriner advises rinsing off visible soil on your vegetables, but says you shouldn’twaste your time with packaged salad mixes.

“With bagged lettuce there’s no point in washing it; they’ve already washed it several times during processing and you’re not going to do any better with a little rinse in your kitchen,” Warriner says.

If you are going to rinse fruits and veggies, it should always be done under running water – not by soaking them in a sink, which tends to expose them to even more bacteria.

Fruit should also never be washed before being stored in a refrigerator, say Warriner. Not only will the water speed up decomposition, it could collect in skins and rinds, like those on melons or citrus fruits.

“When you get moisture on it, you’re basically giving microbes like listeria somewhere to grow,” he said.

RICE

What about rinsing rice? Most chefs agree rice should be rinsed before cooking to clear off dust. (The one exception is parboiled rice --also called converted rice – which has already been cleaned.) But another reason chefs advise it? Better rice; rinsing removes surface starch that causes rice to clump together or get gummy.

Others like to soak their rice in clean water for a couple of hours. But the U.S. FDA thinks we should go even further. It says instead of letting rice absorb all the water in a pot, home cooks should use 6 to 10 parts of water for every part of rice, and then drain off the excess after cooking, just like pasta.

That’s because the FDA says it’s concerned about arsenic. Rice absorbs higher levels of arsenic than other foods during growing. Arsenic can build up in our bodies and long-term exposure has been linked to higher rates of bladder, lung and skin cancers, as well as heart disease.

“Published studies, including research by the FDA, indicate that cooking rice in excess water (from six to 10 parts water to one part rice), and draining the excess water, can reduce 40 to 60 percent of the inorganic arsenic content, depending on the type of rice,” it says.

Warriner says he’s not too worried about rice. He says he pre-soaks his rice, which also reduces arsenic, but he isn’t too worried.

“It’s not like you’re going to drop dead because you had a bowl of rice,” he said. “It’s a slow accumulation. That’s why they recommend not having too much rice each week… You need quite a lot of organic arsenic before it does anything.”

The FDA says it recognizes that consumers do not typically prepare rice like pasta and notes that draining off cooking water will reduce vitamin content. It says choosing a diet with many kinds of grains and starches is the best way to reduce arsenic risks.",[]

Hydro companies are reminding homeowners to review the Electrical Safety Authority’s guidelines to avoid electrocution or fires.

CTVNews.ca has rounded up a number of those tips, with help from professional light installer Paul Baluch, of the B.C.-based company Shack Shine.

Check your wires

Experts say you should never take for granted that your lights from last year will be in good enough condition to go up this year. Broken bulbs can be a fire hazard, as can frayed or exposed wires.

“You want to check the wire before you put it up,” Baluch told CTV Vancouver.

The ESA says you should also never run more than three strings of lights off a power cord, and never let connectors rest in puddles, on the ground or in gutters. They also advise against using staples or nails to secure wires in place, because it can damage the wire and create a fire hazard.

“Never remove the third prong on plugs,” the ESA adds. “This ‘grounding pin’ prevents shock in the event of electrical equipment failure.”

Indoor or outdoor

Authorities say it’s important to make sure lights are approved by the Canadian Safety Association, and that they are rated for the appropriate environment. Indoor lights should never be used outside, and outside lights should never be used indoors.

Baluch adds that anyone using laser lights should take care to point them at something, rather than allowing them to shine into the sky.

“Lasers aren’t safe for you to look into, especially when you have kids around,” he added.

Power lines

Avoiding power lines might sound like a no-brainer, but it’s easy to forget they’re there when you see them outside your home every day. The ESA advises people to take a moment to specifically look for power lines before setting up a ladder or arranging lights, so as to avoid any potentially deadly issues.

Ladders

When it comes to using a ladder, Baluch recommends adhering to the simple 4-1 rule: for every four feet you go up, add one foot of distance between the ladder and the wall.

“Never install lights on your own,” Baluch added. “You always want two people on site at all times when you’re installing lights.”

In the American West, many homeowners are simply giving up on their yards. With stringent water bans in place, it’s all but impossible to keep grass green. The state of California, in its fourth year of drought, is even going so far as to offer homeowners rebates if they rip out their lawns.

There are now even landscaping companies in the state that will pull up homeowners’ lawns and install alternative materials, in exchange for cashing in the rebate money and handling all the paperwork.

It’s no surprise that so many municipalities has declared war on lawns. You would be hard pressed to find a thirstier water guzzler than a patch of grass. According to Environment Canada, more than half of residential water use in the summer goes to lawn watering or “landscape irrigation,” and much of that water gets lost to evaporation or run-off.

While there will always be those who enjoy lovingly tending to their lawns, many Canadians are likely wondering why they bother devoting their weekends to the whims of their yards. If you’re thinking about ditching your lawn, here are a few options to consider, from most drastic to least.

Artificial turf

Why slave away at real grass when the fake stuff looks almost as good?

Artificial grass has come a long way since the AstroTurf days of the 1960s. With a softer feel and a more realistic look, artificial lawns can easily be mistaken for the real thing, which may be why they’re popping up in residential yards, commercial green spaces and even municipal areas such as boulevards.

An artificial lawn is more expensive to install than natural grass, but the annual savings from never having to water and fertilize often takes care of the upfront costs. Artificial grass never requires mowing or weeding, lasts 15 years or longer, and can be kept clean with a garden hose or even a vacuum.

Detractors point out that fake turf doesn’t offer the cooling effects of grass, nor a place for insects to thrive. Others have raised concerns about the safety of the turf material and the black “crumbs” sometimes used to hold the lawn down, though no studies have proven the turf present a health hazard. But for the look of a lawn with none of the expense and headache, artificial grass is proving to be a popular alternative.

Paint it green

When a lawn turns brown in the hottest, driest days of summer, it can mean one of two things: either the grass has gone dormant to protect itself, or it’s just plain dead. Either way, the result is a sad landscape that many homeowners can’t stand to look at.

The solution could lie in a simple bottle of paint. Lawn paint is fairly new but already proving popular. The paint is made of a non-toxic, vegetable-based dye that is water-resistant and binds to the grass for 12 weeks or more. It doesn’t hurt the grass, and can be mowed away once the lawn starts growing again.

Companies that will do the lawn spraying for you are sprouting up across the country, but do-it-yourselfers can also buy the paint concentrate, mix it with water and spray it themselves. LawnLift, the biggest lawn paint distributor in Canada says its product dries quickly, is safe for pets, and will not rub off on shoes, clothes or paws.

Rock gardening

Many a frustrated homeowner has thrown up their hands at a dying lawn and declared: “I’m just going to pave over the whole thing.” True, paving is an option, but there are more visually appealing hardscaping options as well.

Dry gardens made of any combination of stone chips, pea gravel, ornamental grasses or succulents can make for a unique and attractive alternative to grass or tarmac. A well-designed rock garden will still absorb rain and provide colour, while requiring much less weeding and maintenance than a lawn.

The downside is that it can be labour-intensive to establish a hardscape garden, as the rocks and gravel need to be hauled in and landscape fabric needs to be laid down to stop the growth of weeds. The stones can also get hot under the mid-day sun and are likely not a practical option for families with small kids.

But there are landscaping companies happy to help and the costs of switching over to a dry garden quickly pays for itself from the money saved by never needing to water or mow again.

Native plants and meadows

Imagine ditching a monochrome green lawn for a field of flowers that attracts bumblebees and butterflies and is sustained only by the sun and the rain.

More and more homeowners are ripping up turf in favour of plants and wildflowers that grow with almost no help at all. While each region of Canada has its own native species, some plants that grow well in most parts of the country include wild strawberry, yarrow, coneflowers and asters.

Establishing a prairie garden can take a bit of work, as invasive weed species will try to move in. But once established over a couple of years, native flower gardens becomes virtually maintenance-free, requiring only an occasional mow-down.

The downside of “natural gardens” is that many cities simply don’t allow them. They have bylaws in place restricting plant height, usually to avoid seed spread, and deter vermin. But many cities are now relaxing these laws to grant certain yards “natural garden” status

Low-maintenance lawn

Finally, for those who are not quite ready to get rid of their lawns but still want to cut back on their water use, there are lots of options to mimic the look of soft grass but with a fraction of the maintenance.

Drought-tolerant grass alternatives include microclover, white clover, creeping red fescue, ryegrasses and sedges. These varieties can either replace a typical lawn completely, or be sown in with regular grass to reduce the water needs of a lawn. Some choices, such as clover, actually add nitrogen to the soil, thereby eliminating the need to fertilize the grass around it.

The downsides of these grass alternatives is the seeds are often hard to find in stores, but can be ordered online. Fescues and ryegrasses are not as soft as turf grass, and while clover is soft, it can also flower and attract bees. But many of these problems can be managed with regular mowings.",[]

The tiny pests are experts at hunting for fermenting produce, and find their way into fruit-filled homes through window screens or cracks in doors.

Also known as drosophila flies and vinegar flies, the bugs can hitch rides on fruits and vegetables from the grocery store.

According to researchers at the University of Guelph, the flies have an average life span of approximately 40 to 50 days. Female flies can lay up to 500 eggs during their short life.

Kendra Mangione has rounded up some advice from experts and amateurs, including her grandmother, on what to do if you have an infestation in your home:

Entomologist's advice

""Don't leave ripe fruit on the counter. If you plan to keep fruit on the counter, wash it as soon as you bring it home,"" Royal Ontario Museum Entomologist Antonia Guidotti told CTVNews.ca.

""This may get rid of any eggs that are already present on the fruit.""

Pest control expert's solution

""Remove garbage as soon as humanly possible, especially in areas like the kitchen,"" pest control specialist Natasha Anderson said.

""If you feel unable to remove the garbage bags on a regular basis, I highly recommend putting offcuts from fresh foods (vegetables, fruits and meat) into a smaller plastic shopping bag. Once you are done preparing the meal, tie up the bag and put that inside your main garbage bin.""

Gardener's tip

""There are herbs that you can bring into your home that will repel them,"" Canada AM's gardening expert Mark Cullen said.

""Take some basil, cut it and put leaves on your bananas (or whatever fruit they're attracted to). The less popular herb tansy has insecticidal properties, and lemon, lemon verbena and citrosa geraniums also work. They don't kill the bugs but repel them.""

Home blogger's recommendation

""Keeping your kitchen clean definitely helps to keep fruit flies away,"" MrsJanuary.com blogger Ashley LeBlanc advised. ""If you do get stuck with them, I've found a red wine trap works best: a little bit of red wine in the bottom of a cup, a piece of Saran wrap over top and holes poked through with a toothpick so they can get in but not out. Works every time!""

Grandma's take

""I think they come from the drain, that's what they tell me anyway. I try to make sure all my drains are closed if I notice any in the house, to keep them from laying eggs,"" CTVNews.ca writer Kendra Mangione's always-right grandmother Ella Morton suggested.",[]

Last week, the island nation’s prime minister, Mia Mottley, revealed that her government is looking at introducing a 12-month “Barbados Welcome Stamp.”

Mottley said the stamp would give visitors the opportunity to “come and work from here overseas, digitally so, so that persons don’t need to remain in the countries in which they are.”

According to the Barbados Government Information Service website, Mottley said the COVID-19 pandemic had made short-term travel more difficult because of requirements for testing for the virus.

As an alternative, the prime minister proposed the idea of travellers coming to Barbados for a lengthier stay, during which, they could continue to work remotely.

“You don’t need to work in Europe, or the U.S. or Latin America if you can come here and work for a couple months at a time; go back and come back,” Mottley said during a speech at the official reopening of a restaurant in the St. Lawrence Gap neighbourhood on July 1.

Even though Barbados is mulling over a one-year “welcome stamp” to visitors, the Canadian government still advises against all non-essential travel outside of Canada until further notice.

“The governments of those destinations that have opened their borders to tourists could impose strict travel restrictions suddenly, should they experience an increase in cases of COVID-19,” an advisory on the Canadian government’s website reads. “International transportation options could be reduced significantly, making it difficult for you to return to Canada.”

Barbados is set to reopen its borders to international travellers on Sunday, July 12.

According to the U.S. embassy in Barbados, the resumption of commercial flights will begin on July 12 with Air Canada, which will run flights to and from the island nation on Thursdays and Sundays.

British Airways, Jet Blue, Virgin Atlantic, and American Airlines will also operate flights to Barbados on dates after July 12.

There will be a number of new health protocols for visitors arriving to the airport in Barbados, including a PCR test for coronavirus, mandatory face mask use, and health screening. Travellers from high and moderate-risk countries, including Canada, will be monitored for the onset of symptoms for seven days.

Even before the borders reopen, Barbados has already started relaxing COVID-19 pandemic measures and lifting curfews.

On June 15, the government lifted restrictions on open hours for beaches and parks. On July 1, physical distancing requirements were reduced to a one-metre distance and all curfew restrictions were cancelled.

According to the U.S. embassy in Barbados and data compiled by John Hopkins University, the Caribbean country currently has 98 confirmed cases of COVID-19.",[]

""There was no trading, no selling and the city streets were dead. They looked the same at 3 p.m. as they did at 3 a.m.,"" said Wayne Fournier, mayor of the town of 1,800 people in Washington state.

""We were getting a lot of calls from businesses saying they were not sure if they would be able to hang on,"" he told AFP.

The town's museum had a printing press, so it was put to use to make US$10,000 worth of bills on wooden rectangles, each nominally worth $25.

They feature a portrait of former president George Washington and bear a Latin inscription that translates as ""We've got it under control.""

The money is being given as a grant to locals who demonstrate they have been economically harmed by the pandemic. Each resident is allowed up to $300 per month.

Known as ""Tenino dollars,"" ""COVID dollars"" or, sometimes, ""Wayne dollars"" after the mayor himself, the bills are traded at almost all shops in the town at a fixed rate equivalent to $1.

The currency is good only inside the town limits.

DESPERATE TIMES

The idea is not new: town officials last tried it during an even worse period of economic devastation, the Great Depression in the 1930s.

A national scarcity of dollars at the time prompted officials in Tenino to print money on spruce bark.

""The concept became 1930s viral,"" Fournier said, with other communities, businesses and chambers of commerce eager to emulate the town's example.

Media attention piqued the curiosity of investors, and over the years the wooden currency became a collector's item sold on eBay and Amazon.

The contemporary version of wooden currency, like the previous edition, aims to help the town through an economic crisis that forced businesses to close nationwide.

""It's more of an advertisement for the town itself,"" said Chris Hamilton, the manager of the town's main grocery store. ""It brings a lot of people into town that may not even know about Tenino and want to check this place out that makes its own money.

""They might stop off here, buy an ice cream or go down the street and buy a hamburger.""

Similar complementary currencies exist elsewhere in the U.S. and Europe, aimed not at replacing the national money but supporting the local economy -- a key distinction since American authorities take a dim view of anyone trying to create a bill to compete with the almighty dollar.

The U.S. Treasury declined to comment on its position regarding local currencies.

Switzerland's WIR system, created in 1934, is considered the oldest local currency in the world, used by thousands of small businesses every day.

RESPONSE TO GLOBALIZATION

Facing an unemployment rate of 11.1 per cent in June -- one of the highest rates since the Great Depression -- American advocates of complementary currencies say now is the time to consider them as a means to help residents.

""The crisis in municipal funding is pushing creativity. Administrators are exploring this concept of issuing their own currency instead of bonds to finance their COVID response,"" said Susan Witt, director of the Schumacher Center for a New Economics.

The research centre developed BerkShares, a currency in circulation since 2006 in the Berkshires region of western Massachusetts, which is distributed by local banks. Witt is advising several U.S. municipalities interested in similar initiatives.

Advocates of local currencies also see them as a bulwark against unbridled globalization.

""People are starting to realize that we went too global, too fast and we lost our local skills,"" said Chris Hewitt, founder of Hudson Valley Current, a currency in upstate New York which operates as a mutual credit system.

Supporters hope to create a nationwide movement.

""If that happens across the country organically, that could be something that helps save us from a serious recession,"" Fournier said.",[]

The Cliffs of Fundy in Nova Scotia and the Discovery Geopark in eastern Newfoundland were both designated UNESCO Global Geoparks Friday by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.

UNESCO says global geoparks are places that offer visitors a glimpse of exceptional geological heritage.

The Cliffs of Fundy Geopark stretches 125 kilometres, from Debert, N.S., to the Three Sisters cliffs past Eatonville, N.S. -- and out to Isle Haute in the Bay of Fundy.

""We have about 40 different geosites along that location. It's not a one-stop shop. You can spend many days visiting our different sites,"" manager Beth Peterkin said.

The site is well known for having the world's highest tides, Canada's oldest dinosaur fossils and stunning landscapes steeped in Mi'kmaq and Acadian legends.

""We are the site where the Pangaea continent split apart 200 million years ago. You can see where the rocks split apart. You can see the different types of rocks. You can see the cliffs, and the clam flats, and the shores,"" Peterkin said.

""At low tide you can walk out on the floor of the Bay of Fundy for a mile or more in many places, but watch the tide, because in six hours and 13 minutes it's going to be 50 feet higher up the shore,"" she said.

Peterkin and others have been working to get the UNESCO designation for the last five years.

Meanwhile staff at the Discovery Geopark, located on the upper half of Newfoundland's Bonavista Peninsula, have been working for the past 13 years to get their designation.

The park contains some of the earliest fossils of animal life, with rock dating back more than a half-billion years.

""You can see really unique geology that is of national and international significance,"" said John Norman, chairman of Discovery Geopark.

""There are some of the oldest complex life fossils on the planet,"" he said.

Many of the fossils are still in place in the rocks, while others have been removed for display in the provincial museum, The Rooms, in St. John's.

The Discovery Geopark now has 10 sites with interpretation, trails and other infrastructure.

""We have dozens of other sites within our geosites inventory that aren't yet showcased to the public,"" Norman said. ""Some of them will never be. Some of them are for research. Some of them are for academic only and others will be showcased to the public as more infrastructure is added.""

There are now 163 global geoparks in 44 countries, and Peterkin said being part of that group provides important exposure.

""People who travel to one geopark will soon learn about the next geopark. We'll be able to reach visitors that we were never able to reach on our own,"" she said.

Norman said the designation puts them on the world stage, especially in Asia and Europe where geoparks are popular.

Cliffs of Fundy and Discovery join three other UNESCO Global Geoparks in Canada: Stonehammer in New Brunswick, Perce in Quebec and Tumbler Ridge in British Columbia.

With Quebec province at the forefront of Canada's coronavirus pandemic, businesses have been reopening cautiously.

Le Monarque, a fashionable restaurant in Old Montreal, reopened its doors just a few days ago -- but not without putting some creative safety measures in place first.

""We wanted to give customers more space,"" chef and owner Jeremie Bastien told AFP. ""But we didn't want to remove tables or put up Plexiglas panels.""

BRINGING WORLDS TOGETHER

So when Le Monarque fired up its ovens a few days ago, it took several steps to ensure social distancing.

The idea of filling some seats with mannequins, thus providing separation between human clients, came from the team behind the Sarah Pacini clothing line, including prominent Quebec menswear designer Philippe Dubuc.

""We wanted to make a stylish, high-end installation because we are bringing two worlds together, those of fashion and gastronomy,"" said Dubuc, adding, ""I think these two worlds have always been close.""

The restaurant's 29 mannequins all sport Sarah Pacini and Philippe Dubuc designs. They are meant to be ""visually beautiful,"" both inspired by and fitting in with their elegant surroundings.

""We are there, of course, to create and market our clothing,"" Dubuc said. ""But we are also there because our job is to make people dream.""

SILENT AUCTION

Nassim Habashi, who was enjoying lunch at Le Monarque, approved, saying, ""I think it's a wonderful idea both to mark the separation between tables and to make the atmosphere much more pleasant, given the current situation.""

At the end of each meal clients are given a gift certificate redeemable in Sarah Pacini and Philippe Dubuc outlets.

Chef Bastien says the partnership has been ""very advantageous"" for both sides. But he stresses that it is about more than just ""creating distance or dressing up the space.""

The idea, he said, was to ""go a bit deeper (and) figure out what we can do to help the people around us who have suffered during the pandemic.""

The mannequins' clothes are not yet for sale. But restaurant patrons will eventually have a chance to take part in a ""silent auction"" and purchase the clothing they see -- with all profits going to charities.",[]

Founded in New York in 1818, Brooks Brothers survived two world wars, the Great Depression and even managed to stay afloat as dress standards eased in the office. But the pandemic pushed it into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection with so many stores closed and, with millions working from home, a crisp suit pushed to the very bottom of shopping lists.

Brooks Brothers will permanently close more than a quarter of its 200 stores.

The retail sector was under severe pressure even before the pandemic. Rival Barneys New York filed for bankruptcy protection late last year. Since COVID-19 began to spread in the U.S, J.Crew,Neiman Marcus,J.C. Penney and other national retail chains have followed suit.

The virus has hollowed out spending in many places and the accelerated the shift to online shopping, mostly to the benefit of big retailers like Walmart, Target and Amazon.com. Stores have begun to open in some parts of the country, but millions of people are still hunkered down at home. There are regions in the U.S. that are now getting hit with a wave of infections and some companies like Apple are shutting down stores again in those areas.

Brooks Brothers said Wednesday that it will continue operations as it restructures and is looking to reopen shops that are not being closed permanently. The company employed 4,000 people in March, before it furloughed about a third of its workers.

Jonathan Pasternak, a bankruptcy lawyer at Davidoff Hutcher & Citron, said that even before the pandemic, Brooks Brothers' store expansion and the cost of making clothes in the U.S. had created a financial burden, but he does not believe the company will disappear.

“The good thing about Brooks Brothers: It's a very strong brand,” he said.

The company has a storied history, dressing at least 40 American presidents, including Abraham Lincoln, who was wearing a Brooks Brothers coat when he was assassinated in 1865. Brooks Brothers' two-button suits were a favourite of President John F. Kennedy.

But its cultural influence has been broad.

Clark Cable wore Brooks Brothers and Jennifer Aniston appeared on the cover of GQ magazine wearing nothing but a red, white and blue Brooks Brothers tie.

The Duck Brand Stuck at Prom Scholarship Contest challenged students around North America to create their best prom outfit out of duct tape.

Lena Hart, who was one of about 400 applicants in Canada and the U.S., spent 146 hours and 12 rolls of tape to create her dress.

""I started by going through past sketchbooks that I had, and I had two prom dresses that I designed,"" said Hart. ""They were my dream prom dresses. So I took those two designs and combined them into one.""

The winner in both dress and tux categories will win $10,000, while the runners up will get $500 and $100-worth of products from the company.

Hart's dress includes dozens of gold tape roses and petals. A video on the company's website shows how she created sheets with the tape to resemble real fabric, and then cut them to shape and taped together the final product.

""I took giant pieces of paper, cut them out and put them on my body to see if they would fit and adjusted them from there, "" said Hart. ""Then I made sheets of duct tape to emulate fabric, cut out those pieces of fabric from the duct tape, and taped them all together. So it's 100 per cent duct tape.""

Hart is up against four other finalists, whose fates will be decided by voting. At the time of this writing, she was in third place with nearly 7,400 votes.

Le Chateau, which operates 129 stores in eight provinces as well as some manufacturing operations, issued the dire warning late Monday as it reported its latest quarterly earnings report. Although the results covered a period before the pandemic, the company also noted the significant effects that being ordered to close all of its stores has had on its business.

""There are material uncertainties that cast significant doubt upon [our] ability to continue as a going concern,"" the company said in a press release accompanying its earnings report.

Those uncertainties predated the pandemic, as the company said it was already in debt and has defaulted on loans. Now, though, the Montreal-based retailer says it needs to obtain new financing to stay afloat.

Although all of Le Chateau's stores had reopened as of last week, the company warned that the pandemic ""will have a material and adverse impact"" on its business and that it does not expect to fully resume normal operations until 2022.

The company said it is in negotiations with its existing lenders and seeking new sources of financing, while also talking to its landlords about possible rent relief. It announced last week that it is manufacturing up to 500,000 hospital gowns as part of a federal contract.

Le Chateau's fourth-quarter results included a sales decline of 6.5 per cent year-over-year, to $175.9 million, despite a significant increase in online sales. The company recorded a net loss of $51.2 million, up from $6.1 million the previous year, which included a $42-million write-off and write-down of long-term assets.

Despite revealing that its entire operation may not be able to survive another year, Le Chateau has not announced plans to close any stores. This is in sharp contrast to how many other clothiers have handled pandemic-exacerbated downturns, as retailers including The Children's Place, Aldo and Reitmans have announced plans to close stores belonging to some of their brands this year. One analyst has suggested that more than 2,500 big-brand store closures could be announced in Canada this year.

The cover is one of four covers for the magazine’s July and August issue, and was revealed this week in a post on the magazine’s Instagram account.

“It’s about mental health,” the caption read. “It’s about time.”

The photo shows a nude model crouched in a bathtub in a larger room decorated in blue and white tile, with two nurses standing above her, dressed in old-fashioned uniforms.

The cover triggered a wave of criticism calling out the “offensive” and “disrespectful” concept.

Comments below the original Instagram post accused the magazine of attempting to “aestheticize” the struggles of mental health by using a mental health institution as a setting for a fashion shoot.

“MENTAL ILLNESS IS NOT AN EDITORIAL CONCEPT,” one Instagram user commented.

Vogue Portugal issued a statement on July 3 saying the cover was intended to “open up the topic of mental health” and spark “discussion.”

The magazine did not address the backlash directly in their statement, or address concerns that the cover was tone-deaf, but said that the issue itself contained interviews with psychologists “and other experts in the field.” They also said the theme of mental health was “not linked to the theme of madness, but instead [was] covered as an aspect of human emotions and behavior.”

They claim the design of the room depicted in the cover was formed after “deep research of hundreds of reportage photographs from some of the most relevant and famous documentarists who have captured mental health hospitals,” confirming that the cover is drawing on the history of mental health institutions for its aesthetic.

“We acknowledge the significance of the topic of mental health and our intention, through visual storytelling, is to shine a light on the important issues of today,” the statement reads.

Advocates say this defence misses the point completely.

Poorna Bell, a journalist and author who has spoken up about mental health advocacy since losing her husband to suicide, said on Twitter that Vogue Portugal’s defence was “unbelievable.

“The discussion has been had,” she wrote. “You’re late to the table and offensive.

“I don’t have patience or time for people and brands that in the face [of] overwhelming upset and evidence around why what they’ve done is problematic, cannot apologize and say they […] will do better.”

Rose Cartwright, cofounder of Made of Millions, a non-profit platform that is dedicated to mental health advocacy, pointed out in a statement Sunday that a fashion magazine is uniquely ill-equipped to comprehend or discuss mental health struggles.

“You could barely design a more perfect engine of mental ill health than Vogue - an advertising machine that finds beautiful ways of lying to women about what will make them happy,” she wrote on Instagram.

She pointed out that “madness” and many issues with mental health develop because people “exist in impossible situations that their minds can't make sense of, or because they've inherited holding patterns from generations of poverty, discrimination and abuse.

“These subjects are tonally off-colour for a brand that's built on luxury.”

The model depicted in the cover, Simona Kirchnerova, initially described it as a “career highlight,” on her Instagram to have been featured on the cover with her actual mother and grandmother playing the nurses.

After the backlash, she issued a statement saying “the model is not in charge of any photo shoot,” and revealing that she had dealt with depression herself in the past.

The other three covers for Vogue Portugal’s “Madness” issue include a woman sitting in a chair in front of a fake beach background, a woman in a voluminous black dress with numerous legs protruding from underneath the skirt, and a pair of hands holding a human heart.",[]

If you've ever wondered what space smells like, a new perfume may answer that for you. A Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign was recently launched for a new fragrance called Eau de Space to bring the smell of outer space back down to Earth.

The fragrance was developed by Steve Pearce, according to Eau de Space product manager Matt Richmond. Pearce is a chemist and the founder of Omega Ingredients, a company focused on the ""creation of the highest quality, provenance driven, natural flavours and ingredients for the food and beverage industry,"" its website says.

Pearce was originally contracted by NASA to recreate the smell in 2008 after he worked on a scent exhibition for which he recreated the smell of the inside of the Mir Space Station, Pearce told CNN.

Using notes from astronauts who described space smelling like ozone, hot metal and fried steak, Pearce used his knowledge of flavour and fragrance chemistry to produce combinations matching those descriptions, he said.

It took Pearce a few weeks to gather the ""right aroma chemicals"" to try out a few ideas before arriving at something he found satisfactory, he said.

The scent was created to help astronauts train before launching in orbit, and it was part of NASA's goal of eliminating any potential surprises astronauts might encounter or experience in space, according to the Kickstarter.

""It's kind of like a smell from a gun, right after you fire the shot,"" Peggy Whitson, an astronaut and former resident of the International Space Station, told CNN in a 2002 interview about the smell of space. ""I think it kind of has almost a bitter kind of smell in addition to being smoky and burned.""

Richmond said that he has struggled to describe how the fragrance smells, adding, ""Astronauts describe the smell as a mix of gunpowder, seared steak, raspberries and rum.""

The company's main goal with Eau de Space is to increase interest in STEM learning for K-12 students through what Richmond called ""experiential education."" He hopes that Eau de Space will start the discussion, with parents, teachers and scientists taking it from there.

Richmond revealed that they are looking into releasing a fragrance called Smell of the Moon based on the excitement around Eau de Space.",[]

Now there are calls for changes to federal support programs to help businesses keep people employed while they continue to navigate challenges posed by the pandemic.

National industry advocate Restaurants Canada wants to see the 75 per cent federal wage subsidy remain available as long as restrictions are in place for businesses, gradually reducing as revenues increase. In May, the subsidy was extended until the end of August.

The organization is also calling on Ottawa to change the requirement for a 30 per cent revenue decline, and instead assess needs on a scale, so that increasing sales while still operating at a loss won't mean a business is cut off.

Steve Huynh and his wife Camy Wong own the restaurant chain Steve's Poke Bar, and would also like to see the changes recommended by Restaurants Canada.

Their family business shut down for four weeks early into the pandemic and has since reopened its eight locations. They rehired staff with the help of the subsidy.

""Our sales are still down but because of the wage subsidy, we're still able to give the hours to our staff that so they can support themselves,"" Huynh said. ""If the wage subsidy went away and our sales are still down, then we have to start looking at questions — Do we cut hours? Do we cut staff?""

At their newest location in New Westminster's Sapperton neighbourhood, which opened in January, they are currently offering online take-out orders and deliveries in place of dining in.

Wong said it's very difficult to operate at a reduced capacity for a prolonged period of time.

""We are definitely hoping to see something where the government can continue supporting all the different small businesses in a way that is proportionate to the situation that they're going through,"" Wong said. ""The one-size-fits-all is not going to be helpful in the long run.""

She said they'd also like to see help for new and newly opened businesses, which don't qualify for current support programs.

No one from Restaurants Canada was available for an interview with CTV News on Sunday, but the organization recently released a survey showing 44 per cent of operators who responded did not apply for the subsidy for at least one of their establishments because they did not meet requirements.

The federal government has previously said the threshold of a 30 per cent revenue drop is being reconsidered. In the meantime, Huynh and Wong are left to wonder what could happen to the people who rely on their family business for their livelihoods.

""All the people that have jobs and have bills and take care of their families that work with us,"" Huynh said. ""How do we take care of them through this COVID-19 with the current rules that we have right now?""",[]

Patty Stop, located near Port Union Road and Lawrence Avenue East, got a highly coveted shout out from Drake on Instagram earlier this week. The rapper posted a photo of one of the shop’s stuffed patties to his 68.8 million followers and the response that followed was incredible, according to co-owner Freddy Gyebi.

“In terms of social media, my followers on my Instagram have been skyrocketing,” Gyebi told CTV News Toronto. “My views have been skyrocketing.”

Gyebi says he’s been friends with Drake for quite some time now, but admits he didn’t actually know the rap superstar would take to Instagram to show his support.

“A couple weeks back he was like ‘yo, I need to try one of your stuffed patties,” Gyebi said.

So the restaurateur made his way to Drake’s mega-mansion on The Bridle Path for a personal patty party.

“Set up the whole shebang, in terms of the lettuce, the tomatoes. I made the stuffed patty for him, he had it, he liked it. Then he had another one, said he liked it. And I didn’t know he was going to post it, I didn’t even know he posted it until one of my friends was like ‘yo he posted it.’”

The post that followed on Monday evening was simple, a stuffed patty on a countertop, tagged @pattystopinc with a head exploding emoji, the ultimate sign of respect.

According to Gyebi, the interest that came next has been immense and is more than welcome following a forced closure due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“We had to shut down,” Gyebi explains. “COVID has definitely taken a toll on the business, but we’re still here, we’re still able to sell our patties to the community.”

In the meantime, the owners started a GoFundMe campaign in an effort to provide food to Toronto’s front-line workers with a goal of serving up 300 meals a week.

And while Gyebi admits that he doesn’t have a culinary background, he and his co-owner Jason Cheddie agree that their product is different because of what goes into it.

“It’s definitely the love we put into it. We put a lot of quality ingredients into our patties. It’s just not your average patty,” Cheddie said. “Everything is homemade. Straight original from our recipes.”

Drake understands that effort, according to Gyebi, and says that’s why an endorsement from the city’s biggest artist is so significant.

“To me, it means a lot. It just shows that, you know, he believes in being Torontonian. He wouldn’t do it if he didn’t like it, that’s the type of person he is,” Gyebi said.

“He’s doing it because he actually likes the product and he believes it in, you know.”

Most noteworthy were a new bonus plan aimed at getting firms to retain workers that have been idle for months, as well as tax cuts for hard-pressed firms in the tourism and hospitality sectors and a new ""Eat Out to Help Out"" discount scheme.

Treasury chief Rishi Sunak said his latest major intervention is aimed at weaning the U.K. economy off emergency measures announced when the country was put into lockdown in March, while at the same time protecting and generating as many jobs as possible during the recession.

""People need to know that although hardship lies ahead, no-one will be left without hope,"" he told socially distanced lawmakers.

So far, Britain has been spared the sharp rises in unemployment seen in the U.S., for example, because of the Job Retention Scheme, whereby the government has been paying the majority of the salaries of workers who were not fired. Some 1.1 million employers have taken advantage of the program to furlough 9.4 million people at a cost to the government of 27.4 billion pounds ($35 billion).

While confirming that it will end in October, Sunak said the government is introducing a new program that could cost a further 9.4 billion pounds if everyone who has been furloughed is given his or her job back. Under this plan, the government will pay companies a 1,000-pound bonus for each employee they take back.

""Leaving the furlough scheme open forever gives people false hope that it will always be possible to return to the jobs they had before,"" he said. ""The longer people are on furlough, the more likely it is their skills could fade, and they will find it harder to get new opportunities.""

The government hopes employers will make use of the new program as they try to get back on track during what is a historically savage recession -- in March and April alone, the U.K. economy shrank 25%. Many economists think unemployment could more than double to over 3 million this year, to levels last seen in the 1980s.

Anneliese Dodds, the economics spokesperson for the main opposition Labour Party, said Sunak should have made the Job Retention Scheme more flexible rather than scrapping it outright.

""It should have been the day when the millions of British people worried about their jobs and future prospects had a load taken off their shoulders,"" she said.

Sunak reserved extra support for tourism and hospitality, which were shut down during the lockdown. Pubs and restaurants, for example, only reopened Saturday for the first time in over three months.

Sunak said firms within those sectors will see taxes on sales of food and non-alcoholic drinks as well as on accommodation and admission to attractions slashed to 5% from 20%. This measure, Sunak said, is worth 4 billion pounds and should help companies support 2.4 million jobs.

He also announced a new dining discount plan for August that will give people a 50% discount at participating restaurants, cafes and pubs between Monday and Wednesday up to a maximum 10 pounds per person.

U.K. Hospitality, which represents the sector, said the measures provide many firms ""much-needed help to get going again in earnest.""

However, Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the umbrella Trades Union Congress, said Sunak should have given low-paid workers a pay increase rather than offering ""a dining out discount for the well-off.""

Other measures announced included 2 billion pounds to fund work placement schemes for 16-to-24-year-olds, a 3 billion-pound environmental package and the temporary elimination of a tax on house purchases below 500,000 pounds.

Make U.K., which represents companies in the manufacturing sector, praised Sunak's ""bold intent"" and singled out the training measures for the young.

""This is not the beginning of the end of this crisis, however, but perhaps the end of the beginning as far as the economy is concerned,"" Chief Executive Stephen Phipson said.",[]

Across Pakistan's ""mango belt"" in Punjab and Sindh provinces, farmers say a long winter and changing rain patterns have slashed production by up to half this year -- just as virus shutdowns sparked border restrictions and spiralling export costs.

""There are multiple problems that mango farmers are facing,"" said Rana Muhammad Azim, whose family has been producing the fruit in Punjab for generations.

""The situation is extremely worrisome for us. The mangoes are ready, but no exporter is willing to take the risk and place orders,"" he said, adding that he was already suffering from a 40 percent decline in the harvest.

Pakistan produced more than 1.5 million tonnes of mangoes in 2019 -- and exported a record 115,000 tonnes worth $80 million -- making it the sixth-largest exporter of the fruit in the world.

But Waheed Ahmed, head of a produce association in Pakistan, said exports have dropped around 40 percent compared to the same period last year, with just a few months left of the season.

Known in South Asia as the ""king of fruits"", the mango originated in the Indian subcontinent with two dozen varieties grown in Pakistan.

The country's most treasured variety is the greenish-yellow Chaunsa, known for its rich, unique flavour and juicy pulp.

The fruit also helps sweeten diplomatic relations, with Pakistan sending crates of its best produce to India's prime minister every year, regardless of the political climate between the hostile neighbours.

It has also earned a place in recent literary history, with renowned Pakistan author Mohammed Hanif longlisted for the prestigious Man Booker Prize for ""A Case of Exploding Mangoes"", a comic novel based on an unexplained 1988 plane crash that killed former president Muhammad Zia ul-Haq.

ROTTING FRUITS

With much of the world's air traffic grounded by the coronavirus, exports of the best prime, ripe fruit by plane to the US and Europe have been particularly hard hit, but ground transport has also been badly affected.

Dozens of trucks piled high with the yellow fruit were stranded at the border with Iran last month, their precious cargo rotting in the searing 40-degree heat.

Even where trading has continued via sea to the key Middle East market -- which accounts for 70 percent of exports -- demand has plunged.

Since the virus took hold shoppers are making fewer outings to supermarkets and are wary of spending on luxury items, while Pakistani migrant workers who relish the fruit have returned home.

The domestic market brings far less revenue.

In one bright spot, harvests were at least spared the ravages of the worst locust plague in 25 years, which wiped out entire vegetable and cotton harvests.

As flights resume and border restrictions are eased, growers hope to increase exports in the second half of the season to avoid a complete lost season.

""The situation has forced us to think of new solutions,"" said producer Muhammad Ali Gardezi, who for the first time has taken his business online, delivering door-to-door in the age of social distancing.",[]

Some say aliens have,['Jen Rose Smith'],2020-07-09 08:57:00-04:00,"Erich von Däniken dried his sweaty palms with granite dust as he scaled the Great Pyramid of Giza, crawling block by block up the nearly 4,000-year-old monument.

It was 1954, when you could still climb the pyramids. Von Däniken, a 19-year-old with a Catholic education and a passion for flying saucers, was captivated. Fourteen years later, he published an influential book called ""Chariots of the Gods,"" arguing that extraterrestrials influenced ancient sites, the pyramids included.

The magnificent Giza Pyramids are among the world's most famous ancient places, part of a sprawling UNESCO World Heritage Site that brings travelers to Egypt from across the globe.

Visitors come to explore hidden burial chambers, go eye-to-eye with the mysterious Sphinx and take in the sheer scale of Egypt's grandest monuments.

Von Däniken proposed that aliens offered technological help in building them.

WHAT THE SCIENTISTS SAY ABOUT THESE FAMOUS PLACES

Mainstream archeologists disagree with Von Däniken, retorting that ancient Egyptians developed their remarkable building tradition with no help from extraterrestrials.

But while scientists are generally united in rejecting the aliens idea, sometimes known as ""ancient astronaut theory,"" Von Däniken's ideas have endured.

He went on to write 32 additional volumes, selling more than 63 million copies. Penguin Random House, his publisher, claims Von Däniken is ""arguably the most widely read and most-copied nonfiction author in the world.""

And the pyramids aren't the only UNESCO site swept up in his theories, or in those of people he's inspired.

Some speculate that the UNESCO site of Teotihuacan, where the Aztec kings once ruled near modern-day Mexico City, could have been a space port, pointing to mica and liquid mercury found among the ruins that they say are anachronistic.

For travellers, Teotihuacan is a glimpse into an ancient, mysterious empire. Researchers believe the city predates even the Aztecs, who were living there when Europeans first arrived in Mexico.

Archeologists, who have carried out painstaking excavations here for centuries, see it as the crowning achievement of a little-known -- but earthbound -- civilization.

Instead of peering up toward space, they dig into the ground. Archaeologists have spent years excavating a tunnel at Teotihuacan, which leads to chambers full of ritual offerings that some believe symbolize the underworld.

Nearly 3,000 miles away is another enigmatic UNESCO site that draws travellers, researchers and alien enthusiasts alike.

At the Nazca Lines geoglyphs in Peru, visitors take sightseeing flights to view earthen shapes that are too massive to appreciate from ground level. For decades, some have conjectured that the shapes are some sort of ancient airport.

Peruvian scientists agree that the Nazca Lines are mysterious, but believe they are linked instead to rituals and water.

In recent years, researchers have used satellite imagery to discover more than 140 additional geoglyphs, carefully poring over data to find patterns in the landscape.

""They were not drawn by aliens, that's for sure,"" expert Javier Puente told CNN.

TEACHING AN ALTERNATIVE TO ANCIENT ASTRONAUTS

Archeologist Sarah Parcak teaches a seminar on debunking archeological myths and hoaxes at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.

In the class, she pushes back on theories about ancient aliens like those proposed by Von Däniken. She sees it as important work.

""The belief that aliens built the pyramids, or in fact any ancient monument, is deeply racist,"" Parcak says. It's no coincidence that alien theories focus on places home to black, brown and Indigenous people, she notes.

Not only that, Parcak thinks that aliens are a distraction from the real wonders of archaeology. ""It's not a mystery, it's a puzzle. And puzzles take time to put together,"" says Parcak.

One example of Parcak's step-by-step detective work is the city of Itjtawy in Egypt. It was missing for thousands of years, but Parcak found it by analyzing satellite images and NASA topography data.

Sometimes, piecing together archeological puzzles feels personal.

At Parcak's very first excavation, in the Egyptian Delta site of Mendes, she made a discovery that's fresh in her mind more than 20 years later.

""I found an intact pot that was kind of mashed, but we put it back together,"" she recalls. On the handle, Parcak could make out a clear fingerprint left behind in once-wet clay.

""In that moment, I could imagine the person who made it,"" she says. ""It kind of helps us to bridge the divide between past and present and create a sense of empathy.""

Parcak's work offers a personal contact with the past, but you don't need an archeology degree to connect with the ancient world.

On UNESCO-listed Easter Island, travelers can learn how ancient islanders cooked in earthen ovens and built stone-walled gardens. (Easter Island is a favorite with alien theorists, too. Archaeologists chalk up the island's remarkable stonework to Polynesian ingenuity.)

At the temple of Dendera, part of a sprawling UNESCO site in Upper Egypt, visitors follow vivid stories and myths on brilliant wall paintings. (Dendera? Also popular with alien theorists, who interpret one wall painting as proof the ancient Egyptians had electric light bulbs. Researchers say the painting is of a pillar and a lotus flower.)

WHY LEARNING ABOUT ANCIENT HUMANS MATTERS

Learning about ancient humans is fun, but Parcak says it's important, too. For travellers and researchers alike, exploring the ancient world can shed light on the present day -- and maybe the future.

In early April, Parcak was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship to write a book about collapse and resilience in the ancient world. Coronavirus, she says, has lent a new urgency and relevance to the work.

""It's like everything we study is happening in real time,"" she says. Now, she hears echoes of ancient strife whenever she turns on the news. ""The headlines we're seeing, it's like they could be archeology articles.""

For Parcak, though, visiting these ancient sites can be a source of hope. Itjtawy, the ancient city Parcak discovered using satellite imagery, is an example.

It became the capital of the Egypt after a period of widespread political instability, civil war and drought. The Old Kingdom, whose rulers built some of the greatest pyramids, had fallen.

But as power structures shifted, greater economic equality emerged. And from tomb decor to storytelling, Parcak says the area she studies represents a flourishing after chaos.

""I'm not saying it's always rosy,"" she cautions. ""But the site itself is a real symbol of what can happen after great turmoil.""",[]

Stephanie Levitz, The Canadian Press





OTTAWA -- A new poll suggests turbulence ahead for airlines seeking public support for their current COVID-19 plans.

Seventy-two per cent of Canadians surveyed by Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies say they're not comfortable flying since a decision by some airlines to relax their own in-flight physical distancing requirements.

As of July 1, Air Canada and WestJet both ended policies blocking the sale of adjacent seats.

The measure was seen to align with a guidance document for the aviation industry issued by Transport Canada in April to help curb the spread of COVID-19.

Among other things, the department had suggested passengers should be widely spaced when possible, though they did not make it mandatory.

Airlines, however, are required to make passengers and air crews wear masks.

Only 22 per cent of those surveyed said they're comfortable getting aboard with no in-flight physical distancing and a requirement to wear masks.

There's more to it to keep flights safe, WestJet said in a statement last week after critics attacked its plan.

“What makes an airplane, and the entire journey, safe is the layers of enhanced cleaning, the wearing of masks and the hospital-grade HEPA filters that remove 99.999 per cent of all airborne particles,” the airline said.

“The hygiene standards we have now are world-class and backed by industry experts.”

Critics have also previously pounced on the airlines for another move: refusing to fully refund tickets for flights cancelled due to the pandemic.

Thousands of people have beseeched Transport Minister Marc Garneau to compel airlines to issue refunds, but he has refused, arguing that mandating reimbursements from a sector that's lost more than 90 per cent of its revenue would cripple the industry.

But 72 per cent of those polled say they totally oppose his decision.

In lieu of refunds, the airlines have offered vouchers but the poll suggests that it may take a while before people will rebook previously cancelled trips: 85 per cent of those surveyed told pollsters they have no plans to travel outside the country by the end of the year.

The survey polled 1,517 people and can't be assigned a margin of error because online polls are not considered truly random.

Pollsters were in the field between July 3 and 5, a historically popular few days for Canadians and Americans to be on the move between the two countries, given the July 1 Canada Day holiday and the U.S.'s July 4 Independence Day.

But the border remains closed to non-essential traffic, and the majority of Canadians surveyed said they feel it needs to stay that way. The current mutual closure agreement is due to expire July 21.

Of Canadians polled, 86 per cent said they totally disagreed with re-opening the border at the end of July, allowing Americans back into the country.

Americans seem more eager both to head north and to welcome Canadians south; 50 per cent agreed the border should re-open and 36 per cent disagreed.

The potential for cross-border transmission of the virus has been a key factor in the decision to keep the border closed. Currently, rates of COVID-19 infection in the U.S. continue to climb, while in Canada the curve appears to be on a downward trajectory nearly everywhere.

Still, the survey suggests Canadians don't feel they are out of the woods. Thirty-nine per cent believe the worst is yet to come, while 35 per cent believe the worst of the crisis has passed.

In the U.S., 42 per cent of those surveyed felt the darkest days are ahead, 25 per cent believe the U.S. is in the middle of the worst part now while 21 per cent think that's already passed.",[]
681,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/lifestyle/simple-design-steps-can-take-your-garden-to-the-next-level-1.5003509,Simple design steps can take your garden to the next level,['John Raby'],2020-06-28 15:43:00-04:00,"CHARLESTON, W.VA. -- The flower beds are finished, the vegetables are growing, and yet something could be missing from the backyard landscape: That “wow” factor.

Adding a personal touch to the lawn and garden doesn't have to be complicated or break the family budget. Homeowners can transform an ordinary looking landscape with some imagination, design, and perhaps the help of a local agriculture extension service, landscape professional or private nursery.

“A garden is really never finished,” said Jonathan M. Lehrer, chairman of the Department of Urban Horticulture and Design at Farmingdale State College on Long Island, New York. “Sometimes the most difficult thing is kind of taking that plunge and deciding you're going to develop an area or start a project.”

Some ideas that gardeners can use to start taking their yards to another level:

THE STARTING POINT

An arbour, pergola, lattice - even posts with netting wrapped around them - will grab attention, especially at a yard's entrance. It also adds height where homeowners normally think only about length and width, Lehrer said.

Adding clematis, climbing roses or honeysuckle along them will provide long periods of blooms.

Arbors decorated with lights can also define garden rooms and set up views to the space beyond, inviting exploration, said Katharine Pinney, a landscape contractor and designer in Los Angeles.

“Use them to lead your visitor through the garden,” Pinney said.

THE PATHWAY TO SUCCESS

A path with mulch, gravel, brick, pavers or flagstone with edging will encourage a stroll.

Pinney said the simpler the path's route, the better. But Lehrer suggests avoiding a straight, linear pathway.

“Trying to use more curves, twists and turns, that kind of adds the illusion of a longer length than it might be, that mystery of what might be around the next corner,” he said.

Pinney said the choice of pavers should reflect the architectural style of the house. But mixing materials, such as brick and flagstones, adds visual interest.

“In short, use your imagination!” Pinney said.

Placing decorative pots loaded with flowers along the way will create a focal point and add colour.

PLACES TO REST

Benches and tables are a must for homeowners wanting to make their yards a hangout. Having limited room shouldn't be a deterrent.

Pinney said she designs numerous small gardens because the old bungalow neighbourhoods in her area have narrow but deep lots.

“Dividing that narrow space into rooms makes the garden seem larger,” she said.

Pinney and Lehrer suggest building a fire pit, a cooking area, or a place for dining or simply to enjoy morning coffee.

GET PERSONAL

Pinney suggests incorporating items that reflect the homeowner's personality. One of her clients loved wine and held tastings with friends. Pinney said she planted wine grapes for the customer and used old wine bottles from restaurants to border a path.

Old brick from another customer's 1920s bungalow was incorporated into the border of an outdoor groundcover “rug.”

“A homeowner should think about what would make the garden a reflection of their personality and interests,” Pinney said.

Due to the coronavirus pandemic, Lehrer added, “I've seen people that are not going to be going to the beach. “So they're creating pool areas, adding inexpensive holiday lights and lanterns and bringing music outside.”

TIMBERRR!

Landscaping timbers can create tiered walls and stairs to bridge elevation levels in the backyard while creating more planting beds in between. They're also great for creating individual planters. Timbers are available in both natural and synthetic types.

Pinney said treated lumber secured with timber screws is best for terraces, but not for vegetable gardens.

AGREE TO TREE

Depending on the climate and sun requirements, consider planting small trees along the edges.

Japanese tree lilacs and crape myrtles provide vibrant summer colour. Trees with spring blooms include redbuds, white and pink dogwoods, flowering crabapples, ornamental pears and star magnolias. To get the earliest spring blooms, consider planting forsythias.

For northern climates, Lehrer strongly suggests the cornelian cherry dogwood. It has yellow flowers in the spring and red cherry-like fruit in late summer and early fall. The leaves turn red and orange in the fall, and as the tree ages, the outer bark peels, revealing a orange-brown colour.

“It's a four-season plant that is extremely tough,” he said.

WINGED FRIENDS

A big garden bonus is a visit from a butterfly or hummingbird. Plants that produce nectar and pollen can lure them in.

The 4-H Children's Garden at Michigan State University includes a butterfly house that is open in the spring. Education co-ordinator Jessica Wright said attracting butterflies means having compatible plants for the caterpillars they begin as. These can include fennel, dill and milkweed. Other flowering plants can act as butterfly magnets.

Among the plants that attract hummingbirds are bleeding hearts, cardinal flower, impatiens and petunias. Both butterflies and hummingbirds are drawn to bee balm, butterfly bushes and zinnia. Birds and butterflies do require water, so consider adding feeders or a bird bath.

“The interaction with nature is the next level,” Wright said. “It's great to see them enjoying your garden as well.”",[]

In past years, the Niagara Region grower had no trouble selling to wholesalers by the thousands.

""Now we're just composting,"" VanZanten said. ""Since my kids are home every afternoon, they have to spend two hours throwing out the flowers that have bloomed out.""

Sales are down 30 per cent for the year and Easter came and went at the height of physical distancing measures. The uncertainty facing the industry as Mother's Day approaches -- ""you could liken it to Christmas for every other retailer"" -- and the critical spring planting season dawns are even more worrisome.

""If this goes till June we will most likely be at 70 per cent,"" he said of year-over-year revenue loss. ""My overdraft is maxed out at the bank. Obviously they're wondering when I'm going to start drawing that back, and I can't since I haven't sold anything.""

VanZanten is one of thousands of flower farmers across the country concerned about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Demand for non-perishable items pushed decorative plants out of the supply chain in last month's stockpiling frenzy, while the ongoing shutdown of garden centres in jurisdictions including Ontario and New York has cut off critical points of sale, threatening to leave growers high and dry.

""This is when we sell. We're on the cusp of a critical period,"" said James Farrar, director of the Canadian Ornamental Horticulture Alliance.

Trees, bushes and bedding plants are usually planted between May 1 and June 15, he said, with customers ranging from backyard gardeners to municipalities.

In Ontario, flower producers discarded about 40 per cent of their Easter crop, according to Flowers Canada Growers.

The province has designated garden centres as a non-essential service -- a painful exclusion for the industry, since nearly two-thirds of Canadian production stems from Ontario. Neighbouring New York and Ohio have also forced garden centres to lock their doors, while Michigan and Vermont have banned retailers from selling non-essential products, including home gardening items.

""If they don't open, the damage is going to be astronomical,"" said trade group head Andi Kuyvenhoven, noting garden centres' crucial role for bedding plants in particular.

British Columbia -- the second-biggest flower and plant producer -- Alberta and Manitoba and have allowed garden centres to keep running, while Quebec deemed them essential along with nurseries as of April 15, though not in time for Easter.

Kuyvenhoven, who with his wife co-owns a $2.5-million business selling potted Chrysanthemums and indoor calla lilies -- largely to U.S. distributors -- on a pair of farms west of Toronto, says clogged supply chains south of the border remain a problem.

""U.S. customers for a time closed their distribution systems to floral and so the main grocery chains were not purchasing plants,"" he said, which was hard on growers of cut flowers such as roses and tulips.

""If a truck can take 24 skids and four skids were flowers, the flowers came off the trucks and they put more food on the truck -- which we completely understand. The only challenge is, when you're growing flowers as we do, they also have a shelf life,"" said Kuyvenhoven, who bought his business from his parents in 1990.

""Now we're now facing liquidity issues...I haven't slept in five weeks.""

Flowers Canada Growers says exports to the U.S. make up about one-third of greenhouse flower and plant sales, which hit $1.6 billion in 2018, according to Statistics Canada. Nursery sales topped $500 million.

While garden centres can continue to operate across much of the continent, growers wonder whether bouquets and flower pots will remain on the shopping list of consumers struggling to make rent amid soaring unemployment numbers and a looming recession.

Kuyvenhoven is hoping that families confined to their homes for most of the day will choose to spend what they've saved from unpurchased vacations and lattes on plants for their vases and flower beds.

""That's part of what's carried us through downturns in the past,"" he said.

Growers associations are in talks with federal and provincial governments over potential financial relief, with Flowers Canada Growers asking for a ""cash injection"" as well as extended debt repayment plans secured in part by Ottawa, Kuyvenhoven said.

So far, the federal government has extended a stay of default for eligible farmers until Oct. 31, giving flower and potted plant producers an extra six months to pay off federal loans that would have been due at the end of April.

Ottawa has also granted exemptions on air travel restrictions to temporary foreign works and invested $50 million to help farmers fly in labourers on charter trips. ""New flights are being booked ever day,"" the agriculture department said in an email.

Back at the greenhouse, VanZanten mulls the overripe lilies and orchids.

""Flowers do make you happier, they do actually lift your spirits...but there are farms that can't bounce back from this,""

he said.

""This all happened at the wrong time.""

The doors of Golden Acre Home and Garden in Calgary are allowed to be open as an essential service in Alberta, but there are ample warnings about social distancing.

A steady stream of customers, many of them wearing face masks, walk through the store even though spring bedding plants aren't ready and the selection of seeds and flowers is somewhat limited.

Zannis said having an online presence puts his greenhouse on less shaky ground than many others.

The business has sent products to as far away as Nunavut and Nova Scotia in recent years but will be focusing primarily on the Calgary market now.

Online orders are up by 2,000 per cent from a year ago, Zannis said. But it's not a gold mine.

""It's very expensive to operate. Now you have to pay somebody to go and do the shopping,"" he said.

""But the online store has kind of kept us afloat ... We're just trying to survive, honestly. I just want to survive this year.""

In addition to Alberta, Manitoba, British Columbia and Quebec have designated garden centres as an essential service. Other provinces, including Ontario, have forced them to keep their doors closed.

""We are allowed to offer pickup at the curb, so we are doing that,"" said Mary Reid, owner of Green Thumb Gardening Centre in Nepean, Ont.

""A customer would either phone or email us what their order is, then we'd get it ready and say you can come and get it.""

Reid said she has basically had to start online orders from scratch but isn't able to do e-commerce.

She hopes gardeners will still be keen to shop when restrictions are eased.

""It's not a pretty picture at all ... it depends on how far into lockdown we get.""

The executive director of the Canadian Garden Council, the national umbrella body for provincial and national garden organizations, said there's been a huge increase in the number of Canadians who want to start gardening.

Michel Gauthier said it's a struggle for centres that have to stay closed.

""A lot of growers and greenhouses are having issues. Right now, there's a big movement to say horticultural products are essential and should be essential for the well-being of people,"" he said.

""We're saying ... if we want people to have that gardening experience and spend some time in their garden, then they need to have access to the material and access the product.""

Don Vanderwerf said it's almost like business as usual at his Kel-Lake Greenhouses in Kelowna, B.C.

Demand for seeds, soil and vegetables has been strong, he said.

Peak gardening season begins in three weeks to a month. Vanderwerf said products will be spread out on benches and into the parking lot at his site.

Still, Vanderwerf is expecting a financial hit. He's already losing business in flower baskets for hotels and restaurants.

""We'll be down a bit. But I feel fortunate that I'm not owning a restaurant or a pub, because they're hurting.""

As spring's arrival in the Northern Hemisphere coincides with government stay-at-home orders, the itch to get outside has turned backyard gardens into a getaway for the mind in chaotic times.

Gardeners who already know that working with soil is a way to connect with nature say it helps take away their worries, at least temporarily.

""I love to see things grow,"" Lindsay Waldrop said. ""It's incredibly therapeutic.""

Now more than ever.

Waldrop, a resident of Anaheim, California, has an anxiety disorder. Exercise is supposed to help, but her new job as a college biology professor had prevented her from getting into a routine.

Her grandfather, who introduced her to gardening by showing her how to plant seeds, died about a year ago.

Add the global coronavirus pandemic to all that, and it's easy to see where her focus is these days.

""Sometimes I just like to sit and dig holes in the quiet with my own thoughts,"" she said. ""Outside, it takes my mind off. It gives something for my hands to do. It gives you a separate problem to think about than whatever else is going on. It gets you off of social media.""

Waldrop and her husband moved last summer from New Mexico, where she didn't have much luck gardening in a scorching climate. At her new home, she got rid of the lawn, installed an irrigation system, and recently planted dozens of tomatoes, eggplant, peppers and other vegetables.

Over the years, Waldrop converted her skeptical husband, who initially wondered why digging in the dirt and moving things around was considered fun.

After tasting his first home-grown tomatoes, he was converted.

Families, too, are discovering that gardening gives cooped-up kids something to do, builds their self-esteem and brings variety to what has suddenly become a lot of time spent together.

In Miami, Annika Bolanos isn't a fan of the south Florida heat and mosquitoes. But going outdoors lately has been a lifeline.

Bolanos works at home making cakes and doing bookkeeping with her husband's golf cart business. Her three young children add an extra layer of busy, and together they've seeded a variety of vegetables and herbs.

""We have always loved the idea of growing our own food,"" Bolanos said. ""It feels good to eat something that you grew yourself too. It also helps my kids eat more fruits and veggies since they find it cool to eat what they have grown.""

Her children water the plants daily and concentrate on what's growing.

""You're feeling the sun and the breeze and don't have to worry about anything in the moment,"" Bolanos said.

In Britain and Germany, there's a premium on allotments -- popular parcels of land rented for growing food crops.

""Those with a garden are the lucky ones,"" said Heidi Schaletzky, standing on the lawn beneath a cherry tree in the north of Berlin.

Schaletzky and her husband have been cultivating a plot in the ""Free Country"" community garden for the past eight years, growing strawberries, salad greens and kohlrabi. So far, access to garden plots remains exempt from restrictions intended to stop the spread of the virus in Germany.

""We'll be able to see other people, too,"" she said. ""As long as they stay on their side of the fence.""

As the weather warms, garden shops are bustling as other businesses shut during the outbreak.

At the Almaden Valley Nursery in San Jose, California, rose expert John Harp has seen a mix of new gardeners and regulars. Customers can't come into the shop, so their online orders are brought to their vehicles in the parking lot.

""Around town everyone is gardening right now,"" Harp said. ""They're looking to be a little bit more self-sufficient.""

This home-grown attitude goes back to World War II, when millions of people cultivated victory gardens to protect against potential food shortages while boosting patriotism and morale.

Hollie Niblett, who lives near Kansas City, Kansas, hopes the victory gardens come back. Niblett, who has a degree in horticultural therapy, tends to a kitchen garden near her backdoor, perennial flowers, flowering trees and shrubs, and upper and lower grassy yards connected by a path through an area left in its natural condition.

""There are so many things about it that feed my soul,"" she said. ""Right now, more than anything, my garden gives me hope, gives me purpose and provides a sense of connection to something bigger than myself.""

For beginners, wonderment awaits. Just south of Atlanta, 10-year-old Ezra Gandy's love for playing baseball has been paused. He and his grandmother, Melanie Nunnally, recently started an outdoor garden, planting strawberries, cabbage, broccoli, kale and asparagus.

""I like digging in the dirt because I like to see all the bugs and stuff that's in the ground,"" he said.

The non-profit group KidsGardening.org suggests that children grow their own salads or do other activities.

The virus scare could even usher in a new crop of gardeners who start from seed rather than risk the crowds buying starter plants.

Kendra Schilling of Scott Depot, West Virginia, doesn't have space for a sprawling garden, so she's planting potatoes in a bucket and trying to figure out with her teenage daughter what to do with other vegetable seeds.

""I usually go buy the plants and stick them in the dirt. But this year we're going to try to do the seeds,"" she says. ""Thank God for YouTube.""

Allan']",2020-01-28 11:14:00-05:00,"Researchers have figured out which plant species bumblebees prefer to include in their diets, providing advice to those wishing to help with bee conservation efforts.

During the summer months of 2015 to 2016, authors captured bumblebees on more than 100 plant species across more than 400 plots in the Plumas National Forest in California -- a mountainous, meadowy area with wildlife habitats near running water, where bumblebees are abundant.

The findings, published Tuesday in the journal Environmental Entomology, revealed that the most popular plant species among the bees were Oregon checker-mallow and mountain pennyroyal flowers.

Many plants rely on bees as natural pollinators to produce some of nature's most nutritious foods. However, species of North American bumblebees have significantly declined in population in recent decades. Between April 2015 and April 2016, beekeepers in the US lost 44 per cent of their colonies.

Jerry Cole, lead author of the research and biologist at the Institute for Bird Populations in California, said there are a few potential reasons behind the declines: competition with other insect species, transfer of parasites from honey bees to bumble bees, loss of floral resources, or a mismatch between the phenology of plant species and the phenology of bumblebee species.

Phenology is defined by how plants and animals function in their environments in different seasons. Making sure the two are in sync is important, as our food supply depends on the timing of phenological events.

""Determining bumblebee species' plant selection is important for retaining and promoting high quality plant resources that will help populations persist,"" the authors said.

The plants bumblebees prefer

The authors assessed the five most abundant bumblebee species' plant selection by comparing the plants they used to what was available. Although they captured bees on more than 100 plant species, just 14 of them were chosen the most.

Each bumblebee species selected a different group of flowers, even though the bees were foraging across the same plots.

""It's important to consider the availability of plants when determining what's selected for by bees,"" Cole said. ""Often studies will use the proportion of captures on a plant species alone to determine which plants are most important to bees.""

""Without comparison to how available those plants are, you might think a plant is preferentially selected by bees, when it is simply very abundant.""

The selections by the five species remained constant over the study period, suggesting that maintaining, seeding or planting with those plant species could benefit the health of the bees, the authors said.

The most abundant species of bumblebees found was Bombus vosnesenskii, or, the yellow-faced bumblebee. And the plant species used most by that species was large-leaved lupine.

A. urticifolia, a flowering plant in the mint family, was the plant most strongly selected by three of five bumblebee species surveyed. Other commonly selected flowers included thickstem asters and Ryderberg's penstemon, a flower in the snapdragon family.

Yellow-faced bumblebees tend to stay consistent with their preference even when other plants become more available in different seasons.

Bumblebees don't necessarily have natural preferences, but will decide based on the quantity or quality of the nectar or pollen available, and how easily they can be accessed. Other factors driving bumblebee flower use include the length of their tongue, flower symmetry and color preference.

Though the researchers found certain plant species were more popular among bumblebees than others, they say their results ""should be interpreted with caution because they didn't record whether plants were being used as pollen sources versus nectar sources.""

There are other factors important to maintaining the health of bees, including the presence of other pollen sources and weather variations.

Bees and marijuana

A different group of researchers from New York recently found that cannabis crops are also proving beneficial to declining bee populations -- specifically, large numbers of 16 different species of bees thriving among recently-planted cannabis plants.

Marijuana crops are helpful to bee populations in that they don't require one of the main farming practices that is a threat to bees today: insecticides.

""As an exclusively wind-pollinated crop, hemp lacks nectar but produces an abundance of pollen during a period of floral dearth in agricultural landscapes,"" said the report published in the Oxford University Press.

Because of its unique flowering phenology, hemp can potentially provide nutrition to bees during a period of floral scarcity. In a time when cannabis is a rapidly expanding crop in the U.S. agricultural landscape, ""growers, land managers and policy makers should consider its value in supporting bee communities and take its attractiveness to bees into account"" when developing pest management strategies with the health of bees in mind, the report said.

Your backyard

The small group of preferred plant species the authors identified in the new study provide a helpful start for conservationists wanting to seed and restore habitats for bees in regions similar to the study's.

In that California region, plant blooming peaked during the summer each year, but Cole said that when planting, it's important to stagger the species you grow and plant a variety so that bees can have well-rounded food resources throughout the year.

""It wouldn't hurt to plant some of the species we identify here in your home garden,"" Cole said. ""But the way that these plants are beneficial are not just on their own. You have to have a nice complement of plants that provide food resources throughout the season and not just at one point in the season.""

Use of different plants by bees can also change between years if there are changes in what's available and when the plants are blooming.

""Maintaining, seeding or planting these 'bumblebee plants' while managing the surrounding landscape"" to support a ""diverse floral community is likely to benefit bumble bees, especially if some combination of favored plant species are blooming across the duration of bumble bee activity at a given location,"" the authors said.",[]

Any plant with fleshy stems or leaves is called a succulent. Aside from cacti, only a few other plant families have succulent members. All these succulents, cactus or not, are low-maintenance.

SOME NON-CACTUS SUCCULENTS

One family of non-cactus succulents is Crassulaceae, which counts among its members the familiar jade plant, which has thick stems and shiny green, fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves. After years of selective stem cutting, my jade plant has developed two thick trunks that give it the appearance of a venerable tree in miniature.

Kalanchoe is another family member, notable for the small plantlets that grow along the edges of its leaves and periodically drop off to give rise to new plants. Hence its other name: mother-of-thousands. Shortening daylight hours in fall coax out this plant's salmon-red or apricot-orange flowers, which contrast nicely with the bluish cast of the green leaves.

Sedums are yet another Crassulaceae. My burro's tail (Sedum morganianum) has braids of thick, fleshy leaves that hide its stems as they cascade over the edges of its hanging, coconut planter.

Moving on to another family of succulents brings us to the Euphorbiaceae. Milk-striped euphorbia is named for the milky line down its stem, but I think the Latin name, Euphorbia pseudocactus, is more descriptive. With thorns and upright stems off which branch ""arms,"" the plant could easily be mistaken for a cactus.

Crown-of-thorns, aside from its beautiful pink flowers, is another Euphorbia species, this one armed with spines as fierce as those of any cactus.

Not all Euphorbiaceae are succulent; poinsettia is one that's not.

The lily family, Liliaceae, is a third plant family with many succulent members. Aloe is most famous as an ingredient of hand lotions and shampoos, but the plant itself is attractive and care-free -- mine has gone whole winters without watering! Over time, it has filled its pot with whorls of thick, fleshy, lance-shaped leaves.

Sansevieria is a succulent lily with an unflattering common name: mother-in-law's tongue. Unflattering to mothers-in-law, that is, because the plant is a cluster of long, sharp leaves speckled like snakeskin.

WATERING: LESS IS MORE

An advantage and a disadvantage of succulents as houseplants is their adaptation to survive without water. If you remember to water your plants only when you're driving in your car, or if you want a living plant that needs water only slightly more often than a plastic plant, then grow succulents.

On the other hand, if you tip a glass of water on your plants every time you walk past them, you'll soon transform any succulent houseplant into a mass of brown rot. The key to caring for succulents is to hardly ever water them. Once every couple of months in winter, and a couple of times a month in summer, is sufficient. More generally, let the soil dry out between waterings.

When repotting is needed for any succulent plant, use a potting soil that drains water quickly, made so by adding equal volumes of sand or perlite to any mix used for other types of plants.

Besides their ease of care, succulents are easy to propagate. Use the leaves, stems or offshoots, letting any of these plant parts dry and heal for a few day before potting them up. Leaves that occasionally drop off my jade plant often take root just sitting on the soil.",[]

The Toronto-based retail distributor has had to confront myriad supply chain issues during the COVID-19 pandemic, but she calls the current school and home life situation of Canadian families an ""operational nightmare.""

""It's the uncertainty that's eating away at people,"" says Pretty, adding that some of her retailer customers are relying on a skeleton staff of childless workers to keep physical locations running. ""I can't make plans about how to grow my businesses. . . . I can't imagine what my revenue might be like.""

After months of balancing childcare and online schooling with work responsibilities, anything short of complete school reopening presents a crucial challenge for families. Without children in school five days a week, someone has to care for them, and working full-time while simultaneously caring for children is simply not possible -- even when working remotely is an option.

Schools in most of Quebec have been open since May, while those in B.C, Manitoba and P.E.I. have partially reopened. The remaining provinces and territories plan on having students return to the classroom in the fall, though details have not been finalized. School boards are mulling scenarios such as alternating days or weeks with smaller class sizes or continued at-home learning.

The result is a significant number of workers who feel they have little choice but to leave the workforce until a semblance of stability is restored.

According to Statistics Canada's June Labour Force Survey, the employment recovery has been ""slowest for mothers with school-aged children,"" with employment rising 5.2 per cent for women and 6.4 per cent for men with children younger than six. For mothers of children ages six to 17, however, women's employment remains below pre-pandemic levels, and women with children are more likely to be working less than half their usual hours.

Pretty has kids of her own, but she says she can't take leave as people depend on her for their wages. She's considering enrolling her children in private school in Orillia, Ont. in the hopes they would have smaller class sizes and a safer environment. And she isn't alone.

""I know lots of people considering taking a leave of absence,"" says Pretty. ""I know someone who sold a second business. I know teachers who are considering leaves of absence -- they have little people at home.""

Susan Prentice, a sociology professor at the University of Manitoba who studies childcare policy, says the current situation will cause ""unfathomably tough problems"" for families to figure out.

""For any household that has children, a school closing is a make-or-break factor for family decision making,"" says Prentice. ""Women trying to do homeschooling by day and trying to do their own work at night -- in the end, they manage it at the expense of their own health, by sleeping very little. You can get through a short-term period like this, but it's not sustainable over months or semesters.""

Experts say there simply aren't enough daycare spots to accommodate the number of school-age children who may find themselves without a caregiver if parents return to work. Monica Lysack, a professor of early childhood leadership at Sheridan College in Oakville, Ont. says that even in the best of times, Canada only has space in licensed childcare facilities for less than 30 per cent of kids.

""Imagine being told your business could open up only at half capacity, and you have to keep going with all the same expenses,"" says Lysack of childcare centres in the pandemic.

""That means parents are going to have to pay double fees, for already astronomically priced childcare ... And where are the other 50 per cent of children going to go?""

For many families, having two working parents is not optional. Prentice says that families have been able to offset flat wages in the Canadian economy through the contributions of working mothers.

""This discussion of dual earners, or 1.5 earners as we sometimes call part-time work, it's really mothers,"" says Prentice. ""When children are in school, this is when mothers' labour force participation rate jumps to its highest.""

""If schools open on some crazy extraordinary schedule, like two days one week, three days the next week, this will play havoc with the ability of mothers and fathers to keep their jobs. It will play havoc on children. And it immediately has huge, huge economic and social consequences,"" says Prentice.

Pretty says that among the concerns she's hearing from her employees and clients, the return to school is the most pressing.

""Everyone is really obsessed with school opening,"" she says. ""We are getting it from every angle. Everything is complicated.""

The Canadian Council of Business Leaders Against Anti-Black Systemic Racism and the Canadian Association of Urban Financial Professionals announced the plan dubbed the Black North Initiative on Monday.

The plan advocates for companies to work with them to hire more Black students for their internship/co-op programs and to ensure business succession planning strategies include a Black talent strategy to help build a pipeline of employees for future leadership positions.

It is also asking that businesses disaggregate their employee race data and publish it annually, including data on executive representation and/or employee mobility statistics for each racialized group.

The push to deal with systemic racism has gained strength in recent months in the wake of demonstrations held across Canada and the U.S.

A summit is planned for July 20 where business leaders will be asked to sign a CEO pledge and say what they are doing to fight anti-Black systemic racism.

The agency previously reported that year-over-year inflation declined by 0.2 per cent in April, then took a further drop of 0.4 per cent in May as lockdowns put a damper on consumer spending.

But a look under the headline figures showed consumers were spending more on items that don't weigh as much in the consumer price index, which tracks inflation. And they were spending less on things that weigh more in the calculation.

In a numbers experiment to better reflect pandemic spending, Statistics Canada found the annualized inflation figures for April and May would have been 0.0 and -0.1 per cent.

The research paper made public Monday says a specific consumption pattern, such as that happening during the pandemic, would need ""to be sustained in order to have a subsequent impact"" on year-over-year headline numbers.

The research was aided by data from the Bank of Canada, which targets an annual inflation rate of two per cent as measured by Statistics Canada's consumer price index.

The bank has warned that the economic shock wrought by COVID-19 and structurally low interest rates is having a deep effect on the inflation rate, which is far below the target.

The basket of goods used to form the consumer price index has been shaken by a shift in consumer spending habits during the pandemic.

People are buying less gasoline, which usually receives a heavier weight in calculating inflation, as its price has plunged and the frequency of car travel has dropped. Canadians are travelling much less, while grocery-buying is up.

Statistics Canada is to report June's inflation rate next week.

The Bank of Canada said in April that it expected inflation to be close to zero in the second quarter.

Beyond the end of June, the bank was less clear, citing the high level of uncertainty around the course of the pandemic.

The federal government's economic ""snapshot"" last week pegged inflation at 0.5 per cent for this year, then rising back to two per cent in 2021.

The reading was based on the average of forecasts from 13 private sector economists.

On Wednesday, the central bank will release its updated outlook. Governor Tiff Macklem has described what's coming as a ""central planning scenario"" for the economy and inflation, as well as related risks -- such as local, but not national, lockdowns.

Those friendly scenes now seem like a distant memory.

Hostile rhetoric has ratcheted up in recent days over Beijing's new national security law for Hong Kong. Britain's decision to offer refuge to millions in the former colony was met with a stern telling-off by China. And Chinese officials have threatened ""consequences"" if Britain treats it as a ""hostile country"" and decides to cut Chinese technology giant Huawei out of its critical telecoms infrastructure amid growing unease over security risks.

All that is pointing to a much tougher stance against China, with a growing number in Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative Party taking a long, hard look at Britain's Chinese ties. Many are saying Britain has been far too complacent and naive in thinking it could reap economic benefits from the relationship without political consequences.

""It's not about wanting to cut ties with China. It's that China is itself becoming a very unreliable and rather dangerous partner,"" said lawmaker and former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith. He cited Beijing's ""trashing"" of the Sino-British Joint Declaration -- the treaty supposed to guarantee Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy when it reverted from British to Chinese rule -- and aggressive posturing in the South China Sea as areas of concern.

""This is not a country that is in any way managing itself to be a good and decent partner in anything at the moment. That's why we need to review our relationship with them,"" he added. ""Those who think this is a case of separating trade from government ΓÇª you can't do that, that's naive.""

Duncan Smith has lobbied other Tory lawmakers to cut Huawei out from Britain's superfast 5G network. Not only that: He says all existing Huawei technology in the U.K. telecoms infrastructure also needs to be eliminated as soon as possible.

The company has been at the centre of tensions between China and Britain, as U.K. officials review how the latest U.S. sanctions -- imposed over allegations of cyber spying and aimed at cutting off Huawei's access to advanced microchips made with American technology -- will affect British telecom networks.

Johnson decided in January that Huawei can be deployed in future 5G networks as long as its share of the market is limited, but officials have since hinted that that decision could be reversed in light of the U.S. sanctions. A new policy is expected within weeks.

Huawei says it is merely caught in the middle of a U.S.-China battle over trade and technology. It has consistently denied allegations it could carry out cyber espionage or electronic sabotage at the behest of the Chinese Communist Party.

""We've definitely been pushed into the geopolitical competition,"" Vice-President Victor Zhang said Wednesday. U.S. accusations about security risks are all politically motivated, he said.

Nigel Inkster, senior adviser to the International Institute for Strategic Studies and former director of operations and intelligence at Britain's MI6 intelligence service, said the issue with Huawei was not so much about immediate security threats. Rather, he said, the deeper worry lies in the geopolitical implications of China becoming the world's dominant player in 5G technology.

""It's less about cyber espionage than generally conceived because, after all, that's happening in any place,"" he said. ""This was never something of which the U.K. was lacking awareness.""

Still, Inkster said he's been cautioning for years that Britain needed a more coherent strategy toward China that balances the economic and security factors.

""There was a high degree of complacency"" back in the 2000s, he said. ""There was always less to the `golden era' than met the eye.""

Britain rolled out the red carpet for Xi's state visit in 2015, with golden carriages and a lavish banquet at Buckingham Palace with Queen Elizabeth II. A cyber security co-operation deal was struck, along with billions in trade and investment projects -- including Chinese state investment in a British nuclear power station. Cameron spoke about his ambitions for Britain to become China's ""best partner in the West.""

Enthusiasm has cooled significantly since. The English city of Sheffield, which was promised a billion-pound deal with a Chinese manufacturing firm in 2016, said the investment never materialized. Critics have called it a vanity project and a ""candy floss deal.""

Economic and political grumbles about China erupted into sharp rebukes earlier this month when Beijing imposed sweeping new national security laws on Hong Kong. Johnson's government accused China of a serious breach of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, and announced it would open a special route to citizenship for up to 3 million eligible Hong Kong residents.

That amounts to ""gross interference,"" Chinese Ambassador Liu Xiaoming said. Liu also warned that a decision to get rid of Huawei could drive away other Chinese investment in the U.K., and derided Britain for succumbing to U.S. pressure over the company.

Rana Mitter, an Oxford history professor specializing in China, said that the security law -- combined with broader resentment about Chinese officials' handling of information about the coronavirus -- helped set the stage for a perfect storm of wariness among Britain's politicians and the public.

Mitter added that Britain has careened from ""uncritically accepting everything about China"" to a confrontational approach partly because of a lack of understanding about how China operates.

Some have cautioned against escalating tensions. Philip Hammond, the former British Treasury chief, warned that weakening links with the world's second-largest economy was particularly unwise at a time when Britain is severing trade ties with Europe and seeking partners elsewhere. Hammond also said he was concerned about an ""alarming"" rise of anti-Chinese sentiment within his Conservative Party.

Duncan Smith rejected that, saying concerns about China's rise are cross-party and multinational. He is part of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, a newly launched group of lawmakers from more than a dozen countries -- from the U.S. to Australia to Japan -- that want a co-ordinated international response to the Chinese challenge.

""We need to recognize that this isn't something one country can deal with,"" he said.

Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet Inc's Google, said Monday that the project will focus on building products that are relevant to India's needs and empowering businesses for their ""digital transformation.""

""Our goal is to ensure India not only benefits from the next wave of innovation, but leads it,"" Pichai said in a digital keynote at a Google for India event.

The company also announced it will invest $1 million to support digital education in India. It said the fund will enable 1 million teachers in 22,000 schools across the country to use Google services that can facilitate online learning.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made digitization a major priority for India.

He envisions a ""Digital India,"" where high-speed Internet access will empower entrepreneurs to build software and other technology products to help raise the standard of living in a country where many households are still impoverished.

Modi styles himself as a leader in touch with technology. He has nearly 60 million Twitter followers.

Modi said in a tweet that he and Pichai met and discussed a wide range of subjects, ""particularly leveraging the power of technology to transform the lives of India's farmers, youngsters and entrepreneurs.""

This marks the second extension of the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS). On May 15, the government added an additional 12 weeks to the program, extending eligibility to August 29.

""For the last three months, you’ve seen me come out to talk with Canadians about what we’re doing to help you and your family, your employer, your local businesses deal with this pandemic. We’re going to continue to do that vital work,"" said Trudeau during a press briefing outside Rideau Cottage in Ottawa.

Announced on March 27, the CEWS provides qualifying businesses and non-profits funding for 75 per cent of employee wages, retroactive from March 15.

The objective of the program is to keep employees on the payroll so businesses can rebound more quickly when restrictions are lifted and the economy restarts. The CEWS had a slow uptake, but has increased in popularity as more Canadians transition off of the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.

In an interview on CTV’s Question Period in May, Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough attributed the program’s rocky start to barriers in the application process.

""It’s been slower than expected. I think businesses are having to put a lot of time and effort into their applications because you have to dig into your payroll – who earned what and when,"" she said.

Since then, the government has been consulting with the business community and promoting its benefit amid calls from opposition that the Liberal’s are disincentivizing Canadians from returning to work as CERB application numbers balloon.

As of July 5, just under 19 million Canadians had applied for the benefit and more than $54 billion had been paid out.

The new $82. 3 billion CEWS projection, outlined in last Wednesday’s fiscal snapshot, is a stark increase from the original $45 billion estimate.

As of July 6, 581,800 out of a total of 587, 060 submissions had been approved. This equates to slightly more than $18 billion.",[]

The turn of events was disclosed Friday at the Quebec Superior Court.

Shareholders including the Texan fund TPG Capital, the Chinese firm Fosun and the Caisse de depot have presented a so-called stalking horse bid valued at about US$420 million.

The lenders have signalled that they intend to oppose the shareholder agreement, calling it ""doomed to fail.""

A representative of monitor Ernst & Young told the court that it believes a negotiated agreement was the ""optimal scenario for both parties.""

The creditors, who hold about US$1 billion in secured debt, have until Tuesday to submit their proposal to advisers of the company, which has been deprived of income since its 44 shows were cancelled mid-March because of COVID-19 and prompted the layoff of some 3,480 employees.

Details of the creditors' proposal have not been released, but according to what has already been disclosed, the offer would maintain Cirque's head office in Montreal and would not seek financial support from the Quebec government.

The lenders have already proposed a conversion of the guaranteed debt into shares.

STATISTICS CANADA REPORT

Statistics Canada is scheduled to release its analysis of the effects of changing consumption patterns on consumer price indexes on Monday. The agency recently reported that the annual pace of inflation pulled back even further in May due to a drop in gasoline prices compared with a year ago as businesses shut due to the COVID-19 pandemic began to reopen slowly.

PANDEMIC EFFECTS ON BUSINESS

Statistics Canada will release its survey on the impact of COVID-19 on businesses in Canada on Tuesday. The Bank of Canada's latest review of business and consumer expectations revealed how widespread uncertainty is muting rehiring and purchasing plans, with only half of firms polled expecting a rebound in their sales within the next year as COVID-19's effects recede.

HOME SALES

The Canadian Real Estate Association is expected to release its figures for June home sales figures on Wednesday. Sales are expected to show a sharp increase compared with May as buyers returned to the market.

MAY MANUFACTURING

Statistics Canada is scheduled to release its monthly survey of manufacturing for May on Wednesday. The agency previously reported that sales fell by a record amount in April, the first full month of physical distancing measures in the wake of COVID-19, but that sales were expected to regain at least some ground in May as factories moved to resume production.

RATE ANNOUNCEMENT

The Bank of Canada will release its latest interest rate announcement and monetary policy report on Wednesday. The central bank is expected to keep its key interest rate on hold at 0.25 per cent, while the monetary policy report will include an update to its economic forecast.

Here's why.,[],2020-06-24 14:03:00-04:00,"TORONTO -- When Erin O’Brien opened up her email last week, she was shocked to find a notice from the federal government informing her that she would not receive her Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) payment the following week.

The Ottawa mother said the email explained that she was receiving the smaller amount in June because she was given a $2,000 advance when she collected her first CERB payment in April.

“I didn’t realize that this was even going to happen,” she told CTVNews.ca during a telephone interview from her home in Ottawa on Wednesday. “I thought it would just be all in the end that they would fix things. Not halfway through.”

O’Brien is far from alone in her surprise at the sudden reduction in CERB payments this month.

Dozens of Canadians have written in to CTVNews.ca to share how they, too, received word from the government last week notifying them that they weren’t eligible for the full $2,000 in June because of the earlier advance.

Kimberly Drew said she will only be receiving $500 this month, instead of the $2,000 she was expecting because of the advance payment she collected in April.

“It was not explained well when the payment came out so it was a bit of a shock,” she said. “I am frustrated.”

WHY ARE THERE REDUCED PAYMENTS NOW?

According to one of the Service Canada emails a CERB claimant received and forwarded to CTVNews.ca, the extra $2,000 that some people collected at the beginning of the program was an “advance of four weeks of the CERB, which was issued in order to get money in your pocket as quickly as possible.”

“Because of this advance, you will not receive a payment when you complete your next report. This is equivalent to the first two-week period of the advance. Please continue completing reports. This shows that you are eligible for all weeks of the CERB, including the four weeks of the benefit covered by the advance payment,” the message continued.

The notice also informed claimants that CERB would be extended by another eight weeks with a maximum payable amount of $12,000 over 24 weeks, which equals $2,000 per month for 6 months.

Ashley Michnowski, the director of communications for Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough, explained that CERB was initially intended to be available for a total of 16 weeks to a maximum of $8,000 before the extension.

Because those Canadians who were eligible for Employment Insurance (EI) received an extra $2,000 when the CERB benefit began, they had reached their maximum payable amount in June.

“As a result, starting the week of June 8th, some people would have received their full $8,000 initial CERB entitlement for the first initial 16 weeks and will therefore not receive a regular CERB payment this month,” Qualtrough’s spokesperson said in a statement to CTVNews.ca on Wednesday.

The minister’s office said eligible CERB claimants will receive money again at the beginning of July at the start of the next pay period now that the benefit has been extended for an additional eight weeks.

“In order to ensure claimants receive the available funding through the extension of CERB, they should continue to complete their biweekly reports,” the statement said.

'CLEAR, CONCISE, AND CONSISTENT DIRECTION'

There was some initial confusion when the CERB benefit was first rolled out in April because some claimants received more money than others.

For example, some people who applied for both employment insurance (EI) and CERB received two payments, even though no one is eligible to receive payments from both programs simultaneously.

As another example, those who were already on EI may have also received more than the initial $2,000 CERB payment when they were switched over to the new program because of residual EI benefits they had already qualified for.

At the time, Qualtrough reassured Canadians the additional deposits were not mistakes and recipients would be contacted about next steps.

“The CRA and Service Canada are working together to ensure that these situations are reconciled and payments do not exceed the maximum amount allowed per individual of $8,000 over a 16-week period,” she said in early April.

“So it won't necessarily be a clawback situation. It might be, but you can’t apply for more than the $8,000.”

However, days earlier Treasury Board President Jean-Yves Duclos created some confusion when he said the double payments were paid retroactively for the four-week period dating back to March 15, the first day people could apply for CERB.

A spokesperson from Qualtrough’s office clarified later that week that individuals who received $4,000 collectively from both the EI and CERB program would be contacted.

Conservative employment critic MP Dan Albas said the confusion and panic some Canadians are experiencing now could have been avoided if they were told what the $2,000 advance was for when they first received it.

“We recognize that during a crisis things happen quickly, but it’s really up to the government to provide clear, concise, and consistent direction,” he told CTVNews.ca during a telephone interview on Wednesday.

Albas said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has had multiple opportunities during his daily press briefings to bring Canadians up to speed on this issue and to let those people who received extra payments know what is expected of them.

“That would have been the responsible thing to do because ultimately, leaders take responsibility for mistakes,” he said. “And unfortunately, people are now at the end of the month just before the rent comes due, are being told that they will have considerably less support than they were planning.”

NDP MP and employment critic Daniel Blaikie echoed those sentiments when he said that it is “inexcusable” the government hasn’t made more of an effort to provide them with proper notice. He said it would have been easy to put up a reminder about the upcoming reduced payments on the Service Canada website a month ago for people to see when they log in to file their biweekly reports to claim their benefits.

Blaikie also said that he doesn’t understand why the government is reclaiming that advance money now when they have extended the program by another eight weeks.

“There is no need to do this right now,” he said during a telephone interview with CTVNews.ca on Wednesday. “They’re [the government] going to collect the money one way or another eventually. Doing it in a way that gives Canadians as much lead time as possible benefits CERB recipients and I don't think it does any harm to the government.”

Seniors have been anxiously awaiting the up to $500 payment. Many have watched their retirement savings take a hit, and have been paying higher fees for grocery deliveries and medical prescriptions.

Any senior who is eligible for the Old Age Security (OAS) pension will receive a $300 payment, and an additional $200 is being sent to seniors eligible for the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS).

The federal government estimates there are currently 6.7 million seniors who are eligible for the OAS pension and 2.2 million who are eligible for the GIS. These payments are set to total $2.5 billion.

The payments are being made directly to anyone who is eligible, with no application needed.

“Seniors who reside in Canada can expect to receive the payment by direct deposit or cheque this week, whereas seniors who reside outside Canada can expect this one-time payment in July for those on direct deposit, or by cheque with delays given international postal disruptions,” said the government in a statement.",[]

SIU Director Joseph Martino said based on preliminary inquiries “it is apparent that the SIU is without jurisdiction to continue with the investigation,” as the injuries sustained do not amount to a “serious injury” within the SIU’s terms.

It was reported on the night of June 23, Essex OPP officers responded to a mischief call and located a 26-year-old man. After a struggle, the man was arrested and placed in the back of a police cruiser.

A news release from SIU states that while in the back of the cruiser “the man smashed his head and face off the plexiglass partition in the rear with great force.”

He was then taken to the hospital by EMS.

Martino said originally the matter was reported to the SIU as involving a brain bleed and concussion, however, upon reviewing the man’s medical records he was taken to the hospital where his injuries were determined to be a “subdural hematoma of no significant mass or effect.”

Since the man’s injuries do not fall within the terms of the SIU’s jurisdiction the investigation has been discontinued and the file closed.

As Canadian COVID-19 trends continue to decline, cases in the United States propel upwards. The Canada-U.S. border remains closed until July 21 but reopening it to non-essential travel anytime soon would likely lead to a resurgence in cases, infectious disease specialist Dr. Abdu Sharkawy said.

""It absolutely terrifies me to think of the prospect of any sort of easing of restrictions that could allow greater travel between Canada and the United States,"" he said, adding that the United States could hit 100,000 new infections per day sometime in the next week.

""These numbers are just unfathomable and astronomical when you consider what we have dealt with here in Canada over the course of three or four months.""

He said that maps tracking COVID-19 infections worldwide, like the one pictured above from Johns Hopkins University, paints a picture of how a country can successfully or unsuccessfully manage a pandemic.

While the data on the map above is on a more localized level in the United States, which makes it appear more red, there are still an overwhemling number of cases south of the border compared to Canada.

For example, a single red dot in New York City or Los Angeles accounts for more cases than in all of Canada.

""I don't think we have seen any another part of the world where you have two neighbouring countries in polar opposite situations in terms of pandemic control,"" Sharkawy said. ""This is a very strange phenomena where you are seeing such an extreme range.""

To date, there have been 2,796 COVID-19 cases per million people in Canada, while in the United States that number is much higher at 9,051 per million.

The United States is leading the world in COVID-19 cases as it nears the three million mark, while Canada has just over 106,000.

""I think if you look around the world at other countries that have successfully flattened the curve, a lot of resurgent cases have been a direct result of travel restrictions being eased,"" Sharkawy said.

""Border control and travel restrictions are a very key element in keeping your particular geographical area safe.""

""It's the longest undefended border in the world and the last thing we want to do is turn it into the longest unprotected border when it comes to COVID-19 transmission.""

Please keep the border closed...

Ontario Premier Doug Ford said in June that he believes reopening the borders too early could spark a second wave of COVID-19.

""I know it's inevitable … I just don't think we are ready right now,"" Ford said. ""You see what's happening down in the states; you look at Florida, you look at Texas, Arizona, California. I don't want to be those states. I want to protect the people here in Ontario.""

""Believe me, I love the Americans, make no mistake about it, but not when their COVID cases are just spiking right now and I’m just not in favour.""

Since March, everyone entering Canada for non-essential reasons has been ordered to quarantine for two weeks. The order was extended until the end of August but could be pushed even further.

Travelling within Canada 'reasonable'

While Sharkawy said he wouldn't road trip across Canada right now, he said beginning to plan travel again within the country ""makes sense.""

""I think it's very reasonable to explore interprovincial travel,"" Sharkawy said.

""Again, I wouldn't do it for the sake of doing it but if someone wanted to visit friends or family and its likely to bring them a great deal of comfort and satisfaction then I think the benefit of that outweighs the theoretical risk of acquiring COVID-19.""",[]

To celebrate a decade of operations, the space agency released some incredible time-lapse footage of its solar mission.

Since 2010, the SDO has collected 425 million high-resolution images of the sun, amassing 20 million gigabytes of data. Using a variety of instruments, it was able to capture new images of the sun every 0.75 seconds for 10 years. Those images were spliced together to create the time-lapse video shown below.

A decade of sun activity was condensed into the 61-minute video which features notable events, like transiting planets and solar eruptions. The SDO was launched in February 2010 to help researchers understand the sun’s influence on Earth by studying the solar atmosphere.

While the SDO has been determined to capture every moment of the sun, there were a few instances where that wasn’t possible. The dark frames that appear in the video are caused by the Earth or moon eclipsing as they pass between the spacecraft and the sun. A temporary issue with one of the atmospheric imaging instruments led to a longer blackout in 2016.

The SDO will continue to watch the sun in the years to come and provide more insights about the sun’s effect on life on Earth.",[]

""I made a mistake in not recusing myself immediately from the discussions, given our family's history, and I'm sincerely sorry about not having done that,"" Trudeau said.

Trudeau said he is sorry for how the rollout of the Canada Student Service Grant program went, and he regrets the “unnecessary controversy” it’s caused.

“The mistake that we made was on me, and I take responsibility for it. We will continue to work very, very hard to deliver the program,” Trudeau said, speaking about the ongoing controversy during his first national address on the federal government’s latest COVID-19 response plans from Rideau Cottage in two weeks.

Over the last two weeks, the controversy surrounding the government’s decision to allow the WE Charity to deliver a now-halted $900 million COVID-19 student grant program has grown considerably.

WE Charity backed away from administering the grants amid questions about Trudeau’s involvement, but also in light of a series of news stories about racialized former employees’ experiences with the organization.

The ethics commissioner also launched a probe into a potential conflict of interest with Trudeau’s decision to grant the organization the contract to administer the program, given the prime minister’s close personal ties to the charity.

“This was my mistake. This was me not stepping back from an organization that I should have known to not get involved with, even as prime minister, and allow the public service and non-connected ministers to move forward on delivering this program,” said Trudeau on Monday.

'I DIDN'T KNOW THE DETAILS'

Last week WE Charity confirmed that, over the years, Trudeau’s wife, mother, and brother have received a range of payments amounting to around $300,000 for speaking at WE events. Sophie Gregoire Trudeau is an ambassador with the organization and hosts a mental health podcast under its name. She received a ""one-time speaking honorarium"" of $1,400 for participating in a youth event in 2012, before Trudeau became leader of the Liberal Party.

On Monday, the prime minister faced a series of questions from reporters about whether he knew his family members got paid by WE, and said that, while he was aware of their professional speaking roles, he was unaware of just how much money his family members received.

""I have known, obviously, for many years that my mom has been an extraordinary advocate for mental health issues, a professional public speaker who works with a range of different organizations. Obviously I knew she worked with WE, I didn't know the details of how much she was getting paid by various organizations but I should have and I deeply regret that,” Trudeau said on Monday.

Trudeau said he also regrets bringing his mother, Margaret Trudeau, into the controversy, saying that it was “unfair.”

“I should have been thoughtful enough to recuse myself completely from any discussions around WE because of these connections from the very beginning, and I did not and I'm very sorry about that,” he said.

MORNEAU ALSO APOLOGIZES

Last week Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s office confirmed his daughters have connections to the charity and he also did not recuse himself from the decision-making table. The finance minister’s daughter Clare has spoken at WE events, and his daughter Grace is currently employed by WE Charity.

On Friday, Morneau also apologized for not removing himself from discussions about the student grant program.

“Given the fact that my daughter works for the organization in an unrelated branch, I now realize I should have in order to avoid any perception of conflict. I apologize for not doing so, and moving forward, I will recuse myself from any future discussions related to WE,” Morneau said in a statement.

STUDENTS LEFT IN LIMBO

Initially, WE Charity was selected to set up placements and administer grants to students and new graduates for their volunteer work this summer.

With the program halted, thousands of students are now in limbo without summer jobs and, for now, no chance for volunteer grants to help cover costs like fall tuition.

The grant to post-secondary students and recent graduates was designed to provide one-time payments of up to $5,000 for volunteering in pandemic-related programs, depending on the number of hours worked. For every 100 hours spent, a student will receive $1,000.

On Monday, Trudeau repeated his regret that his error in judgment has resulted in students hoping to help their communities being left in limbo instead.

“Because of the mistake I made in not withdrawing from these conversations when the public service recommended we move forward with the WE organization, it has gotten a little slower for young people who are facing a difficult time right now, to be able to get involved in their communities and make a difference,” Trudeau said.

Now, Trudeau says the government is looking to Service Canada as a potential avenue to run the program, despite doubling down on the statement that the public service had initially suggested outsourcing the program to WE Charity.

OPPOSITION PARTIES DIG IN

The Conservatives have written to the RCMP suggesting they look into the matter, while two House of Commons studies are underway into various aspects of the controversy.

Now, the opposition is looking to convene a third committee probe, with the intent to uncover as many documents as possible and aiming to call and a slate of cabinet ministers to testify.

Trudeau said a series of cabinet ministers will be testifying this week about the affair, and if he gets an invitation, he will consult with his House of Commons leadership team about attending.

“Obviously, the opposition parties have their job to do and they will keep doing it. I have my job to do as well, which is to make sure that Canadians are well supported through this pandemic and we have an economic restart that goes smoothly,” Trudeau said.

“Revelations that Justin Trudeau’s family was paid to speak at events for an organization, which later received a $900 million sole-source contract, are deeply disturbing,” said Conservative MP and ethics critic Michael Barrett in a statement about the push for a third committee study. “This new information has raised concerns about the way this Liberal government operates and whether the appropriate processes are in place to avoid conflicts of interest,” said Barrett.

Critics have pointed to the WE Charity affair as the latest in a series of ethical oversights Trudeau has had over his time as prime minister.

Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion’s ongoing investigation is now the third ethics investigation Trudeau has been subjected to, with the two previous times — his trip to the Aga Khan’s private island and in relation to the SNC-Lavalin prosecution — resulting in findings that Trudeau had breached federal ethics law. In both cases Trudeau apologized for his improper behaviour, and both times he said he had learned his lesson.

“I feel like it's Groundhog Day. We've seen so many instances where the prime minister gets caught… seems outraged that anyone could question him, and then as the scandal deepens then he apologizes,” said NDP MP and ethics critic Charlie Angus in an interview on CTV News Channel. He said what is most concerning is that no one around Trudeau seemed to try to stop him from getting involved given his close personal ties to the organization.

Angus said the controversy should have never happened and if the proper standards and protocols were in place, it wouldn’t have. He called it “one of the stupidest scandals in Canadian history.”

Asked if he was worried that the controversy puts his minority government on unstable footing after months of positive polling numbers, Trudeau said on Monday that he trusts Canadians will make judgments on his leadership based on the pandemic response as a whole.

“When we look at these things, proximity to the prime minister has an impact… The fact that it includes family members makes it very problematic for the prime minister,” said pollster Nik Nanos in an interview on CTV News Channel.

WE CHARITY WEIGHS IN

In a new statement on their website, WE Charity co-founders Craig Kielburger and Marc Kielburger say they want to “set the record straight” about the entire affair. The brothers wrote about how their organization was qualified to stickhandle the administration of the Canada Student Service Grant program, which had 35,000 applicants a week after launching. But, as their statement notes, “the program was immediately enmeshed in controversy,” and handed back over to the government along with the funding.

“WE has not profited from this contract in any way,” said the Keilburgers, adding that the last two weeks have been “extremely difficult.”

“The charity’s integrity and purpose has been called into question. It has had direct impacts on our staff, supporters, and beneficiaries. We have made mistakes that we sincerely regret,” says the statement.",[]

What PM Trudeau's COVID-19 messaging reveals,['Rachel Aiello'],2020-07-13 07:15:00-04:00,"OTTAWA -- It became a scene most Canadians could recognize: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau emerges from Rideau Cottage and descends six steps to a podium, notes in hand. This was how the prime minister chose to speak to the country, day in and day out between March and July. In his morning updates, COVID-19 aid packages amounting to hundreds of billions of dollars were unveiled and public health advisories were driven home, but what else did Trudeau have to say?

CTVNews.ca has analyzed the 81 national addresses and following media availabilities that Trudeau held during the 110 days between entering a 14-day self-isolation, on March 12, to his June 29 announcement that, going forward, he would only convene the Rideau Cottage updates when he had big news to share.

The day after Trudeau entered quarantine on account of his wife Sophie having symptoms that were soon confirmed to be from COVID-19, the prime minister began what quickly became a daily routine: addressing the nation from Rideau Cottage, his family’s temporary home on the grounds of Rideau Hall.

Those morning addresses, mostly from the grounds of Rideau Hall, became a seven-day-a-week ritual, with few days off in the first two months. Then, as the public health crisis entered into the initial phase of reopenings, the routine was eased, with no press conferences on weekends and eventually only a few times a week.

Analyzing the transcripts of his English-language remarks from all those Rideau Cottage updates, as well as the few offsite, CTVNews.ca identified his commonly used phrases and terms, as well as his go-to nouns and adjectives, before asking political communication experts and a linguist to assess the words he was using to deliver his messages, and whether they were effective.

WHAT WORDS DID HE USE?

CTVNews.ca’s analysis found that the most repeated phrase was “right across the country,” followed by variations of “keep Canadians safe.” Others that topped the list included “make sure,” and “move forward.”

Speaking to the use of “keep Canadians safe,” former lead speechwriter for Trudeau, Jeni Armstrong, said she thinks it was a great choice.

“It's simple, it's direct, it appeals to the kind of worries that we all have about our families… It’s memorable and like I said, it is the kind of reassurance that I think people were seeking especially in the early days,” said Armstrong, who is now an instructor with the Clayton H. Riddell Graduate Program in Political Management at Carleton University after working as the director of communications for Finance Minister Bill Morneau and helping to author the Liberal Party’s 2019 and 2015 federal election platforms.

Other phrases that appeared often included: “long-term care”; “continue to work”; “public health”; “social distancing”; “people need”; “staying home”; and “coming weeks.”

CTVNews.ca also searched for the frequency of other key words, which may not necessarily be the words said the most. The word “recognize” came up 183 times over the 81 addresses, “virus” was said 127 times, “parliament” got named 108 times and “unprecedented” was said 63 times. Further, “racism” was said 53 times, “China” was found in the transcripts 45 times, and “budget” just nine times.

Armstrong said Trudeau has a personal verbal habit where he builds formulas for responding to questions, which could explain the frequency of the word “recognize”—which often was how he started an answer to reporters’ questions: “we recognize…”

“He'll often say—and this has been true for a number of years… ‘Canadians expect us to ABC, and we are doing just that.’ It's kind of a formula that he has,” she said.

Trudeau’s go-to verbs, in order of frequency: “need”; “get”; “make”; “continue”’ “know”; “keep”; “ensure”; “want”; “think”; and “help.”

As for adjectives, he most often said: “many”; “sure”; “safe”; “able”; “right”; “important”; “different”; “new”; “Canadian”; and “possible.”

Linguist Shana Poplack told CTVNews.ca that Trudeau’s word choices show he wants to evoke he is in charge and has things under control.

“If this is the message he's trying to relay, those words are consistent,” said Poplack, who is the director of the Sociolinguistics Laboratory at the University of Ottawa and Canada Research Chair in Linguistics.

Poplack also said what stood out to her were the phrases that didn’t crack the top of the list of things Trudeau said, despite them being so frequently said in society writ large these days, including “in these uncertain times,” and “the new normal.”

“That does not tie in with the message that he's trying to get across,” she said, suggesting it’s possible he didn’t want to highlight the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“That's why we see “ensure,” we see the word “safe,” reappearing... He also has to convince us that he's on top of it,” she said.

BUILT UP LEXICON OF PHRASES

What the frequent repetition of these and other phrases indicates, experts said, is that Trudeau and his relatively small team of speechwriters had developed a dictionary of key phrases to reinforce and repeat in his prepared remarks. The messaging was first built into his speeches, but after their near-daily repeating, they became a reflexive part of his vocabulary when responding to questions, too.

Poplack said these are referred to as “fixed expressions,” some of which are commonly used by all, others are created, as seen with terms for aid programs to establish a clear message. The use of such phrases can be seen across political lines and in past prime ministers’ speaking habits as well.

“For Paul Martin it was ‘let me be clear,’ for Stephen Harper it was ‘obviously’,” said Garry Keller, vice president at StrategyCorp and a past adviser to former prime minister Stephen Harper.

Armstrong said the repetition of the COVID-19 benefit-specific phrases also helped to build up familiarity with new programs. “Emergency Response Benefit” — referring to the Canada Emergency Response Benefit of $2,000 a month to out of wok Canadians — was in the top-five most said three-word phrases, and “wage subsidy” was in the top five two-word phrases spoken.

“What he's attempting to do there is to get people familiar with the name of any program… When you're working on that, repetition is your friend,” she said.

STRUCTURE SUITS THE PM

Strategic communication professional and political commentator Scott Reid said that the formula of “political communication by dint of news conference” has become a go-to form of communicating COVID-19 crisis updates around the world and across Canada, where provincial premiers have all taken a similar approach.

The format plays to Trudeau’s strengths, Reid said, contrasting the PM’s comfort and skill delivering on-message remarks without relying on rote responses to the communication approach of other world leaders including U.S. President Donald Trump, who Reid said failed at being consistent in his messaging and shut down his routine of regular press conferences long before Trudeau did.

“A crisis such as this, which has created a made-for-television daily news conference, it's almost perfectly built for his [Trudeau’s] talent set and instincts because he has a preternatural sense of self… He's extraordinarily conscious of his presentation and of his representation to the public, and that serves him extremely well in this situation,” said Reid, who also worked as an adviser to former prime minister Paul Martin.

Keller noted that opting to keep Trudeau’s addresses to the high-level details and letting a cadre of ministers follow after him to take reporters’ more detailed questions also meant that Trudeau was usually out of the spotlight by midday, rather than facing reporters and opposition MPs multiple throughout the entire day.

“It quite frankly has worked for them,” said Keller, adding that all of the opposition parties found it challenging to compete with.

BOOST TO APPROVAL RATING

The more frequent prime ministerial appearances also had positive returns on his approval ratings, according to CTV News’ pollster and Chair of Nanos Research, Nik Nanos.

“What I'll call the ‘relentless chain of press conferences’ … they've effectively done a bit of a reset on his brand,” Nanos said. “There's been a complete reset on Justin Trudeau’s personal brand. His brand is now strong again— it's not as strong as the honeymoon [phase]— but it's strong and the Liberal numbers are strong.”

Nanos Research asks Canadians weekly whether they feel the various federal party leaders have the qualities of a good political leader, and Trudeau’s trend line shows that Canadians surveyed are viewing him more positively since March than they have in the entirety of the last four years.

KEY MOMENTS LIKE 'SPEAKING MOISTLY'

These routine speeches also provided several key moments over the initial four months of the COVID-19 pandemic, from Trudeau’s infamous “speaking moistly” slip-up when describing how the coronavirus can transmit through droplets, to his conspicuously long pause when asked about Trump's handling of anti-racism protesters in the United States.

While the combination of “speaking” and “moistly” was swiftly removed from Trudeau’s lexicon, Armstrong said even when such moments inspire mockery, they are generally well-received.

“That ended up being really funny at a time when people needed to laugh right? And he's, he's very much able to laugh at himself in moments like that,” she said of Trudeau. She cited the first time that he spoke directly to children as another notable moment.

“Kids are an overlooked constituency… They're not even spoken to directly by people in power very often. But they are feeling and experiencing this moment, in a very, very profound way, and I as a mom, and as a citizen, and as a communicator, I really love that he acknowledged that,” she said.

WHY THE ADDRESSES ENDED

By the time Trudeau said he’d be cutting down his regular press conferences, the announcements he was making had already become incremental and small, while the questions he faced were predominately about non-COVID-19 news.

The political communication experts CTVNews.ca spoke with largely agreed that, while the near-daily addresses were key in reassuring Canadians that the federal government was on top of the rapidly unfolding crisis early on, continuing to come out and face reporters was having diminishing positive returns for the prime minister as other big news stories began to bubble up, notably the ongoing WE Charity controversy.

Another reason some suggest could explain why Trudeau’s team opted to wind down what some critics call “the morning show”? Canadians had begun tuning them out.

“I think that they've rightly recognized that should there be a second wave, should there be a need to start communicating again on a daily basis in a way that was happening in March for example, they don't want to kind of burn the goodwill and the listening potential of the audience by continuing to speak every day if there's not something new to share,” said Kate Harrison, vice president at Summa Strategies Canada and Conservative political commentator.

WILL SEE THIS FORMAT AGAIN

Going forward, the experts interviewed said to expect the format to resume should there be a new resurgence in the virus’ spread.

Reid said that if there is a second wave of COVID-19 infections, the public and the media has come to expect the prime minister will be front-and-centre.

“This is now how it is done. It has quietly become a matter of consensus among political leaders, media, public audiences, that this is how this gets prosecuted, and so it will recur, and it will overwhelmingly benefit political leaders who are capable of commanding the podium and follow those very simple rules of being thematic, being consistent, demonstrating empathy,” Reid said.

Methodology: For this project we used the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) in Python to run a word frequency and N-gram analysis on the transcripts. An N-gram analysis counts the occurrences of two or more words together. The code stripped the transcripts to leave only those words spoken by Trudeau in English.

716,ctvnews,http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/plate-shaming-is-happening-in-atlantic-canada-as-locals-fear-those-from-outside-the-bubble-1.5021203,'Plate-shaming' is happening in Atlantic Canada as locals fear those from outside the 'bubble',[],2020-07-12 22:00:00-04:00,"TORONTO -- Atlantic Canada’s reputation for being warm and welcoming has long been a source of pride.

But instead of hospitality, the pandemic is exposing a glimpse of hostility aimed at those who are assumed to be outsiders.

""Being from Halifax, growing up here all but eight years of my life, I really didn't expect this,” resident Tony Mountenay told CTV News.

Tony and Debbie Mountenay chose to return to Nova Scotia during the pandemic because they were looking for a laid back retirement.

As required, they isolated after they arrived. But then they decided to go out and run errands.

""And we had three different incidents where people came up beside us, yelling at us, through the window, and when it first happened, we had to try to think, well what was that about?” Debbie said.

The answer was the licence plate on their truck — showing that they came from Ontario.

Visitors from beyond the “Atlantic bubble” have been vilified by locals fearing the virus could be imported.

Though relatively rare, there have been incidents of “plate-shaming.”

A woman from Quebec was told to go home while walking on a New Brunswick beach.

More than 15,000 Newfoundlanders signed a petition demanding their province not open the border to anyone.

Debbie said one woman who had harassed the couple had done so in front of her own children.

“She really shouldn't have been doing that in my opinion,” she said. “Another man, you could tell he was out of control.""

The Atlantic bubble, which encompasses the provinces of New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador, is a concept that was introduced recently to allow easier travel between the Eastern provinces as the region reopens.

People from all across Canada are allowed to travel to any Atlantic province, but those outside of the Atlantic bubble must isolate for 14 days — as leaders in the region are quick to remind people.

""The Atlantic bubble is open today, [but] that does not apply to those who are from Ontario, Quebec or Western Canada,” Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil said. “If you're coming into our province, you're required to self isolate as well.""

The Atlantic provinces have largely fared well during the pandemic compared to provinces such as Ontario or Quebec. Of the Atlantic provinces, Nova Scotia has had the most cases in total, at just over 1,000 — a far cry from Quebec’s 56,521 cumulative cases.

The stress for locals in the Atlantic provinces is that out-of-bubble visitors could lead to a second wave of the virus.

Only last week, a string of new cases in Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island were proven to be related to travel from outside of the bubble. One individual flew from the United States to Toronto, and then to Halifax. This case was then connected to cases in Prince Edward Island.

McNeil said on July 6 that he is frustrated with travellers who do not isolate for the 14 days after they arrive.

“We have worked hard together and sacrificed so much in this province to help flatten the curve only to have some people come into our province who think they’re above it all, who think that the rules don’t apply to them,” he said. “Guess what? They do.”

But the Mountenay’s experience in Nova Scotia suggests that the uncertainty over who has isolated and who has not has led to some rather un-neighbourly behaviour.

In response, the couple has come with a way to alert people they’re not a threat. A piece of paper that clearly states a person has completed isolation.

""I don't want to get [COVID-19],” Debbie said. “And I don't want to give it to anybody.""",[]

The Canadian Council of Business Leaders Against Anti-Black Systemic Racism and the Canadian Association of Urban Financial Professionals announced the plan dubbed the Black North Initiative on Monday.

The plan advocates for companies to work with them to hire more Black students for their internship/co-op programs and to ensure business succession planning strategies include a Black talent strategy to help build a pipeline of employees for future leadership positions.

It is also asking that businesses disaggregate their employee race data and publish it annually, including data on executive representation and/or employee mobility statistics for each racialized group.

The push to deal with systemic racism has gained strength in recent months in the wake of demonstrations held across Canada and the U.S.

A summit is planned for July 20 where business leaders will be asked to sign a CEO pledge and say what they are doing to fight anti-Black systemic racism.

The Canadian Association of Urban Financial Professionals has more than 600 Black professionals as members who work across Bay Street.

""The BlackNorth Initiative and CAUFP are fully aligned regarding the critical need to begin dismantling systemic racism in corporate Canada,"" said Wes Hall, founder and chairman of the Canadian Council of Business Leaders Against Anti-Black Systemic Racism.

""Corporations must do more to create and nurture Black talent pipelines to ensure proper representation at the highest levels. This is a natural partnership in a shared mission that will lead to measurable results.""

It's a record of which the Nishnawbe Aski Police Service is proud, especially in light of the recent uproar in North America over police killings and brutality involving Indigenous, Black, and mentally distressed people. It's a record achieved in communities frequently in social distress, places where hunting rifles and shotguns are ubiquitous.

The key difference from urban, non-Indigenous policing, insiders and observers say, is the relationship building between officers and the people they serve.

""In the past, you might have been the only officer in there,"" Roland Morrison, chief of NAPS says from Thunder Bay, Ont. ""You would have no radio, you've got no backup, so you really effectively have to use your communication and talk to people. You have to develop relationships with the communities in order to have positive policing.""

Inaugurated in 1994, NAPS is responsible for policing more than 38,000 people in 34 communities, many beyond remote, across a vast, largely untamed swath of northern Ontario. Currently the service has 203 officers, about 60 per cent of them Indigenous, Morrison says. Its mandate is culturally responsive policing.

Erick Laming, a criminology PhD candidate at the University of Toronto, says people from First Nation communities -- many with an ingrained suspicion of police given the brutal realities of generations of enforced residential school attendance -- have a higher level of trust when officers are Indigenous.

In contrast, he said, new RCMP recruits with no such background might find themselves in Nunavut or Yukon confronted with significant language and cultural barriers.

""If you're from the community, you have those lived experiences. You can relate to people. You just know how to deal with the issues,"" says Laming, who is from the Shabot Obaadjiwan First Nation north of Kingston, Ont.

""If you don't have that history, you can have all the cultural-sensitivity training in the world, you'll never fully be able to fully integrate into that situation.""

Another example, he said, is the service in Kahnawake, Que., which calls itself the Kahnawake Peacekeepers rather than a police force.

While all officers in Ontario undergo the same basic training, the province's nine Indigenous police services are fundamentally different from their non-Indigenous counterparts.

For one thing, they are not deemed an essential service, although federal Public Safety Minister Bill Blair said last month that policing First Nations communities should be. Nor are those in Ontario subject to the provincial Police Services Act, which mandates standards, including for an extensive oversight framework.

Now, the process for filing complaints against members of an Indigenous police force is ad hoc, although NAPS does have a professional standards branch and will on occasion call in Ontario Provincial Police. Officers have been disciplined, charged or even fired for excessive use of force.

Another difference is that Indigenous forces are completely reliant on the vagaries of government program funding -- with Ottawa footing 52 per cent of the bill and provinces 48 per cent. The current operations budget for NAPS, for example, is around $37.7 million -- more than its peers -- with expenses approaching $40 million.

The upshot, particularly in years gone by, has been a dire shortage of officers and even of basic facilities and equipment that urbanites can scarcely imagine. In more than a dozen cases, Indigenous self-administered police services in Canada have simply folded.

Now retired, Terry Armstrong, who spent 22 years with Ontario Provincial Police as well as five years as chief of NAPS, says people would be shocked to find out just how poorly funded First Nations policing has been.

Armstrong recounts how a few years ago, in the Hudson Bay community of Fort Severn, Ont., a NAPS officer found himself dealing with a homicide. Besides having to secure three crime scenes and the body, the lone officer had to arrest the suspect and deal with a separate gun call. Bad weather prevented any forensic or other help flying in until the following day.

One thing he always stressed to newcomers as chief, Armstrong says, is the importance of treating people respectfully.

""Some day, they're going to be your backup. When stuff goes south, you're going to need people to support you,"" he says. ""If you're going to be a dick ... when you need help, they aren't going to be there for you.""

One frigid afternoon in February 2013, the only on-duty NAPS officer in Kasabonika Lake First Nation in Ontario's far north detained Lena Anderson, an intoxicated young mother upset over the apprehension of her daughter. The new detachment portable was unheated. The old holding cell was unusable because prisoners could escape through holes in the floor.

The arresting officer left Anderson, 23, in the caged back seat of his Ford 150 police truck for warmth while he went to get help from his off-duty colleague. Alone for 16 minutes, Anderson strangled herself.

The tragedy, combined with a threatened strike over working conditions by NAPS officers, caused an uproar. The situation, says Grand Chief Alvin Fiddler, prompted his Nishnawbe Aski Nation to take a stand. Governments, he said, had to do better or face the far more daunting prospect of doing the policing themselves.

As a result, Fiddler says, a new funding agreement was reached in 2018 that allowed the hiring of 79 new officers over five years and critical infrastructure upgrades to detachments and poor or non-existent communication systems. Most importantly, he said, the deal set in motion pending Ontario legislation that would finally allow First Nations police services to opt in to the Police Services Act, putting in place solid standards and accountability mechanisms.

""That's something our communities and citizens deserve."" Fiddler says. ""If they have an issue with NAPS, there should be a forum for them to pursue their grievance.""

However, giving investigative authority to the province's Special Investigations Unit or Office of the Independent Police Review Director must come with cultural safety built in, he says.

Stephen Leach, current review director, says his office is not yet involved in the opt-in process.

""My expectation is that once the Community Safety and Policing Act is proclaimed and the opt-in process is further along, then I would be involved in explaining how the public complaints process works, and listening to how it might have to be adapted to meet the needs of First Nations communities,"" Leach says.

Stephen Warner, a spokesman for Ontario Solicitor General Sylvia Jones, confirmed the government was working on regulations to the new act. Part of the work, he said, was to set clear and consistent standards for policing delivery ""informed by, and responsive to, the views of the communities that police are both a part of and serve.""

Toronto-based lawyer Julian Falconer calls the new legislation a game changer. Despite having devoted much of his career to holding police accountable, he says he has no qualms in representing NAPS.

Despite, or perhaps because of, their chronic lack of resources, Falconer says Indigenous police behave much differently from their urban counterparts. He cites the dearth of police killings and racist behaviours that have sown deep mistrust of policing among Indigenous, Black and marginalized groups.

""Mainstream policing has a lot to learn from Indigenous policing,"" Falconer said. ""The relationship between community and policing is so dramatically different.""

Here's a look at how much Canadian cities spend on policing,[],2020-07-10 07:30:00-04:00,"TORONTO -- An analysis by CTVNews.ca of 18 of Canada’s largest cities, regions and provincial capitals found more than half allocated 15 per cent or more of their 2020 operating budget to policing, with cities in Western Canada budgeting 20 per cent or more.

Coast-to-coast, from Vancouver to Charlottetown, P.E.I., Canadian cities are spending 15 to 20 per cent or more of their budget on law enforcement, the bulk of it coming from municipal taxes. Cities that do not have a municipal force were excluded from the analysis.

Cries to defund the police have rung out in protests across the United States, sparked by the death of George Floyd, seen in a video pleading and gasping for air as a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee against his neck -- long after he had already gone silent.

Around the world and in Canada, cities are also facing public pressure to reduce their law enforcement budgets to reallocate funds to other areas including mental health and community social support services.

It is a contentious issue, however. Ontario Premier Doug Ford has already dismissed the idea for the Ontario Provincial Police, saying he believes in strengthening policing through better community involvement.

In recent months, several deaths that followed “wellness checks” by Canadian police have sparked further discussion over whether police officers are properly trained or even the appropriate authority to deal with someone having a mental health crisis, in particular those who are Black, Indigenous, or a person of colour.

In June, 62-year-old Ejaz Choudry was killed in his home by police in Mississauga, Ont., after the family said it called a non-emergency helpline because he was having a mental health episode. Paramedics who arrived called the police after Choudry was seen with a knife in his hand. Earlier in the month, Chantel Moore, an Indigenous woman, was shot and killed by police in New Brunswick during another wellness check, while Regis Korchinski-Paquet, a Black, Indigenous woman, fell from her apartment balcony in Toronto last month while police officers were in her home.

BIGGEST POLICE BUDGET IN CANADA

At the end of June, Toronto city council rejected a 10 per cent cut to the police budget, about $107 million, and instead passed a motion on police reform that includes implementing body cameras and overhauling the way Canada’s largest municipal police force responds to people in crisis.

A 10 per cent reduction would have meant cutting about 1,000 police officers, according to the Canadian Press, a move that could take years to implement due to collective bargaining agreements with the union.

The Toronto Police Service operating budget for 2020 is $1.22 billion, about 9 per cent of the city’s $13.53 billion operational budget for 2020. More than $3 billion is distributed for various social support and development programs including employment, social assistance, child-care, long-term care services, helping under-resourced neighbourhoods, housing and shelter support.

In early June, the Vancouver Police Board rejected a motion by city council calling for a 1 per cent cut to the police’s $339 million budget, about 21 per cent of the city’s $1.62 billion operating budget for 2020.

Meanwhile, Edmonton city council approved a motion in early July that included cutting the police service’s budget by $11 million over the next two years amid weeks of debate around police reform.

South of the border, the city of Los Angeles voted on July 1 to cut police department hiring, slashing the LAPD’s budget by US$150 million. The cut brings the department’s staffing down to its lowest level in 12 years, the Los Angeles Times reported. The city said the money would eventually be reallocated into services like hiring programs and summer youth jobs for Black, Latino and other marginalized communities.

BIGGEST LINE ITEM ON THE BUDGET

For cities in Western Canada including Victoria, Vancouver, Saskatoon, Regina, Winnipeg, policing accounts for at least 20 per cent of their 2020 operating budgets. Among them, all but Vancouver have policing as the city’s biggest expenditure. (Utilities is listed as Vancouver’s biggest operating expenditure in its 2020 budget, though annual financial reports show that police is the city’s biggest expense.)

In Victoria, the police force accounts for roughly 23 per cent of the city’s total operating expenses for 2020. For Vancouver, Saskatoon and Regina, it’s just over 20 per cent. Edmonton and Calgary are the exceptions.

The Winnipeg Police Service is getting $304.1 million this year, or 26.6 per cent of the city’s $1.14 billion tax-supported operating expenditures. It is the largest percentage among the cities examined by CTVNews.ca. By comparison, community services in Winnipeg are getting $115 million, or 10 per cent of the budget.

As in many other cities, a petition has been circulating calling for change and defunding the Winnipeg police. Chief Danny Smyth said in June that it was too early to “just say defund the police and forward that all to social services” but added there was room for conversation on what such a move could look like.

Even places with modest budgets, like Charlottetown, P.E.I., which has a budget of $59.7 million, allocates more than 16 per cent to police. In Fredericton, N.B., more than 14 per cent of its $124.4 million budget (including capital expenditures) goes to policing. That portion is more than 18 per cent if capital expenditures are excluded.

In larger southern Ontario, Toronto-area cities and regions including Hamilton, Waterloo, Peel, and York, hundreds of millions of dollars are spent each year on policing. Peel and York, which have similar operating budgets of approximately $2.5 billion, spend about $445.8 million and $384.2 million, respectively, or 17 and 16 per cent. The Waterloo Regional Police, which also serves Kitchener, Ont., accounts for just over 17 per cent of the region’s operating budget. Hamilton’s police budget accounts for nearly 19 per cent of the city’s net operating budget. (That portion is halved however, if calculated based on the tax and rate supported gross operating expenditure).

Nearly all cities that spend roughly 10 per cent or less on policing have operating budgets of at least $1 billion. These include Toronto, Calgary, Ottawa, Quebec City, Montreal and Halifax, which has a budget just shy of a billion.

According to Statistics Canada data, the average salary among municipal police officers was $100,962 for 2017/2018, the latest year in which data is available. And while police spending has increased, the number of police officers per 100,000 people has been shrinking, the data showed.

In the United States, data varies depending on the source, but the percentage allocated to police departments for the 10 largest cities in the country ranged from 6 per cent to 17.4 per cent based on an analysis by U.S. News & World Report. Data compiled by the Center for Popular Democracy, a progressive advocacy group, which includes other cities, showed that percentage ranged as high as 20 to 45 per cent, with such cities as Minneapolis accounting for more than 35 per cent and Milwaukee making up nearly 48 per cent.

One important caveat to note is that cities are all structured differently and may report their finances or categorize their spending differently as well, so a true apples-to-apples comparison is extremely difficult. A few cities include utilities as part of its operating expenses, for example, while many do not.The Canadian police data in this analysis was collected and calculated based on figures presented in 2020 budget proposals and reports released by each city and region. As much as possible, comparable figures were used. In general, total operating budget or expenditure budget excluding capital expenditures as presented in the budget reports were used. In some cases, for example, figures provided may be net of recoveries and/or transfers, terms for certain types of financial transactions in accounting.

This comes as Trudeau spoke to U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday morning, though the border was not among the range of topics the prime minister said the two world leaders discussed — despite the looming July 21 deadline.

""Every month we have been able to extend the border closures to all but essential goods and services and those discussions are ongoing with the United States right now as we are a week from the next deadline for closures,"" Trudeau said.

""We're going to continue to work hard to keep Canadians safe and to keep our economies flowing, we will have more to say later this week I'm sure.""

Canada has been under renewed pressure to reopen the shared border, despite surging COVID-19 case numbers in the United States. At the end of June, the U.S. became home to the world’s highest number of reported infections: more than 2.2 million. That number has since soared to more than 3.3 million, according to the New York Times, with more than 134,000 deaths.

Despite these figures, 29 bipartisan members of U.S. Congress penned an open letter to Public Safety Minister Bill Blair calling on the Canadian government to plan a phased reopening of the Canada-U.S. border and to consider easing existing measures.

""We are asking that the United States and Canada immediately craft a comprehensive framework for phased reopening of the border based on objective metrics and accounting for the varied circumstances across border regions,"" read the letter, which was published on Western New York Congressman Brian Higgins' website on July 3.

The members of Congress, who represent the northern states along the border, also implored the Canadian government to consider easing restrictions on family members and property owners impeded by the restrictions.

The Canadian government pushed back on the request, with Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland's office telling CTVNews.ca in a statement that the health and safety of Canadians is ""absolutely priority.""

""Decisions about Canada's border are made by Canadians, for Canadians,"" Freeland's spokesperson Katherine Cuplinskas said in the statement on Friday.

The suggestion was also unpopular with non-politician Canadians, who took to social media to express their staunch opposition.

In response to a tweet from Higgins, who had shared the open letter on his Twitter account, hundreds of Canadians slammed the suggestion.

""No thank you...clean up your backyard before you attempt to enter ours..sincerely Canada,"" wrote a user who goes by the name @MichelletypoQ.

Another user, @rachelinTO, wrote that ""most of our earliest cases came from the U.S. So......that's a firm 'no'. Sorry, eh.""

Users called the request ""disastrous"" and multiple accounts said they’d only be comfortable easing restrictions after seeing improvement in the number of COVID-19 cases in the U.S.

TRUMP, TRUDEAU DISCUSS TARIFF THREAT

While Trudeau did not give any indication in his press conference that he and Trump had touched on the border issue during their phone call on Monday, he did confirm that the two discussed a host of other issues — including China and the two detained Canadians, the Black Lives Matter movement, and the U.S. president’s renewed aluminium tariff threat.

""I impressed upon him that it would be a shame to see tariffs come in between our two countries at a time where we’re celebrating NAFTA , and at a time where we want our businesses and our manufacturers to get going as quickly as possible,"" Trudeau said.

""We pledged to keep working on it together.""

Trudeau also said he told Trump that the pandemic had disrupted the usual supply chains and manufacturing processes, but that this disruption is slowly subsiding.

""That is starting to realign itself, given the economies are starting up again and manufacturing is getting going,"" Trudeau said.

CTV News confirmed the possibility of the U.S. slapping another set of tariffs on Canada at the end of June. The tariffs would fall under Section 232 of the U.S. Trade Expansion Act, and the threat comes amid U.S. claims that their aluminum market is being flooded by Canadian product.

Two Canadian sources told CTV News at the time that the announcement is possible in the coming weeks, though to date no formal announcement of tariffs has transpired.

Should the U.S. decide to re-impose tariffs on Canada, it would reopen a trade rift between the two countries that had been healing since a spat just over a year ago, that saw the U.S. impose tariffs on steel and aluminum and Canada answer with tariffs on a wide array of U.S. products including quiche, mayonnaise, and toilet paper.

Trudeau has been outspoken in his defence of Canada's aluminum industry, noting when the possibility of the U.S. imposing new tariffs emerged recently, that the U.S. ""needs Canadian aluminum"" and would only be hurting its own economy.

""Our economies are so interlinked that punitive actions by the United States administration end up hurting Americans the same way they end up hurting Canadians,"" Trudeau said at the time.",[]
721,ctvnews,http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/who-s-hiring-a-look-at-the-canadian-job-market-1.5022260,Where the jobs are: Some sectors rebounding faster as Canada emerges from lockdown,['Ryan Flanagan'],2020-07-13 14:39:00-04:00,"TORONTO -- Jobs lost during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic are coming back – but not all at once, and not in the same order they disappeared.

Statistics Canada reported July 10 that more than 950,000 jobs were added in the country in June. While only a small fraction of the three million or so positions that were lost as lockdowns were imposed in March and April, the number represents a record increase as those measures are lifted.

""There's a lot of places that are still hiring amidst all the doom and gloom that we've been experiencing over the past few months,"" Carolyn Levy, president of the technologies division of staffing and recruitment agency Randstad Canada, told CTVNews.ca on Monday via telephone from Calgary.

Breaking down the numbers by industry yields clues into where the first wave of rebound hiring is taking place. More than 20 per cent of the added jobs were classified as wholesale and retail trade – with 16 per cent in accommodation and food services, 12 per cent in health care and social assistance, and eight per cent apiece in construction and manufacturing.

This suggests that the retail and restaurant workers who were among the first to be let go when their establishments were ordered to close were also among the first to be hired back when limited activity was allowed to resume.

There is still a long way to go before those sectors can be back to normal, though. In food services alone, it is believed that 400,000 Canadian jobs eliminated during the pandemic have yet to return. Many businesses in the broader service sector say they do not expect to ever return to pre-pandemic staffing levels.

Also notable, StatCan found, is that there were more wholesale jobs in Canada in June than there were in February, before the pandemic hit. Levy chalked this increase up to the surge in online shopping, which has left companies needing extra staff in warehouses and other parts of the supply chain.

On manufacturing, Levy said the increase could be due to companies retooling their lines to produce personal protective equipment or other items suddenly in demand due to the pandemic.

EMPLOYERS RETHINKING OLD ROLES

For the nearly 2.5 million Canadians who remain unemployed, though, knowing where hiring has recently happened only paints part of the picture. More helpful is information about where hiring is happening now.

According to the federal government's job bank, the most in-demand jobs right now are sales associates, administrative assistants and customer service representatives, followed by truck drivers, general farm workers and light-duty cleaners.

A popular website used by job-seekers to connect with employers is seeing similar patterns. Brendon Bernard, an economist with the Indeed Hiring Lab, wrote July 7 that retail and customer service jobs are among those that saw the biggest drop in new postings on Indeed earlier in the pandemic, and have since seen some of the biggest rebounds.

""Sectors narrowing the gap relatively quickly in recent weeks include ones featuring lower-paying positions, like retail, and customer service,"" he wrote.

""Areas posting roles with many mid-wage jobs have also seen noticeable bounce-backs, like construction, as well as education and instruction.""

Levy said that some employers are also creating new roles as they look to respond to their customers' needs during and after the pandemic. Opportunities created by this include more positions for financial advisers, she said, as well as an even greater demand for tech workers.

Postings on Indeed for higher-paying jobs have been slower to bounce back, Bernard said. Indeed has tracked two categories where new job postings have fallen off since early May – security and public safety, and aviation.

Bernard reported that the number of new job postings on Indeed as of July 3 was 21 per cent lower than it had been one year earlier. That gap had been as large as 70 per cent in mid-April. Smaller provinces, which have generally been less affected by COVID-19, have kept job posting levels closer to where they were in 2019 than larger provinces.

Levy said she is seeing employers increasingly show interest in hiring for temporary contract positions. This benefits them because it allows them to avoid making long-term commitments in an uncertain environment, she said, but can also be good for those looking for jobs because it gives them a chance to find work that they might not otherwise have.

""Companies have had to take a step back and start to reimagine how they have to work in this new normal,"" she said.

""Businesses have to look at what do we need to do to reskill, what do we need to do to retrain, given the way we operated our business four months ago is not the way it's going to be … from now on.""",[]

The body was discovered five days after the 33-year-old Rivera disappeared on Lake Piru, where her son was found July 8 alone a few hours later on a boat the two had rented, the Ventura County Sheriff's Office said.

Authorities would not immediately say if the person found was Rivera, but said the day after she disappeared that they believed she drowned in the lake northwest of Los Angeles. A 2 p.m. press conference was scheduled.

Search crews found the body floating in the northeast area of the lake, authorities said. The body would be flown 40 miles (64 kilometres) to the coroner's office in Ventura, Sheriff's Capt. Eric Buschow said. Rivera's family has been notified of the discovery.

The lake an hour's drive from Los Angeles was searched by dozens of divers working in waters with little visibility, with help from sonar and robotic devices combing the bottom and helicopters and drones searching above.

“I can't imagine what it's like for her parents, her family,” Buschow said. “It takes an emotional toll on the search teams too.”

Rivera played singing cheerleader Santana Lopez for six seasons on the Fox musical-comedy “Glee.”

If she is declared dead, she will become the third major cast member from the show to die in their 30s.

Cory Monteith, one of the show's leads, died at 31 in 2013 from a toxic mix of alcohol and heroin.

And co-star Mark Salling, who Rivera dated at one point, killed himself in 2018 at age 35 after pleading guilty to child pornography charges.

Rivera had experience boating on the lake in Los Padres National Forest, authorities said.

Surveillance video shows Rivera and her son, Josey Hollis Dorsey, leaving on the rented boat.

When the boat failed to return, its vendor found the vessel drifting in the northern end of the lake late Wednesday afternoon with the boy asleep on board. He told investigators that he and his mother had been swimming and he got back into the boat but she didn't, according to a sheriff's office statement.

The boy was wearing a life vest, and another life jacket was found in the boat along with Rivera's purse and identification.

Rivera is believed to have drowned “in what appears to be a tragic accident,” the statement said.

The boy, Rivera's son from her marriage to actor Ryan Dorsey, was safe and healthy and with family members, authorities said. The couple finalized their divorce in June 2018 after nearly four years of marriage.

The most recent tweet on Rivera's account, from July 7, read “just the two of us” along with a photo of her and her son.

723,ctvnews,http://www.ctvnews.ca/world/jewishprivilege-hashtag-trends-on-twitter-as-users-fight-back-against-anti-semitism-1.5022216,'JewishPrivilege' hashtag trends on Twitter as users fight back against anti-Semitism,[],2020-07-13 14:17:00-04:00,"TORONTO -- The anti-Semitic hashtag 'JewishPrivilege' was trending on Twitter Monday after Jewish people took it over to share their experiences of discrimination, with one expert saying such hatred is still 'alive and well' in Canada today.

According to Jewish News, the trend first started Sunday night when Israeli writer and activist Hen Mazzig shared his family's experience with anti-Semitism after others used the hashtag to accuse Jewish people of being ""privileged.""

""#JewishPrivilege is when my grandparents were violently forced out of Iraq and Tunisia for being Jewish with only the clothes to their back. Along with 850,000 other MENA [Middle East and North Africa] Jews they arrived to Israel with nothing, only spoke Arabic, and lived in a tent/tin shack for years,"" Mazzig tweeted.

""I want all my Jewish followers to share the 'Jewish Privilege' them and their families experienced.""

Noah Shack, vice president of the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs (CIJA), told CTVNews.ca that #JewishPrivilege has, for years, existed as an anti-Semitic hashtag used primarily by conspiracy theorists.

""A lot of these tropes are well known about Jews controlling media and government, and the economy and unfortunately, a lot of these conspiracy theories have ended in the past with violence,"" Shack told CTVNews.ca in a phone interview on Monday.

""We're seeing a lot of traction on the hashtag now because Jewish people have sort of taken it over to discuss those experiences of persecution that have come about as a result of anti-Semitism, not just as something in the past but of course something that's very much alive and well today.""

After Mazzig's tweet, many others joined in on the conversation including stand-up comedian Sarah Silverman who said she experienced other children ""throwing pennies at me on the bus"" and had ""pastors in Florida calling for my death and telling their congregation that knocking my teeth out and killing me would be God’s work.""

Comedian David Baddiel tweeted that ""Jews don't always feel white, if by white you mean, to put it bluntly, safe."" Baddiel explained that he was just 12-years-old when he overheard a new teacher call him a 'Jew' and others agreed. He added that ""this is without getting into most of my mum’s family being murdered.""

Dov Hikind, founder of the campaigning organization Americans Against Antisemitism, also used the hashtag to tweet: ""I had the #JewishPrivilege of growing up without grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins because my parents’ friends were nearly entirely wiped out by Hitler.""

The hashtag has been used more than 100,000 times on Twitter as of Monday afternoon, trending in the U.S., Israel, the U.K. and Canada.

Shack said anti-Semitism is ""not just a relic of the past"" and that countries such as Canada, the U.S. and the U.K. are seeing a rise in discrimination against Jewish people.

""I am enjoying a life in Canada today, because a couple of generations ago somebody had the good fortune to be able to flee murderous persecution,"" Shack explained. ""Despite the fact that we live in such a wonderful open diverse and vibrant democracy here in Canada, I can't help but worry whether or not my children will be the next generation that's forced to flee.""

While Jewish people are using the hashtag to bring awareness to discrimination, a number of organizations expressed concerns online that hashtag is drawing attention to those tweeting anti-Semitic comments.

Danny Stone, the CEO of the Antisemitism Policy Trust, tweeted ""That #JewishPrivilege is trending makes me feel sick. It may not be a hate term but Twitter should know what this does to communities.""

The Campaign Against Antisemitism (CAAS) also criticized Twitter for not taking action to curb anti-Semitism on the platform, claiming that the social media site has a ""long record of enabling racism against Jews.""

""The idea that Jews are a 'privileged' group is a slur designed to deny that antisemitism exists and to imply that Jews are a cause of racism towards other minorities,"" the CAAS tweeted.

However, Shack said the attention the hashtag is getting is a ""good thing"" as it will amplify Jewish voices and ""drown out those of the anti-Semites.""

""It's important that people take note that this isn't something that just gets swept under the rug and that Canadians, Jews and non-Jews alike stand together and call it out and make it absolutely clear that this kind of hate [and] discrimination has no place in Canada,"" Shack said.

""Whether it's directed towards Jewish people, or any other people, it's just not what we're about here.""",[]
724,ctvnews,http://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/feds-to-extend-wage-subsidy-program-until-december-1.5021990,Feds to extend wage subsidy program until December,[],2020-07-13 12:03:00-04:00,"OTTAWA -- The Liberal government will extend the wage subsidy program until December, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on Monday.

This marks the second extension of the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS). On May 15, the government added an additional 12 weeks to the program, extending eligibility to August 29.

""For the last three months, you’ve seen me come out to talk with Canadians about what we’re doing to help you and your family, your employer, your local businesses deal with this pandemic. We’re going to continue to do that vital work,"" said Trudeau during a press briefing outside Rideau Cottage in Ottawa.

Announced on March 27, the CEWS provides qualifying businesses and non-profits funding for 75 per cent of employee wages, retroactive from March 15.

The objective of the program is to keep employees on the payroll so businesses can rebound more quickly when restrictions are lifted and the economy restarts. The CEWS had a slow uptake, but has increased in popularity as more Canadians transition off of the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.

In an interview on CTV’s Question Period in May, Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough attributed the program’s rocky start to barriers in the application process.

""It’s been slower than expected. I think businesses are having to put a lot of time and effort into their applications because you have to dig into your payroll – who earned what and when,"" she said.

Since then, the government has been consulting with the business community and promoting its benefit amid calls from opposition that the Liberal’s are disincentivizing Canadians from returning to work as CERB application numbers balloon.

As of July 5, just under 19 million Canadians had applied for the benefit and more than $54 billion had been paid out.

The new $82. 3 billion CEWS projection, outlined in last Wednesday’s fiscal snapshot, is a stark increase from the original $45 billion estimate.

As of July 6, 581,800 out of a total of 587, 060 submissions had been approved. This equates to slightly more than $18 billion.",[]

""There's a reason why they call liver disease the silent killer,"" said Dr. Mark Swain, a University of Calgary liver specialist who led a study published recently in the online journal CMAJ Open.

""It's because liver disease broadly has no symptoms.""

Liver cells are like balloons that can fill with fat over time, especially when someone is obese, he said.

The paper notes an estimated one-quarter of Canadians over the age of 20 have this condition, called nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD.

Swain, who directs the university's gastroenterology and hepatology division, said physicians have historically treated it as relatively benign because liver fat usually just sits there and doesn't do much.

But about three to five per cent of those with the disease go on to develop a more problematic condition called nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH. In those cases, Swain said, an immune response can trigger inflammation, which can lead to scarring or even cancer.

Swain and other researchers with the The Canadian NASH Network, a coalition of doctors focused on the disease, used trends in obesity rates to forecast the prevalence of fatty liver disease in the Canadian population between 2019 and 2030.

The study found cases of NAFLD are on track to rise 20 per cent in that time frame and that its more advanced form, NASH, is projected to rise by 35 per cent.

Cases of liver failure, liver cancer and the need for transplants are expected to rise by a total of 65 per cent to 579,000 by 2030.

Deaths are expected to double to 49,100 in that time.

""There has been a conditioning amongst many health-care professionals that it's not of concern,"" said Swain.

""We really need to be better at increasing awareness, both in the population and amongst health-care professionals and allied health-care workers, that this is an issue.""

A dollar figure for the cost-burden on the health-care system has not been calculated in Canada, but Swain expects it would be ""astronomical.""

Dr. Diana Mager, an associate professor of clinical nutrition at the University of Alberta, said patients are often surprised to find out that they even have fatty liver disease. Symptoms, like a sore abdomen, don't show up until it's well advanced, she said.

""People walk around for years with NAFLD and don't know they have it.""

The biggest culprits seem to be processed foods and sugary drinks, she said. Mager, who specializes in pediatric patients, said fatty liver disease has been showing up in children and adolescents.

A more wholesome diet and more active lifestyle can reverse the disease in its early stages, she said.

There's some debate as to whether the same holds for when the disease is more advanced. But, at the very least, lifestyle changes can slow its progression, said Mager, who also chairs the Canadian Liver Foundation's national education advisory committee.

Simply telling people to go on a diet and lose weight isn't enough, she said.

""It's one thing to tell the Canadian public, 'Don't eat this and don't eat that.'

""But if there isn't an availability of affordable healthy foods, then that's a problem. You can't expect a family, if they can't afford to purchase those foods, to be able to consume those foods on a regular basis.""

726,ctvnews,http://www.ctvnews.ca/sports/washington-nfl-team-dropping-redskins-name-long-denounced-as-slur-after-87-years-1.5021524,"Washington NFL team dropping 'Redskins' name, long denounced as slur, after 87 years",['Stephen Whyno'],2020-07-13 01:10:00-04:00,"WASHINGTON -- The Washington NFL franchise announced Monday it is dropping the “Redskins” name and Indian head logo, bowing to recent pressure from sponsors and decades of criticism that they are offensive to Native Americans.

A new name must still be selected for one of the oldest and most storied teams in the National Football League, and it was unclear how soon that will happen. But for now, arguably the most polarizing name in North American professional sports is gone at a time of reckoning over racial injustice, iconography and racism in the U.S.

The move came less than two weeks after owner Dan Snyder, a boyhood fan of the team who once declared he would never get rid of the name, launched a “thorough review” amid pressure from sponsors. FedEx, Nike, Pepsi and Bank of America all lined up against the name, which was given to the franchise in 1933 when the team was still based in Boston.

“The NFL and Dan Snyder, we have to commend them on making the right call to change the name,” said Oneida Indian Nation Representative Ray Halbritter, leader of the “Change the Mascot” campaign. “Dan Snyder won today because now he has a legacy that will be different from the racial slur that was the team name. I know that's not an easy thing to do, but it was the right thing to do.”

The team said it is “retiring” the name and logo and that Snyder and coach Ron Rivera are working closely to develop a new moniker and design. The announcement came on the old letterhead with the Redskins name because the team technically retains it until a new one is chosen and approved.

Native American advocates and experts have long criticized the name they call a “dictionary-defined racial slur.” Over a dozen Native leaders and organizations wrote to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell last week demanding an immediate end to Washington's use of the name. Goodell, who has fielded questions on the topic for years, said he supported the review.

Protests against the name predate Snyder buying the team in 1999, and, until now, he had shown no willingness to consider a change. Strong words from sponsors - including a company run by a minority stakeholder of the team - changed the equation.

FedEx earlier this month became the first sponsor to announce it had asked the organization to change the name, particularly important because CEO Frederick Smith owns part of the team. FedEx paid $205 million for the long-term naming rights to the team's stadium in Landover, Maryland.

The lease at FedEx Field expires in 2027, and dropping the name keeps open various possibilities in Maryland, Virginia and Washington for the team's new stadium and headquarters. District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser has said the name was an “obstacle” to Snyder building on the old RFK Stadium site, which is believed to be his preference.

The team recently started cutting ties with racist founder George Preston Marshall, removing his name from the Ring of Fame and renaming the lower bowl at FedEx Field for the team's first Black player, late Hall of Famer Bobby Mitchell. Marshall, who renamed the Boston Braves the Redskins in 1933 and moved the team to D.C. four years later, was a segregationist and the last NFL owner to integrate his team. The current logo shows the profile of a red-faced Native American with feathers in his hair.

Major League Baseball's Atlanta Braves and the National Hockey League's Chicago Blackhawks have said they have no inclination to change their names. Some advocates would like to see all Native American names, mascots and imagery out of sports.

“Our fight continues,” Crystal Echo Hawk of the Native American advocacy group IllumiNative said in a statement. “We will not rest until the offensive use of Native imagery, logos and names are eradicated from professional, collegiate and (other school) sports. The time is now to stand in solidarity and declare that racism will not be tolerated.”

Halbritter said it was important to note those other names are not a slur, but he hopes a “broader discussion” can be had. He pointed out that Florida State spoke with the Seminole tribe about its name, the same thing a minor league baseball team in Spokane, Washington, did with local Native Americans.

It was not immediately clear if the organization is consulting Native Americans on a new name or if any imagery will even be used.

“I think it's striking that the NFL and other owners of other sports teams don't have a conversation with Native America on these names,” Halbritter said. “It's about respect, and I don't understand why they just don't have a conversation with the affected people.”

Long removed from the glory days of winning Super Bowl titles in the 1982, 1987 and 1991 seasons under coach Joe Gibbs, Washington's NFL team has just five playoff appearances in 21 years and no postseason victories since 2005. The team has lacked a nationally marketable player since Robert Griffin III's short-lived stardom, and the 2020 schedule features zero prime-time games for a franchise that used to be a draw.

Re-branding with a new name and logo - and perhaps the same burgundy and gold colours - coupled with turning football operations over to Rivera could be a boon for Snyder on and off the field. Even if a segment of the fan base opposes the change in the name of tradition, winning would more than make up for those losses.",[]

She was 57.

Travolta said in an Instagram post that his wife of 28 years died after a two-year battle with breast cancer.

""It is with a very heavy heart that I inform you that my beautiful wife Kelly has lost her two-year battle with breast cancer,"" Travolta said. ""She fought a courageous fight with the love and support of so many.""

The couple had three children together.

""Shocked by this sad news,"" Maria Shriver said on Twitter. ""Kelly was such a bright loving soul, a talented actress, and a loving mom and wife. My heart breaks for her family who have already known such sadness and grief.""

Born Kelly Kamalelehua Smith on Oct. 13, 1962, in Honolulu, Hawaii, Preston had a lengthy acting career in movies and television beginning in the 1980s, including the 1985 teen comedy ""Mischief,"" 1986's ""Space Camp"" and her breakthrough, 1988's ""Twins."" Preston played Marnie, the woman who marries Schwarzenegger's character.

Preston was first married to actor Kevin Gage. They divorced in 1987.

The year after, Preston met Travolta while shooting the 1989 film ""The Experts,"" a box-office flop about a Soviet KGB agent who hires hip New Yorkers to update the spy program's understanding of American society. They meet on the dance floor after Travolta asks, ""Does anyone here know how to dance."" Preston responds: ""I know how to dance.""

They were married in 1991 at a midnight ceremony in Paris while expecting their first son, Jett.

Preston starred opposite Kevin Costner in the 1999 film ""For the Love of the Game."" In 2003, she starred in ""What a Girl Wants"" and as the mom in the live-action adaptation of ""The Cat in the Hat."" The following year she appeared in the music video for Maroon 5's ""She Will Be Loved.""

Preston gave one of her most well-received performances in ""Jerry Maguire"" as the ex-fiancee of Cruise's sports agent who dumps him early in the movie. The Daily News called her ""icily effective.""

On Monday, Russell Crowe recalled knowing Preston in the '90s. He said he hadn't seen her much since, ""but when I did, she was always the same sparkly eyed gem.""

Preston occasionally appeared in films with her husband, though the results were seldom among either's best work. Among them: the box-office bomb ""Battlefield Earth"" in 2000 and the 2009 Disney comedy ""Old Dogs,"" also with their daughter, Ella Bleu.

In January 2009, Jett Travolta, 16, died after a seizure at the family's vacation home in the Bahamas. The death touched off a court case after an ambulance driver and his attorney were accused of trying to extort $25 million from the actors in exchange for not releasing sensitive information about their son's death.

Travolta testified during a criminal trial that ended in a mistrial and was prepared to testify a second time, but decided to stop pursuing the case and it was dismissed. He cited the severe strain the proceedings and his son's death had caused the family.

Both Preston and Travolta returned to acting, with Preston's first role back in the Nicholas Sparks adaptation, ""The Last Song,"" which starred Miley Cyrus and her future husband, Liam Hemsworth.

In addition to Jett and Ella Bleu, who was born in 2000, the couple had son Benjamin in 2010. Ella wrote on Instagram Sunday: ""I have never met anyone as courageous, strong, beautiful and loving as you. Anyone who is lucky enough to have known you or to have ever been in your presence will agree that you have a glow and a light that never ceases to shine and that makes anyone around you feel instantly happy.""

The couple last starred together in the 2018 film ""Gotti,"" with Travolta playing John Gotti and Preston playing the crime boss's wife, Victoria.

""Kelly's love and life will always be remembered,"" Travolta said on Instagram. ""I will be taking some time to be there for my children who have lost their mother, so forgive me in advance if you don't hear from us for a while. But please know that I will feel your outpouring of love in the weeks and months ahead as we heal.""

Leona Alleslev made the announcement on Twitter on Monday morning, as the party's four leadership candidates look to shore up last-minute support before the August 21 deadline for mail-in ballots.

""Canada faces an uncertain future. Canada needs a leader who has the experience and a plan to tackle the priorities of our time. That is why Peter MacKay has my support,"" reads the tweet.

On Sunday evening, Alleslev made her decision to step down as deputy party leader public, citing a need to engage in the final weeks of the campaign.

""The selection of the next leader of the Conservative Party of Canada is too important a decision for me to stand to the side. Today, I am stepping down as Deputy Leader of her Majesty’s Loyal Opposition to engage more actively in the leadership campaign,"" the tweet reads.

Alleslev was appointed deputy leader by Andrew Scheer in November, 2019, about a year after causing a stir in the House of Commons when she crossed the floor, swapping her Liberal badge for a Tory one.

""I stand here today deeply concerned for the future of our country. After three years of hope and hard work, I find myself asking: Am I doing everything I can to serve the citizens of Aurora—Oak Ridges—Richmond Hill and my country?,"" Alleslev said when delivering her announcement in the House in September, 2018.

""My attempts to raise my concerns with the government were met with silence. It is my duty to stand and be counted. Our country is at risk.""

The Ontario MP quickly adapted to her role under the opposition tent, grilling her former colleagues for their foreign affairs policy and most recently for their pandemic response.

She was steadfast in her loyalty to Scheer and defended his positioning on social conservative issues during the fall federal election campaign.

In an interview on CTV’s Question Period shortly after she became deputy leader, she questioned the allegiance of Scheer critics who railed against the leader for his campaign performance and shed doubt on his ability to lead following the party’s devastating loss.

""I think that there are certain obviously disgruntled people and I'm very disappointed in them, because if they really cared about the country and they really cared about the conservative movement, they would wait for the external review that we are investing in, to find out exactly where we can do better and what we did wrong,"" Alleslev said at the time.

In her resignation letter Sunday, she celebrated her party’s recent accomplishments and expressed her commitment to help build a strong Tory base.

""Together, our Conservative team has held the government to account and challenged them to address critical policy flaws that they had failed to consider or deliberately neglected,"" reads the letter.

""Canada faces an uncertain future. The Conservative Party of Canada is in the process of choosing a new leader that will guide us through the nation’s next chapter.""

Peter MacKay, Erin O’Toole, Leslyn Lewis and Derek Sloan are vying to replace Scheer from the party’s top post. MacKay, a former cabinet minister, and O’Toole, a sitting MP, are widely considered to be the front-runners.

Alleslev represents a part of the old riding that once belonged to MacKay’s former partner and Conservative turned Liberal MP Belinda Stronach.",[]

The London-based influencer's family confirmed the news on Sunday in an Instagram post, stating that Thea's unborn son had also died.

""To all Nicole's friends and supporters it is with great sadness that I have to inform you that Nicole and her son she and Boga named Reign sadly passed away on Saturday morning,"" the statement read.

The message explained that Thea had pre-scheduled ""a few YouTube videos"" to upload on her channel before her death, and her boyfriend, Boga, had ""made the decision to allow them to be aired.""

The family asked for privacy, saying ""our hearts are truly broken and we are struggling to cope with what has happened.""

The cause of Thea's death is not yet known. The former dancer was around eight months pregnant.

Thea announced her pregnancy back in April with an Instagram video showing off her baby bump while dancing beside Boga.

""We can't hide this any longer, secrets out... GOD gave us the biggest blessing yet. I'm finally creating a beautiful little human inside of me,"" the accompanying caption read. ""Can't believe this bubba will be half of me and half of the loml. Honestly, @global_boga has been the best support EVER and GOD made no mistakes making him the father.""

She added: ""We are already obsessed with you our little miracle baby. Thank you for choosing us to be your parents and best friends.""

Thea had amassed more than 80,000 subscribers on her YouTube channel, where she often discussed her pregnancy journey and posted content featuring boyfriend Global Boga -- real name Jeffery Frimpong -- who is a street dancer.

Her most recent video, titled ""GOT IN A BATH FULL OF MILK! *BTS PREGNANCY SHOOT,"" was uploaded on Sunday.

In the 14-minute footage, Thea can be seen getting ready for her milk bath, while talking her followers through the process. She also showcased special moments from her maternity photoshoot.

On Saturday morning, Boga shared a video of himself dancing with a baby carriage and said in a post the week before that he believed his son was arriving ""on a Monday.""",[]

The moves to undercut Fauci come just days after he gave an unvarnished look at his relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump, including that they have not spoken in weeks.

The tension between the two men -- who are no longer speaking, CNN reported last week -- has grown publicly as they have responded to one another through interviews and statements. But recent moves by the White House to publicly diminish the nation's top infectious disease expert amounts to a significant escalation as it seeks to divert attention from the government's failure to contain the coronavirus and instead push Trump's call to reopen the country. That effort continued Monday morning, when the President retweeted a baseless claim by game show host Chuck Woolery that ""everyone is lying"" about the coronavirus -- including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

In a statement Saturday, a White House official told CNN that ""several White House officials are concerned about the number of times Dr. Fauci has been wrong on things."" The official went on to provide a lengthy list of examples, citing Fauci's comments early in the pandemic and linking to past interviews.

These bullet points, which resembled opposition research on a political opponent, included Fauci downplaying the virus early on and a quote from March when Fauci said, ""People should not be walking around with masks,"" among other comments. Not included were previous statements from the surgeon general urging people not to buy masks or an acknowledgment of the President's own false claims and misstatements about the virus.

Fauci did not return a request for comment by CNN. But in a recent series of newspaper and radio interviews, Fauci, who has worked under six U.S. presidents from both parties, has at times openly disagreed with Trump.

In particular, a recent interview with the Financial Times in which Fauci disclosed that he has not briefed the President in weeks prompted the White House to distribute the list of Fauci statements, an aide familiar with the matter said. Among other things, Fauci disputed Trump's claim that ""99%"" of coronavirus cases in the United States were ""totally harmless"" -- saying that was ""obviously not the case"" -- and drew a connection between his insistence on ""speaking the truth at all times"" to his noticeably diminished television appearances.

A person familiar with the situation acknowledged that Fauci has been appearing on television less frequently because Trump is annoyed by his public statements. Though Trump was already miffed by Fauci's television appearances early on, the White House has sought to downplay tension between the two for several months. The press shop stopped approving Fauci's television appearances, believing it would help alleviate the situation, though they continued to allow him to give interviews with print outlets.

Another person familiar has said the rare in-person meetings between Trump and Fauci are not awkward and don't involve raised voices, but Trump has complained about Fauci privately. Sources say part of that irritation is over the ""good press"" Fauci has received. Trump's irritation with Fauci has also, at times, been encouraged by Peter Navarro, Trump's trade adviser who has repeatedly blamed Fauci for doubting the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine.

Navarro once told Fauci he would be personally responsible if it was later shown that hydroxychloroquine worked to treat coronavirus, despite multiple studies questioning its use.

One senior administration official told CNN that some officials within the White House do not trust Fauci. According to the source, those officials think Fauci doesn't have the best interest of the President, pointing to some of Fauci's interviews. Other administration officials have told CNN that while they have disagreements with Fauci's methods, they don't doubt his motives, and that his only concern was public health.

In an interview on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" Sunday, Adm. Brett Giroir, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, said there is ""open discourse"" within the team.

""I respect Dr. Fauci a lot, but Dr. Fauci is not 100% right and he also doesn't necessarily -- and he admits that -- have the whole national interest in mind. He looks at it from a very narrow public health point of view,"" Giroir said.

Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs at Health and Human Services Michael Caputo said Sunday there was no White House-versus-the scientists narrative.

""We have great faith in the capacity of all of our scientists and doctors on the coronavirus taskforce to impart necessary public health information. People like Admiral (Brett) Giroir, Surgeon General (Jerome) Adams and others are carrying these messages very effectively,"" Caputo said in the statement, although he did not directly answer questions about Fauci.

Fauci is scheduled to be in the West Wing Monday for meetings.

TRUMP PUBLICLY CRITICIZES FAUCI

Trump -- who in April retweeted a message calling for Fauci to be fired, though he later downplayed the significance of the message when asked -- has recently intensified his public criticism of Fauci in recent weeks.

""Dr. Fauci is a nice man, but he's made a lot of mistakes,"" Trump said last week, undermining the public health expert whom Americans say in polls they trust more than the President.

In recent interviews, he openly questioned the advice he'd received from Fauci at the start of the outbreak.

""I think we are in a good place. I disagree with him,"" Trump said in an interview Tuesday when questioned about Fauci's assertion the U.S. is still ""knee-deep in the first wave"" of the pandemic.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, said Sunday evening that any effort by the White House to sideline or discredit Fauci is ""just atrocious.""

Schiff told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on ""The Situation Room"" that such a move ""is so characteristic of Donald Trump. He can't stand the fact that the American people trust Dr. Fauci and they don't trust Donald Trump -- and so he has to tear him down.""

""We need people more than ever to speak truth to power, to be able to level with the American people about what we're facing with this pandemic, how to get it under control, how to protect ourselves and our families,"" Schiff continued. ""That's what Dr. Fauci has been trying to do and by sidelining him the President is once again interfering with an effective response to this pandemic.""

Kathleen Sebelius, who served as secretary of Health and Human Services under former President Barack Obama, told CNN efforts to discredit Fauci and other scientists are ""potentially very, very dangerous"" as the US and other countries work toward a coronavirus vaccine.

""I think people want to know from the scientists that the vaccine is safe, that it is effective, that it will not do more harm than good,"" she told Blitzer on ""The Situation Room.""

""And if the public scientists have been discredited, if the President says 'don't believe them, you can't listen to them, they're often wrong,' we have then undermined a national vaccination campaign which is an essential step to bringing this horrible period to an end.""

Prosecutors made the revelation in court papers as they argued there is no reason to free Ghislaine Maxwell on bail.

The 58-year-old British socialite has been held without bail since her recent arrest at a $1 million New Hampshire estate she bought late last year.

Prosecutors told a Manhattan federal judge in written arguments that at least one woman and possibly more were expected to exercise their right to appear at Tuesday's hearing and ask that Maxwell be detained until trial.

“The Government is deeply concerned that if the defendant is bailed, the victims will be denied justice in this case,” prosecutors wrote.

The filing came a day before an arraignment and bail hearing for Maxwell, who has been held for the last week at a federal jail in Brooklyn.

On Friday, her lawyers filed arguments that said she's being made a scapegoat after Epstein killed himself in a Manhattan lockup last August. They said she should be freed on $5 million bail with electronic monitoring.

“Ghislaine Maxwell,” they wrote, “is not Jeffrey Epstein.”

They said their client denies any allegations of misconduct, has had no contact with Epstein for more than a decade and has never been charged with a crime or found liable in civil litigation stemming from the allegations against Epstein.

Prosecutors noted that Maxwell's defence lawyers proposed offering as collateral property their client owns in the United Kingdom, but they said that was beyond the reach of U.S. authorities.

Epstein was arrested in July 2019 and was awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges of women and girls in Florida and New York in the early 2000s when he died by suicide in custody.",[]

""We're targeting August, maybe early September,"" he said in a recent interview.

""I was even shocked when (the doctor) told me. I met him last week and I asked him for a ballpark time frame. And he said August, and I said 'Oh, OK.' I wasn't quite ready for that.""

Thompson moved to Ontario from British Columbia in April to prepare for the surgery in London. It involves medical and psychological tests, as well as finding a donor.

If things go as planned, Thompson will be Canada's first double-hand transplant patient.

Thompson had all of his limbs amputated after contracting bacterial meningitis and septic shock in 2015.

He left work early one day in May, after feeling like he was coming down with the flu, and decided to sleep it off. A few hours later, he woke up to get a drink of water.

""But when I stood up my feet were like on fire. I could barely walk. I made it downstairs to where my wife Rita was watching TV. And that's pretty well the last thing I remember. I just collapsed on the floor.""

He woke up six weeks later in intensive care, confronted with the choice of dying in palliative care or amputation.

""If I wanted to survive, I would need all four limbs amputated,"" he said.

""In the end, the will to live is stronger than anything else.""

After 8 1/2 hours of surgery, doctors had amputated his limbs.

""That was a difficult time, obviously, because you know, you wake up as a different person. You look down and all you see is bandages ... where your hands used to be or where your legs and feet used to be,"" he said.

""The first thing that came to my mind was, what did I just do?""

After learning about hand transplants two years ago, Thompson met with a team of doctors in Ontario to assess whether he would make a suitable candidate.

""It's life changing,"" he said.

""Being able to shake someone's hand, being able to pick up a cup of coffee with one hand, write your name with a pen, open a door, you know, just the things that we take for granted every day.""

Dr. Steven McCabe, who performed Canada's first hand transplant, may participate in the surgery. He is a hand surgeon at Toronto Western Hospital and an associate professor at the University of Toronto.

The surgery can take 10 to 12 hours with four teams of surgeons. Each team consists of six to 10 people.

While operating on both hands makes the surgery logistically harder because it involves more people, McCabe said it is ""logical"" to do the two transplants at the same time.

""When you transplant, you're introducing this different tissue,"" he explained. ""And the theory behind that is that you don't want to introduce two different donor tissues.""

A person who undergoes a transplant has to take immunosuppressants, so the body doesn't reject the new organ or limb, and it's easier when surgery is done all at once, he said.

""So if you transplanted one limb, and then three months or a year later, the other one, you'd have to go through that again. The idea is to get that all over with one donor.""

But there's also another reason.

""Having one hand when you have none is a huge benefit,"" McCabe said.

""But if you're going to have that type of surgery, and it seems logical to transplant both hands, part of the sense of wholeness is restored. It seems to be very important for patients.""

There are risks associated with the surgery, including infections and the possibility of blood loss. But McCabe said the benefits outweigh the risks, and limb transplants have low rejection rates.

After the surgery, transplant patients face a long recovery, he added.

""If you transplant the limb near the elbow, it will take a few months for the muscles to start to work again, and maybe up to a year or more for the nerves to get down to the fingers to have some feeling,"" McCabe said. ""So, I think we would say, you can't judge whether it's really helped or not for at least a couple years.""

Thompson said unlike most organ transplants, a hand transplant is visible.

""It's physically there. So getting over the mental challenge is going to be the hardest one, because you know they belonged to someone else at one point and now they're on your body,"" Thompson said.

""You have to look at it as a gift ... (the donor) family has decided to give you this gift. And it's a gift I'm not going to waste.""

The liftoff of the UAE's Mars orbiter named Amal, or Hope, on a Japanese H-IIA rocket is scheduled for early Wednesday from the Tanegashima Space Center in southern Japan, in what would be the Arab world's first interplanetary mission.

A final decision will be made Tuesday before the roll out of the rocket, said Keiji Suzuki, launch site director for Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.

A seasonal rain front was expected to cause intermittent lightning and rain over the next few days, he said.

""But this thunder is not expected to be severe or lasting, and our assessment is that there will be a chance for a launch,"" Suzuki told an online briefing Monday from Tanegashima. ""We will make a careful decision based on data.""

Heavy rain has continued for more than a week in large areas of Japan, triggering mudslides and floods and killing more than 70 people, most of them on the southern main island of Kyushu.

Hope is set to reach Mars in February 2021, the year the UAE celebrates 50 years since its formation. A successful Hope mission would be a major step for the oil-dependent economy seeking a future in space.

Hope carries three instruments to study the upper atmosphere and monitor climate change and is scheduled to circle the red planet for at least two years.

Emirates Mars Mission Project Director Omran Sharaf, who joined Monday's briefing from Dubai, said the mission is not just a repeat of what other countries have done. It will provide a complete view of the Martian atmosphere during different seasons for the first time, he said.

Two other Mars missions are planned in coming days by the U.S. and China. Japan has its own Martian moon mission planned in 2024.",[]

Locals said waves of waste -- mostly plastic bottles, fishing nets and buoys -- floated ashore late Saturday. They spotted turtle carcasses among the sand dunes early Sunday.

Bangladesh's forestry department said it was the first time such a large volume of plastic had washed onto the 120-kilometre beach along the Bay of Bengal.

""Hundreds of locals rushed to the beach since early morning to rescue the wounded turtles,"" forestry spokesman Sohail Hossain told AFP.

""We have buried the dead ones and are trying to release the rescued turtles back to sea.""

Beach clean-up charity Plastic Bank Bangladesh said their volunteers found and buried at least 20 Olive Ridley turtles among the estimated 50 tonnes of waste spread out over a 10 kilometre stretch of the beach at Cox's Bazar.

""I haven't seen these many dead turtles lying on the beach in my life and also haven't seen such a massive pile of waste floating ashore,"" fisherman Jashim Uddin told AFP.

Leading Bangladesh turtle and tortoise expert Shahriar Caesar Rahman of the NGO Creative Conservation Alliance said most of the turtles were at least 30 years old.

""The turtles often get trapped in gigantic waste patches floating in the sea and eventually die of suffocation. This seems to be a similar case,"" he told AFP.

About 26 tonnes of waste produced from ships and neighbouring countries float into Bay of Bengal every year, said Moazzem Hossain of local conservation charity Save the Nature Bangladesh.

""This is a unique case of plastic invasion. It sends a great danger signal to our marine biodiversity,"" he said.

It was not clear how many turtles were rescued.

Local district administrator Kamal Hossain said authorities were investigating the incident.

Olive Ridleys are the most abundant of all sea turtles around the world, according to conservationists.

But their numbers have been declining and the species is recognised as vulnerable by the IUCN Red list.",[]

The case, brought by Amnesty International in January, called on the court to prevent NSO from selling its technology abroad, especially to repressive regimes.

The Tel Aviv District Court ruled that Amnesty's attorneys did not provide sufficient evidence ""to prove the claim that an attempt was made to track a human rights activist by trying to hack his cellphone"" or that the hacking was done by NSO.

""Granting a license is done after the most rigorous process and also after granting the permit, the authority conducts oversight and close inspection, as necessary,"" the court said. If human rights are found to be violated, that permit can be suspended or cancelled, it added.

The court issued its ruling on Sunday, but only made it public on Monday.

Gil Naveh, spokesman for Amnesty International Israel, said the group was disappointed but not surprised.

""It's been a longstanding tradition for the Israeli courts to be a rubber stamp for the Israeli Ministry of Defence,"" he said.

The group doesn't know what evidence NSO or the Defence Ministry gave to the court, because the hearings were closed. ""Even if we knew, we were not able to talk about it,"" he said.

In 2018, Amnesty claimed one of its employees was targeted by NSO's malware, saying a hacker tried to break into the staffer's smartphone, using a WhatsApp message about a protest in front of the Saudi Embassy in Washington as bait.

NSO, an Israeli hacker-for-hire company, uses its Pegasus spyware to take control of a phone, its cameras and microphones, and mine the user's personal data.

The company has been accused of selling its surveillance software to repressive governments that use it against dissidents. It doesn't disclose clients, but they are believed to include Middle Eastern and Latin American states. The company says it sells its technology to Israeli-approved governments to help them combat criminals and terrorism.

NSO Group said in a statement that the company ""will continue to work to provide technology to states and intelligence organizations,"" adding that its purpose is to ""save human lives.""

In a report published last month, Amnesty International said Moroccan journalist Omar Radi's phone was tapped using NSO's technology as part of the government's efforts to clamp down on dissent.

A Saudi dissident has accused NSO of involvement in Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi's killing in 2018.",[]

For many families the thought of discussing money can make them uneasy and is often a taboo subject. In fact, this conversation doesn't discriminate -- wealthy, poor, young or old no one likes to open themselves up and share their financial situation, especially if it is challenging.

Money is deeply personal and can influence our lives in so many ways.

Families are finding this out first-hand as the pandemic has hit the bottom line and parents are struggling. One or both parents may find themselves laid off permanently or temporarily and while the government aid can help pay the bills and keep a roof over their head today these same parents who may have in the past been able to afford to say ""yes"" to their children are now finding themselves having to say ""no"" financially. And that is ok.

There are going to be opportunities during this pandemic that are going to force us to change and this may be one of them.

Here are a few ideas that may help.

Begin a honest conversation with your children about how you are feeling and where you stand financially. They may not appreciate the numbers but I have found the more you respect their ability to grasp a situation the quicker they embrace it. Include your children in big purchases. I recall having a conversation with our children about a family vacation. With four teenagers in high school and one computer they responded,""we don't really need a vacation but we do need a second computer."" The vacation didn't happen. It is ok to say no to your children even if you can afford to say yes financially. To the extent you can replicate real life the better your children will be when they embark on their own journey. We clearly don't always get want we when we want all the time and neither should they. I know this sounds a little like tough love but it is a great lesson in living below your means that will stick with them. Encourage your children to set financial goals that excite them. They absolutely will not save money for something that excites you. I learned this first-hand when when our daughter got her first part-time job and I thought great you can tuck a little money away for university. Trust me that wasn't on her agenda. Also try to resist the temptation of telling them how to spend their money. It is their money. Yes they will make mistakes but that is ok it is all part of the process. Talk about the difference between investing in your children - helping to fund their education and bailing them out when they run up a credit card bill they can't afford to pay. I'm not suggesting you don't help them out. I would however, ensure they pay you back. Owning the problem can be a game changer. Our son received a notification from CRA highlighting a tax bill he wasn't expecting. He said to me, ""How did you let this happen?"" My response,"" I didn't get you into this situation - you did."" He paid the bill and has never been in that position again. These are difficult times and families are coming together. Just like your salary maybe a moratorium on allowances has to be put into place. That's ok. It can be a temporary situation. However, this doesn't mean everyone should still pitch in. It means maybe we all have to do a little more for less.

When children contribute something to the household regardless of your financial situation it can be a great accomplishment for them as well as you. Now more than ever we need to pull together.",[]

Most of Schumacher's wins were during a dominant spell with Ferrari, but his old team is struggling badly. For the second time in the past four races, Charles Leclerc and Sebastian Vettel crashed into each other and went out.

When Hamilton stood on the podium he raised a clenched right fist.

Hamilton's record-extending 89th career pole on a rain-drenched track was one of his best in extreme conditions, but during the race he was hardly challenged as he finished a sizeable 13.7 seconds ahead of Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas and 33.7 ahead of Red Bull's Max Verstappen.

Because of social distancing amid the coronavirus pandemic, the drivers on the podium had their trophies delivered by a remote controlled device.

""What a weird year but (it's) great to be back driving with this kind of performance. The team did a fantastic job, it was just for me to bring it home,"" said Hamilton, who finished fourth last week after a time penalty. ""Difficult weekend last weekend but this was a great step forward.""

Montreal's Lance Stroll of Racing Point was seventh, picking up six points. Toronto rookie Nicholas Latifi of Williams Mercedes was 17th.

Bottas won last weekend's season-opening Austrian GP on the same Red Bull Ring track in Spielberg at the foot of the Styrian mountains -- hence the name change.

Despite the sizeable margin of Hamilton's win, Bottas maintains he can challenge for the F1 title. He leads in points 43-37.

""I have no reason to doubt any of my ability or skills. I know what I'm capable of,"" the Finnish driver said. ""I really feel some improvements in my driving since last year that's why I'm confident it will be a good battle for the championship this year.""

Like last Sunday, drivers again wore black T-shirts with ""End Racism"" and most took the knee a few moments before the national anthem.

Red Bull driver Alexander Albon did well to fend off persistent attacks from Racing Point's Sergio Perez and finished fourth ahead of McLaren's Lando Norris and Perez, who dropped to sixth after touching wheels with Albon late on.

McLaren's Carlos Sainz Jr. started from third and finished ninth, but collected a bonus point for the fastest lap.

At the start of the race, Hamilton got away cleanly while Verstappen did well to hold off Sainz.

Leclerc tried to overtake down the right entering a hairpin bend and ended up riding over the back of Vettel's car, mangling his rear wing and prompting a safety car to come out for two laps.

Vettel, who finished 10th last week, had to retire while Leclerc came into the pits on Lap 5 and was soon out of the race.

At last season's penultimate GP in Brazil, both Ferrari cars crashed out. Vettel appeared at fault that time after being overtaken cleanly by Leclerc and trying to regain position.

But this time Leclerc was far too hasty and impatient.

Up ahead, Hamilton was coasting and about five seconds clear of Verstappen when the Dutch driver came in for his first tire change on Lap 25 of 71.

Hamilton came in for fresh tires soon after and then Bottas a few laps later, meaning that by Lap 38 Verstappen was second again -- still five seconds adrift of Hamilton.

Verstappen's front wing was damaged on the right side and, with six laps remaining, his lead over Bottas was down to under a second.

Bottas overtook Verstappen on the next lap but Verstappen regained his position superbly, only to concede it again moments later as Bottas' superior speed proved decisive.

""When Valtteri tried to pass me I tried to make it a bit more difficult,"" Verstappen said. ""The podium is good but there's still a lot of work to do.""

Red Bull showed signs late last season that it was closing the gap on Mercedes, but this time Verstappen is not convinced a serious challenge can be mounted.

""I tried everything I could but it's still not enough,"" Verstappen said. ""As a team we want to win and fight for the championship, and to do that we need to win races.""

Renault driver Esteban Ocon was the other driver not to finish, but teammate Daniel Ricciardo was eighth behind Stroll.

Chairman Carlos Ghosn says he is assisting those who helped him flee from Japan to Lebanon last year but refuses to provide details about the escape, saying such information would endanger them.

In an interview aired late Saturday by the pan-Arab Al-Arabiya TV, Ghosn refused to comment on allegations from prosecutors in the U.S., who said last week that he wired more than US$860,000 to a company linked to one of the men accused of helping smuggle him out of Japan in a box in December.

Michael Taylor, a 59-year-old former Green Beret and private security specialist, and Peter Taylor, 27, are wanted by Japan on charges they helped Ghosn escape the country in December after he was released on bail.

Ghosn was arrested in November 2018 and was expected to face trial in April 2020. He posted 1.5 billion yen ($14 million) bail on two separate instances after he was arrested a second time on additional charges, and released again.

When pressed to speak about the Taylors, who are under arrest in the U.S., as well as others who helped him flee, Ghosn refused to speak about any specific person. He said that after he arrived in Lebanon he vowed not to speak about how he left Japan ""because any statement I am going to make will endanger the people who helped me leave Japan.""

Asked if he is aiding those who helped him get out of Japan, Ghosn said, ""of course."" When asked about the Taylors, Ghosn said: ""You are talking about specific people, and I will not comment. However, I am helping everyone who stood by me as much as I can, financially and in any way I can.""

""I made the entire plan of how to get out, but I needed information and assistance. I am not ready to involve these people at this moment simply by talking about it,"" he said. He is believed to have been smuggled inside a large box.

Ghosn, who holds Lebanese, Brazilian and French citizenship, said the ""only side that stood by me is the Lebanese state. They intervened and they asked the Japanese state, `Why are you doing this to him?""'

Ghosn said that when he arrived in Lebanon, Japan requested the Lebanese government hand him over. ""Lebanon approved, if they receive the case file. They (Japanese) didn't send anything for six months,"" he said.

Earlier this month, a Turkish court released four pilots and a private airline official from jail, pending the outcome of their trial on charges of smuggling Ghosn out of Japan to Lebanon, via Turkey.",[]

""I can't say no to a good time,"" said Edmonton Oilers fan Jeet Jermana. ""I'd be hard-pressed not to jump into a big party.""

On Friday, the NHL board of governors and NHL Players' Association said they had ratified the return-to-play plan, paving the way for the league to resume its pandemic-hit season later this summer.

Toronto and Edmonton were also officially unveiled as hub cities where all games will be played, beginning Aug. 1. Training camps start Monday in the 24 cities with teams still in the running for the Stanley Cup, including six in Canada.

In 2017, when the Oilers nearly advanced to the Western Conference final, Jermana was among the thousands of fans who partied in Ford Hall at Rogers Place arena and in bars along the popular Whyte Avenue district.

But with COVID-19 this year, where teams will play in empty arenas, Jermana said he'll likely watch more games at home, maybe with just a few friends.

That is, he said, until the Oilers advance and he and other fans won't be able to resist going out.

""Once it becomes the 'real playoffs' I think more and more the momentum will grab,"" he said.

Matt Black of Hotel X Toronto, located west of the city centre where multiple media outlets have reported that several teams will be based, said the prospect of any accommodation for celebratory fan gatherings, even outdoors, seems unlikely.

Nevertheless, Black said he expects citywide excitement will be palpable, even with empty arenas.

""You look back to those scenes of Jurassic Park and Maple Leaf Square and all of that ... it would be great for people to be able to get together again but you just need to make sure that you're doing it in a safe manner,"" said Black.

The players themselves aren't to have any contact with the general public.

Dr. Vinita Dubey, Toronto's associate medical health officer, said in an emailed statement that players and staff arriving from abroad will also have to serve a modified 14-day quarantine as well as undergo rigorous screening and daily testing protocols, wear masks in indoor settings, physically distance and wash hands often.

An Edmonton police spokesperson said the service wouldn't be able to comment over the weekend on what sorts of preparations they might make for crowds when the season resumes.

Geoff Grimble with the City of Edmonton said the city's civic events management team would likely discuss the issue during a scheduled meeting on Monday.

""The City of Edmonton's first priority is public safety and we'll continue to follow the advice and requirements of the Chief Medical Officer of Health to ensure fans, players, coaches and staff remain healthy,"" Grimble said.

Oilers fan Brendan McLeod admitted he may be lured to a street celebration when -- not if -- his team advances, but said he still wants to maintain physical distancing.

""We have to get through this together or else it's not going to change,"" said McLeod.

But Shadi Merhej, who said he enjoys both hockey and the Oilers, noted the sport doesn't have quite as strong attraction for him in the summer.

""It's daylight 'til 11 o'clock. You don't want to spend half your day watching hockey,"" Merhej explained.

""I'd rather go for a bike ride, or rollerblade or golf.""

Described by Sotheby's as a ""lost masterpiece,"" the rare artifact made specifically for China's Qianlong Emperor in the early 1700s went under the hammer on Saturday, selling for 70 million Hong Kong dollars.

China's Qianlong Emperor ruled for more than 60 years and reportedly praised the vase as a ""masterwork.""

According to Sotheby's, the vase was rediscovered by Amsterdam-based art consultant Johan Bosch van Rosenthal in an elderly women’s home after she called him to inquire about assessing her collection.

In a video posted to the auction house's YouTube channel, Van Rosenthal said the dust-coated vase was in almost-pristine condition after nearly 60 years, despite being kept in a room surrounded by the owner’s cats and dogs.

""We reached a room with a number of Chinese works of art inherited many years ago. Her four cats walked around freely among these. She pointed out a ... partly gilded Chinese vase on a cupboard -- a cherished object which she knew to be something special and valuable,"" Van Rosenthal said.

Van Rosenthal said he is not an expert in Chinese art and sent pictures of the vase to Sotheby's experts who were able to match it to an item in the Chinese imperial archives belonging to the Qing dynasty.

According to the archive record, the vase was previously kept in the Palace of Heavenly Purity, part of Beijing's Forbidden City.

Van Rosenthal said the vase is ""highly unusual"" given its design in which a blue-and-white floral pattern is visible through the object's lattice shell, giving it a “double-walled"" appearance.

Sotheby’s said the vase is similar to only a handful of other designs attempted under China's imperial kiln supervisor Tang Ying in the years 1742 and 1743, describing the object as a ""technical tour-de-force."" The auction house said the pear-shaped vase is an example of ""yangcai"" style, also known as ""foreign colours,"" that saw artisans incorporate Western-style enamels into their porcelain work.

Sotheby's records showed that the artifact -- known as the Harry Garner Reticulated Vase for its original collector -- was sold through its London auction house in 1954 for $75 (£44). Records also showed that the vase was sold again later that year for $136 (£80).

""It is a miracle that this extraordinarily fragile vase survived half a century in a home surrounded by countless pets,"" Nicolas Chow, chairman of Sotheby's Asia, said in a press release prior to the sale.",[]

State television South African Broadcasting Corporation has reported that Mandela died at a Johannesburg hospital early Monday morning. The cause of her death has not been announced.

She had been South Africa's ambassador to Denmark since 2015.

The Mandelas' daughter came to international prominence in 1985, when the white minority government offered to release Nelson Mandela from prison if he denounced violence perpetrated by his movement, the Africa National Congress, against apartheid, the brutal system of racial discrimination enforced in South Africa at that time.

Zindzi Mandela read his letter rejecting the offer at a packed public meeting that was broadcast around the world.

Last year Mandela stirred controversy by calling for the return of the white-owned land to South Africa's dispossessed Black majority.

""Dear Apartheid Apologists, your time is over. You will not rule again. We do not fear you. Finally .TheLandIsOurs,"" she tweeted in June last year.

South Africa's foreign affairs minister Naledi Pandor has expressed shock at Mandela's death, describing her as a heroine.

""Zindzi will not only be remembered as a daughter of our struggle heroes, Tata Nelson and Mama Winnie Mandela, but as a struggle heroine in her own right. She served South Africa well,"" said Pandor.

She is survived by her husband and four children.",[]
749,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/judge-blocks-federal-executions-administration-appeals-1.5021688,Judge blocks federal executions; administration appeals,['Michael Balsamo'],2020-07-13 08:39:00-04:00,"TERRE HAUTE, IND. -- A U.S. district judge on Monday ordered a new delay in federal executions, hours before the first lethal injection was scheduled to be carried out at a federal prison in Indiana. The Trump administration immediately appealed to a higher court, asking that the executions move forward.

U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan said there are still legal issues to resolve and that ""the public is not served by short-circuiting legitimate judicial process."" The executions, pushed by the administration, would be the first carried out at the federal level since 2003.

Chutkan said the inmates have presented evidence showing that the government's plan to use only pentobarbital to carry out the executions ""poses an unconstitutionally significant risk of serious pain.""

Chutkan said the inmates produced evidence that, in other executions, prisoners who were given pentobarbital suffered ""flash pulmonary edema,"" which she said interferes with breathing and produces sensations of drowning and strangulation.

The inmates have identified alternatives, including the use of an opioid or anti-anxiety drug at the start of the procedure or a different method altogether, a firing squad, Chutkan said.

The Justice Department appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

And the Bureau of Prisons continued with preparations in order to move forward should the stay be lifted. Lee has had access to social visitors, has visited with his spiritual adviser and has been allowed to receive mail, prison officials said. He's been under constant staff supervision. The witnesses for Lee are expected to include three family members, his lawyers and spiritual adviser.

The new hold came a day after a federal appeals court lifted a hold on the execution of Daniel Lewis Lee, of Yukon, Oklahoma, which was scheduled for 4 p.m. EDT on Monday at the federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana. He was convicted in Arkansas of the 1996 killings of gun dealer William Mueller, his wife, Nancy, and her 8-year-old daughter, Sarah Powell.

""The government has been trying to plow forward with these executions despite many unanswered questions about the legality of its new execution protocol,"" said Shawn Nolan, one of the attorneys for the men facing federal execution.

The Lee execution was to be carried out after a federal appeals court lifted an injunction on Sunday that had been put in place last week after some members of the victims' family argued they would be put at high risk for the coronavirus if they had to travel to attend. The family on Monday appealed to the Supreme Court.

The decision to move forward with the execution -- and two others scheduled later in the week -- during a global health pandemic that has killed more than 135,000 people in the United States and is ravaging prisons nationwide, drew scrutiny from civil rights groups as well as family of Lee's victims.

Critics argue that the government is creating an unnecessary and manufactured urgency for political gain. The developments are also likely to add a new front to the national conversation about criminal justice reform in the lead-up to the 2020 elections.

Anti-death penalty protesters began gathering in Terre Haute on Monday. Organizer Abraham Bonowitz drove a van through the city with a sign emblazoned on the side of a trailer that read, """"Stop executions now!""

Because of coronavirus concerns, Bonowitz said his group, Death Penalty Action, wasn't encouraging others to show up. No more than a few dozen protesters were expected to join him, and they were all being told to wear masks, he said.

""It's symbolic,"" Bonowitz said about the protests. ""We are just here to say that this is wrong.""

In an interview with The Associated Press last week, Attorney General William Barr said the Justice Department has a duty to carry out the sentences imposed by the courts, including the death penalty, and to bring a sense of closure to the victims and those in the communities where the killings happened.

But relatives of those killed by Lee strongly oppose that idea. They wanted to be present to counter any contention that it was being done on their behalf.

""For us it is a matter of being there and saying, `This is not being done in our name; we do not want this,""' said relative Monica Veillette.

The relatives would be travelling thousands of miles and witnessing the execution in a small room where the social distancing recommended to prevent the virus' spread is virtually impossible. An attorney for the family members who have objected to the execution said they hadn't travelled to Indiana, as of Monday morning.

The federal prison system has struggled in recent months to contain the exploding number of coronavirus cases behind bars. There are currently four confirmed coronavirus cases among inmates at the Terre Haute prison, according to federal statistics, and one inmate there has died.

Barr said he believes the Bureau of Prisons could ""carry out these executions without being at risk."" The agency has put a number of additional measures in place, including temperature checks and requiring witnesses to wear masks.

But on Sunday, the Justice Department disclosed that a staff member involved in preparing for the execution had tested positive for the coronavirus, but said he had not been in the execution chamber and had not come into contact with anyone on the specialized team sent to handle the execution.

The three men scheduled to be executed this week had been scheduled to be put to death when Barr announced the federal government would resume executions last year, ending an informal moratorium on federal capital punishment as the issue receded from the public domain. A fourth man is scheduled to be put to death in August.

Executions on the federal level have been rare and the government has put to death only three defendants since restoring the federal death penalty in 1988 -- most recently in 2003, when Louis Jones was executed for the 1995 kidnapping, rape and murder of a young female soldier.

In 2014, following a botched state execution in Oklahoma, President Barack Obama directed the Justice Departmen t to conduct a broad review of capital punishment and issues surrounding lethal injection drugs.

The attorney general said last July that the Obama-era review had been completed, clearing the way for executions to resume.

Residents in Navotas, one of 16 cities that make up the sprawling capital of 12 million people, will have to stay home for a fortnight, just six weeks after emerging from one of the world's longest lockdowns.

""I am not sure if this is a solution, but I am certain that if I do this the number of cases will not increase,"" Navotas city mayor Toby Tiangco told a radio station.

Navotas, one of the poorest areas of Manila and home to its main fishing port, has 931 confirmed cases and 59 deaths, according to local government figures.

But the number of new infections has spiked in the past two weeks.

""We have no choice but to do it because people are so stubborn,"" said Tiangco, referring to people flouting social distancing rules.

The order is expected to take effect on Wednesday or Thursday, Tiangco told AFP, adding the full set of guidelines was still being finalised.

Residents will be allowed to go to work, but outdoor exercise will be banned. Shops and businesses can remain open but restaurants will only be allowed to do take-aways.

Tiangco said he has asked the capital's police chief to deploy troops to enforce the orders and arrest violators.

Quarantine measures to contain the virus vary across the Philippines, but the strictest and longest lockdown was in Manila, the centre of the country's outbreak.

It shut down in mid-March and only began to reopen at the beginning of June with limited public transport and offices permitted to have skeleton staff.

Since then lockdowns have been re-imposed on several neighbourhoods as cases jumped, but the stay-at-home order for Navotas will be the biggest.

The tough measures have hurt millions of workers in Manila, which accounts for more than a third of the country's economic output.

But the relaxation of rules and the return of thousands of overseas workers have seen a surge in the number of new cases across the country.

TIGHTER RESTRICTIONS

The Philippines has the second highest number of infections in Southeast Asia, with more than 57,000 cases and 1,599 deaths.

Indonesia tops the regional rankings with more than 75,000 cases.

A record 2,539 new cases were reported on July 8 and the figure has been over 1,000 most days this month.

On Monday, the health department reported more than 2,000 fresh infections for the previous day and a record 162 new fatalities, but it included deaths that had not been counted in recent months.

Researchers from the University of the Philippines project the total number of cases could top 80,000 by the end of July.

Private hospitals Makati Medical Center and St. Luke's Medical Center said Monday they had reached full capacity for treating COVID-19 patients.

Secretary Carlito Galvez, who heads the inter-agency task force spearheading the government's response to COVID-19, said Monday restrictions would be tightened in some areas.

A backhoe operator began slowly moving dirt at Tulsa's Oaklawn Cemetery, where ground-penetrating radar earlier this year determined there was an anomaly consistent with mass graves.

Researchers plan to open a 6-by-3-meter excavation area using the backhoe to clear the first layer of soil, followed by shovels, trowels and even more delicate tools if remains are uncovered, said Oklahoma State Archaeologist Kary Stackelbeck.

""It can become a tedious process, but it's important that we do this carefully, cautiously and take copious notes along the way,"" Stackelbeck said.

On May 31 and June 1 in 1921, white residents and civil society leaders looted and burned Tulsa's Black Greenwood district, known as Black Wall Street, to the ground, and used planes to drop projectiles on it.

The attackers killed up to 300 black Tulsans, and forced survivors for a time to live in internment camps overseen by National Guard members.

In the years that followed, Tulsa city and business leaders engaged in a ""concerted coverup"" to hide the truth about the massacre, Tulsa Mayor G.T. Bynum said.

""You had generations of people who grew up in this community ... and never heard about it,"" Bynum said. ""I feel a tremendous responsibility as mayor to try and find these folks. That's a basic thing that a city government should do for people, and Tulsa hasn't.""

It also requested that people in the tightly-controlled country maintain a social distance of at least one metre (three feet), without giving an explanation as to why.

The announcement came after a World Health Organization delegation arrived in Turkmenistan last week for a 10-day mission examining the country's response to the pandemic.

Turkmenistan -- a tightly-controlled, oil-rich, ex-Soviet state -- is one of the few countries in the world yet to declare any coronavirus cases.

In a statement published by the state information agency on Monday, the health ministry said people should wear masks because of ""high concentrations of dust"" in the air.

""It is strongly recommended that everyone use personal protective equipment to protect the upper respiratory tract,"" the ministry said.

Officials also asked Turkmens not to stand too close to air conditioners after spending time outside, in a country where summertime temperatures regularly exceed 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit).

The World Health Organization did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment on the statement.

TEMPERATURE CHECKS

Few people were wearing masks on the streets of the capital Ashgabat, where the largest bazaar was closed for disinfection Monday.

Two other markets were only allowing people wearing masks to enter. Customers were given temperature checks on entering -- a measure rarely required for large amounts of dust, but one regularly used worldwide to identify COVID-19 infections.

A 28-year-old man, who gave his first name, Nuri, told AFP that he had been surprised when traffic police pulled him over him and threatened to fine him for not wearing a mask.

""(The road policeman) decided not to fine me in the end,"" after he found a mask in his car and put it on, Nuri said.

Baili, a 42-year-old woman who works as a civil servant, said officials had asked all government employees to wear a mask, but did not mention coronavirus as a justification.

""They told us that this is advised by the Ministry of Health, because there are a lot of sick people in the world due to poor ecology,"" Baili told AFP.

""They gave masks to everyone in the organization and we were told to wear them all day.""

Drivers of public transport and taxi services donned facial protection for the first time last Monday as the WHO delegation arrived.

Police had previously been seen discouraging citizens from wearing masks and face coverings were absent at mass government events held in recent months, some of which were attended by thousands of people.

The WHO in June began recommending that people wear masks on public transport and in other situations where physical distancing not possible.

The resort, located in Orlando, Fla., opened on Saturday despite a surging number of cases in the state.

Disney World began a phased reopening for its Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom parks over the weekend. Its other two parks, EPCOT and Hollywood Studios, will reopen on July 15. Disney is implementing several health measures to reopen safely.

Josh D'Amaro — the new chairman of Disney Parks, Experiences and Products — says the resort is safe for guests.

The video shot Saturday night from a passerby's vehicle shows Allentown officers restraining a man on the ground outside the emergency room of the Sacred Heart Campus of St. Luke's Hospital. An officer has his elbow on the man's neck before switching to a knee to hold him down while other officers restrained his arms.

The man does not appear to be resisting during the video.

Allentown Police released a statement Sunday night saying the interaction is being investigated and additional videos are being reviewed.

The department released its use of force policy earlier this month, five weeks after a white Minneapolis police officer put his knee on George Floyd's neck for several minutes, even after he stopped responding. Floyd's death has sparked protests around the world calling for an end to police brutality and systemic racism.

The policy prohibits neck restraints and chokeholds. It says that officers should only use the amount of force necessary to control the situation.

According to the police statement, officers were outside the hospital for an unrelated matter when they saw a man staggering in the street, vomiting and stopping in the driveway of the ER.

The officers and hospital staff interacted with the man, who began to yell and spit at them, police said. The statement said the man was “noncompliant which required officers to restrain” him. It's unclear from the video how long the officer had his knee of the man's neck.

The man was treated at the hospital and released.

Wood']",2020-07-13 10:14:00-04:00,"The surge in coronavirus continues to rage uncontrolled across the United States as cases are rising in 35 states, including record numbers in Florida.

Florida health officials reported Sunday a staggering record of new cases in a single day: 15,300. If Florida were a country, it would be the fourth highest in the world in reporting new cases. The state would rank 10th in the list of nations with the most cases, according to data from Johns Hopkins University data.

The state added at least 12,343 cases since Sunday, according to the Florida Department of Health.

At least 35 states are seeing a rise in new cases compared to the previous week, according to Johns Hopkins University data.

The U.S. has recorded more than 3.3 million coronavirus cases since the pandemic began, meaning nearly 1 out of every 100 Americans has tested positive for COVID-19, according to Johns Hopkins University. At least 135,379 Americans have died.

Across the world, 12.9 million people have tested positive for the virus.

Both local and state leaders in the U.S. have said in recent weeks new cases are largely driven by Americans who have opted to resume gatherings and outings to bars. In many states, the average age of new cases has shifted downward, with more young people testing positive than ever before since the start of the pandemic.

The rising U.S. numbers could just be the tip of the iceberg, as experts have often highlighted infections could be around 10 times higher than what is reported, as many go untraced.

To blunt the rise in case, at least 36 states now have some type of mask requirement order in place, and more than half of U.S. states have paused or rolled back their reopening plans in efforts to contain the spread of the virus.

But precautions have been met with heavy backlash from many officials and residents and some governors have stayed away from statewide mask orders, including Florida.

PEOPLE NEED TO 'FOLLOW THE RULES'

Miami Mayor Francis Suarez said on CNN's ""New Day"" on Monday that the numbers are ""out of control.""

Americans need to follow the rules on social distancing and wearing masks, which are required for citizens in public in the city of Miami, the mayor said.

""If they don't follow the rules, things are going to continue the way they are going,"" he said.

In Atlanta, where the mayor attempted to require citizens to wear masks and revert the city back to its first phase of reopening to combat a rise in cases, Gov. Brian Kemp slammed the decision saying it was ""both non-binding and legally unenforceable.""

Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said on CNN that Kemp had not criticized other cities in Georgia for issuing mask mandates.

""I think that it's unfortunate that when we know the science says wearing a mask is one of the easiest ways to stop the spread, that we had the leader to our state taking exception with it,"" she said.

Miami's Suarez said officials need to have a consistent message at the local, state and national levels.

""A lot of the decisions have been pushed down to local officials that probably should have been done at the federal and state levels,"" he said.

""There's a total disconnect between what is happening and being said out of Washington and even Tallahassee and what is happening in some of these communities right here,"" Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber said.

U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams said the country could turn the rise of cases around in ""two (to) three weeks."" But that is based on whether ""we can get a critical mass of people wearing face coverings, practicing at least 6 feet of social distancing, doing the things we know are effective,"" Adams said Sunday on CBS' ""Face the Nation.""

The surge in cases comes as the White House is making a concerted effort to discredit Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, as he becomes increasingly vocal about his concerns over reopening the country during the national surge in coronavirus cases.

The moves to undercut Fauci come just days after he gave an unvarnished look at his relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump, including that they have not spoken in weeks.

During a webinar with the Stanford School of Medicine, Fauci said the pandemic is ""clearly the most challenging"" public health crisis he's ever dealt with, including HIV, the Ebola virus, anthrax and Zika virus.

""We haven't even begun to see the end of it yet,"" Fauci said of the novel coronavirus.

'THIS THING IS JUST ABOUT EVERYWHERE'

Across the country, health officials are sounding the alarm over the number of infected patients seeking medical care.

In Florida, 8,038 patients are hospitalized across the state with the primary diagnosis of coronavirus as of Monday morning, according to numbers released by the state's Agency for Health Care Administration. At the peak of the pandemic in New York, the highest number of hospitalizations for COVID-19 was 18,825.

Florida's three most populous counties, Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach, are experiencing the highest numbers of coronavirus-related hospitalizations.

In Broward County, home to Fort Lauderdale, there was a 279% increase in hospitalizations overnight, the agency reported.

In the past 13 days, Miami-Dade County has seen a 65% increase in the number of COVID-19 patients hospitalized, a 67% increase in the number of ICU beds being used and a staggering 129% increase in the use of ventilators, according to the latest data released by Miami-Dade County government.

Across the state, there are more than 7,500 patients hospitalized with the virus, state data showed Sunday. In Orange County, where Disney World reopened over the weekend, more than 540 patients were in hospitals.

Leah Carpenter, CEO of Memorial Hospital West in Pembroke Pines, a community in Broward County, said the hospital has canceled all elective procedures and converted those surgical spaces into temporary ICUs.

""Basically, we're creating space in every inch of the building as needed,"" she said.

In Los Angeles County, health officials reported more than 3,300 new cases Sunday -- the second highest daily case count in the last week. There are nearly 2,100 people hospitalized, a number ""substantially higher"" than hospitalizations a month ago, officials said.

Texas reported 8,136 new cases, down from the record 10,351 new cases reported on Saturday. County Judge Lina Hidalgo, the executive overseeing Harris County, the largest in Texas, called on Sunday for a stay-at-home order to be issued.

""Not only do we need a stay home order now, but we need to stick with it this time until the hospitalization curve comes down, not just flattens,"" Hidalgo tweeted. ""Many communities that persevered in that way are reopening for the long haul. Let's learn from that & not make the same mistake twice.""

And in Arizona, Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego told CNN that health care professionals are reporting they are ""already tired"" and worried about additional strains on hospitals stemming from the July 4 holiday, even as the city is already seeing record-breaking ventilator usage.

In Arizona, 89% of ICU beds are currently in use and 86% of all hospital beds in use, according to the Arizona Department of Health Services. Dr. Ross Goldberg, president of Arizona Medical Association, said the longer length of stay by COVID-19 patients is putting pressure on hospitals.

""Here it's a much longer kind of hospital stay, which takes that bed out of circulation,"" he told CNN. ""So if you get people coming in and coming, it just adds pressure on the system.""

There was a glimmer of good news.

Those who tested positive weren't able to identify everyone they had contact with, ""and therefore we want to make the public aware that those who attended could be at risk for exposure, and additional cases could be seen in the coming days,"" the health department said.

Brenton Harrison Tarrant had pleaded guilty in March to 51 charges of murder, 40 of attempted murder and one charge of engaging in a terrorist act for the shootings targeting people praying at the two mosques in the city of Christchurch in 2019.

His sentencing hearing, delayed by the coronavirus pandemic, is scheduled to begin in Christchurch on Aug. 24 and could last more than three days. The date was confirmed at a High Court session in Christchurch on Monday that was attended by some shooting survivors.

Tarrant's defence team, lawyers Shane Tait and Jonathan Hudson, applied during Monday's hearing for permission to withdraw as his counsel, a role they have filled since April 2019. They told the court they had been instructed by Tarrant to withdraw as he wishes to exercise his right to represent himself.

Tarrant participated in Monday's proceedings by video link from his Auckland jail. Justice Cameron Mander approved Tarrant's request to dismiss his lawyers, saying he was satisfied he understood his right to legal representation and wished to waive that right.

A lawyer will still be appointed by the court to provide advice if Tarrant requests it. Mander called for a pre-sentence report and statements from victims for the hearing.

Tarrant faces life imprisonment, with the judge having some discretion in deciding how many years Tarrant must serve before becoming eligible for parole.

The attacks targeting people praying at the mosques shocked New Zealand, where new laws were quickly approved banning the deadliest types of semi-automatic weapons. It also prompted global changes to social media protocols after the gunman livestreamed his attack on Facebook, where it was viewed by hundreds of thousands of people.

The sudden guilty plea in March surprised survivors and relatives and relieved many people who had feared Tarrant would try to use his trial as a platform to promote his views.",[]
760,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/conservative-polish-president-wins-2nd-term-after-bitter-campaign-1.5021542,Conservative Polish president wins 2nd term after bitter campaign,"['Vanessa Gera', 'Monika Scislowska']",2020-07-13 02:54:00-04:00,"WARSAW, POLAND -- Polish President Andrzej Duda declared victory Monday in a runoff election in which he narrowly won a second five-year term, acknowledging the campaign he ran was often too harsh as he appealed for unity and forgiveness.

The close race followed a bitter campaign between Duda and Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski that was dominated by cultural issues. The government, state media and the influential Roman Catholic Church all mobilized in support of Duda and sought to stoke anti-Semitism, homophobia and xenophobia in order to shore up conservative support.

Duda celebrated what was seen as a mandate for him and the right-wing ruling party that backs him, Law and Justice, to continue on a path that has reduced poverty but raised concerns that democracy is under threat.

“It was a very sharp campaign, probably too sharp at times,” Duda told supporters in Odrzywol, a town near Warsaw. “If anyone is offended by my words, please forgive me. And give me the chance to improve in the next five years.”

Duda received 51.03% of Sunday's vote, while Trzaskowski got 48.97%, according to final results Monday from the state electoral commission.

Duda told supporters in Odrzywol that he was grateful and moved by winning the support of more than 10 million voters. He said that with the race now over, it was time to turn to the difficult job of returning the country to strong growth after the economic blow of the coronavirus.

Trzaskowski conceded defeat and congratulated Duda. He thanked his supporters and said his strong showing would be the catalyst to fight to keep Poland from becoming a one-party state.

“This is just the beginning of the road,” Trzaskowski said.

But Adam Michnik, a prominent anti-communist dissident and the founding editor of the liberal Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza, said the result bodes badly for Poland's young democracy.

“Andrzej Duda's victory will be understood by his voters, and first of all by those in power, as a permission for the kind of politics that Law and Justice has been pursuing for almost five years, and that is a policy of the destruction of the democratic system, of isolating Poland in Europe, of homophobia, of xenophobia, nationalism and of using the Catholic Church as a tool,” Michnik said.

“I would not even rule out a situation in which, if this policy is continued and we see an attempt on the free media, culture and science, there could be another `Maidan,”' he said, referring to the bloody 2014 pro-Europe protests in Ukraine.

Critics and human rights groups worry Duda's victory will boost illiberal tendencies at home and in the European Union, which has also struggled to halt an erosion of rule of law in Hungary under Prime Minister Viktor Orban.

Among those who welcomed Duda's victory were Orban, as well as the Czech leaders.

Orban congratulated him on Facebook, saying “bravo!” while Czech President Milos Zeman though a spokesman said: “Long live Poland!”

The result was dispiriting for liberals in Europe who are keen to halt what they consider the threat of populism and nationalism.

Remigijus Simasius, the liberal mayor of the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius, offered his condolences to Poles and said the small difference in support of about 2% “sometimes determines the path between progress and regress.”

Duda got help from U.S. President Donald Trump, who invited him to the White House in late June and said he was “doing a terrific job.”

His campaign focused on defending traditional family values in the predominantly Catholic nation of 38 million people, and on preserving social spending policies.

The party's popular policies included lowering the retirement age and paying monthly cash bonuses of 500 zlotys ($125) per child to all families irrespective of income.

Many credit Law and Justice for being the first party to reduce the economic inequality that came with Poland's transition from communism to a market economy three decades ago. There is a strong sense among Poles that the economic help is restoring a sense of dignity after decades of hardship from war, communism and the upheaval brought by capitalism.

The party also stoked conflict with the EU by taking control of the top courts and judicial bodies. Officials in Brussels repeatedly expressed concern over the rule of law in both Poland and Hungary, which were for many years hailed as the most successful democracies to emerge from behind the Iron Curtain.

Law and Justice officials have said they plan to continue reshaping the justice system and also want to nationalize foreign-owned private media outlets. Critics fear that lower courts will face increased political pressure and that press freedom will face new threats.

Zselyke Csaky, an expert on central Europe with the human rights group Freedom House, said Duda's victory gives the party “essentially free rein” until parliamentary elections in 2023 “to do away with limits on its power and work towards destroying Poland's independent institutions.”

Sunday's vote was originally planned for May but was delayed by the coronavirus pandemic. Turnout was 68.18%, close to a record set in 1995, in a sign of the huge stakes for Poles.

As the race tightened, Duda turned further to the right in search of votes. He denounced the LGBT rights movement as an “ideology” worse than communism.

His campaign also cast Trzaskowski as someone who would sell out Polish interests to Jewish interests, tapping old anti-Semitic tropes in a country that was home to Europe's largest Jewish community before it was decimated by Germany in the Holocaust.

The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitored the election, said that while well organized, “negative campaigning and mutual vilification abounded” and that “the incumbent's campaign and coverage by the public broadcaster were marked by homophobic, xenophobic and anti-Semitic rhetoric.”

But the World Jewish Congress focused on Duda's past condemnations of anti-Semitism in a congratulatory statement, not mentioning the harsh campaign.

“President Duda has spoken out against this hatred, and we remain hopeful that he will continue to do so,” WJC President Ronald Lauder said.

During the campaign, Duda also lashed out at a German correspondent and a partly German-owned tabloid for their campaign coverage, alleging “a German attack in these elections.” A German Foreign Ministry spokesman said Monday that Berlin works “outstandingly” with the Polish government and would continue to do so.

""Today's investments will improve the accessibility and reliability of bus services in Barrie,"" said the Honourable Mary Ng, Minister of Small Business, Export Promotion and International Trade.

The government is investing $16.4 million into a new transit hub at the Allandale GO Station, a new connection hub downtown, bus stops and platforms, and additional bicycle parking.

The bulk of the money will be put towards replacing ageing city buses with 30 new, low-floor, accessible buses.

The province and city each pledged more than $10 million to this plan last year.

Barrie Mayor Jeff Lehman said he's thrilled to be able to link to different modes of transportation all under one roof.

""This combined federal, provincial and municipal investment in Barrie will offer our community updated and more accessible buses, and the new transit hub will ensure a better connected and integrated city. It will improve the ability of residents to travel and get to work, make connections and provide more active transportation options as our city grows,"" said Lehman.

A policy that requires face coverings for masks to enter at all indoor businesses, organizations, and to ride public transit takes effect Monday.

There are some exemptions for those with medical conditions, children under the age of five, those with religious reasons, and those who are unable to remove the mask without help.

For many businesses that have lost revenue during the COVID-19 pandemic, masks mean an additional financial pinch.

Will Smith, owner of Say It With Love Bridal in Barrie, has struggled since reopening mid-May without weddings, proms, or graduations.

Smith says staff members will be ensuring that customers are aware of the protocols, and will provide a mask for those who don't have one.

""They are not cheap. They are over a dollar for a disposable mask. It's proving to cost us a lot of money,"" Smith said.

Despite the cost, Smith would rather provide a mask than lose a customer.

At Centennial Beach on Sunday, many people said they felt safer with face masks being in effect, and they're confident that most of Simcoe-Muskoka residents will comply.

The bodies of Norah and Romy Carpentier, aged 11 and 6, were located in a wooded area in the community of St-Apollinaire, Que.

Provincial police say they continue to focus their hunt for Martin Carpentier near where the girls' bodies were found after discovering items they say are of interest to their investigation.

Police did not specify what the items were but raised the possibility Carpentier could be unconscious or dead.

They say a helicopter, a drone and police dogs are all involved in the search.

The girls were last seen Wednesday and became the subject of an Amber Alert the next day.

On Sunday, the manhunt for their 44-year-old father had authorities tightening the search in a thickly wooded area near where the young sisters from Levis, Que. were found.

Residents had helped with the searches until Saturday, but police asked people to stay away from the area Sunday to let officers work.

The Samson Cree Nation says in a memo posted on social media that it has been told by a community health nurse that contact tracing has begun.

Officials say the person may have transmitted the virus while visiting Maskwacis.

They say the person is self-isolating away from the community, but they are trying to identify anyone who may have come in contact with the visitor in the community or at Ma-Me-O Beach.

Anyone who has been identified as a contact is being tested, and there are currently no active cases in Maskwacis.

The memo says non-essential programs and services have been closed for two weeks.

“During the closure, all face-to-face meetings are prohibited and the council chambers will remain closed,” said the memo posted Monday. “Please organize all meetings virtually.”

Saturday report by Iran's Civil Aviation Organization came six months after Ukraine International Airlines Flight PS752 was shot down by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.

The Jan. 8 crash killed 176 people, including 55 Canadian citizens, 30 permanent residents and dozens of others with connections to Canada. Thirteen were residents of Alberta's capital city.

The report detailed a series of moments where the shootdown of PS752 by two Revolutionary Guard missiles could have been avoided, starting with the surface-to-air missile battery that targeted the Boeing 737-800 having been relocated and not properly reoriented.

Those manning the missile battery also could not communicate with their command centre, the report said. They also misidentified the civilian flight as a threat and opened fire twice without getting approval from ranking officials.

""If each had not arisen, the aircraft would not have been targeted,"" the report said.

But for a family member waiting for answers in Edmonton, the report doesn't provide closure.

""We don't trust any investigation, any report prepared or conducted by Iranian regime,"" Javad Soleimani told CTV News Edmonton.

His wife, 29-year-old Elnaz Nabiyi, had been one of the Edmonton residents on the plane.

Soleimani pointed to Iran's days-long denial of any involvement in the crash immediately after it happened in demonstrating the need for an independent investigation by international authorities.

""Do you trust Iranian regime or not?"" Soleimani asked.

""We know that they are working hard, but we expect more from the Canadian government and also international community.""

The plane's black box heads to Paris on July 20.

Western intelligence officials and analysts believe Iran shot down the aircraft with a Russian-made Tor system, known to NATO as the SA-15. The system is mounted on a tracked vehicle and carries a radar and a pack of eight missiles.

The report did not say why the Guard moved the air defence system, but noted the Ukrainian flight had done nothing out of the ordinary up until the missile launch, with its transponder and other data being broadcast.

An Iranian government spokesperson said in June six people involved had been arrested, three of whom at the time had been released on bail.

Global Affairs Canada spokesman Sylvain Leclerc did not comment directly on the report's findings, but reiterated calls by the foreign affairs minister for a fully and transparent investigation.

""Canada and its partners will continue working to ensure transparency, accountability, justice, compensation and closure for the families of the victims of this terrible tragedy,"" Leclerc said in a statement.

Soleimani is waiting.

""Discovering the truth and prosecuting and punishing all those people responsible for this atrocity is our first priority.""

783,ctvnews,https://edmonton.ctvnews.ca/n-w-t-ignored-in-alberta-monitoring-suspension-despite-agreement-leaked-emails-1.5021598,N.W.T. ignored in Alberta monitoring suspension despite agreement: leaked emails,['Bob Weber'],2020-07-13 05:19:00-06:00,"EDMONTON -- Alberta suspended environmental monitoring for oilsands companies without notifying the Northwest Territories, despite a legally binding agreement to do so.

The omission is revealed in a series of emails between the two governments obtained by The Canadian Press.

“We have been made aware ... that the Alberta Energy Regulator has indefinitely suspended several environmental monitoring requirements for major oilsands producers,” wrote Erin Kelly, the N.W.T.'s deputy environment minister to her Alberta counterpart.

“Do you have any information that can be shared about this?”

The May 15 email was written more than a week after Alberta's regulator suspended a wide array of monitoring over what it said were public-health concerns raised by the COVID-19 pandemic. Kelly said her government learned about the move from news reports.

Ten days later, Kelly had not received a response.

“This is concerning to many N.W.T. residents, who still maintain subsistence lifestyles,” she wrote May 25.

“With COVID-19 we have even more residents relying on food harvested from the land and it is almost certain that concerns related to reduced monitoring upstream will be brought up during (the upcoming legislative) session.”

Monitoring is expected to resume Wednesday.

The N.W.T. is downstream from the oilsands and in 2015 signed an agreement with Alberta that spelled out clear responsibilities on information-sharing, notification and consultation for cross-boundary waters.

In her second email, Kelly points to that deal.

“The (territory) has not been informed of or discussed new changes to monitoring as per (the agreement). I have yet to receive a response to my last email.”

An Alberta Environment and Parks email shows Kelly's second note provoked an “urgent” request within the department for a response to her concerns.

In answer to a request for an explanation for the lack of consultation, Alberta's United Conservative government provided a one-sentence email.

“There have been ongoing discussions and information-sharing with the N.W.T. on the status of ambient water quality monitoring at sites referenced in the Alberta-N.W.T. Bilateral Agreement throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, starting in March,” wrote Alberta Environment spokesman John Muir.

Joslyn Oosenbrug, spokeswoman for the N.W.T. Environment Department, said several meetings were held in June to address the territory's concerns.

“Alberta has committed to sharing information and discussing any changes to monitoring,” she wrote in an email. “Communication is ongoing, and includes emails and letters exchanged at the deputy minister and ministerial level.”

However, the territory wants a stronger voice in managing water flowing into its land. It wants a seat on several committees that determine how waters will be monitored “to ensure downstream interests are represented,” Oosenbrug wrote.

Marlin Schmidt, environment critic for Alberta's Opposition New Democrats, said the snub showed a “lack of respect.”

“It's really disappointing to me to see the government of Alberta is taking its relationship with other Canadians so lightly right now,” he said.

“When our government is complaining about the poor treatment that we're allegedly getting from other Canadians, we should be treating (them) with the respect with which we expect to be treated.”

The N.W.T. isn't the only interested group that wasn't consulted about the suspensions. First Nations in the oilsands area, environmental groups, Alberta's chief scientist and the scientific consultants who perform monitoring work all say they were left out of the decision.

The government has said the move was made in response to concerns from the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers about operators not being able to meet certain monitoring requirements while complying with COVID-19 orders.

Alberta has yet to release work plans or budget for this year's field season of a joint federal-provincial program responsible for environmental monitoring outside various oilsands leases. Industry, which funds the efforts, has been lobbying heavily for a less extensive and cheaper plan.

The mural was done by Amos Kajner-Nonnekes of DESIGN, et cetera and his team.

“It adds a little pop of colour and whimsy to Old Strathcona,” said Kajner-Nonnekes. “We kind of specialize in enhancing spaces and turning spaces into people-friendly spaces through a little bit of urban design, some public art”

The mural is a reference to the classic, and infamous, Rainbow Road level in Mario Kart, something Kajner-Nonnekes wanted to evoke with the design.

“It’s that new whimsical level and it’s colourful and poppy and so cool. We wanted to bring that experience to Whyte Avenue.”

It occupies the Spur Line Alley north of Whyte Avenue between 104 Street and 105 Street.

“Something you don’t see very often is a mural on the ground, you can kind of walk through and see yourself going down this rainbow road,” said Kajner-Nonnekes.

The alley was originally changed from a parking area for vehicles to a public plaza by the city as part of the Whyte Ave Alley Project.

The city previously had some designs on the ground in the alley but they “didn’t really fill out the roadway” according to Kajner-Nonnekes.

The project took around 35 gallons of paint to complete and was delayed because of the uncertain Edmonton weather.

“We’ve been painting for the last 36 hours… my back and knees are sore but it’s been great.”

Kajner-Nonnekes also said that this project will be good for Whyte Avenue as people start to venture out again during the pandemic.

“Adding all this colour and all this space it really invited people in and invites them to experience Whyte Avenue in a safe and distanced way and have a new experience.”

The new mural was commissioned by the Old Strathcona Business Association and is something that Kajner-Nonnekes said has the Whyte Avenue feel.

“It’s always something a little weird, a little whimsical, and to come around the corner and see this magnificent pop of colour in an alleyway, something so Old Strathcona about that and so special.”",[]

Construction started in the fall of 2019 and is expected to be completed in the fall of 2022.

The project will add one lane of traffic in each direction as well as two noise walls.

The approximately 18 k.m. stretch being developed is between Gateway Boulevard and just north of Whitemud Drive.

“Depending on the section of the roadway they say there’s 60,000 vehicles a day but as high as 80,000,” said Darrell Trapp the project director with Carmacks. “I’ve even heard as high as 100,000 a day depending on the time of year and the section of roadway.”

Work requiring lane closure is being done at night to minimize the impact to traffic according to Trapp.

“Those works usually start after eight o’clock and we’ll have the roadway cleaned up and clear by before six o’clock a.m.,” said Trapp.

“Traffic counts are up so it’s a little bit more of a challenge to again work, accessing and egressing onto the Henday and you know keeping our guys safe with all this traffic.”

Trapp said there have been some incidents where barriers have been struck. Recent rainfall has also had an impact on work, but Trapp said the construction schedule isn’t “in jeopardy yet.”

“We anticipated being a lot further along with the roadworks than we are today.”

In the next few months Trapp expects there to be a third, new, driving lane available for northbound traffic.

“The northbound lanes literally could be put into service once the paint lines all the signs and everything are put up.”

Following that, crews would begin work on the southbound lanes, bridgework will continue throughout the winter.

“When we do the concrete deck overlays the traffic will all be put onto one bridge so both directions will be put onto the sister bridge,” said Trapp.

“Truck loads and the cars actually do flex the bridges and so the bridges bounce in a sense and that would weaken the concrete when it’s curing.”

More information on timeline goals is available on the Carmacks website.

While the daily case count announcements from provincial health authorities are the most eye-catching figures, there's other important numbers beyond newly confirmed cases, including hospitalizations and testing data.

This page will be updated daily as new information on Alberta, Canada and international cases of COVID-19 is made available.

Starting the week of June 29, the province will provide daily data updates Monday through Friday and not on weekends and holidays.

Follow the links below or scroll down to see how the COVID-19 situation is changing in Alberta as the pandemic continues.

HOW IS COVID-19 GROWING IN ALBERTA?

The province's daily case count announcement is among the most prominent COVID-19 statistics.

The number of new cases represents the number of patients who are newly infected with the coronavirus. The number of active cases in the province can go up or down depending on the number of new recoveries on a given day.

The above graph divides active cases into those who are sick, but not in hospital, and those patients requiring hospitalization. Hospitalized patients are further divided by those getting care in and out of intensive care units.

Recoveries are defined by Alberta Health Services as follows:

A return to health after 14 days of isolation for those with COVID-19 but who experienced only mild symptoms.

If hospitalized due to COVID-19, anyone who does not require additional hospitalization or treatment in the 10 days after they left the hospital.

If tested, such as a health care worker, two negative tests at least 24 hours apart.

Daily case counts include both lab-confirmed and probable cases. The case count for a given day is sometimes revised to more accurately reflect probable cases that were either later confirmed or determined not to be related to COVID-19.

WHERE IS COVID-19 HITTING ALBERTA THE HARDEST?

Since early April, the province has provided a geographic breakdown for both its five health zones as well as individual cities and community-level subzones within those cities.

Alberta Health Services divides the province into five health zones: Calgary, Central, Edmonton, North and South.

A map of those zones can be seen here, and it's important to note that the Edmonton and Calgary zones cover an area significantly bigger than the cities they are named after.

Sizable daily jumps in the new number of cases can't necessarily be attributed to the virus growing, as testing volume and reporting time also influence the data.

For more local data, the province's COVID-19 statistics page has an interactive map showing cases by city and community.

HOW MANY COVID-19 PATIENTS ARE IN HOSPITAL?

Tracking hospitalizations is an important indicator of how severely pandemic is affecting Albertans as well as how the coronavirus is taxing the province's health care system.

Alberta has the capacity for 295 intensive care unit beds and nearly 8,500 total beds, according to the province's modelling released in April.

So far, the number of hospitalizations and ICU admissions have both remained well below those maximum capacities.

Hospitalization data is often retroactively updated by the province as individual hospitals report data at varying times and speeds.

HOW IS ALBERTA TESTING FOR COVID-19?

Alberta has been the top province in Canada measured by per capita COVID-19 testing since near the start of the pandemic.

The province has now administered more than 500,000 tests Albertans.

It's important to distinguish between test volume (number of tests completed) and number of people tested as patients can be tested more than once.

The province has made seven notable shifts in testing policy.

March 23: The province announced testing was being focused on at-risk populations and health care workers. At the same time, testing returning travellers was deprioritized to only those showing symptoms.

April 7: Testing is opened to any symptomatic individuals in the Calgary Zone, which had seen significant spikes in cases in March and April.

April 13: Testing was expanded to any Albertan with symptoms consistent with the coronavirus.

April 17: The province announced it would start testing all staff and residents of continuing care facilities for COVID-19 regardless of whether or not they show symptoms.​

May 4: The testing criteria was expanded again to include anyone exeperiencing headache, muscle or joint aches, fatigue or severe exhaustion, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, unexplained loss of appetite, loss of sense of smell or taste, or pink eye.

May 11: The province opened testing to asymptomatic residents of the Calgary zone who work outside their home. Testing is to be done on a first-come, first-serve basis for up to 1,000 asymptomatic residents each day. The policy was in place until May 18.

May 29: The province announces all Albertans, including those who are asymptomatic, were eligible to be tested.

HOW IS COVID-19 BEING SPREAD IN ALBERTA?

The province divides the ways COVID-19 is being spread into three categories: travel-related cases, spread via a known source, and spread via an unknown source, or community transmission.

Initially, travel-related cases were responsible for many of Alberta's new COVID-19 cases. But since travel restrictions came into effect, the number of travel-related cases has largely flattened since early April.

Close contact with individuals known to be carrying the virus remains the most common way of spreading COVID-19 in Alberta.

Suspected community transmitted cases, where the carrier isn't immediately known, are an important indicator of how the coronavirus is spreading in a community as well as how successful measures like physical distancing have been in limiting transmission.

Identified cases are investigated by AHS and classified into one of the three categories. The classification can change pending further investigation.

WHICH AGE GROUPS HAVE BEEN MOST SUSCEPTIBLE TO COVID-19?

Since the onset of the pandemic, COVID-19 has affected the elderly more than other age groups as seen in high death and active case counts.

But, younger age groups are not immune, and by mid-June, cases among Albertans under the age of 40 had risen to form a majority of all active cases in the province.

HOW DOES COVID-19'S GROWTH IN ALBERTA COMPARE TO ELSEWHERE?

Conclusions drawn from comparing provinces are somewhat limited by widely differing testing volumes and practices among provinces, but the raw data does allow from some contrast.

The above graphs rank provinces by the number of tests they administer and how many confirmed cases they have, both adjusted to per 10,000 population of their respective province.

Tests are also not without their own biases. More tests will produce more positives, and it's easier to test everyone in a less populous province.

Rates adjusted for population provide a snapshot of the COVID-19 situation on any given day, but experts say the growth of the virus, which is unrelated to population size, is also an important indicator of future trends.

The below graphs display Alberta's coronavirus curve alongside other provinces and other countries. Both use a logarithmic scale to better depict the exponential growth of COVID-19.",[]

Alberta Health Services divides Edmonton up into 15 health subzones named for their home communities.

Since early April, the province has provided daily updates on the number of COVID-19 active cases, recoveries and deaths in each of those subzones as well as totals for the city itself.

This page is divided up into four sections: overall city data, subzone (community) level data, testing data and methodology.

Scroll down or follow the links below to navigate to each section.

CITY OF EDMONTON

The city of Edmonton is distinct from the Edmonton zone, which includes communities far beyond the city itself. You can see a map displaying the boundaries of the five AHS health zones across the province here.

Unless otherwise specifically indicated, numbers on this page are for the city itself and not the zone.

See the methodology section below for how a recovery from COVID-19 is defined by AHS.

COMMUNITIES

The 15 Edmonton AHS subzones cover the vast majority, though not all, of the area inside the city's coroporate boundaries.

You can see a rough map of the subzones below. For a zoomable version, visit the province's interactive data site and click on the geospatial tab.

Scroll down or follow these links to find data on each individual subzone:

Abbottsfield, Bonnie Doon, Castle Downs

Duggan, Eastwood, Jasper Place

Mill Woods South & East, Mill Woods West, Northeast

Northgate, Rutherford, Twin Brooks

West Jasper Place, Woodcroft East, Woodcroft West

Beaumont, Devon & Leduc, Fort Saskatchewan St. Albert, Sherwood Park, Stony Plain & Spruce Grove

TESTING DATA

Testing data for specific cities isn't yet available so these graphs display data from the Edmonton Zone as opposed to the city itself.

The Edmonton Zone had a population of just over 1.4 million people in 2018, according to AHS. The same year, the province estimated the city of Edmonton's population at just over 1 million people.

METHODOLOGY

Boundaries

The graphs above were assembled using two versions of the province's interactive data map, each with different borders.

The city-specific graphs draws data from the city of Edmonton as defined by its geographic corporate boundaries.

The community-level graphs draw data taken from the province's 15 Edmonton-area health subzones.

Their boundaries closely resemble the city's borders but with some exceptions. As a result, some areas within Edmonton's corporate boundaries, largely near the city's southern boundary, are included in suburban health zones.

Cases are attributed to the subzone of a patient’s primary residence. You can see population estimates for each subzone here.

Case Counts

The updated daily case count reflects the number of new, active cases (people who are now newly ill with COVID-19).

The daily change in active cases are determined by subtracting the number of newly recovered cases from the number of new cases. A positive value represents an increase in net active cases, with a negative value indicating the opposite.

The province often revises data, and reclassifies cases to other health zones or subzones which can cause a sudden rise or drop in cases for a given location.​

Reclassifications can occur for a number of reasons, including:

A patient's contact information was updated to reflect his or her proper address.

Further testing revealed a patient did not, in fact, contract COVID-19.

Data entry errors.

The province published new numbers daily March, April, May and June, with subzone data being available since early April. Starting the weekend of July 4, the province will release updated data on weekdays only, with no scheduled updates on holidays and weekends.

Recoveries

Recoveries are defined by Alberta Health Services as follows:",[]

Locals wanting to get to know or rediscover their city have plenty of options in and around the river valley and downtown for the whole family.

""It’s one thing to be able to showcase our amazing city to visitors and guests, and it is even more special when we get to rediscover our own backyard again,"" said Explore Edmonton Director of Communications Tammy Forbes. ""And even if we have to adapt to the current health restrictions and remain safe, the tourism industry is going to be vital as Edmontonians look for fun ways to rediscover their own city. Our greatest ambassadors are the people who choose to make this place their home.""

Here are 10 unique spots to check out during your summer staycation.

BOB AND DOUG MCKENZIE SCULPTURE

From your television screen to a bench in Ice District, Bob and Doug McKenzie are now in Edmonton for good.

The sculpture of Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas pays tribute to the sketch comedy duo's Great White North segment that had a memorable run on Second City Television in the 70s and 80s.

Edmonton sculptor Ritchie Velthuis made the piece that appeared in Ice District, in 103 Street and 103 Avenue, in late March.

SPIRIT OF STANLEY

Edmonton has had a lot of Stanley Cups over the year, and while this one wasn't won on the ice, it's by far the biggest and most prominent.

Located in front of the United Cycle on Gateway Boulevard, the Spirit of Stanley is the world's largest Stanley Cup replica at four metres and 850 pounds.

Fun fact: Each team took 45 minutes to engrave, according to its maker, IMARK.

NEON SIGN MUSEUM

An Edmonton classic, the Neon Sign Museum tells parts of the city's history in an artistic and bright way.

The City of Edmonton has collected 20 signs, restored and installed them on the Telus building and Mercer Warehouse on 104 Street.

Neon signs include the Canadian National Railway, the Princess Theatre, and with the goal of collecting 30 signs, there is a petition to save and move the Western Cycle sign there.

HIGH LEVEL BRIDGE AND WALTERDALE BRIDGE

These two are just nice to look at, especially at night. The City of Edmonton often changes the High Level Bridge's lights in the morning and night to celebrate certain occasions, or to send a message of solidarity as it did recently with Nova Scotia.

The Walterdale Bridge has only been around for three years but it's already arguably Edmonton's No. 1 spot for photos, featuring the breathtaking architecture, the river valley, and downtown Edmonton's growing skyline.

Gallery: Walterdale Bridge

KEILLOR POINT

Keillor Point was known as the End of the World before the City of Edmonton overhauled the North Saskatchewan River viewpoint in 2019.

The End of the World, located in the Belgravia neighbourhood, had become a safety hazard due to slumping in the embankment and deterioration of the pillars, the city said.

Still, it was a popular place to hang out and take pictures of the river, so the city spent $1.5 million to make it safer and more accessible, with stairs and a pathway.

BELGRAVIA BENCHES

Near Keillor Point, these benches in the Belgravia Dog Park are a cool spot to catch a sunset with views that include Fox Drive, the Whitemud Equine Learning Centre Association, Quesnell Bridge, the river — and your dog.

TALUS DOME

Explore Edmonton calls the Talus Dome Edmonton's ""most provocative piece of public art"" that ""always has people talking.""

You've probably driven by the 1,000 steel balls while crossing the Quesnell Bridge and raised an eyebrow, but the city encourages Edmontonians to take a closer look.

""Think fun house meets the compound eye of a fly,"" Explore Edmonton said. ""You can capture some pretty warped and funny reflections that will have you busting a gut laughing.""

Just don’t throw paint on it.

FORT EDMONTON FOOTBRIDGE

A footbridge on what feels like the middle of nowhere connects neighbourhoods in southwest Edmonton divided by the North Saskatchewan River.

Sit on the benches on and surrounding the bridge for up-close views of the river, or exercise on the trails on either side or the Wolf Willow Stairs just steps away.

""If you choose the latter, be prepared to sweat it out and hike up 200 stairs to get to this vantage point,"" Explore Edmonton said.

RIVER VALLEY SWING

As if it wasn't clear Edmonton's river valley was full of fun and surprises: a wooden swing overlooking downtown Edmonton.

It's been called a hidden gem and picturesque, but not many people know where it is. It's not clear who built it and put it there — the mystery adding to the charm.

It's tucked under somewhere around Dawson Park.

Tell your friends…unless you want it all to yourself.

WHITEMUD CREEK UNDERPASS

This is another gem not a lot of people have known about until now.

Underneath the Whitemud Creek on Anthony Henday Drive is an archway that wraps around a footbridge.

And since it doesn’t get a lot of foot traffic, it's turned into a lot more than that.

The little underpass has turned into a colourful retreat covered in graffiti and photographers admiring the rugged beauty.

It may looked abandoned on the outside, but it's getting a lot of attention on social media.",[]

“I come here a lot,” one passerby told CTV News. “It's pretty nice.”

The Whitemud Creek arch was once a site for coal mining.

In 2005 the province added the pedestrian bridge as a means for people to safely traverse from one side of the freeway to the other. Below the bridge is the creek which allows wildlife to also make the safe trek.

Local blogger Lincoln Ho believes the project is incomplete and unsafe.

""Crumbling infrastructure is always an issue especially underneath one of the busiest roadways in the city,"" said Ho.

He believes that because of very little foot traffic, “urban explorers” are taking part in extensive and often profane graffiti tagging.

“They're climbing on to parts of the bridge that aren't for pedestrians,” says Ho. “Somebody is going to get hurt and it's very hard to access for medical personnel.""

The crossing has also become a popular backdrop for social media posts, increasing its notoriety.

""So anybody who has featured this bridge on a TikTok has gotten very popular with it and so everybody is copying everybody else’s TikTok's and checking out this supposed hidden bridge.""

Neither end of the bridge is connected by trail, making it difficult to access. Still, that isn’t stopping admirers from making the trek to this urban escape.

""I actually have a friend from Toronto coming to visit and I'm going to bring her here,"" said one woman out for a hike.

""It's a beautiful piece of infrastructure,” said Ho. “Beautiful contemporary architecture style in there and it is a shame that it's just left abandoned.”",[]

Kaysen Martin, who is 23 months old, needs a $2.8-million gene-therapy drug called Zolgensma for his Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type 1 that affects the muscles used for lung support, swallowing, crawling, walking and head control.

His family is pleading for Alberta Health to cover the drug, but time is running out, because it can only be administered before a child turns two.

A GoFundMe page to raise the money for the drug has already raised more than $80,000, including a $5,000 donation from Reynolds.

Kaysen’s mother Lana Bernardin said the family was excited to see the donation.

“Definitely surprised that Ryan Reynolds saw us. I’m not sure how, but he saw us. So for sure, it was a really good, big surprise,” she told CTV News Edmonton.

Reynolds, who was born in Vancouver, has made many charitable donations in 2020. He and his wife Blake Lively donated to food banks across Canada, including a $5,000 to the Edmonton Food Bank in April.

The family has until July 17, Kaysen’s second birthday, to raise the money.

The Mountie found a stolen vehicle in the parking lot and attempted to arrest the thief at approximately 5:30 p.m., police said.

The man, 44, punched the officer in the head, stole their baton and struck them in the head several times.

A local resident, who did not want to be fully named for fear of retribution, says RCMP were already at the store when she and her husband arrived. He ran inside to buy diapers, so she was alone with two toddlers when she says the officer approached the thief.

“As soon as she went to detain him he kind of like uppercutted her, probably two or three times in the jaw. That’s when she went down,” Morgan recalled.

“She gets on her feet pulls her baton, whips it out, and goes to smack him with it and he just grabbed it out of the air — rips it out of her hand — and kind of cave man styled her in the back of the head with it. … She went back down and he gets on top of her again and just starts bashing her with this baton. Like he’s going for the skull every time.

“And she was screaming at the top of her lungs.”

The man fled when a passerby started yelling at him.

According to police, he left with the baton, threatened another driver with it and a knife and stole a Trailblazer.

He drove southbound on Highway 28; RCMP chased him and disabled the stolen vehicle.

The 44-year-old was arrested without incident and the baton was recovered, police said.

The RCMP officer was taken to hospital with serious but non-life threatening injuries and is now recovering at home.

Morgan considers her lucky to have survived the beating without help.

She says some members of the public watched the incident “like it was a joke.”

“It was heartbreaking because you want to do something but at the same time you can’t jeopardize my young children.”

The officer, she insisted, did nothing to escalate the situation.

“We should be helping each other not hating each other no matter what colour we wear. You see someone who has done nothing wrong and they’re being brutalized basically it’s something someone needs to step up and do something.”

The man is in custody and will be charged.

The liftoff of the UAE's Mars orbiter named Amal, or Hope, on a Japanese H-IIA rocket is scheduled for early Wednesday from the Tanegashima Space Center in southern Japan, in what would be the Arab world's first interplanetary mission.

A final decision will be made Tuesday before the roll out of the rocket, said Keiji Suzuki, launch site director for Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.

A seasonal rain front was expected to cause intermittent lightning and rain over the next few days, he said.

""But this thunder is not expected to be severe or lasting, and our assessment is that there will be a chance for a launch,"" Suzuki told an online briefing Monday from Tanegashima. ""We will make a careful decision based on data.""

Heavy rain has continued for more than a week in large areas of Japan, triggering mudslides and floods and killing more than 70 people, most of them on the southern main island of Kyushu.

Hope is set to reach Mars in February 2021, the year the UAE celebrates 50 years since its formation. A successful Hope mission would be a major step for the oil-dependent economy seeking a future in space.

Hope carries three instruments to study the upper atmosphere and monitor climate change and is scheduled to circle the red planet for at least two years.

Emirates Mars Mission Project Director Omran Sharaf, who joined Monday's briefing from Dubai, said the mission is not just a repeat of what other countries have done. It will provide a complete view of the Martian atmosphere during different seasons for the first time, he said.

Two other Mars missions are planned in coming days by the U.S. and China. Japan has its own Martian moon mission planned in 2024.",[]

The population of Mars is on the verge of tripling as three new Mars missions from three different countries are set to launch within the next month, with two new rovers coming to the planet.

Curiosity is about to get some company.

Although Mars has been an object of fascination for years for humans millions of kilometres away on Earth, it is still a planet of vast mystery, and has been only marginally explored.

The Curiosity Rover, a NASA project, has called Mars home since 2012. Over the last few months, scientists have been commanding Curiosity from the comfort of their sofas at home instead of their offices at NASA.

The rover has been alone on the planet ever since Opportunity — which was sent to Mars with the Spirit rover in 2003 — stopped responding in 2018 following a massive dust storm that swept over the rover’s location on Mars. Opportunity’s mission was officially deemed complete in 2019 after months of NASA attempting to reconnect and revive the rover.

On July 30, NASA is sending Curiosity a new friend: their fifth Mars rover since the start of the program, called Perseverance.

Perseverance’s main mission is to look for signs of past life on Mars by studying the geology and taking rock and soil samples to be analyzed on Earth later. Previous explorations — including work done by Opportunity — have shown evidence that there was once water on Mars’ surface.

As water is one of the main building blocks of life as we know it, further evidence that Mars didn’t always used to be a dry, rocky wasteland could open up our understanding of how life could exist outside of our planet.

NASA has been sending rockets and landing craft to Mars for decades. But America’s martian monopoly is being challenged by China and the United Arab Emirates this summer, with both aiming to join the outer space elite.

Like the Americans, China is landing a rover on Mars this summer, called Tianwen-1, according to a press release from the China National Space Administration.

Although not many details of the mission have been released, the rover is set to launch sometime in July, and is China’s first Mars exploration mission.

The United Arab Emirates are not landing a rover on the planet, but are instead launching a mission to orbit Mars and observe from space.

The Hope Probe will circle the planet for two years studying weather and atmosphere, and will be the first of the three missions to launch this summer: a countdown on the UAE Space Agency website shows that the mission is launching next week, on July 15.

The mission is aiming to understand the climate dynamics of Mars, the structure of Mars’ atmosphere and why hydrogen and oxygen are escaping from the upper atmosphere into space.

So why are so many missions to Mars launching in the same month?

Because there is a unique window of opportunity right now. This is when Earth and Mars are closest together — something that only happens every two years.

Although these three missions are being operated by different countries, and have different goals, they all serve as important stepping stones towards the ultimate quest: achieving a human expedition to Mars by the end of the century.",[]

800,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/kenya-wildlife-reserves-threatened-as-tourists-stay-away-1.5021789,Kenya wildlife reserves threatened as tourists stay away,['Francois Ausseill'],2020-07-13 09:38:00-04:00,"TALEK, KENYA -- In the majestic plains of the Maasai Mara, the coronavirus pandemic spells economic disaster for locals who earn a living from tourists coming to see Kenya's abundant wildlife.

Even before the virus arrived in Kenya mid-March, tourism revenues had plummeted, with cancellations coming in from crucial markets such as China, Europe and the United States.

According to the tourism ministry, the sector has lost US$750 million this year -- roughly half of the total revenue in 2019.

""We were fully booked in June but now we have zero bookings. Nothing. It's terrible,"" said Jimmy Lemara, 40, the manager of an eco-lodge in the private Ol Kinyei conservancy.

In the Maasai Mara, one of Africa's most highly-rated wildlife reserves located in the vast flat plains of the Great Rift Valley, the local Maasai community, traditional herders who make up 2.5 percent of the population, now depend almost exclusively upon tourism for their livelihood.

In a unique model set up to engage local communities in tourism, enabling them to see the value of wildlife and thus protect it, the Maasai now get revenue from renting their land to form private wildlife conservancies.

Some work as cooks, guides and security guards in the lodges while others give tours of their traditional homes or sell homemade crafts to tourists.

'SURVIVAL MODE'

People in Talek, a dusty town situated at one of the entrances to the Maasai Mara national reserve, are gloomily buckling down, hoping for better days.

Kenya has announced international flights will resume on August 1, but the high season is already lost.

""Since December, work has been extremely low, and now we're in survival mode hoping to make 150 to 200 shillings ($1.4 to $1.9) a day, to be able to buy a meal,"" said Ibrahim Sameri, 38, whose small mechanic workshop can generate up to $30 a day in the high season.

Nalokiti Sayialel normally sells bead necklaces and bracelets to tourists passing through.

""It's been three months that I haven't sold anything,"" the 45-year-old told AFP.

""This is terrible. Everything is stuck. Everything is shut down. (I have) never seen something like that"", said tour guide Petro Nautori who has had no work since January.

The Maasai Mara national reserve, run by the Narok county government, extends to the north with several privately-managed conservancies renting land from the Maasai who in exchange do not graze their cattle or settle there.

This model has since 2005 allowed the doubling of the habitat for wildlife in this area.

On average, each land owner earns $220 per month, far more than the minimum wage in the area.

However like other conservancies, Ol Kinyei is struggling and has agreed to only pay half the usual rent to the Maasai, after having to pay back deposits to tourists who cancelled their holidays.

The salaries of lodge employees have also been cut by half.

FORCED TO SELL LIVESTOCK

Some Maasai families are having to turn to selling their precious livestock to earn money.

""Because we're getting little and it's not enough to sustain the family for a living, I had to sell two goats worth about 12,000 shillings to put on top of what I'm getting to keep me going,"" said Julius Sanare, 41, head chef at the eco-lodge in Ol Kinyei.

However livestock markets have been shut due to coronavirus prevention measures.

Residents said the Maasai are instead selling their animals on the black market for a pittance to unscrupulous buyers taking advantage of their desperation.

Erin Levy was supposed to be on summer vacation in Alberta, but the COVID-19 pandemic forced her to stay in Nova Scotia, where she decided to enjoy a staycation.

Levy went camping at Five Islands Provincial Park and planned a trip to the Joggins Fossil Cliffs on July 3.

The UNESCO World Heritage Site had just reopened on July 1.

“We hadn’t explored that area of the province before, so we went over there and wanted to do a day trip,” says Levy, who lives in Bedford, N.S.

After touring the Joggins Fossil Centre, Levy went for a walk near the beach.

“Up a little ways up to the right were the cliffs, so I got up next to the cliffs thinking maybe there’s cooler things there, and this was honestly just lying in the sand,” says Levy of her find. “So I pulled it out a little bit and saw the two sets of tracks and thought it was really neat.”

Levy soon discovered that “neat” was an understatement for her discovery, which turned out to be a 310-million-year-old fossil.

It dates back to a snapshot in time when Joggins was part of Pangaea, 100 million years before dinosaurs roamed the earth.

“These are fossilized footprints of two different animals,” explains Melissa Grey, curator at the Joggins Fossil Centre.

“One’s an amphibian creature and one’s a millipede, so two very different animals, which is really unusual and, not only that, they are both really beautifully preserved.”

“They were very excited about it,” says Levy. “They identified the tracks in a heartbeat and said it was interesting because the tracks were much smaller than what they were used to seeing for that kind of creature.”

Stunning find by a visitor to @JogginsFossils last week! Two sets of trackways - can you see both of them? One (one right) is from a large millipede and the other (left) is from an amphibian. This will be going into our Collection for future study! pic.twitter.com/NWXEWMjtxD — Dr. Melissa Grey (@CuratorGrey) July 6, 2020

The fossil has captured the attention of experts across the province. It will be researched and may go on display at the Joggins Fossil Centre, but Levy will always be part of its history.

“Erin the fossil finder will go down as the collector, so her name will forever be associated with that find,” says Grey.

Both Levy and Grey say they hope the discovery will encourage more people to explore Joggins and other historic sites in Nova Scotia.

“You do not have to be an expert or a trained paleontologist to find fossils at Joggins,” says Grey. “There’s so many. You actually can’t help but step on them.”

“This was amazing,” says Levy. “We have a ton of history that’s a bit unexplored, so I’m hoping it will just bring more people here to spend a bit more time in Nova Scotia and realize what we have to offer.”",[]

The WMO said there was a 20 per cent chance that it will exceed 1.5 C above 1850 to 1900 average levels in at least one year, according to its annual climate predictions for the coming five years.

The last five-year period has been the warmest five years on record, said the Geneva-based United Nations agency, which counts 193 member states.

Temperatures over the next five years, 2020 to 2024, are very likely to be within the range of 0.91 C to 1.59 C above pre-industrial levels.

Almost all regions, except parts of the southern oceans, are likely to be warmer than the recent past, which is defined as 1981 to 2010.

""This study shows -- with a high level of scientific skill -- the enormous challenge ahead in meeting the Paris Agreement on Climate Change target of keeping a global temperature rise this century well below 2 C above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 C,"" said WMO secretary-general Petteri Taalas.

The 2015 Paris accord seeks to limit global temperature rises through sweeping cuts in greenhouse gas emissions.

WETTER SAHEL

The WMO forecasts do not take into account changes in greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions due to the shutdown of economic and industrial activity triggered by the coronavirus crisis.

""Due to the very long lifetime of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the impact of the drop in emissions this year is not expected to lead to a reduction of CO2 atmospheric concentrations which are driving global temperature increases,"" Taalas said.

The planet's average temperature is already more than 1.0 C warmer than the pre-industrial period, the WMO said.

Looking at the five-year period 2020 to 2024, the organisation said there was a 70 per cent chance that at least one month would be 1.5 C warmer than pre-industrial levels.

However, there is only a three per cent chance that the entire period would be 1.5 C warmer than that baseline level.

The northern North Atlantic region could have stronger westerly winds, leading to more storms in western Europe over the next five years.

High latitude regions and the Sahel are likely to be wetter than the recent past, the organisation predicted.

The WMO also said that in 2020 alone, many parts of South America, southern Africa and Australia are likely to be drier than the recent past.

Meanwhile, the Arctic is likely to have warmed by more than twice as much as the global mean.

It said the smallest temperature change was expected in the tropics and in the mid-latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere.",[]

Denver based start-up Boom Supersonic has announced it will roll out XB-1, a 1:3 scale prototype of its upcoming supersonic commercial jet Overture, on October 7, with test flights beginning in 2021.

The move will help to pave the way for the first commercial supersonic flights since the legendary delta-wing passenger airliner made its last flight in 2003.

""XB-1 is the first step in bringing supersonic travel back to the world,"" Blake Scholl, founder and CEO of Boom Supersonic, said in a statement on the company's website.

SUPERSONIC FLIGHT REVIVAL

""Flights at twice the speed mean we can travel twice as far -- bringing more people, places, and cultures into our lives.""

According to Boom, the purpose of XB-1 is to demonstrate and prove the ""key technologies"" for Overture, such as advanced carbon fiber composite construction and computer-optimized high-efficiency aerodynamics.

The company has also released images of the experimental aircraft, described as ""history's fastest privately developed aircraft,"" in the hangar, including the completion of its wing installation.

""Our experiences in the Covid-19 pandemic underscore for all of us the fundamental human need for personal connection,"" says Scholl.

""Faster travel enables us to experience the world's people, cultures, and places. With XB-1, we're demonstrating that we are prepared to bring back supersonic.""

The results of the XB-1 test program, which claims to be 100% carbon neutral, will allow the company to fine tune the design for supersonic airliner Overture.

""We're ensuring that the supersonic future is safe and environmentally and economically sustainable,"" he added.

""We've learned that the demand for supersonic has grown even faster than we anticipated.""

Before the pandemic, Boom had garnered at least $6 billion worth of pre-orders for the aircraft, which has a price tag of $200 million, with buyers included Virgin Group and Japan Airlines, which invested $10 million in the company in 2017.

If all goes to plan, Overture, which is designed to seat between 55 to 75 people, will begin passenger flights in 2030. It will focus on over 500 primarily transoceanic routes that will benefit from the aircraft's Mach-2.2 speeds -- such as New York to London, a journey that would take just three hours and 15 minutes.

The aircraft has been designed with the latest noise-reducing technologies and will only fly at supersonic speeds while over oceans to ensure that populated areas are not affected by sonic booms.

Backstopped by more than $500 million in new funding over the next five years, Ottawa's newly released cybersecurity strategy lays out a range of initiatives to help Canadians, business and the government better protect against cyberthreats.

The strategy was the result of nearly two years of consultations with industry, academics and other experts, and updates the first such plan released by the Harper Conservatives in 2010.

It comes as the internet and digital technology play an increasingly important role in every aspect of life, making many functions easier and leading to new economic opportunities -- but also opening the country and Canadians up to new risks.

And those risks appear to be increasing: The RCMP says that police services across the country received 24,000 reports of cybercrimes in 2016, which represented a 58 per cent increase over the previous two years.

There are also growing concerns about the threat posed by foreign states, terrorist groups and others who may try to target the country's electricity grids, banking services, hospitals and election systems.

The new cybersecurity strategy does three things, starting with an increased emphasis on detecting, deterring and prosecuting cybercrime, Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale told a news conference on Parliament Hill.

""We must substantially strengthen Canada's cybersecurity capabilities to better protect ourselves and our systems against evolving cyberthreats,"" he said, ""while also enlarging our capacity to combat cybercrime and prosecute offenders.""

To that end, the RCMP will add new cyber-investigators and become the main focal point for police across the country to report illegal activity online. It will also liaise with foreign partners to identify potential threats and crack down on criminal networks.

The strategy also brings the various cybersecurity efforts underway in different federal departments under a new Canadian Centre for Cyber Security, Goodale said, which will be housed at the Communications Security Establishment and open in the fall.

And it will attempt to help the private sector, especially small businesses, which officials say were the victims of 71 per cent of data breaches, better protect themselves, including through a voluntary certification program.

""They comprise a huge chunk of the Canadian economy,"" Goodale said of small businesses.

""And they are as interconnected as the rest of us to their suppliers upstream and to their customers downstream, so if they have a cyber problem, that whole network could be infected.""

Yet it wasn't immediately clear how the government intended to address what will be one of the biggest hurdles to successfully implementing the plan's ambitious goals: a shortage of cybersecurity specialists, both in Canada and around the world.

""A shortage of cybersecurity talent makes it difficult for organization -- including the federal government -- to attract and retain the people they need to improve their cybersecurity or to disrupt cyberthreats,"" the new strategy reads.

Goodale described the shortage as ""a huge challenge and a huge opportunity,"" noting that the cybersecurity industry in Canada already supports an estimated 11,000 jobs and generates $1.6 billion in economic activity -- numbers the government hopes to grow.

""The world will be demanding people with these talents and skills who understand cybersecurity and can deliver the goods for their employers,"" Goodale said, ""whether they are in the private sector or the public sector.""

But while the most recent federal budget set aside $8 million for up to 1,000 student work placements in cybersecurity, the strategy doesn't include a dedicated focus on skills training or set aside funding to help grow the industry.

""It's disappointing to see a lack of commitment to build Canada's cyber sector,"" said Benjamin Bergen, executive director of the Council of Canadian Innovators, which represents many of Canada's tech companies.

""Cyber is the fastest growing ICT sector in the world and domestic innovators present an opportunity for our government to grow our economy and deploy world-class technology solutions for protecting Canada's digital borders.""

The plan was also largely silent about foreign-owned telecommunications companies such as Huawei, which intelligence chiefs in the U.S. have identified as a national security risk, and made no mention of encrypting personal communications.

The latter has been a contentious issue between privacy advocates and law enforcement, who have argued that such encryption poses a barrier to investigations.

Goodale acknowledged the debate, saying that while it is obviously important for online banking and other commercial activities, ""there are important questions about law enforcement and national security being able to properly conduct investigations.""

A joint letter Tuesday calls on CEO Sundar Pichai to explain what Google is doing to safeguard users from the Chinese government's censorship and surveillance.

It describes the company's secretive plan to build a search engine that would comply with Chinese censorship as representing ""an alarming capitulation by Google on human rights.""

""The Chinese government extensively violates the rights to freedom of expression and privacy; by accommodating the Chinese authorities' repression of dissent, Google would be actively participating in those violations for millions of internet users in China,"" the letter says.

In a statement, Google said it has ""been investing for many years to help Chinese users, from developing Android, through mobile apps such as Google Translate and Files Go, and our developer tools. But our work on search has been exploratory, and we are not close to launching a search product in China.""

In the U.S., President Donald Trump and other conservatives have lobbed charges of censorship at Google and other U.S. tech companies, though they haven't provided evidence. On Tuesday, Trump claimed that Google had rigged search results about him ""so that almost all stories & news is BAD."" A top adviser said the White House is ""taking a look"" at whether Google should face federal regulation. The companies deny the accusations.

The rights groups' expression of concern over a Chinese search engine follows a letter earlier this month from more than a thousand Google employees protesting the China plans. The letter called on executives to review ethics and transparency at the company.

Google had previously complied with censorship controls starting in 2006 as it sought a toehold in the booming Chinese economy. But it exited the Chinese search market in 2010 under unrelenting pressure from human rights groups and some shareholders.

Tuesday's letter, signed by groups including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and Reporters Without Borders, said China's controls over the internet have only strengthened since then amid an overall crackdown on civil liberties and freedom of expression. The letter said it would be difficult for Google to relaunch a search engine ""in a way that would be compatible with the company's human rights responsibilities under international standards, or its own commitments.""

According to online news site The Intercept, Google created a custom Android app that will automatically filter out sites blocked by China's so-called ""Great Firewall.""

Google co-founder Sergey Brin was born in the Soviet Union in 1973 and lived there until age 6 when his family fled. He has said his experience with a repressive regime shaped his and the company's views.

However, Pichai, who became CEO in 2015, has said he wants Google to be in China serving Chinese users.

In December, Google announced it was opening an artificial intelligence lab in Beijing, and in June, Google invested $550 million in JD.com, a Chinese e-commerce platform that is second only to Alibaba in the country. The companies said they would collaborate on retail solutions around the world without mentioning China, where Google services including Gmail and YouTube are blocked.",[]

The regions will move into Stage 3 of the province's economic recovery, along with most public health units in Ontario, the provincial government announced Monday.

Region of Waterloo Public Health Region's Acting Medical Officer of Health Dr. Hsiu Li Wang said the region was notified on the move into Stage 3 on Monday afternoon.

""This will be a welcome update for many in our community,"" she said. ""We are able to move to Stage 3 because of the efforts of our residents to date.""

Dr. Wang said people will need to remain vigilant as more businesses open their doors.

""I ask all residents to please continue to follow the public health measures to slow the spread of COVID-19 in our community,"" she added.

Mandatory masking bylaws came into effect in the region on Monday. People need to wear masks in all indoor public spaces and on public transit, with some exceptions.

Waterloo Mayor Dave Jaworsky said the move into Stage 3 is ""welcome news for those businesses who have been waiting patiently.""

""We can't lost sight of the fact, however, that we are still in the midst of a pandemic and we cannot let our guard down,"" an emailed statement from Jaworsky said in part. ""This is still a serious issue and we must follow physical distancing.""

He also advised businesses to be deliberate in their plans to welcome people back through their doors and stick to guidelines from public health officials to avoid another shut down in the future.

""Only open when you're absolutely ready, don't rush it,"" he said. ""Nothing is more important than keeping everyone healthy.""

Indoor gathering sizes will increase to up to 50 people, a large increase from the 10 people currently allowed under Stage 2. Outdoor gatherings can be up to 100 people under Stage 3. People will need to maintain physical distance if they're gathering with people outside of their social circle.

The provincial government says certain activities won't be allowed because they are considered high-risk for the spread of COVID-19, including amusement parks, water parks, buffets, dancing at restaurants, and saunas and steam rooms.

Some regions, including the Toronto-area, Niagara and Windsor, will stay in Stage 2.

The regions will move into Stage 3 of the province's economic recovery, along with most public health units in Ontario, the provincial government announced Monday.

Region of Waterloo Public Health Region's Acting Medical Officer of Health Dr. Hsiu Li Wang said the region was notified on the move into Stage 3 on Monday afternoon.

""This will be a welcome update for many in our community,"" she said. ""We are able to move to Stage 3 because of the efforts of our residents to date.""

Dr. Wang said people will need to remain vigilant as more businesses open their doors.

""I ask all residents to please continue to follow the public health measures to slow the spread of COVID-19 in our community,"" she added.

Mandatory masking bylaws came into effect in the region on Monday. People need to wear masks in all indoor public spaces and on public transit, with some exceptions.

Waterloo Mayor Dave Jaworsky said the move into Stage 3 is ""welcome news for those businesses who have been waiting patiently.""

""We can't lost sight of the fact, however, that we are still in the midst of a pandemic and we cannot let our guard down,"" an emailed statement from Jaworsky said in part. ""This is still a serious issue and we must follow physical distancing.""

He also advised businesses to be deliberate in their plans to welcome people back through their doors and stick to guidelines from public health officials to avoid another shut down in the future.

""Only open when you're absolutely ready, don't rush it,"" he said. ""Nothing is more important than keeping everyone healthy.""

Indoor gathering sizes will increase to up to 50 people, a large increase from the 10 people currently allowed under Stage 2. Outdoor gatherings can be up to 100 people under Stage 3. People will need to maintain physical distance if they're gathering with people outside of their social circle.

The provincial government says certain activities won't be allowed because they are considered high-risk for the spread of COVID-19, including amusement parks, water parks, buffets, dancing at restaurants, and saunas and steam rooms.

Some regions, including the Toronto-area, Niagara and Windsor, will stay in Stage 2.

Accounting for both outbreak-related cases and non-outbreak cases, the Forest Heights/Forest Hill/Lakeside neighbourhood has the highest infection rate, at 992.9 per 100,000 people.

The Vanier/Rockway neighbourhood is next, with a rate of 945.6 cases per 100,000 people.

While both of those neighbourhoods have a high rate of outbreak-related cases, Vanier/Rockway also has the highest infection rate when adjusting for non-outbreak cases only.

Note: You can explore the map yourself by scrolling to the bottom of this article.

When looking at only non-outbreak cases, that neighbourhood has an infection rate of 260.2 per 100,000 people, with 41 cases.

Woolwich Rural North also has one of the highest rates of infection rate, with 212.9 infections per 100,000 people. There are 15 non-outbreak cases there.

The neighbourhood with the third-highest infection rate is Southwest Kitchener. There, the rate is 190.4 per 100,000 people.

Public health officials have reported 39 non-outbreak cases there, and 62 total cases.

On the region's website, officials note that the data is skewed because of previous testing guidance that prioritized certain groups.

The website also notes that, just because your neighbourhood may look okay on the map, it doesn't mean you're safe.

""There is broad circulation of COVID-19 in our community. You should assume you could get COVID-19 anywhere in Waterloo Region,"" the region's website notes.

Several neighbourhoods on the map are considered not reportable because they have five cases or fewer.

The data also shows that five cases have invalid or missing postal codes.

Since the pandemic began, there have been 1,299 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Waterloo Region. That includes 1,094 resolved cases and 116 deaths.

Region of Waterloo CAO Mike Murray reported the charges on Tuesday during one of the region's twice-weekly media briefing.

The charges were laid between June 23 and June 29 at a private residence in Waterloo and another in Kitchener.

In both cases, Murray says that more than 10 people were gathered.

""The emergency orders are still in effect, they are still being enforced, and the emergency orders do limit public gatherings to less than 10 people,"" he reminded the public during the briefing.

""I just encourage everybody to take the emergency orders seriously and take their personal precautions seriously.""

Over the weekend, the Ontario government extended its emergency orders until July 15.

Murray said during the briefing that the rules will continue to be enforced on Canada Day, when many people will be off work and may want to celebrate.

When asked whether these gatherings had anything to do with the situation where London party-goers had come to Waterloo Region, Murray said that the incidents were unrelated.

During the same time period when these charges were laid, enforcement officials had 142 site visits where they educated people about the emergency orders.

They also had 154 site visits where no action was required.

With these charges, the total now sits at 23 given out since the pandemic began.

Murray has said previously that in most cases, the fine would be given to the person facilitating the breaking of the emergency order, meaning the tenant or homeowner.

The company started with a focus on a device called Myo, a gesture-based device that strapped onto a user's forearm and allowed them to compute with their movements.

North then shifted its focus to Focals smart glasses, which the company says it will be winding down after the acquisition.

The company unveiled the product back in October of 2018, two years after receiving US$120 million in funding from investors like Amazon and Intel.

At one point the company had some 400 employees, but in February of 2019 it announced it was downsizing, something a Communitech spokesperson said at the time was ""not uncommon"" for a young company.

""Today, given that everyone – from the victims to the accused – were all part of the same household, we didn't really have any further concerns to the community,"" he said.

On June 13, first responders attended a fire at a Langley home on Wakefield Drive near 196 Street.

Investigators said at the time they found a man's body at the back of the house and that he had ""injuries consistent with homicide."" Two other peoples' remains were also found inside the home.

""There is no other word than tragic to describe what happened,"" Jang said. ""That family, I can definitely say, was not known to police and did not have any record of criminality.""

Jang would not elaborate on how the three died, saying the matter was before the courts.

Police say they were called to a bush fire at Blundell Neighbourhood Park at about 4:30 a.m. Friday.

Someone walking in the area – which is close to an elementary school – noticed the fire and put it out before emergency crews got to the scene.

Police say evidence gathered from the fire suggested it was intentionally set and that it appeared to be similar to 15 other fires that have been set in the city since the start of the year.

Now, Mounties say they're looking for a possible serial arsonist.

According to police, the fires were lit in hedges, garbage bins and in portable toilets in construction sites. Usually they've been set between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m.

""At this point, no one has been injured and property damages have been small,"" said Insp. Michael Cohee, in a news release.

""But Richmond RCMP is asking for information from anyone who can assist in identifying the person, or persons, responsible. Once we have a suspect, we can take steps to prevent any further arsons like these.""

Mounties say they increased patrols and created a task force in April to find the person or people responsible. But the efforts have been unsuccessful so far.

Police say all the fires have been happening ""within a specific area in Richmond,"" and anyone who lives south of Granville Avenue and north of Williams Road should be ""extra vigilant.""

""They are encouraged to check their home video surveillance regularly, to ensure it is working properly, and to report any suspicious activity captured overnight,"" Richmond RCMP's news release said.",[]

Sran died at the scene from his injuries and the Integrated Homicide Investigation Team was called in to take over.

They just ask that you please eat it somewhere far from where they're serving it.

Like many aspects of life as we knew it before the global health crisis, the hosts of the 34th annual festival and fundraiser are finding a new way to carry on while also working to stop the spread of COVID-19.

Rather than draw hundreds of people together to eat, watch live entertainment, socialize and eat some more, the festival is now drive-thru only. No live show, no dancing, no gathering alongside the neighbours outside St. Nicholas and Dimitrios Greek Orthodox Church at Boundary and East 29th Ave in East Vancouver. But that doesn't mean no enjoyment, and there's certainly no shortage of food.

""It's a little bit of a twist,"" says this year’s festival chairperson, Vivean Ready. Not only has the first weekend been busy, but she says the take-out service is likely going to last.

Vancouver city councillor Lisa Dominato gave her vote of approval, tweeting she's teaching her kids about their Greek-Canadian roots.

Busy day Greek Summerfest! Despite rain, Greek food lovers attended our annual event which pivoted to ""TO GO!"" this year. We spotted our @CityofVancouver Councillor @LisaDominato & hubbie picking up family dinner.

And B.C.'s health minister also shared shots of his dinner, including a side of those famous honey doughnuts.

Congratulations 2 everyone at @GreekSummerFest 4 their “drive-through“food festival. We love the regular festival-tmusic,dancing,volunteers,church. Not possible this year. Tonight at least @reneesarojini and I enjoyed the food. Thank you. Give it a try tomorrow or next weekend pic.twitter.com/8GKFtM6Umc — Adrian Dix (@adriandix) July 12, 2020

""A lot of people are making larger orders, picking it up and going,"" said Ready. ""Whereas if they were here, they would probably join their friends, have a meal, sit for a while, take in a show, have a snack, have dessert, have a couple of beers, a couple of wines and then they would go.

""We will definitely be providing some kind of pick up or deli service in the future or delivery service in the future because it’s been working so well. It's great for some people who don't want to come and sit here. They just want good Greek food.""

With the guidance of provincial health officers, organizers have been able to establish safety protocols and guidelines in order to go ahead. Ready said the fate of the festival was ""questionable"" until they settled on the drive-thru model since groups of 50 people are prohibited in B.C.

Customers order ahead online through the festival’s website and are asked to stay in their vehicles while their food is delivered to them. People are asked not to stay on site to eat. All servers and festival volunteers are expected to wear masks.

The festival is also charging a 50-cent markup called the ""COVID-19 recovery fee"" to cover additional safety precautions such as protective equipment, sanitizer and cleaning. But for anyone who feels the fee is unfair or those safety measures unwarranted, they offer a code to avoid payment.

Ready said the Greek Orthodox Community of East Vancouver relies on the festival to fund events and services throughout the year, including programs for seniors and youth as well as Greek heritage and language lessons. They have plans to build a permanent daycare and preschool.

""This will be a fraction of what we normally raise,"" she said. ""We are hoping we'll get by OK. We have a lot of support from our community and corporate donors that are trying to help us out.""

Greek Summerfest runs for two weekends, continuing until 8 p.m. Sunday, July 12. They open again next weekend, starting Friday, July 17 from 3 to 8 p.m. and again Saturday, July 18 and Sunday, July 19.

Demand to book tickets online caused the Park Board website to crash for nearly an hour Sunday morning as people tried to reserve time at Kitsilano, Second Beach and New Brighton pools for a designated session on Monday, the first day they reopen to the public.

Registration opened at 9:30 a.m.

Shortly after 10 a.m., the Park Board issued an apology, citing technical problem and thanking people for their patience.

Sincere apologies to anyone who is trying to book a swim online for the outdoor pool openings tomorrow. We are experiencing a technical challenge with our system and are working to bring it back up as soon as possible. We appreciate your patience as we remedy the issue. — Vancouver Park Board (@ParkBoard) July 12, 2020

By 10:30 a.m., the booking system was open for business.

The Park Board closed pools and recreation centres at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic when B.C. declared a public health emergency.

The three outdoor swimming pools are poised to open Monday, July 13 for the first time this year with new safety guidelines and health protocols. Maple Grove Pool will open July 20.

Swimmers must arrive ready to swim, meaning there will be no access to change rooms or lockers, and people must book their visit one day ahead, opting for 45 minutes for lane swimming or 90 minutes for leisure swimming.

The Park Board is enforcing the use of ""pods"" – painted rectangles on the pool deck – where family members or inter-connected groups can congregate at a distance from others.

Pods are limited to two people over the age of five and a maximum of three people.

""We encourage patrons to access the centre of the pod as much as possible, to allow for adequate distance between pods,"" the Park Board advises on its website.

Specific rules also govern swim lanes. Swimmers are asked to keep five metres apart and not congregate or socialize at the lane ends. To rest, swimmers are asked to leave the lane.

The pools will close for 30 minutes for thorough cleaning between sessions.",[]

""We have very limited choices. This seems like a good fit for us,"" says Sulthan Jafferali, whose family of five arrived at a Fraser Valley strawberry field with buckets in hand on Sunday afternoon.

The owners of Maan Farms in Abbotsford say they are prepared to make the farms safe for everyone.

""Strawberries, raspberries and blueberries — they don’t wait for anyone,"" says operations manager, Gurlene Maan. ""They don't care that there's a pandemic happening — they're growing.""

She says they added hand-washing stations and additional hand sanitizers throughout the property, hired more staff to enforce physical distancing and also created an online reservation for u-pickers.

""By introducing time slots, it was a great way to be able to control how many people are using the activities in our Barnyard Adventure Land and control how many people are in the fields,"" she says.

Despite the fact u-picking allows visitors to space out across the fields, Maan says they haven’t seen an uptick in visitors.

""COVID has definitely affected us. People aren't likely to leave their home as much as they would have last year, so I don't think the numbers are up,"" she says.

But their farm offers something else that has grown in popularity: goat yoga.

They host yoga classes with the four-legged creatures roughly every two weeks. Maan says those classes have filled up quickly.

""We have had sold-out classes because people are looking for something to do and people are wanting to go outside,"" she says.

Those are the same reasons that brought Jonathan Ma and his children to the farm.

The kids seemed particularly enamoured by the goats in the petting zoo.

""We saw that they have a lot of kid-friendly activities, and our kids love animals,"" he says, adding he's also pleased to see health precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Maan encourages more people to support local farms.

""It really just doesn’t feel safe,"" said Surrey resident Selena Werner-Bellon.

Surrey RCMP reported a woman was robbed and sexually assaulted on the path around 10:45 p.m. Friday, July 10.

The politician made the announcement on Twitter, adding that this June 30th also marked his 60th wedding anniversary with his wife Kathy, and the occasion seemed like a good time to announce his retirement.

B.C.’s next civic election takes place Oct. 15, 2022.

“I joined the CCF [Co-operative Commonwealth Federation] party to fight to save farmland in 1960 and was elected the first president of the BC NDP Youth in 1961,” Steves wrote, adding that Kathy has always “quietly shared my workload.”

The Steves family have farmed in Richmond for decades, and the couple still run the family farm and live in the 103-year-old home on the property.

Steves first got interested in politics over a fight to save the farm in the 1950s. A university student at the time, and said he came home one day to find his father saying they would have to go out of business.

50 years on #RichmondBC Council, 60 years married to my partner Kathy who quietly shares my workload, 60 years an activist. I joined the CCF party to fight to save farmland in 1960 and was elected the first president of the #BCNDP Youth in 1961 https://t.co/TUA1cGjMZv — ClimateChange Steves (@Harold_Steves) July 11, 2020

That’s because the city had denied his dad a permit to build a new dairy – a requirement during that period because Canadian regulators were requiring dairies to update to modern equipment. The Steves family found out their land and the land of many other farming families had been quietly rezoned for residential use.

“No one knew how to fight city hall,” Steves told CTV News Vancouver. “The taxes were going up and nobody knew what to do about it.”

The fight to protect farmland has motivated Steves throughout his long political career. He joined the CCF, the precursor to the New Democratic Party, and pushed for the creation of a land bank for farmland, an idea that would eventually become B.C.’s Agriculture Land Reserve.

Steves was first elected as a City of Richmond alderman in 1968, a post he held until 1973. From 1973 to 1975 he served as a B.C. NDP MLA, then returned to Richmond city council in 1977. He’s served as a city councillor continuously ever since.

Steves said his wife has been the backbone of his political career, doing all his filing and also reading countless reports. They met at the University of British Columbia, where Harold was studying agriculture and Kathy was studying nuclear physics.

“She does this all behind the scenes – basically it’s been the two of us together for 60 years,” Steves said.

The couple have five children and eight grandchildren.

Steves has been a stalwart critic of the B.C. government’s decision to build the Site C dam in the Peace region, warning that with the anticipated effects of climate change, the province couldn’t afford to lose valuable farmland.

In recent years, he’s fought to bring in changes to the size of houses allowed on farmland in Richmond, arguing that the large mansions that are currently allowed have led to rising land prices.

Steves said he plans to continue with his activism work, which is centred around protecting farmland and promoting the importance of strong local food systems.

He’s looking forward to continuing work on a plan to create 300 allotment gardens on some of the Garden City lands in Richmond, and ongoing work to create community garden plots in some city parks and develop incubator farms.",[]

In the past week, the number of new cases has increased steadily. On July 10, provincial health officials announced 25 new cases, the biggest increase since early May.

Friday, July 10: 25 new cases

July 9: 20 new cases

July 8: 18 new cases

July 7: 12 new cases

July 6: 7 new cases

July 5: 15 new cases

July 4: 9 new cases

""I'm not losing sleep at this point over the increase in cases right now but it’s something that I think needs to be watched very carefully,"" said Dan Coombs, a UBC mathematics professor who studies epidemiology modelling and has previously worked with the province on its overdose response.

""We have to recognize that we’re in a very delicate position,"" he told CTV News Vancouver.

Coombs said it's difficult to say why B.C. is seeing this increase in positive case numbers. There have been no new outbreaks at long-term care homes, and cases appear to be affecting younger people while there are also more incidents of community infection.

His biggest concern comes from the other side of the world, where Melbourne is entering a second lockdown. Stage 3 stay-at-home orders were announced for the Australian city on July 8 after the state of Victoria recorded 191 new cases in a few days.

Vancouver and Melbourne have shared a “broadly similar experience,” said Coombs, noting a pressing but unanswered question remains whether the cases will continue to rise or if these numbers will flatten.

He doesn't think B.C. is poised to return scale back its reopening or return to lockdown measures. ""I don't think we’re near that point yet, but the events in Australia in Melbourne indicate that this could be a possibility if things do increase rapidly.""

The next update from the provincial health officer is expected Tuesday, when B.C. will report on three days' worth of data.",[]

Contact-tracing is currently underway, but the health authority said people who might have been exposed to the virus should watch for symptoms in the meantime.

People who were at the Discovery Bay Resort and Gyro Beach Lodge on the specific dates are being told to self-isolate, while people who spent time in Kelowna’s downtown and waterfront areas are being asked to simply monitory themselves for symptoms.

Common symptoms of COVID-19 include:

Fever

Cough

Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

Loss of sense of taste or smell

Other milder symptoms may include: runny nose, fatigue, body aches (muscles and joints aching), diarrhea, headache, sore throat, vomiting and red eyes.

When the pandemic started and the B.C. film industry was forced to shut down, Thomas FX Group Inc. also had to close its doors.

As John and Betty Quee brainstormed on how they could reopen safely, they also had many questions.

""We can all wear personal protective equipment,"" John says, ""but what about the environment that we're working in, how does that get sanitized? How do we kill the viruses that are in the air or on surfaces?""

They purchased some equipment resembling a fog machine but instead, it gets filled with disinfecting liquid and then sprayed onto surfaces.

They kept on hunting for ideas and that's when they stumbled upon American company Biotech UV.

""The real advantage of using UV lighting is it's economical and it's very safe and it's not chemically enhanced with anything,"" says Betty.

She says the ultraviolet light can sanitize and disinfect 20 square feet each minute, so a 340 square foot room can be cleaned in 17 minutes.

Two weeks ago, the B.C. film industry officially got the green light to operate again as the province welcomed the third phase of the reopening plan.

WorkSafeBC created the guidelines that the industry must follow to keep crews and actors safe.

Betty says the industry has unique challenges.

""The really big concern in the film industry is everybody uses the same equipment and costumes. When they finish their scene, then they have to sanitize their wardrobes and costumes,"" she says.

The Quees believe BioTech could be a solution, as it can sanitize in a matter of minutes.

""In searching for a solution to help the film industry reopen, we just thought, 'Let's pivot and help all Canadian businesses reopen,'"" John says.

Thomas FX is now the only Canadian distributor of BioTech, stocking 16 different items that range from $70 to $1,700.

Instead of selling fake snow to studios, they're now selling UV machines to households and businesses across the country.

""This is less about making money and more about saving lives and creating something that gives people confidence to come in public and go back to their jobs,"" John says.",[]

Among them was Wang’s roommate Shayla Raine.

Raine explained that she wasn’t home on the January night when security video captured Kelowna RCMP officer Cpl. Lacy Browning executing the now controversial wellness check at her apartment.

“When I came back and opened the suite it looked like a crime scene,” she said. “I had to stuff my nose with tissue because the smell of blood.”

Troubling video of the incident emerged in June, prompting the head of B.C. RCMP’s southeast division to issue an apology to Mona Wang.

“When I first saw the video I was deeply concerned. And I’m very sorry to Ms. Wang for what occurred,” said Chief Superintendent Brad Haugli on July 2.

Mona Wang has launched a lawsuit claiming she was assaulted and abused by Browning who was dispatched to Wang’s residence to check on her wellbeing.

Surveillance video shows a handcuffed Wang, dressed only in a bra and leggings, being dragged facedown by her wrists and arms down a hallway and through the building’s lobby by the female officer.

No video has emerged to show what took place in the apartment but Raine believes much of the alleged assault happened out of view of cameras.

“Mona could not have possibly gotten broken blood vessels in her eyes or bruises on all of her legs and abdomen from only being dragged down the carpet or having her head stepped on or hair pulled,” Raine said.

“There was definitely more that happened inside the apartment and it was evidently clear from the crime scene I had to clean up.""

At the Vancouver rally close to 100 people also gathered to support Wang’s advocacy for an end to wellness checks without mental health professionals present.

Police say around 10:45 p.m., a man with a weapon approached a woman who was walking alone under the Expo Skytrain line toward Fraser Highway.

The man robbed the woman of her personal belongings, according to police, then pulled her into the bushes and sexually assaulted her. He then fled, and the woman was able to call police. Police say her injuries are minor. She was taken to hospital; she is also being supported by Surrey RCMP’s victim services team.

The suspect is described as a white man, aged 30 to 40 and 5'10"" tall. He was wearing a red and blue bandana on his face and was dressed all in black.

Surrey RCMP’s special victims unit has taken over the investigation and are seeking any witnesses. They are also asking for any dash cam video from motorists who may have been driving in the area at the time of the assault on the woman.

Police are also issuing a general warning to the public to avoid taking short cuts or walking along lanes, forested or secluded areas. They’re recommending walking with someone else, when possible, and telling someone where you are going and when you will be coming back.",[]

The BC Human Rights Tribunal has ordered a man to pay his former house cleaner just over $44,000 in damages for sexually harassing and assaulting her while she worked for him.

According to the June 26 decision, the woman, who the tribunal refers to as M.P., began working for the man, J.S., in 2011. At that time her employer, who the tribunal refers to as J.S., was still married. His wife died in 2013.

At first, J.S. and M.P. had a warm and friendly relationship, according to the tribunal’s decision. She referred to him and his wife as Uncle and Auntie, and after J.S.’s wife died, M.P. and her husband included J.S. on some family outings.

But as early as 2012, according to M.P.’s testimony to the tribunal, J.S. would touch her shoulder or buttocks from time to time. The contact escalated over the years, to the point where J.S. would attempt to touch M.P.’s breasts and genitals and remove her clothing, and would repeatedly attempted to pull her down on his bed.

While M.P. attempted to stop working for him around 2015 or 2016, she and her husband testified that J.S. came to their home to ask why she had stopped coming to his house to clean.

M.P. testified that J.S. had threatened to tell her husband about what was going on and “break her family up,” so she returned to work.

M.P. testified J.S.’s unwanted sexual touching and coercion escalated in 2017, until an incident on Oct. 27, 2017 when she said he pulled her down on the bed, touched her breasts and her genitals and attempted to have intercourse with her.

For his part, J.S. testified that the sexual relationship had been consensual and that he had paid M.P. money after the encounters.

However, tribunal member Emily Ohler said that on the whole, she found the testimony of M.P. and her husband more credible than J.S.’s account. Ohler found that M.S. had been discriminated against on the basis of sex.

Ohler ordered J.S. to pay M.P. $40,000 for “injury to dignity, feelings and self‐respect,” as well as $4,300 for wages lost as a result of the discrimination. Ohler also ordered J.S. to pay a total of $156 to cover medication and tribunal hearing expenses.",[]

Marcel Hanson recorded the ordeal using his phone, and said he and other beachgoers at the popular South Surrey beach attempted to help the family by calling a tow-truck and the fire department.

But the sand on that part of the beach also claimed one of the tow trucks, which eventually had to be pulled out with a second tow truck.

“We were just relaxing at Blackie Spit on Crescent Beach,” Hanson said. “All of a sudden this G-Wagon (Mercedes SUV) with a trailer with a Sea-doo on it comes down the ramp there, through the sand.”

Hanson said he was surprised to see the vehicle driving on the beach, which is near the sailing club; most people who bring their boats down to the beach use a hand-trailer to move relatively light sailboats, and they usually put boats into the water at high tide.

Hanson observed the SUV going further and further into the mud on the beach.

“I thought ‘Oh my gosh, this is not going to end well,’” Hanson said

Several people gathered to see if they could help, and eventually Hanson called several tow truck companies – but all the companies said they wouldn’t be able to send a truck for two to three hours.

On the advice of the sailing club staff, one of the beachgoers also called the fire department. A Surrey RCMP officer also arrived at one point.

Clover Towing eventually did arrive, sending three trucks. One of those trucks got stuck itself, and had to be pulled out by another truck.

Two to three hours later, the Mercedes and the tow truck were finally unstuck. Based on what he heard from the sailing club staff, Hanson said it appears this happens around once a year.

Hanson said while the event made for “good entertainment” to beachgoers, “I felt really sorry for the people.""

“They probably just wanted to come to the beach to try out their new Sea-doo, and it just ended completely differently than what they anticipated,” he said.",[]

The epidemiologist is now celebrated as the face of nerds everywhere.

A grade-school photo of the bespectacled blonde has gone viral, capturing seven-year-old Bonnie before she was Dr. Henry, the future provincial health officer flashing a toothy grin, her bob clipped to the side with a barrette matching her plaid pinafore.

There's no denying she's adorable.

The portrait is leveraged in a marketing campaign for Science World, capitalizing on the leadership and popularity of B.C.'s top doctor to drive home the importance of evidence-based research and inquiry in scientific fields – the backbone of STEAM literacy and the purview of ""nerds"" everywhere.

""A nerd is someone who loves what they love, no matter what,"" Science World declares in a press release. ""They bring passion, wonder and curiosity to everything they do. Nerds are all-in. That's the nerd way. Always 100 per cent because 110 per cent is not scientifically possible.""

855,ctvnews,https://bc.ctvnews.ca/sign-at-vancouver-hardware-store-calls-out-bad-customer-behaviour-during-pandemic-1.5020056,Sign at Vancouver hardware store calls out bad customer behaviour during pandemic,['Maria Weisgarber'],2020-07-10 18:53:00-07:00,"VANCOUVER -- It was one of many signs posted at the front of a Home Hardware store on Davie Street in Vancouver’s West End. Some indicated changes brought on by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including reduced opening hours and distancing.

But this sign referred to what some say is an unpleasant byproduct of current conditions: bad customer behaviour.

Under the title “Unacceptable,” the sign called out what was described as “appalling” disrespect and abuse towards staff.

“If you think you will be unable to behave in a calm, respectful manner and accept our current situation with empathy and an expectation of compromise, we kindly ask you to shop elsewhere,” it read.

George Schwab told CTV News he used to work at the store earlier this year, and experienced some rude customer behaviour himself.

“There is a sense that people, with their frustration, feel they can take it out on the employees,” Schwab said, and added they would try to explain the changes were for everyone’s safety, but it didn’t help.

“They ramp it up even more, and more, to the point where they’ve called myself, they’ve called all the employees….pretty derogatory names and swear words that we can’t say on TV. And it’s really sad.”

CTV News tried to reach the store’s independent owner, but did not hear back.

Home Hardware’s director of communications, Jessica Kuepfer, said while the sign was not one they provided to the store, the intention behind it was to try and protect employees.

“He wasn’t out of line in terms of suggesting that customers act in a kind and courteous manner,” Kuepfer said, and added shoppers have experienced a lot of change, and emotions are heightened. “We’re all dealing with a global pandemic, and as we strive to keep our stores safe, we ask that customers extend that level of safety and kindness back.”

Kuepfer said Home Hardware has created its own signs, which were also visible at the Davie Street store, reminding people that aggression, intimidation, and harassment will not be tolerated, and anyone behaving in that way will be asked to leave.

“We certainly did unfortunately need to create that sign in the last little while,"" she said. “We understand that it is a difficult and unusual time for everyone…we do ask that everyone is mindful of being a little more kind than necessary.”

Director of government relations for the Retail Council of Canada Greg Wilson said increased anxiety has ramped up the number of “problematic” interactions.

“I think people are accustomed to grocery stores and other stores being the same, and that they’re not right now completely the same, so I think there’s an element of that,” Wilson said, and added he thinks over the longer term, more businesses will end up investing in de-escalation training for their employees. “We encourage everybody to be kind, and remember that the employee in that retail store is also very anxious about their own health.”

Over the course of the day, a store employee came out and removed the unofficial sign, saying he was told to do so.

Kuepfer said the store owner made a decision to take the sign down, but was not asked to take that action.

Schwab said he remains grateful to the customers who were kind and would stand up to other shoppers getting out of line with the staff.

“I would just restate what Dr. Bonnie Henry has said all the time: Be kind, be safe, and be calm,” he said.",[]

The entire ordeal has left Kevin McIntosh shaking his head as he waits out another two-week quarantine at home.

""It's asinine, is it not?"" asked the 63-year-old, who lives a short distance from the U.S. border crossing into The Point.

""I put myself at probably substantial risk of being exposed to COVID-19 when it could have been done so simply by just going eight blocks across the border.""

McIntosh is the man behind an online petition urging the government to let B.C. residents with property in Point Roberts briefly cross the border to do necessary maintenance on homes and water vessels.

The roughly 2,800 signatories are calling for a special dispensation to access the small, sparsely populated pene-exclave (an area that can only be reached by passing through another area) to do things like shut off water, disconnect gas lines and secure their vacation properties from the threat of skunk and raccoon infestations.

In McIntosh's case, his primary concern was his 42-foot powerboat sinking at Point Roberts Marina, potentially releasing 400 U.S. gallons of diesel fuel into the ocean.

There are regular power interruptions at the marina, McIntosh said, and they sometimes mess with his boat's battery charging system. No battery power would mean no bilge pumps.

""Any water intrusion into the bilges would eventually fill it up and sink it,"" McIntosh said. ""You can imagine the problems that would ensue from an event like that, and I'm being prevented by the land border crossing agents from accessing the boat.""

Some residents have ponied up to have their boats towed back to Canada, but McIntosh said his was in pieces and not fit for moving. He was partway through the process of servicing his raw water cooling system when the pandemic hit back in March.

McIntosh credits one border guard with allowing him to briefly enter Point Roberts to check on the boat back on May 14, but he was only given 30 minutes to rush in and rush out. The guard made a strong impression, McIntosh said, that if he took a minute longer there would be hell to pay.

That little expedition triggered his first two-week quarantine at home.

After his petition garnered little traction, and after being brushed off by his local MP's office, McIntosh finally decided to try flying into the U.S. last Friday - despite some misgivings about spending time on an international flight, and in Washington state, where the COVID-19 case count is about 13 times higher than B.C.'s.

While his pleas have mostly fallen on deaf ears at the land crossing, McIntosh said the U.S. customs agents who screened him at Vancouver International Airport deemed his concerns a valid reason for entry.

He was ultimately able to fly to Seattle on a plane ticket that cost about $310, rent a car to drive to Bellingham for $134, and charter a flight to Point Roberts that cost him US$135.

That charter would have cost US$375, McIntosh said, but by sheer luck there were two other people looking to fly over to The Point that day.

He reached his boat Friday afternoon, and had it repaired and ready to move by the following Wednesday. McIntosh finally arrived at Steveston for customs clearance on Thursday, allowing him to begin his second quarantine.

""It was a journey, all right,"" McIntosh said.

With his boat now secured on blocks, McIntosh said he's done with his petition, but he's hopeful someone will take the reigns and formally present it to the government.

""Quite honestly, I'm somewhat angry at the political powers that be,"" he said. ""This world has just gone topsy turvy when it comes to thinking things through logically.""",[]
857,ctvnews,https://bc.ctvnews.ca/public-inquiry-into-long-term-care-would-take-too-long-says-seniors-advocate-1.5020121,"Public inquiry into long-term care would take too long, says seniors' advocate",['Michele Brunoro'],2020-07-10 19:16:00-07:00,"VANCOUVER -- While many agree the pandemic has highlighted serious flaws in B.C.'s long-term care system, the province's seniors' advocate is casting doubt on the need for a public inquiry.

Isobel MacKenzie believes changes to how the province provides long-term care are absolutely needed, but that a public inquiry would take too long to conduct. She said the circumstances will be reviewed, however.

“Whether it is what we would call a full blown public inquiry or whether it is looking at what happened and finding out what went wrong, where and why, certainly I believe the minister of health has indicated we are going to be doing that. I know my office will be doing that,” she said.

A number of family members came forward this week to speak about what they described as a disturbing lack of support for seniors at the outset of the COVID-19 outbreak at Lynn Valley Care Centre in North Vancouver. They have been calling for such an inquiry, even as B.C. Premier John Horgan has repeatedly rejected the idea.

The families said they saw seniors' calls for help go unanswered, and residents left in urine-soaked clothing for extended periods of time.

Mackenzie told CTV News one of the biggest issues facing long-term care is inadequate staffing, which impacts everything from feeding to bathing to bathroom use.

“We were seeing the impact of that magnified many times over in Lynn Valley (Care Centre),” MacKenzie said.

She suggested Lynn Valley, the first care home in the country to report a COVID-19 death, became a tragic learning ground.

""From that suffering came some positive outcomes in terms of learning what we could do better in subsequent care homes,” she said.

The MLA for North Vancouver-Seymour, Jane Thornthwaite, agrees that ""more could have been done,"" but also that a public inquiry would take too long to complete.

""We definitely need an independent review,"" Thornthwaite added. ""And it should start immediately.""

Of the 186 deaths from COVID-19 in B.C., almost three quarters have been linked to nursing homes.

From staff shortages to care aides infecting residents in multiple homes, efforts in some care facilities clearly failed to stop the spread of the virus.

And there continue to be significant outbreaks at seniors' homes in the province. The most recent is at Holy Family Hospital in Vancouver, where 13 residents have died.

Haro Park lost 11 seniors, and 25 residents died at Langley Lodge, which has had two COVID-19 outbreaks since the start of the pandemic.

“Langley Lodge invites some questions about how did that get so out of control so quickly given what we knew around controls at that point in the pandemic,” MacKenzie said.

Both the seniors' advocate and Thornthwaite agree change is needed.

The MLA also said there's ""not enough emphasis on giving seniors the support they need to stay at home as long as they possibly can and then the next issue is an entire revamp on the staffing.""

The seniors’ advocate expects her investigation to be complete by the fall, before an anticipated second wave of COVID-19 hits the province.",[]

According to Statistics Canada's monthly labour force survey released Friday, B.C.'s unemployment rate was at 13 per cent in June – down from 13.4 per cent the month before. Nationwide, the rate was 12.3 per cent, down from 13.7.

The survey results were gathered from June 14 to 20, which Finance Minister Carole James said was ""right in the middle of (B.C.'s) gradual economic reopening.""

""The data released today for British Columbians paints a picture of cautious optimism with a long road ahead of us,"" James said Friday morning.

""We continue to see positive signs as a result of B.C.'s restart plan.""

B.C. has been in a state of emergency because of the COVID-19 pandemic since mid-March.

But things are starting to improve in the province's economy and James said more than 118,000 people found jobs last month. She also said the employment gains made in both May and June brought back about 40 per cent of the total job losses seen since February.

""So no question these numbers are encouraging, but as I said, we have a long road to go,"" James said, adding that thousands of B.C. residents and businesses are still struggling.

""The total net job loss since the start of the pandemic stands at 235,000 … while that's a large number, those are people, those are families, those are individuals in communities.""

In May, Canada reported a record-high unemployment rate, but also saw signs of recovery in June.

More locally, however, at least four B.C. cities saw their unemployment rates go up in June.

Vancouver 13.1 per cent (up from 10.7)

Kelowna 10.2 per cent (up from 9.6)

Abbotsford-Mission 8.8 per cent (up from 7.5)

Victoria 11 per cent (up from 10.1)

James said ""there's no question"" that these increased unemployment rates in some cities is because of the challenges facing service and tourist sectors.

""You would, by now in Vancouver and in Victoria, be seeing cruise ships coming in, seeing passengers unload, be seeing people through the downtown core,"" she said. ""And that's just not possible.""

Services sector, youth hit hardest

James said B.C.'s services sector continues to be the hardest hit since the start of the pandemic.

However, with businesses reopening in the province's restart, she said this sector has also seen significant job gains recently.

""In fact, the accommodation and food services sector accounts for 50 per cent of this month's gain in jobs,"" she said.

James also said youth are still seeing a significant unemployment rate in the province at 29.1 per cent, which is slightly higher than it was in May.

Moving ahead, James said following provincial health orders and guidelines remains important.

""We need to stay focused on our restart plan, doing it in a responsible way so we can see more and more businesses reopen,"" James said.

""The best recovery for our economy is making sure that we continue to fight COVID-19.""",[]

Transit Police confirmed she was attacked just before 10 o’clock the night of May 12, at the Main Street-Science World SkyTrain Station.

The victim is seen approaching the fare gates on Main Street, when a man wearing shorts, T-shirt and a baseball cap comes into frame, winds up and slugs her in the back of head. The woman’s wig and belongings fall to the floor, and then the man is seen taking off.

The next images show the victim getting up and looking bewildered as she collects her possessions off the station floor.

The footage was captured by the security camera of a neighbouring condominium.

“Acts of violence occur all the time in this neighbourhood,” said Patricia Chartrand, who lives in the building at Main and Terminal.

“It’s horrific and shocking. It’s gotten progressively worse, and more and more dangerous.""

“When our kids (are) here, they’re afraid to walk in this area,” said another resident of the building. “Sometime we’re all afraid.”

Witnesses saw the man in the video cross the street moments after the SkyTrain attack and smash the glass of a bus stop stand.

Both Transit Police and the Vancouver Police Department acknowledged issues in the neighbourhood.

“We do have additional officers and resources working that area,” said VPD spokesperson Sgt. Aaron Roed.

Transit Police confirmed they tracked the attacker down and have recommended assault charges. They are also seeking a warrant for his arrest, but so far nothing has been approved by Crown.

That means the man is still at large.

“I want the city to pull their socks up,"" said resident Patricia Chartrand.

After 20 years as a condo owner in the building near the corner of Main Street and Terminal Avenue, Chartrand explained the situation has become dangerous.

“On the weekend I had some gentleman out here throw a container of food at me,” she said.

Residents are perturbed at the amount of garbage, drug paraphernalia and graffiti they see in the area despite it being a major transit connection and close to tourist attractions like Science World.

“I never know what to expect there could be people lying, sleeping, guys doing drugs and shooting up, “ said long-time resident Mort Broverman.

The residents explain that the breaking point came in the spring after a random assault just steps from a neighbouring SkyTrain entrance led to Transit police recommending multiple charges.

The incident was captured on the building’s security cameras.

In the video a man is seen walking up to another person and punching them from behind.

Transit police told CTV News that after a full investigation the suspect was identified.

The residents of several condo units near the intersection have also paid for a temporary fence to block people from openly using drugs on a courtyard area outside their front doors.

Jamie Bacon, who has been identified in previous trials as the former leader of the Red Scorpion gang, entered a guilty plea Thursday afternoon to conspiracy to commit the murder of 21 year-old Corey Lal, one of the victims of the Surrey six killings in October 2007.

Six people ended up being killed in execution-style shootings in a Surrey condo, including two innocent bystanders: Chris Mohan, who lived across the hall, and Ed Schellenberg, who was doing maintenance work on a gas fireplace.

Eileen Mohan, Chris Mohan’s mother, was in court to hear the pleas.

“He could have done this 10 years ago,” she said. “He made a calculated plea deal to set himself free.”

In May, the B.C. Court of Appeal had ordered a new trial for Bacon in connection with the Surrey six killings after prosecutors appealed a December 2017 stay of the charges involved. Bacon had also originally been charged with first degree murder in the case. That charge is now expected to be stayed.

Crying could be heard in court as Bacon appeared by video. He also pleaded guilty to counselling to commit murder in connection with a 2008 shooting.

The Crown and defence are making a joint sentencing submission of 18 years on the conspiracy charge, and 10 for the counselling charge, to be served concurrently. The maximum possible sentence carried by each charge is life, and there is no minimum sentence. Bacon has been in jail since his arrest in 2009, and will also get credit for time already served.

Outside court, Bacon’s defence lawyer Kevin Westell said if the judge accepts their proposal, factoring in time served, his client will have “somewhere between five or six years left to serve.”

“This has been a long, deliberative process of coming to the right agreement with the Crown,” Westell said. “We think, for many reasons, we’ve come to a resolution that’s principled, and is appropriate from all sides.”

Mohan said she hopes the judge considers how long it’s taken to come to this point.

“Mr. Bacon has dragged us since 2009, to plead guilty, and he didn’t. So maybe the judge will take that into account, and give him the sentence that’s really due to him,” she said. “It’s not just my son’s life. And that has to be taken into consideration, that six people’s lives meant something to this country and to the laws of Canada.”

Sentencing is scheduled for July 23. Mohan intends to read a victim impact statement in court at that time.

“I will have my day in court with him,” she said. “He will not escape me. He has escaped me for 13 years.”",[]

""This investigation is not trying to determine whether racism exists in B.C.'s health-care system. It does exist, just as it does in every aspect of Canadian society,"" said lead investigator Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond, adding the system ""clearly needs work.""

Turpel-Lafond, who previously served as B.C.'s representative for children and youth, was called in to investigate the allegations, and delivered an update Thursday. She announced a small team has been assembled to help with the investigation into a racist game allegedly being played in B.C. emergency rooms, behaviour she described as ""egregious.""

Indigenous people are being encouraged to fill out a survey about their experiences with the health-care system, and Turpel-Lafond said a preliminary report is expected in a few months. Health-care workers who have witnessed racism are also encouraged speak out and will not face incrimination in their workplace, she said.

""This is an issue of urgent concern, this issue of racism and Indigenous-specific racism in the British Columbia health-care system,"" she said.

Those who have experienced or have knowledge of racism in the health-care system can share their information over the phone at 1-888-600-3078 or addressing_racism@gov.bc.ca.

While not everyone will feel comfortable coming forward to share their stories, Turpel-Lafond said everyone who comes forward will be treated with ""utmost confidence and respect.""

""I want to assure all Indigenous people that you are safe to share the story with myself, my team,"" she said, adding that it is independent from government and there will be no retaliation for people who speak out.

The investigative team will include people with clinical experience and knowledge of the health-care system, including former provincial health officer Dr. Perry Kendall. Members will also include those with experience in conducting complex investigations and data analysis.

""But it's also very important to note that in all of those areas, there are Indigenous people on my team, and they're Indigenous professionals,"" she said. ""And that's important because safety and trust—to be able to work in this space—is a precondition.""

The investigation will look at the specific allegations around the racist game, but will also examine issues around systemic racism in B.C.'s health-care system.

""I think it is very important to send a clear message that this is not a healthy and appropriate way to behave,"" she said.

On June 19, B.C.'s health minister told the public he was made aware of allegations that health-care workers were guessing the blood-alcohol levels of patients, particularly Indigenous ones.

Health Minister Adrian Dix did not identify the hospital or health authority allegedly involved, but indicated the game may have been played at multiple emergency rooms.

He said he first heard the allegation from Deputy Health Minister Steve Brown who received information about the guessing game from both the community and ""inside the system.""

After the allegations were revealed, multiple Indigenous organizations – including Métis Nation B.C. and the BC Association of Aboriginal Friendship Centres – called on the province to hold a public inquiry into Indigenous-specific racism in B.C.

An employee at the Musqueam Golf and Learning Academy confirmed to CTV News that Kyle Ledingham was employed as of Monday, even as the company removed a posting on its website that said Ledingham ""has taught our youngest juniors, to teenagers, adults and senior players.""

On Wednesday, when CTV News visited the course to find out more, officials there didn't answer whether Ledingham was teaching teenagers.

On Thursday, Devin Sharma, the interim chief administrative officer of the Musqueam Band, said that Ledingham had been an independent contractor at Musqueam Golf and Learning Academy since 2017.

“Effective July 5, 2020, Mr. Ledingham’s services have been suspended while this investigation is ongoing,” he said in an e-mailed statement.

“Musqueam Golf and Learning Academy strives to create a safe and welcoming environment for every individual visiting our facility, including staff and players, and have offered our full co-operation to authorities investigating this matter,” he said.

Ledingham has not been charged. His lawyer says he is innocent, and if charged vows to defend him vigorously in court.

The Musqueam Golf and Learning Academy was one place the 17-year-old student said Ledingham drove her to, and while in the car, she said, she was propositioned for oral sex.

The student says she was sexually assaulted on four different times in the band room at Prince of Wales Secondary School.

Ledingham's teaching licence is on hold with his agreement, pending an investigation into his conduct. The Vancouver Police Department concluded its investigation into the claims and handed a report to Crown counsel in December. Crown prosecutors are now weighing whether to lay charges in the case.

""He teaches in many environments where there are kids and vulnerable students and that isn't right,"" the student told CTV News in an interview.

Prince of Wales school was the base of the Quest Program, where teacher Tom Ellison was convicted in 2006 of abusing several students while on trips with them in the 1970s. Concerns about his behaviour were ignored for years, according to news reports at the time.

The student says she also spent time with Ledingham alone, during a community service placement with him.

The Vancouver School District says there were almost 1,800 students registered in community service programs across the district. Supporters say it provides students with valuable learning and volunteer opportunities.

But some critics are calling for that program to be reviewed.

""Men need to be supervised in a lot of cases especially when it is one-on-one,"" said Karla Djini of Vancouver Rape Relief.

She said it's probably an overreaction to ban one-on-one time between students and teachers. But she said it makes sense to reduce it, and try to include even another student where possible.

""Having even just another person there would be a reasonable thing to try,"" Djini said.

The district says it has changed multiple policies since Ellison was convicted, saying it reported allegations against Ledingham to provincial regulators as soon as it heard of the situation.

The public didn't hear about the concerns, and it's not clear whether the Musqueam Golf and Learning Academy was informed.

Two other B.C. teachers were disciplined in the past week for having sexual contact with students. The first was with an 18-year-old graduate the teacher had taught for two years. The same teacher also gave alcohol to a 17-year-old former student before initiating contact.

The second teacher taught a student in Grades 10, 11, and 12, spending a ""significant"" amount of time with her outside school hours. The consent agreement says the relationship began the following September.

Both teachers were barred from teaching for 15 years. Their names are not published, as is customary, as the regulatory body says it feels publicizing their names could harm the students involved in the cases.",[]
864,ctvnews,https://bc.ctvnews.ca/how-to-prevent-sun-damage-before-it-s-too-late-1.5019636,How to prevent sun damage before it's too late,[],2020-07-13 06:00:00-07:00,"VANCOUVER -- Take a look in the mirror – a really good look. What's staring back at you is likely sun damage. Even on cloudy days, you need to protect yourself from the sun, something Dr. Jason Rivers says is crucial.

""One person every eight hours dies of skin cancer in Canada,"" he told McLaughlin On Your Side when Ross had his skin checked last week.

Dr. Rivers, at his PacificDerm office, used a UV photo to demonstrate the cumulative damage to Ross' skin.

""It's a really graphic representation of what the sun can do to your skin.""

The photo highlighted a red, dry spot on Ross' face, which Dr. Rivers said is called actinic keratosis.

""It's not a cancer of the skin, but it's a pre-cancer,"" he said, and it's caused by too much time in the sun without much protection – like sunscreen.

Dr. Rivers is also president of the Canadian Dermatology Association, which is committed to educating people about the importance of proper protection.

""People are always wondering which sunscreens do you use,"" he said. ""UVA, UVB means it's broad spectrum protection.""

UVB rays are responsible for the burning effects of the sun, while UVA rays play a greater role in premature aging and wrinkles.

""Both rays, however, can contribute to skin cancer formation,"" Dr. Rivers said.

UVA rays vary in the summer but even on a cloudy day you can burn. And as for UVAs?

""UVA is fairly consistent throughout the year,"" Dr. Rivers says. ""Sunscreen use can be beneficial year-round.""

And did you know that you can still be exposed to UVA rays while sitting by a window? While glass blocks UVB rays, UVA can still get through, which is why many people may have more freckles on the left side of their face because of UVA exposure while driving.

The Canadian Dermatology Association recommends sunscreens with an SPF of 30 or higher. And look for the association's logo on the product – they're tested and approved.

Dr. Rivers said people often don't apply enough sunscreen – only a quarter to a half of what they actually need. It takes about one fluid ounce for proper coverage of the whole body. That's about six teaspoons.

""In this case, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.""

As for the chemicals in sunscreens, Dr. Rivers says there's little evidence showing there's any real danger. But if you're concerned, try zinc oxide or titanium dioxide.

He also suggests buying a sunscreen that you'll actually feel comfortable wearing. If you have oily skin, you probably don’t want a base that looks or feels greasy, and the opposite is true for dry skin – you want some moisture.

Don't forget to keep skin covered in the sun, even if you are wearing sunscreen. Wear wide-brim hats, sunglasses to protect your eyes, and avoid peak hours of sun.

And as for Ross?

""Your skin is getting to the point now where you're not able to repair the damage that well,"" Dr. Rivers said.

A bit of a blow.

866,ctvnews,https://bc.ctvnews.ca/heatstroke-danger-for-kids-left-in-hot-cars-1.5004930,Heatstroke danger for kids left in hot cars,[],2020-07-10 06:00:00-07:00,"VANCOUVER -- Dozens of children die every year in the U.S. after being left in a hot car, most of them under the age of three. In Canada, the number is lower but the risk is the same.

Even on days with mild temperatures, the heat inside a vehicle can reach dangerous levels within an hour, posing significant health risks to small children and pets left inside. And the risk is ever-present. Earlier this year, a four-year-old boy in the U.S. died after sneaking out and into the family car unnoticed.

""Because everyone's home more often than usual, parents need to make sure that their keys are always out of reach of little hands,"" says Emily Thomas with Consumer Reports. ""And that their vehicles are locked at all times.""

The risk hot cars pose to children may be higher than usual this year. Because of the pandemic, most stores have implemented restrictions, limiting the number of people allowed inside at a time. Parents may be tempted to leave their child in the car to decrease the risk of exposure to COVID-19 while they shop.

But even with the window cracked or the vehicle parked in the shade, the interior temperatures of the car can reach dangerous levels in a short period of time.

""Children's bodies heat up three to five times faster than adults,"" Thomas says. ""That's why it's never safe for them to be left unattended inside of a closed vehicle. It doesn't matter if you're parked in the shade or if you've left the window cracked, or even if you think it's not that hot out. It effects them differently and it's never safe.""

A study from GM found that on a 35 degree day, a small car in the sun could get hotter than 50 degrees in just 20 minutes, and up to 65 degrees in 40 minutes. And it found that leaving the window cracked didn't alleviate the heat.

To keep your kids safe, leave them at home and arrange for childcare when running errands. You should also keep the car locked when it's in the driveway or in the garage, so kids can't get in when you're not looking.

And make it a habit to keep your cellphone or purse in the backseat. That way, you'll have to turn around and check the backseat every time you get out of the car.

If you spot a child or a pet that's been left in a hot vehicle, call 911 right away.

But last year, ICBC cleared the way and now vehicle owners can put their idle cars to work and potentially make hundreds of dollars a month.

Daniel Barozzini loves his Tesla so much, he's named it Artemis.

""I have a great passion for cars,"" he says. And now he's going to share Artemis on Turo, which launched on June 16.

""We already have 65,000 users signed up to our app in British Columbia,"" says Cedric Mathieu, Turo's Canadian director.

An Angus Reid study recently found that Canadians spend thousands of dollars on their cars every year, but typically only drive them four per cent of the time, something that motivated Barozzini to join Turo.

""I have two cars, one of them usually sitting in the parking lot,"" he says. Now they're both listed on the site – the Tesla 3, which you can borrow for about $167 a day, and a Chrysler 200 for $37 a day.

Turo supplies the insurance - a percentage of the daily rate, depending on the kind of coverage you want. That's something that took ICBC a while to approve.

""We're happy that this product has finally been made available and that protects every car listed on the platform,"" Mathieu says.

Or, B.C. residents can buy rental car insurance for $10 a day, but only on vehicles that rent for less than $125 a day.

The company screens every guest and host that joins the platform and they review one another too, something Barozzini, as a host, likes.

""It creates an environment of trust and transparency,"" he says. ""And so far, since it's launched it's been great for me and I'm definitely going to continue it.""",[]

""Initially, the owlets would only stick their head out of the nest for a short while before crawling back into the nest,"" Lavoie told CTV News Vancouver.

""They're very well camouflaged with Mom always standing guard while the dad searched for food but also stood guard on a nearby tree watching for predators like the eagle who would love to whisk away an owlet or two for a quick snack.""

Soon, the owlets were ready to emerge from the nest and stretch their wings, Lavoie said. The father owl would start hooting, a signal to the young owls it was relatively safe to come out of their nest. First, they would fly just a short distance, with Mom by their side. A few weeks later, Lavoie observed them flying to a tree a bit farther away.

""The owlets stuck together, always flying to the same tree as one another,"" Lavoie said. ""They often snuggled up to one another, possibly to stay warm and safe.""

As the owlets have practised flying, they've also learned to hunt, he said.

""A fellow photographer has actually seen a male owl drop a rat in the field so the owlet can swoop in and learn to pick it up,"" Lavoie said.

A thrill for Lavoie was the chance to get an elusive shot of the male adult owl carrying a dead rat in its beak, preparing to share the tasty morsel with the owlets.
