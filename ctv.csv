Authorities were called to a North York apartment building, in the Weston Road and Finch Avenue area, just after 10 a.m. on Saturday morning.

Police said when they arrived they located two children, a six-month-old girl and a four-year-old boy, suffering from stab wounds inside an apartment unit.

A video sent to CTV News Toronto by a viewer shows a woman being led into the back of a police cruiser in handcuffs. It also shows what appears to be the children being carried into an ambulance.

The children were rushed to SickKids Hospital with serious injuries, police said. Their injuries were initially deemed life-threatening but police later said their condition improved and are expected to survive.

Const. Alex Li said the 36-year-old mother, who was arrested at the scene, has been charged with two counts of attempted murder, two counts of assault and two counts of aggravated assault.

The identity of the woman will not be released, police said, to protect the identity of the victims.

""This is a very serious stabbing and we're taking this very seriously,” Li said. “We have deployed our available resources to look into the matter... You can expect an active crime scene.""

""Having young children myself, I couldn't imagine that type of trauma and injury,"" Li said.

""Land back, we want our land back, that's part of reconciliation,"" said Ellen Gabriel, a Mohawk activist and spokesperson for the People of the Longhouse in Kanesatake.

""Giving our land back and having us part of the decision making process on what happens on our land, that's reconciliation, and it has to be done in a decolonized framework, in a way that respects Indigenous laws, that respects the rights of the women who are the title holders of the land you're standing on.""

The commemoration was to honour those community members who played a critical role during in the summer of 1990, when the country's attention was on Oka, a small town about 50 kilometres northwest of Montreal.

""The stand taken that summer became an important symbol for peoples across North America, inspiring them to take similar stands against the emancipation of their ancestral lands,"" Gabriel said.

Thirty years ago Saturday, on July 11, 1990, Quebec provincial police moved in on a barricade erected by Mohawks that March to protest the planned expansion of a golf course and development on what is ancestral land.

A provincial police officer was killed and the situation escalated into a tense, 78-day standoff between Mohawks and Canadian soldiers.

""Our basic human rights were violated by the Surete du Quebec (provincial police), the Canadian army, condoned by the governments of Quebec and Canada, pushed forward by private enterprises including those within the municipality of Oka,"" Gabriel said.

The 1990 siege ended when the expansion was cancelled and the barricades came down.

Three decades later, however, the underlying land dispute remains unresolved.

The trio of federal ministers that oversee Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada said in a statement the pain and trauma inflicted continues to this day.

""Today, we must acknowledge that progress in our relationship has been unequal, halting, and often, far too slow,"" the government said, adding mistakes must be learned from.

""We must resolve to never order the deployment of the Canadian Armed Forces against Indigenous Peoples, as we remain deeply committed to dialogue and peaceful resolution of conflict.""

Like the conversation around residential schools and murdered and missing Indigenous women, Gabriel said the issue in Kanesatake won't be an easy one.

""It's going to be an uncomfortable discussion,"" Gabriel said. ""But when are we actually going to see actions and have a voice in what reconciliation is going to be.""

Under a light rain, a rolling convoy made its way through the community to a nearby provincial park, passing by a real-estate development in Oka that has been a flash point in recent years, before returning home.

A similar event took place Saturday in Kahnawake Mohawk Reserve, southwest of Montreal, where a rolling convoy of vehicles from that community stopped briefly on the Mercier Bridge, which was barricaded in 1990 in solidarity for those manning posts in Oka.

""A lot of people joined in and it lasted a good two hours, driving on the highway at about 10 kilometres an hour,"" said Joe Deom, a sub-chief in the Bear clan.

""I felt it good about the attention our own people had to this anniversary -- a lot of our own people weren't even born at that time, so it's good that they're enthusiastic about it.""

Among those present in Kanesatake on Saturday was NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh and Manitoba NDP MP Leah Gazan, invited by the Longhouse.

Singh said thirty years removed, lessons clearly haven't been learned.

""The problem was created by Canada,"" Singh said. ""It's 2020, with the resources this country has, there's no excuse why this cannot be resolved.""

In many ways, Gabriel said, the situation remains unchanged -- land rights aren't respected and systemic racism remains at the core of Indigenous people's relationship with governments.

Ghislain Picard, the grand chief of the Quebec Assembly of First Nations, marked the 30th anniversary with an open letter calling on Quebec Premier Francois Legault to change his tune on systemic racism, which the premier has said repeatedly doesn't exist.

""Systemic racism and discrimination are not just concepts or theoretical notions,"" Picard wrote. ""Rather, they are a set of facts and behaviours and we should not be afraid to name and denounce them if we are genuinely willing to correct them.""

Rowe'],2020-07-11 18:11:00-04:00,"MONTREAL -- Few people had as unique a view of the Oka Crisis in 1990 as the officers at the Kahnawake Peacekeepers.

Retired Peacekeeper (PK) Warren White said that the summer of 1990 was incredibly tough, but it helped make the community’s police force what it is today.

“Today you have a well-educated police department,” said White. “They’re very well trained, they’re very community oriented and they believe in their community.”

White joined the force in 1979 and retired in 2013.

Leading up to 1990, White said the relationship with surrounding municipalities and populations was always tense.

“Our relationships with our surrounding communities was always very, very fragile because the governments kept telling the people that we weren’t a police department and they shouldn’t recognize us,” said White.

Kahnawake, unlike Kanesatake where the SQ patrolled the community in 1990, had a local police force in place. When Kahnawake’s warriors joined in solidarity with those in Kanesatake under siege by blocking the Mercier Bridge and highways cutting through the community, the eight-man force maintained patrols.

“We were caught up in a situation that we had no control over,” said White. “Yes, we were a police department, but there were eight of us. How was eight policemen going to control something that was already out of control.”

Current PK Clint Jacobs was watching from across the river in Montreal’s West Island, and seeing his fellow community members suffer helped his decision to apply for the job in 1991.

“There was all this turmoil in Kahnawake and stress, and out there (on the West Island), it didn’t affect them one bit,” he said. “They didn’t quite understand. People were saying, ‘Why do you want to live there? Why don’t you just leave?’ They don’t understand that it’s your home.”

Jacobs ran supplies into the community and helped those who needed transport to a hospital.

“That’s kind of why I became a Peacekeeper because I was too separated from my community, and I never felt more separated than at that time,” said Jacobs.

Peacekeepers helped transport food in to the community that was donated from community groups in the surrounding area, and escorted elders, women and children off the territory.

White was with the caravan that went through the infamous Whiskey Trench where cars full of women and children were pelted with rocks as police officers in LaSalle watched.

“It was terrible to see,” said White. “It wasn’t us that created that incident there. It was the lack of the police departments in LaSalle, in Montreal, the SQ, RCMP from in fact doing anything. They just stood there and watched.”

White remembers being on a boat escorting people across the water when an SQ helicopter stopped him with guns drawn.

“What was ironic about it was the officer who was pointing a gun at me, I knew who he was because I met him before, and I blatantly said to him, ‘what are you doing’ and the officer was shocked,” said White. “He put the firearm away and just flew off, but still… He was in shock that that thing happened.”

Though frustrated, White sympathized with officers on the other side.

“I believe some of them were sensitized through their training to deal with Native people – maybe not as much as what’s being done today – but these are people that over those years, prior to 1990, when we needed expertise, we called them,” said White. “It was the higher ups that were telling them what to do,” said White.

When the standoff ended, Peacekeepers continued to do their job patrolling the community, often having to pull over residents from off the territory for traffic violations and other offences. White and Jacobs said it took years to get non-Indigenous people to respect their authority.

“It was very hard,” said White. “Every time we tried to stop a vehicle that committed a traffic violation, they would flee and we ended up in chases out of our territory. And everybody challenged our authority.”

“As Peacekeepers we kind of got stuck in the middle,” said Jacobs. “You had outside forces that were encroaching, they wanted to extend their jurisdiction on our territory, (and) obviously there were issues with people’s relationship with outside departments was not good at all, and we got stuck in the middle.”

White said things started to change in the late '90s, highlighted by the Mohawk Council of Kahnawake and Quebec government signing the Agreement on Police Services Between Quebec and Kahnawake in March 1999.

White said he feels current PKs benefit from the fights he and his fellow officers went through in the '80s and '90s. The force is now a respected Indigenous policing agency that is held up as an example across the country.

“We were the guinea pigs,” said White. “We learned.”",[]
7,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/trump-lags-biden-on-people-of-colour-in-top-campaign-ranks-1.5020347,Trump lags Biden on people of colour in top campaign ranks,['Darlene Superville'],2020-07-11 12:01:00-04:00,"WASHINGTON -- Amid a summer of racial unrest and calls for more diversity in leadership, President Donald Trump lags Democratic rival Joe Biden in the percentage of people of colour on their campaign staffs, according to data the campaigns provided to The Associated Press.

Twenty-five per cent of the Republican president's senior staff are nonwhite, compared to 36% of Biden's senior staff. Biden's overall campaign team is 35% nonwhite; Trump's campaign did not provide a comparable number.

And neither campaign provided racial breakdowns for their nonwhite staff, nor the total number of staffers who are on their payrolls, including senior staff.

Advocates for minority groups say staff diversity is necessary to ensure political candidates hear a full range of voices and viewpoints to help them understand the concerns of various communities and interest groups -- especially at a time when racial injustice is front and centre in the national conversation. And while Biden has an edge on Trump, there is plenty more to be done in presidential campaigns overall.

Jennifer Lawless, commonwealth professor of politics at the University of Virginia, said ""there are still a lot of milestones that haven't been hit"" by political campaigns, such as a Black man or woman directing -- and winning -- a presidential campaign. And she said having diverse staff at lower levels in campaigns can help increase the pool of future managers, finance chairs and others.

""It's all part of the pipeline,"" Lawless said.

Trump's campaign makeup got a double-take in June when Vice-President Mike Pence tweeted -- and later deleted -- a photo from his visit to campaign headquarters. The photo at first drew attention for the lack of social distancing and use of face masks among the staff. But it also was notable for the sea of mostly white faces.

Eric Rodriguez, senior vice-president of policy and advocacy at UnidosUS, said the Biden team had more Latinos in senior positions than Trump.

""You need people from those communities to be able to make those connections,"" said Rodriguez, whose organization used to be called the National Council of La Raza.

The rival campaigns fared better -- and are about even --- on employing women, with females filling more than half of all jobs overall, and more than half of all senior positions.

The president's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, who is white, former White House aide Mercedes Schlapp, who is Cuban American, and Katrina Pierson, who is Black and worked on Trump's 2016 campaign, are among the highest-profile senior female staffers working to help reelect him.

Others include former Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle, now a top campaign fundraiser and the girlfriend of Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., and Hannah Castillo, the campaign's coalitions director. Guilfoyle's late mother was from Puerto Rico. Castillo is Mexican American.

Biden senior adviser Symone Sanders, who is Black, is the campaign's highest-ranking person of colour and, at 30, is the youngest member of his inner circle. The candidate also recently brought on several African Americans who worked for President Barack Obama, including Karine Jean-Pierre, formerly an NBC News and MSNBC political analyst.

Jamal Brown, a spokesperson for Biden, said the former vice-president's campaign reflects the ""diversity, breadth and promise of America.""

""He believes our democracy is strongest when people see themselves reflected in their government,"" added Brown, who is Black.

The killing in May of George Floyd, who was Black, by a white Minneapolis police officer sparked nationwide protests against racial injustice and calls for greater minority representation across the board in society that brought fresh scrutiny to the presidential campaigns.

Biden had faced questions earlier in the campaign about the lack of diversity on his staff. Along with adding more people of colour to his campaign, Biden has promised an administration that ""looks like America"" if he is elected on Nov. 3.

The U.S. population is about 60% white, 19% Latino and 13% Black, according to Census Bureau estimates.

Trump has not made a similar pledge about a potential second term. His campaign declined to discuss minority representation on the campaign staff.

Four women currently serve in Trump's Cabinet: CIA Director Gina Haspel and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, both of whom are white; Jovita Carranza, a Latina who leads the Small Business Administration; and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, who was born in Taiwan.

Housing Secretary Ben Carson is the only Black member of the Cabinet.

Rodriguez summed up the Biden campaign strategy as focused on winning support from a diverse pool of voters, especially in battleground states where large numbers of Latino and Black voters live. He characterized Trump's strategy as being ""really all about the base"" and attempting to replicate his successful 2016 campaign playbook, which used immigration as a wedge issue.

""The strategy is to run on racial division,"" Rodriguez said of the president, who has begun to use the racial tensions that surfaced after Floyd's killing in his reelection pitch.

Still, Trump and his campaign make regular appeals to Black and Latino voters.

The president regularly cites employment gains for these groups before the coronavirus pandemic struck, and he continues to showcase legislation he signed to overhaul criminal sentencing procedures and provide permanent funding for historically Black colleges and universities.

This week, Trump was surrounded by Latino American leaders as he announced a new advisory commission to help Hispanic Americans with economic and educational opportunities.

But the event also highlighted how far Trump has to go in winning support from people of colour. Critics of Trump's record with Hispanics called for a boycott of the Goya food company after its president praised Trump at the event.

The president does have strong support among some people of Cuban and Venezuelan descent, though, because of his tough stance against authoritarian leaders in those countries.

The Biden campaign said LGBTQ staff and staff of colour hold such positions as senior advisers, deputy campaign managers, national coalitions director, chief financial officer, chief operating officer and national press secretary, among others.

Trump's campaign defined its senior staff as ""senior leaders who meet regularly to make decisions. People with authority,"" and did not elaborate.",[]
8,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/video-calls-separate-bedrooms-bolsonaro-s-first-covid-week-1.5020444,"Video calls, separate bedrooms: Bolsonaro's first COVID week",['Daniel Carvalho'],2020-07-11 14:44:00-04:00,"BRASILIA, BRAZIL -- After months in which Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro downplayed COVID-19 by flouting social distancing recommendations and mostly shunning masks, both coronavirus precautions became part of his cloistered life this week at the official residence in capital Brasilia.

Bolsonaro, 65, announced on Tuesday that he tested positive for the virus and had experienced fever, aches and malaise. He scrapped a trip he had planned to northeastern Piaui state, and all his meetings for the week were converted to video calls.

One was with former congressman Roberto Jefferson, president of the conservative PTB party. Jefferson told The Associated Press that he went to the presidential Planalto Palace and sat in front of a large television where he could see Bolsonaro in a makeshift office at his residence.

""I found the president well, flushed, willing. In very good health,"" Jefferson said Saturday. ""I only saw him cough once, when I made a joke.""

Since his diagnosis, Bolsonaro has held virtual meetings almost every day with Jorge Oliveira, secretary-general of government, to sign official documents. According to Oliveira's office, a protocol was created so work could be carried out digitally.

This was also how Bolsonaro interviewed candidates to head the education ministry, he said on Facebook on Thursday. The following day, he named to the post Milton Ribeiro, a former deputy dean of Mackenzie University in Sao Paulo who preaches at a Presbyterian church in Santos, outside the metropolis.

Only a few aides who were previously infected by the new coronavirus could get close to Bolsonaro during the week, one of them said on Tuesday. The person declined to be named, citing lack of authorization to speak with journalists. Bolsonaro also spent some time in the afternoons in front of the palace with photojournalists 400 yards away, on the other side of a garden. He had met his supporters by that garden until his diagnosis, but no longer.

The new routine marks a stark change for Bolsonaro, who spent months attending rallies with his fans, heading out to bakeries and food trucks to mix and mingle. He sometimes declined to wear a mask. He has scoffed at the restrictions mayors and governors implemented to contain the spread of the virus, arguing their economic impacts would cause more suffering than the virus, which he repeatedly called ""a little flu.""

Bolsonaro took hydroxychloroquine pills for five days, Monday through Friday, according to a member of the presidential medical team who asked to not be identified, citing patient confidentiality and because the person isn't authorized to speak publicly. The drug has no proven effect on the treatment of COVID-19 and can cause side effects such as cardiac arrhythmia, according to medical studies. As a result, Bolsonaro was subjected to electrocardiograms and blood tests, the person said.

Brazil's presidential press office said in a statement that the president has experienced no medical problems with his treatment.

The aide who spoke on condition of anonymity said Bolsonaro slept in a different bedroom to keep the first lady, Michelle Bolsonaro, safe. He lives with her, his daughter and step-daughter.

On Saturday, the first lady shared a photo of her COVID-19 test results showing she was not infected.

""My daughters and I tested negative for COVID-19,"" she wrote in the post on her verified Instagram account. ""I appreciate the prayers.""

On Thursday, Jair Bolsonaro held his weekly live broadcast on Facebook. This time, he was not accompanied by a minister or a sign language interpreter, as usual. Despite saying he felt well, he said he should still be isolated next week, so as to avoid contaminating anyone.

""I'm sorry I can't interact with you here. Not even next week will it be possible, because I think I will not yet be completely free of the virus, so I will not have anyone on my side here,"" Bolsonaro said on the broadcast.

During the broadcast, he wasn't wearing a mask. But the aide said Bolsonaro now regularly wears the equipment to protect both his family and the more than 100 employees who work at the residence.",[]

The unanimous decision by the Chama cha Mapinduzi party to back Magufuli came as no surprise.

The president, nicknamed ""The Bulldozer"" for his relentless work ethic and populist approach, has unsettled critics and some in the international community as his government clamps down on opposition gatherings, arrests opposition leaders and punishes dissent.

His administration's approach to the coronavirus pandemic -- not announcing case numbers since April, questioning face masks and declaring COVID-19 defeated -- has caused further alarm.

Former President Ali Hassan Mwinyi and members of the ruling party have urged Magufuli to try to stay in power after 2025 despite Tanzania's two-term limit. But he has said he won't seek an extension after two terms.

Opposition parties have not declared their official candidate, and they have expressed skepticism with the electoral commission, demanding amendments to ensure the upcoming vote is free and fair.

Ruling party secretary-general Bashiru Ali told the gathering that the National Executive Committee nominated Magufuli because of his commitment to social and economic development and fighting corruption.

Magufuli said he was surprised by the support. ""I never imagined I could get 100%,"" he said. ""This, however, should not mean winning the election by 100% as we have more work to do as a party.""",[]

He also said the couple's tempestuous marriage broke down for good after an incident in which he accused Heard or one of her friends of defecating in the couple's bed.

He said he thought it was an oddly fitting end to the relationship.

Depp was concluding almost four days of evidence in his libel case against a British tabloid newspaper that accused him of physically abusing Heard.

The Hollywood star is suing News Group Newspapers, publisher of The Sun, and the paper's executive editor, Dan Wootton, over an April 2018 article that called him a ""wife-beater.""

In the High Court witness box, Depp has described a volatile relationship with Heard that descended into screaming matches which sometimes turned physical.

But he has strongly denied hitting Heard and accused her of compiling a dossier of fake claims against him as an ""insurance policy.""

Depp, 57, and Heard, 34, met on the set of the 2011 comedy ""The Rum Diary"" and married in Los Angeles in February 2015.

Heard, a model and actress, filed for divorce the following year and obtained a restraining order against Depp on the grounds of domestic abuse.

The divorce was finalized in 2017.

The Sun's defence relies on a total of 14 allegations by Heard of Depp's violence between 2013 and 2016, in settings including his private island in the Bahamas, a rented house in Australia and a private jet.

He strongly denies all of them.",[]

The statement was made anonymously on an Instagram account recently created as a space for people to share stories of trauma they’ve experienced at the hands of others in the tattooing, piercing and music scenes in Montreal.

“Recent public statements have led me to acknowledge that some of the interactions I have had with women have caused them harm,” Desrosiers wrote. “I have decided to withdraw from the band and seek professional help to educate myself and act appropriately in the future.”

The same message was posted to the band’s Instagram around the same time on Thursday.

The claims against Desrosiers – posted two days prior to his announcement – say that he made inappropriate jokes with a minor and began “running after her for sex” as soon as she was of age. The post says a consensual relationship between the pair eventually became uncomfortable for the woman, who says Desrosiers would invite his friends to have group sex with them without her consent. The woman said she felt trapped because Desrosiers allegedly threatened to call the cops on her when she threatened to go public with her experience.

The account, called victims_voices_montreal, began posting just four days ago. Since, around 80 stories have been posted and similar accounts around Canada have popped up as well, including ones for the Gatineau and Outaouais regions.

It was on the Montreal account that Safia Nolin, a musician from Quebec City, made a statement claiming that Quebecois actress Mariepier Morin sexually harrassed her and made racist comments during an interaction between the two at a bar in 2018. Following the statement, Morin addressed the sexual harassment claims through an apology on her Instagram. She didn't address the comment about her alleged racist remarks. Morin has since decided to take a professional hiatus.

13,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/b-c-man-prepares-to-be-first-to-receive-double-hand-transplant-in-canada-1.5020297,B.C. man prepares to be first to receive double-hand transplant in Canada,[],2020-07-11 10:34:00-04:00,"VANCOUVER -- When Rick Thompson's doctor told him a surgical team was going ahead with his double-hand transplant in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, his first reaction was surprise.

""We're targeting August, maybe early September,"" he said in a recent interview.

""I was even shocked when (the doctor) told me. I met him last week and I asked him for a ballpark time frame. And he said August, and I said 'Oh, OK.' I wasn't quite ready for that.""

Thompson moved to Ontario from British Columbia in April to prepare for the surgery in London. It involves medical and psychological tests, as well as finding a donor.

If things go as planned, Thompson will be Canada's first double-hand transplant patient.

Thompson had all of his limbs amputated after contracting bacterial meningitis and septic shock in 2015.

He left work early one day in May, after feeling like he was coming down with the flu, and decided to sleep it off. A few hours later, he woke up to get a drink of water.

""But when I stood up my feet were like on fire. I could barely walk. I made it downstairs to where my wife Rita was watching TV. And that's pretty well the last thing I remember. I just collapsed on the floor.""

He woke up six weeks later in intensive care, confronted with the choice of dying in palliative care or amputation.

""If I wanted to survive, I would need all four limbs amputated,"" he said.

""In the end, the will to live is stronger than anything else.""

After 8 1/2 hours of surgery, doctors had amputated his limbs.

""That was a difficult time, obviously, because you know, you wake up as a different person. You look down and all you see is bandages ... where your hands used to be or where your legs and feet used to be,"" he said.

""The first thing that came to my mind was, what did I just do?""

After learning about hand transplants two years ago, Thompson met with a team of doctors in Ontario to assess whether he would make a suitable candidate.

""It's life changing,"" he said.

""Being able to shake someone's hand, being able to pick up a cup of coffee with one hand, write your name with a pen, open a door, you know, just the things that we take for granted every day.""

Dr. Steven McCabe, who performed Canada's first hand transplant, may participate in the surgery. He is a hand surgeon at Toronto Western Hospital and an associate professor at the University of Toronto.

The surgery can take 10 to 12 hours with four teams of surgeons. Each team consists of six to 10 people.

While operating on both hands makes the surgery logistically harder because it involves more people, McCabe said it is ""logical"" to do the two transplants at the same time.

""When you transplant, you're introducing this different tissue,"" he explained. ""And the theory behind that is that you don't want to introduce two different donor tissues.""

A person who undergoes a transplant has to take immunosuppressants, so the body doesn't reject the new organ or limb, and it's easier when surgery is done all at once, he said.

""So if you transplanted one limb, and then three months or a year later, the other one, you'd have to go through that again. The idea is to get that all over with one donor.""

But there's also another reason.

""Having one hand when you have none is a huge benefit,"" McCabe said.

""But if you're going to have that type of surgery, and it seems logical to transplant both hands, part of the sense of wholeness is restored. It seems to be very important for patients.""

There are risks associated with the surgery, including infections and the possibility of blood loss. But McCabe said the benefits outweigh the risks, and limb transplants have low rejection rates.

After the surgery, transplant patients face a long recovery, he added.

""If you transplant the limb near the elbow, it will take a few months for the muscles to start to work again, and maybe up to a year or more for the nerves to get down to the fingers to have some feeling,"" McCabe said. ""So, I think we would say, you can't judge whether it's really helped or not for at least a couple years.""

Thompson said unlike most organ transplants, a hand transplant is visible.

""It's physically there. So getting over the mental challenge is going to be the hardest one, because you know they belonged to someone else at one point and now they're on your body,"" Thompson said.

""You have to look at it as a gift ... (the donor) family has decided to give you this gift. And it's a gift I'm not going to waste.""

Both said they had chosen to publicize the infections on their own, with one deciding to close for cleaning too, without being asked by authorities to do either thing.

“Although we have not been contacted by Quebec Public Health,” wrote management of La Voûte bar in Old Montreal on Friday, “it is our civic responsibility to inform you.”

They’re right, say public health authorities: bars are not required to warn clients in these cases, or to close.

“A bar does not have to close if there has been a [person who tested positive] that frequented it during his or her infectious period,” said Marie-Claude Lacasse, a spokeswoman for Quebec’s health department.

This, however, is because health authorities are supposed to already be on top of the situation through contact tracing, and their system doesn’t rely on establishments reporting this kind of concern.

Instead, it starts with individual people’s positive test results and works backwards, including checking if they’ve been at a bar or restaurant.

“These are assessments that are made by the public health [regional authorities], depending on the situation,” wrote Lacasse.

For example, in the case of a bar, was the infected person an employee or a client? How long did they spend in the bar, and were people complying at the time with other health measures?

“In the same vein, a public place or a workplace is not necessarily closed if a positive case has been present,” she said. It depends on a variety of factors.

It’s not that being forthcoming is to be discouraged, others said.

“It would be weird for us to say no, right,” if a bar owner wanted to take that initiative, said Jean Nicolas Aubé, a spokesperson for Montreal’s public health department.

However, he thinks people should know that contact tracers get to work quickly on every single positive test result, contacting the person involved.

“It generally is within the day. It’s very fast,” said Aubé.

Montreal’s public health department doesn’t comment on specific contact tracing cases, including the two bar-associated ones this week, he said.

An infectious diseases specialist agreed that it can’t hurt to give people more warning,

“As a physician I would say that is an admirable effort,” said Dr. Matthew Oughton of McGill, speaking of bar owners’ COVID-19 transparency.

However, he’d want to make sure they “can do it in a way that, as much as possible, protects the right to privacy of people's medical information,” he said.

Oughton also said people shouldn’t panic at the idea that they won’t always hear about cases they crossed paths with. The risk should still be fairly low, and it’s important to remember that prior to this kind of announcement, “what [public health] did behind the scenes is invisible.”

Closing and doing a deep clean makes a lot of sense for a business owner for other reasons, however, said Oughton.

“From a practical perspective, if I were a customer and I found out there were cases at a bar and the bar knew and didn't say anything… I don't think that would be a very smart public relations route,” he said.

There’s one last thing to keep in mind about human nature—a reason not to announce every single positive case, he said.

“Would I recommend that every single business declare every time they have an employee or customer who's positive?” he asked.

“My concerns there are... you hear an alert the first time, it catches your attention. You hear an alert the hundredth time, it loses its impact.”",[]

In a case study, published last week in The BMJ, the doctors profiled the case of a 57-year-old Japanese man who worked in customer service at a restaurant.

He first went to doctors in April, where he tested positive for influenza A, but as his condition failed to improve in the days that followed, he went to hospital where he eventually tested positive for COVID-19 as well.

The patient’s fever lasted four days while in hospital, while his difficulty breathing and low oxygen count in his blood began to improve after a week. The man remained in the hospital for four weeks, but was eventually discharged.

The doctors note that this case should be an indication to other health-care professionals to check for COVID-19 among patients with other respiratory infections.

“During the epidemic, the possibility of COVID-19 should be considered regardless of positive findings for other pathogens,” the doctors wrote in the case study.

Patients infected with other respiratory viruses along with COVID-19 are not unheard of, though it’s unclear how often that occurs.

Studies from New York City and Northern California show 2.1 per cent and 20.7 per cent rates of respiratory infections and COVID-19, respectively. A third study from Wuhan, China shows 4.35 per cent of the COVID-19 patients examined had also been diagnosed with influenza.

In Texas, Eleana Topp was diagnosed with COVID-19 and the flu at the same time back in March.

Soon after her diagnosis, Topp was placed on a ventilator and her family watched as her condition worsened to the point of multiple organ failure.

“In my mind, I said ‘She’s not going to the die from this, she’s going to survive,’” Daniel Topp, Eleana's husband, told CNN. “There’s no doubt that she was.”

After seven weeks, she was able to get off a ventilator and continue rehabilitation. She was able to return to her home last week.

However, the doctors behind the BMJ report note that there is no indication whether someone who has contracted another virus is more or less likely to contract COVID-19.

“There was no significant difference in the rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with and without other pathogens, the report states. “The presence of a non-SARS-CoV-2 pathogen may not provide reassurance that a patient does not also have SARS-CoV-2.”",[]

“That revelation raises need for the police to take a look at it,” Conservative MP and ethics critic Michael Barrett said during a press conference on Friday.

The Conservatives are suggesting there could be criminal implications, but they aren’t sure and want police to investigate. The party has published an “open letter” to RCMP Commissioner Brenda Lucki asking the national police force to determine whether the matter runs afoul of the Criminal Code section on government fraud.

“On the question of if it is criminal, that's for the RCMP to decide,” said Barrett, who authored the letter.

“Federal government proactive disclosures show that the Canada Student Service Grant is not the beginning of WE Charity’s dealings with the federal government. Government records confirm that, since 2017, WE Charity has received seven grants or contributions totalling about $5.2 million, plus another five contracts,” writes Barrett.

“I encourage the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to investigate the possibility of criminal offences arising from these disturbing facts. You and the very able members of the national police force possess the necessary skills, expertise and tools to get to the bottom of this,” he writes.

Bloc Quebecois Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet has called on the prime minister to ""step aside"" until the completion of the ethics commissioner investigation that is already underway, though the Conservatives are stopping short of demanding the same.

Barrett said he wants to wait and see whether a criminal investigation is launched.

“We're not looking to bring down the government on this issue. We're looking to get the truth,” he said.

The Conservatives are calling for all documents related to the contract to be made public, and already MPs have taken steps to dig into the issue using the parliamentary tools available to them, launching two separate studies into the sole-sourced contract with the intent, in part, of calling cabinet ministers to testify.

In an interview on CTV News Channel, Conservative MP and leadership candidate Erin O’Toole said he agrees with his caucus colleagues that “an examination by law enforcement is warranted.”

Fellow leadership hopeful Peter MacKay sent an email to supporters saying he was “deeply troubled” by the story and said Trudeau’s conduct is “part of a pattern as a serial ethical offender,” and potentially “far more” than an ethics breach. He said he supports the police looking into the matter.

“Justin Trudeau has yet to display any sense of contrition, guilt or humility in the face of all of the morally questionable and outright offensive actions he has committed throughout his adult and political life. The list is long, and it's growing,” he said.

WE CHARITY PAID PM'S FAMILY

On Friday, CTV News confirmed that WE Charity paid Trudeau’s mother Margaret Trudeau’s expenses to send her to Kenya in July 2019 to appear at the opening of “WE College.” The costs associated with the trip are estimated at $10,000. Former prime minister Kim Campbell was also in attendance.

On Thursday, WE Charity revealed that Trudeau's mother, Margaret Trudeau, spoke at approximately 28 events and was paid $250,000 in speaking honorariums between 2016 and 2020. The prime minister’s brother, Alexandre Trudeau, spoke at eight events from 2017 to 2018 and was paid a total of approximately $32,000.

More than $60,000 of that money, which WE Charity said is usually administered by corporate sponsors, was paid directly to Margaret Trudeau by the charity as the result of what WE Charity referred to as an ""error"" in billing and payment that was discovered through an “internal review.”

In addition to this, Trudeau's wife, Sophie Gregoire Trudeau — who is an ambassador with the organization and hosts a mental health podcast under its name — received a ""one-time speaking honorarium"" of $1,400 for participating in a youth event in 2012, before Trudeau became leader of the Liberal Party.

The organization said all her other time spent participating in WE events and hosting a podcast series for the charity was ""donated.""

WE Charity said neither they nor ME to WE Social Enterprise have ever paid Justin Trudeau — who has spoken at a number of WE events — for any speeches or other matters.

In an emailed statement sent Thursday, Chantal Gagnon, a spokesperson for the Prime Minister's Office, said Trudeau's relatives ""engage with a variety of organizations and support many personal causes on their own accord.""

Facing questions about what he knew as a member at the cabinet table, Industry Minister Navdeep Bains restated the government position that the advice to go ahead with WE Charities came from the public service.

“Clearly we are going in a different direction right now, but make no mistake, our government and our prime minister are absolutely committed to supporting students,” Bains said.

ETHICS PROBE UNDERWAY

Prior to the family payments being confirmed, Trudeau had already become the subject of an ethics investigation over the matter. The ethics commissioner is investigating a potential conflict of interest over his government's now-cancelled decision to have WE Charity manage a $900-million federal program to set up placements and administer grants to students and new graduates for their volunteer work this summer.

""The Canada Student Service Grant program is about giving young people opportunities to contribute to their communities, not about benefits to anyone else,"" said the PMO in Thursday’s statement.

With the program halted, thousands of students are now in limbo without summer jobs and, for now, no chance for volunteer grants to help cover costs like fall tuition.

The grant to post-secondary students and recent graduates would provide one-time payments of up to $5,000 for volunteering in pandemic-related programs, depending on the number of hours worked. For every 100 hours spent, a student will receive $1,000.

While the charity backed out of the management of the program following days of controversy, Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion said, when confirming the probe, that the Conservatives’ request for an investigation ""satisfies the requirements"" laid out in the Conflict of Interest Act.

The Conservatives have alleged that Trudeau violated a provision in the Act that ""prohibits public office holders from making any decision or participating in the making of a decision that furthers their private interests or improperly furthers the private interests of another person.""

Opposition parties have said that Trudeau had a duty to recuse himself from any discussion or decision relating to the WE Charity, given the prime minister's close ties to the organization and his wife’s involvement, and that Trudeau violated the Act when he announced that WE Charity would administer the Canada Student Service Grant.

Trudeau confirmed on Wednesday that he did not recuse himself from the cabinet discussion on outsourcing the large government program. Asked why, Trudeau said he has “long worked on youth issues” before getting into politics.

He has previously said that the public service told his government that the WE Charity organization was the only group capable of administering the student program.

'A PATTERN OF BEHAVIOUR'

In a statement NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said Friday that the hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments to the trio of Trudeau’s family members is “more than disturbing,” and illustrates a “pattern of behaviour.”

Singh pointed to the fact that this is now the third ethics investigation Trudeau has been subjected to since he became prime minister, with the two previous times resulting in findings that Trudeau had breached federal ethics law.

In December 2017 then-commissioner Mary Dawson found Trudeau broke the federal ethics act when he vacationed at the Aga Khan’s private island over the 2016 Christmas holidays with friends and family. And then in August 2019, Trudeau was found to have broken the federal Conflict of Interest Act in relation to the SNC-Lavalin scandal, by seeking to influence former justice minister and attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould in ""many ways.""

In that report, Dion concluded after months of reviewing ""troubling"" evidence and relevant legal and constitutional principles, that Trudeau contravened section nine of the Act, which states that public office holders are prohibited from using their position to seek to influence a decision that furthers the interest of a private third party.

“The PM, his office and cabinet need to co-operate fully with the ethics commissioner and must waive cabinet confidentiality so the commissioner can truly get to the bottom of this,” Singh said.

“Canadians deserve to know the truth and need to know this won't happen again.""

In an interview on CTV News Channel, Liberal MP Nate Erskine-Smith said that while the contract was eyebrow-raising, he doesn’t think that Trudeau should step aside while the investigation is underway.

“The government rightly listened and walked the program back, now I think the question is squarely focused on this conflict question and that's for the ethics commissioner to pursue… I will follow it closely,” he said.

Now, the NDP are calling for an ethics investigation.

In a statement to CTV News, Morneau’s office said that there is “absolutely no link” between his daughters’ involvements with the charity and “any work that WE does with the Government of Canada.”

The statement confirmed what website Canadaland first reported: that the finance minister’s daughter Clare has spoken at WE events, and his daughter Grace is currently employed by WE Charity.

“Clare has spoken at WE events, as well as many other public events, in the context of the release of her book on young refugee girls. She has never been compensated for that work,” said Maeva Proteau, press secretary for Morneau.

As well, Morneau’s daughter Grace is a “contractual employee of WE in an administrative role in the travel department,” a job she has had since 2019 following her internship, according to Morneau’s office.

“She got this position on her own merits. There is absolutely no link between her employment and any work that WE does with the Government of Canada,” Proteau said.

Proteau confirmed that Morneau did not recuse himself from the discussions about the decision to offload the program meant to administer grants to students and new graduates for their volunteer work this summer.

NDP WANT INVESTIGATION

In light of Morneau’s statement, the New Democrats are calling for Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion to investigate Morneau. In a letter to the commissioner obtained by CTV News, NDP MP and ethics critic Charlie Angus says he thinks the finance minister’s decision to not recuse himself from conversations about outsourcing the program to We Charity merits more scrutiny.

“The Act has clear stipulations that prevent public office holders from making or participating in a decision related to the exercise of an official power, duty or function if the public office holder knows or reasonably should know that, in the making of the decision, he or she would be in a conflict of interest,” writes Angus.

“It would seem apparent that Minister Morneau would recognize that the fact that his family member was an employee of this organization necessitated him to recuse himself regarding this extraordinary decision to outsource nearly billion-dollar commitment of public funds in a single source contract,” Angus writes.

With the program halted, thousands of students are now in limbo without summer jobs and, for now, no chance for volunteer grants to help cover costs like fall tuition. The grant to post-secondary students and recent graduates was set to provide payments that amount to less than minimum wage for volunteering in pandemic-related programs, depending on the number of hours worked. For every 100 hours spent, a student would receive $1,000.

“The recommendation to have WE administer the program came from the public service,” Morneau’s office said.

APPEARED 'TOO CLOSE': LIBERAL MP

With Dion already looking into Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s ties to WE Charity and his decision to not recuse himself from the contract discussions, the Conservatives are now calling for an RCMP probe, and for a full accounting of what all cabinet ministers knew about the extent of the Trudeau family’s connections to the charities. Trudeau’s wife, mother and brother were paid a range of amounts to speak at WE events over the years.

In an interview on CTV News Channel, Liberal MP Nate Erskine-Smith said that while he can’t speak for the state of mind either Trudeau or Morneau were in, he was “skeptical” about how the project was announced.

“I was glad to see the government reverse course in response to feedback… The prime minister and the finance minister appeared to me to be too close to this as far as decision-making goes, but ultimately this is in the hands of the ethics commissioner,” he said.",[]

Current leader Andrew Scheer is in his final weeks in the job.

Party members are now voting for his replacement with the winner to be announced in late August.

Meanwhile, the issue is not going away.

The ethics commissioner has been called in to see if Trudeau broke conflict-of-interest law in awarding a multimillion-dollar contract to the WE organization, given Trudeau's long-standing family ties to the organization.

The commissioner is also being asked to probe Finance Minister Bill Morneau's ties as well -- one of the minister's daughters works for the organization.

The Liberals, and WE, have said there is no direct link between the awarding of the contract to run the $900 million Canada Student Services Grant program and the organization's connections to the Trudeaus.

The Conservatives also say that revelations Trudeau family members have been paid by WE for speaking engagements in the past elevates the seriousness of the matter. The party says the police should investigate for possible fraud.

Trudeau himself was never paid.

Both ethics and criminal investigations take time.

The investigation by the ethics commissioner into the SNC-Lavalin affair was requested in February 2019 and completed in August of that year.

The Senate expenses scandal first broke in 2012 and it took two years for criminal charges related to fraud to surface in that case. Former Conservative senator Mike Duffy was acquitted on all of them in April 2016.

So, given that the Opposition Conservatives will have a new boss while the WE story likely continues to percolate, how will Scheer's replacement seek to proceed?

The Canadian Press asked all four leadership candidates how they would deal with the scandal.

Leslyn Lewis:

The Toronto lawyer said the ethics commissioner has proven himself capable in the past of getting to the bottom of Trudeau's scandals and she trusts him to do that job here as well.

""The problem is that every time the ethics commissioner proves Trudeau has broken the rules, he just shrugs and moves on,"" Lewis said in a statement.

""The only way to hold Justin Trudeau accountable is for voters to vote him out. I look forward to leading the charge and replacing him with an honest and ethical government.""

Lewis does not have a seat in the House of Commons. If she wins, she would have to appoint someone to be the parliamentary leader until she could get elected.

Peter MacKay:

MacKay's wife, Nazanin Afshin Jam, a human rights activist, has spoken at WE events. His campaign says she has never taken money from the organization.

In an interview, MacKay said the WE controversy raises questions about the need to broaden and strengthen the power of the ethics commissioner, so if there's a finding a politician broke conflict of interest law, they could actually be penalized.

He also suggested that a stronger ethics screen might be required for whomever is prime minister to ensure there can be no blurring of lines between a prime minister's private life and public role.

In the meantime, MacKay, a former justice minister, said he thinks a criminal investigation into the WE contract could be warranted under Section 122 of the Criminal Code, which is breach of trust involving government officials.

The purpose of the section is to ensure government officials do not abuse their authority or their office, MacKay said.

By being in the cabinet room when the decision was made, knowing their family connection to WE, is a very serious thing, MacKay said.

""It's essential we keep confidence in public office holders,"" MacKay said. ""This undermines that.""

While it is the kind of issue that could result in a motion of non-confidence in the Liberal government, it's not that simple, MacKay said.

""We can't lose sight of the bigger picture here which is the economic and health crisis that still rages on as a result of COVID-19,"" he said.

""This is going to undermine severely the prime minister's legitimacy and ability to govern throughout this period.""

MacKay also does not have a seat in the House of Commons. What levers of parliamentary power he might want pulled would have to be done by someone else.

Erin O'Toole:

O'Toole has suggested the scandal brings with it the threat of a fall election.

When his campaign was asked whether he would seek to topple the government over it, a spokesperson did not directly answer the question, repeating only that they think the chances of a fall election are higher.

O'Toole supports his party's call for a criminal investigation. In an email, campaign spokesperson Melanie Paradis said that given O'Toole already has a seat in the House of Commons, he would be ready take on Trudeau on this issue from ""day one.""

""As leader, Erin will stand up for Canadians and get to the bottom of this corruption,"" she said. His campaign did not say how he would do that.

O'Toole's children have also attended WE events and he has spoken at one in his riding. His campaign said his family has never financially benefited from WE.

Derek Sloan:

Sloan is also a sitting MP. His campaign did not return two requests for comment on what he would do to address the issue.

""This very close passage by the sun is cooking the comet's outermost layers, causing gas and dust to erupt off the icy surface and creating a large tail of debris. And yet the comet has managed to survive this intense roasting,"" reads another article about the comet on NASA’s website.

Erin Levy was supposed to be on summer vacation in Alberta, but the COVID-19 pandemic forced her to stay in Nova Scotia, where she decided to enjoy a staycation.

Levy went camping at Five Islands Provincial Park and planned a trip to the Joggins Fossil Cliffs on July 3.

The UNESCO World Heritage Site had just reopened on July 1.

“We hadn’t explored that area of the province before, so we went over there and wanted to do a day trip,” says Levy, who lives in Bedford, N.S.

After touring the Joggins Fossil Centre, Levy went for a walk near the beach.

“Up a little ways up to the right were the cliffs, so I got up next to the cliffs thinking maybe there’s cooler things there, and this was honestly just lying in the sand,” says Levy of her find. “So I pulled it out a little bit and saw the two sets of tracks and thought it was really neat.”

Levy soon discovered that “neat” was an understatement for her discovery, which turned out to be a 310-million-year-old fossil.

It dates back to a snapshot in time when Joggins was part of Pangaea, 100 million years before dinosaurs roamed the earth.

“These are fossilized footprints of two different animals,” explains Melissa Grey, curator at the Joggins Fossil Centre.

“One’s an amphibian creature and one’s a millipede, so two very different animals, which is really unusual and, not only that, they are both really beautifully preserved.”

“They were very excited about it,” says Levy. “They identified the tracks in a heartbeat and said it was interesting because the tracks were much smaller than what they were used to seeing for that kind of creature.”

Stunning find by a visitor to @JogginsFossils last week! Two sets of trackways - can you see both of them? One (one right) is from a large millipede and the other (left) is from an amphibian. This will be going into our Collection for future study! pic.twitter.com/NWXEWMjtxD — Dr. Melissa Grey (@CuratorGrey) July 6, 2020

The fossil has captured the attention of experts across the province. It will be researched and may go on display at the Joggins Fossil Centre, but Levy will always be part of its history.

“Erin the fossil finder will go down as the collector, so her name will forever be associated with that find,” says Grey.

Both Levy and Grey say they hope the discovery will encourage more people to explore Joggins and other historic sites in Nova Scotia.

“You do not have to be an expert or a trained paleontologist to find fossils at Joggins,” says Grey. “There’s so many. You actually can’t help but step on them.”

“This was amazing,” says Levy. “We have a ton of history that’s a bit unexplored, so I’m hoping it will just bring more people here to spend a bit more time in Nova Scotia and realize what we have to offer.”",[]
21,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/un-forecasts-even-warmer-temperatures-over-next-5-years-1.5017021,UN forecasts even warmer temperatures over next 5 years,['Robin Millard'],2020-07-09 07:53:00-04:00,"GENEVA, SWITZERLAND -- The annual mean global temperature is likely to be at least one degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels in each of the next five years, the World Meteorological Organization said Thursday.

The WMO said there was a 20 per cent chance that it will exceed 1.5 C above 1850 to 1900 average levels in at least one year, according to its annual climate predictions for the coming five years.

The last five-year period has been the warmest five years on record, said the Geneva-based United Nations agency, which counts 193 member states.

Temperatures over the next five years, 2020 to 2024, are very likely to be within the range of 0.91 C to 1.59 C above pre-industrial levels.

Almost all regions, except parts of the southern oceans, are likely to be warmer than the recent past, which is defined as 1981 to 2010.

""This study shows -- with a high level of scientific skill -- the enormous challenge ahead in meeting the Paris Agreement on Climate Change target of keeping a global temperature rise this century well below 2 C above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 C,"" said WMO secretary-general Petteri Taalas.

The 2015 Paris accord seeks to limit global temperature rises through sweeping cuts in greenhouse gas emissions.

WETTER SAHEL

The WMO forecasts do not take into account changes in greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions due to the shutdown of economic and industrial activity triggered by the coronavirus crisis.

""Due to the very long lifetime of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the impact of the drop in emissions this year is not expected to lead to a reduction of CO2 atmospheric concentrations which are driving global temperature increases,"" Taalas said.

The planet's average temperature is already more than 1.0 C warmer than the pre-industrial period, the WMO said.

Looking at the five-year period 2020 to 2024, the organisation said there was a 70 per cent chance that at least one month would be 1.5 C warmer than pre-industrial levels.

However, there is only a three per cent chance that the entire period would be 1.5 C warmer than that baseline level.

The northern North Atlantic region could have stronger westerly winds, leading to more storms in western Europe over the next five years.

High latitude regions and the Sahel are likely to be wetter than the recent past, the organisation predicted.

The WMO also said that in 2020 alone, many parts of South America, southern Africa and Australia are likely to be drier than the recent past.

Meanwhile, the Arctic is likely to have warmed by more than twice as much as the global mean.

It said the smallest temperature change was expected in the tropics and in the mid-latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere.",[]
22,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/canadian-economy-adds-953-000-jobs-in-june-unemployment-rate-falls-1.5018613,"Canadian economy adds 953,000 jobs in June, unemployment rate falls",['Jordan Press'],2020-07-10 04:19:00-04:00,"OTTAWA -- Nearly one million more Canadians had jobs in June, Statistics Canada says, as businesses forced to close by the pandemic began to reopen and the country continued to recoup steep losses over March and April.

Statistics Canada's labour force survey released Friday showed 953,000 jobs were added last month, including 488,000 full-time and 465,000 part-time positions. The unemployment rate fell to 12.3 per cent after hitting a record-high of 13.7 per cent in May.

As in May, even though more people found jobs, more people also looked for work as the labour force grew by about 786,000 after a gain of 491,000 in May, bringing it to within 443,000 of its pre-pandemic level.

Statistics Canada said the unemployment rate would have been 16.3 per cent had it included in unemployment counts those who wanted to work, but did not look for a job.

Job gains were made in every province, including by 378,000 in Ontario, marking the first increase since the COVID-19 shutdown, Statistics Canada said. It didn't include any gains in Toronto as restrictions in that city loosened after the survey week.

Despite the good news, economist Jim Stanford said there remains a historic crisis in the job market with high unemployment and hundreds of thousands who have left the labour force altogether.

Also, gains nationally were not shared equally among groups, with women, youth and low-wage workers still slower to rebound, which Stanford said could be problematic if those jobs don't ever come back.

""I worry about a coming second round of layoffs motivated not by health restrictions, but by companies deciding their businesses are going to be permanently smaller. So that would be qualitatively different and in a way worse,"" said Stanford, director of the Centre for Future Work in Vancouver.

""We aren't remotely out of the woods yet, but this was a really encouraging step forward.""

Some three million jobs were lost over March and April due to the pandemic, and 2.5 million more had their hours and earnings slashed. By last month, some 3.1 million were affected by the pandemic, including 1.4 million who weren't at work due to COVID-19.

Brendon Bernard, an economist at Indeed Canada, said recapturing jobs at the same pace in the coming months will be tougher.

""A lot of areas of the economy still aren't running at full capacity,"" Bernard said. ""So while doors may be open and customers might be coming in, business hasn't come back to normal.""

Despite the overall improvement, the oil and gas industry continues to struggle.

The PetroLMI Division of Energy Safety Canada says direct oil and gas employment fell by more than 6,700 positions in June compared with May, with about 70 per cent of the net job losses in Alberta.

Compared with a year earlier, employment in the oil and employment sector was down 17 per cent.

The overall job losses were unprecedented in speed and depth compared with previous recessions, Statistics Canada said, and the rebound to date sharper than previous downturns.

Ottawa's response has been equally unprecedented: a deficit of at least $343.2 billion this fiscal year as the Trudeau Liberals dole out some $230 billion in emergency aid.

In June, 28.3 per cent of Canadians aged 15 to 69 reported receiving some form of federal aid since mid-March, Statistics Canada said. Meanwhile, the proportion of households reporting difficulty paying the bills dropped to 20.1 per cent in June from 22.5 per cent in May.

""Without the federal government being there to support Canadian workers, Canadian businesses and the Canadian provinces and territories, we would be in a bigger mess in this country right now,"" Hassan Yussuff, president of the Canadian Labour Congress said in an interview this week.

The Bank of Canada and federal government believe the worst of the economic pain from the pandemic is behind the country, but Canada will face high unemployment and low growth until 2021.

In a statement, federal Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough touted the overall jobs numbers as a sign the government's plan was working, before adding many Canadians still ""face real challenges during this time.""

She and other ministers are now reshaping programs so fewer workers stay on the $80-billion emergency benefit, and more get tied to jobs through the $82-billion wage subsidy program.

""We understand the need for those emergency programs. We also understand as we reopen and recover, we have to move away from emergency programs and into stimulus and recovery,"" said Leah Nord, senior director of workforce strategies for the Canadian Chamber of Commerce.

She said there are other issues to resolve around health and safety in the workplace, transit, and child care to help more Canadians get back to work.

In provinces where daycares reopened for children five and under, employment levels returned to pre-pandemic levels for fathers in June, but not for mothers. Similarly, mothers with children under 18 were more likely than fathers to work less than half their usual hours in June, Statistics Canada said.

Job gains have come at a faster clip for men. Their unemployment rate hit 12.1 per cent in June compared to 12.7 per cent for women. And the underutilization rate -- which counts those who are unemployed, those who want a job but didn't look for one, and those working less than half their usual hours -- was 28.3 for women and 25.5 per cent for men.

Economist Armine Yalnizyan said the numbers underscore the need to provide child care as well as options for schooling in the fall so mothers can work.

The alternative, she said, could pull back any economic gains.

""It means that even if there are jobs, some women won't be able to take them because there's no way they can leave their kids,"" said Yalnizyan, a fellow on the future of workers at the Atkinson Foundation.

""So we are looking at the potential for an economic depression instead of talking about paces of recovery and pivoting to building to better.""

Ltd. made their decision to end “pandemic pay” independently of each other, even as the decision was based in part on being aware of what some of their competitors were planning, the chief executives for the companies told the members of Parliament on Friday.

Executives for Canada’s three main grocery chains defended their decision to halt their temporary $2-an-hour wage increase last month, telling a House of Commons committee that there was no “collusion” and that the decision was based on employee workload, the economy re-opening, other retailers opening again, a return to more “normal” business conditions, and lower business volumes.

Lawmakers grilled the executives, questioning the “courtesy” calls and emails that were made and sent between them. This included an email Loblaw president Sarah Davis sent on June 11 to Metro, Empire, and others including Walmart, letting them know the company was planning to end its temporary pay hikes two days later. Metro decided to end theirs on the same day.

Davis had sent a similar email earlier when Loblaw, which owns No Frills, T&T and Valu-Mart as well, decided to initiate a wage increase for its workers.

Eric LaFleche, chief executive at Metro, which operates 950 food stores including Food Basic and Super C, said he did not send emails to any colleagues or competitors regarding the decision to end the temporary wage hike, but he had previously spoken to Davis and Empire CEO Michael Medline on the phone, in compliance with the Competition Act, to ask about their intentions with respect to the temporary bonuses. Both said at the time they were undecided. Medline added that a lawyer was present during his call with LaFleche and that he had declined to discuss the issue further.

“I don’t accept your premise that this was co-ordination, collusion or anything untowards. Everything was above board, within legal boundaries, I can say that wholeheartedly. I have no issue with what we did and what information we got and how we got it,” said LaFleche, who said the calls were to help inform his decisions for the company and its employees, and not any kind of tacit agreement on staff pay.

“We make our own decision based on the information we have, and the more information we have, the more clarity in our decision. When we made our decision, it was our own.”

LaFleche’s comments echoed Medline’s, who said in his opening statement to the committee that he wanted to be “absolutely clear” they did not co-ordinate their decisions. Medline told committee members that the company’s decision to stop the pay premium came before he received Davis’s email, though he did hear Loblaw was considering it. Empire operates Sobeys and Safeway among other banners.

The executives told lawmakers that they also consulted with corporate counsel to ensure that no laws were being violated.

In a series of tense exchanges during the two-hour session, committee members questioned the executives’ decision to halt the pay premium, particularly as dozens of retail and warehouse workers continued to be sick with COVID-19, and a new report that another two grocery store workers tested positive in southern Ontario.

Earlier this week, union leaders representing thousands of grocery employees, told the same committee that the pandemic was not over, and therefore the temporary premiums should also continue.

During questioning, Medline indicated that going forward, if a region were to go into lockdown again, they would offer “hero pay” again, and that he would look into retroactive compensation as well.

In Friday’s meeting, executives -- criticized for their own salary compensations and dividend payouts to shareholders -- said decisions like the installation of plexi-glass barriers in stores were made without consideration to costs and that tens of millions of dollars had been invested to ensure the safety of their store workers during the pandemic.",[]

If there is a word to describe how I feel about the pandemic it is ""sad."" I feel so sad for people who have lost their lives to this horrible disease, people who lost their job, small business owners who have had to close up shop, for those who have had their life savings evaporate and -- when it comes down to it -- anyone who has been impacted in any way.

When the fiscal update highlighted our deficit would run north of $343 billion I didn't panic. I know for now as a country we can afford it. This low interest rate environment helps, the Bank of Canada buying up bonds to provide liquidity helps and Canada continues to fare better than other countries around the globe.

My focus is always on the average Canadian trying to make ends meet and especially those who may have been struggling before the pandemic struck.

Canadians can't take on more debt. They are tapped out. The government can and did and as the PM said, ""we took on debt so Canadians didn't have to"". In my opinion that was a good thing to do. We don't have a playbook when it comes to shutting down the whole economy. In past recessions the money may have stopped but the people didn't.

The challenge is, we aren't through the pandemic and I fear more jobs losses are on the horizon. From a financial perspective, what I worry about most are jobs. As the CERB comes into question come the fall, families will be faced with harsh reality their lives have changed and like any challenging period of time some will be impacted more than others. Some companies will make it and some won't. Some families will rally and others won't.

However, the June jobs report showed a hint of encouragement with almost 1 million jobs created leading me to maybe just maybe believe we could see the ""V"" shaped economy that so many are hoping for. And while the job number surprised to the upside after 3 million jobs were lost in March and April it is still a little too soon to declare a roaring victory. There are 1 3/4 million people still unemployed. Yet, other signs of improvement point to recovery. Areas such as the real estate market in terms of sales and housing starts while vehicle sales exploded higher as well.

The analogy I will use: The patient who has a heart attack, or in this the case the economy that stopped in a heartbeat, is starting to shows signs of stabilizing. But that isn't enough. Like the patient, the economy needs a long-term recovery plan to ensure good health is sustainable.

I'm looking for long-term growth plans to get people back working. Some of the jobs losses will never come back. In my perfect world we would see money going toward new initiatives with new jobs created, supported with training, so families and business can begin to plan again.

In the meantime, I tend to confront the brutal facts while remaining cautiously optimistic we will get through this.

It was the Mercedes driver's record-extending 89th career pole and particularly impressive as he first beat Red Bull driver Max Verstappen's mark and then his own leading mark on his final lap.

""That was awesome,"" Hamilton said after placing 1.216 seconds ahead of Verstappen and 1.398 clear of McLaren driver Carlos Sainz Jr.

""I definitely had my heart in my mouth, but I was able to improve,"" Hamilton said. ""Honestly it was a fantastic lap, that lap was as close to perfect as I could get it in those conditions.""

Verstappen swerved a little on his final lap.

""It could have been better but I don't think it was enough to beat Lewis,"" the Dutch driver said. ""You can't see a thing, it is hard to see the braking zones but that is the same for everyone.""

It was the best career result in qualifying for Sainz -- underlining how McLaren is improving after Lando Norris finished last weekend's race in third place.

""It feels amazing, especially that qualifying was one of the toughest I have done. There was so much aquaplaning it was crazy,"" the Spanish driver said. ""We're completely blind in the car, we don't see what's at the front, what's at the back.""

Hamilton's Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas could only qualify in fourth place after taking pole position and winning last Sunday's Austrian GP.

It was another dismal day for Ferrari, with Sebastian Vettel 10th and Charles Leclerc 11th.

""The main problem was we were just not quick enough,"" Leclerc said. ""We're just too slow.""

Driving rain washed out the third and final practice session at midday and threatened qualifying altogether. But the cars managed to finally get out onto the Red Bull Ring at around 3:45 p.m. local time (1345 GMT) even though rain was still lashing down.

In the event of a complete washout, qualifying would have been moved to Sunday morning.

With drivers told the rain would soon get heavier, they were advised to post a solid time quickly in order to get into the second part of qualifying.

Verstappen said ""I can't see a thing"" and Romain Grosjean slid off track into gravel.

Some unexpected names popped up at the top of the leaderboard, before order was restored as Hamilton, Bottas and Verstappen swapped leading times.

""Leave me to it,"" Hamilton said over radio, trying to keep his concentration with water spraying everywhere in front and around him.

With two minutes left in Q1, Italian driver Antonio Giovinazzi lost control of his Alfa Romeo and it swerved sideways and then backward into a crash barrier. His car had to be lifted off the track.

The rain fell so heavily throughout the morning that firefighters had to remove excess water from the roof of one empty hospitality building. The race is being held without fans because of the coronavirus pandemic.

The race is changing names from last week but is still being held at the same track in Spielberg, which is surrounded by the Styrian mountains.",[]

In screenshots from a now deleted post, the driver made the unfounded claim that the coronavirus is “not dangerous to those with good immune systems” and that people don’t need a vaccine “that will make us even more sick.” He says he came to these conclusions after doing some ""research.""

“Today, I no longer disinfect my bus because it is a false pandemic in order to better control people,” he wrote.

There is no evidence to support the driver's claim that the COVID-19 pandemic is ""false."" More than 12 million people around the world have become infected with the novel coronavirus; some 548,000 have died.

The Societe de transport de Montreal (STM) said in an email to CTV News that all buses are cleaned daily by maintenance teams, but “of course, we also ask our employees to follow public health and hygiene guidelines.”

The STM took to Twitter to add that ""One bad apple doesn't spoil the bunch."" The agency says it employs 11,000 people, ""and the very vast majority of them are doing a tremendous job following strict measures and recommendations in place since the beginning of the pandemic, to protect clients, colleagues and themselves altogether.""

Though the STM wouldn’t reveal how it intends to move forward with this particular driver, it said “it is our best practice to meet with employees to remind them of the instructions in force.”

A photo posted to the driver’s Facebook page suggests he’s also against the wearing of masks – which is set to become mandatory on all public transit in Quebec as of July 13. When Premier Francois Legault made the announcement last week, he said it would be up to bus drivers to refuse entry to passengers who aren’t wearing masks. No other enforcement measures will be in place.

The driver admitted that at the beginning of the pandemic, he showed up to his shifts 30 minutes early to disinfect his bus.

“I made a barrier to stop passengers from speaking to me… and I washed my hands a minimum of 20 times per day,” his post said. ""But with time, I found that something was wrong.""",[]

""It was no disrespect to the list that was handed down to all the players,"" James said Saturday in a confernece call from Florida. ""I commend anyone that decides to put something on the back of their jersey. It's just something that didn't seriously resonate with my mission, with my goal.""

As part of the NBA's recognition of the nationwide invigoration of the social justice movement sparked by the death of George Floyd, NBA players are allowed to choose from a lengthy list of possible messages for their jerseys during the league's restart. James is among just a few who declined to choose one of the messages, he said.

""I would have loved to have a say-so on what would have went on the back of my jersey,"" James said. ""I had a couple of things in mind, but I wasn't part of that process, which is OK. ... Everything that I do has a purpose, has a meaning. I don't need to have something on the back of my jersey for people to understand my mission or know what I'm about and what I'm here to do.""

The 35-year-old superstar has a long history of social involvement and advocacy for progressive causes. James speaks frequently of what he feels is a responsibility to campaign for positive social change from his powerful position in sports and pop culture.

""This is the mission I've been on for a long time now,"" James said. ""It's great that a lot of people's ears are opening. A lot of people are understanding, a lot of people are recognizing. A lot of people still don't get it, and a lot of people are still afraid to talk about the racism that goes on in America, especially for our people. ... But we have some ears, and we will continue to push the envelope and let everyone know that we are human as well. We don't want to be just be used for our God-given abilities.""

JaVale McGee, the Lakers' veteran centre, said he will wear ""Respect Us"" on his jersey in Orlando.

""It's a blessing to have this platform,"" said McGee, whose asthma has him being particularly cautious during the pandemic. ""We have way more of a voice playing basketball ΓÇª Our fans are basketball fans over anything. This is the biggest platform we can speak about social injustices. That's the best time to talk about it.""

James also said he didn't consider not playing in the NBA's restart, believing the league can be a positive force through its visibility and competition. He expressed no concerns for his health inside the bubble.

""I believe the NBA and (Commissioner) Adam Silver, they took all precautionary measure to make sure that we as a league are as safe as we can be,"" James said. ""Obviously, in anything that you do, there can be things that can happen, so we will cross that line if it happens. But we're doing everything to make sure everyone stays safe during this pandemic. Adam Silver has given me no reason to not believe him since he took over. I have no concerns. I'm here 100% and in great health.""",[]

Given the gravity of the new coronavirus pandemic and the abrupt decision to place the NHL season on pause in March, it didn't take commissioner Gary Bettman and union chief Don Fehr long to realize they were going to have to work together if play was to resume any time soon.

Nearly four months to the day since the last puck dropped, the two sides put aside past differences to have a return-to-play plan in place, and the assurance of labour peace through September 2026 to go with it.

“When we got to March 12 and decided to take the pause, that began a period of perhaps unprecedented collaboration and problem solving,” Bettman said during a Zoom conference call with reporters Saturday, a day after the league and players ratified a 24-team expanded playoff, set to begin Aug. 1, and a four-year extension of the collective bargaining agreement.

“It was a recognition by both sides that we were being confronted with an incredibly difficult, a novel, unprecedented situation. I believed we would get to this point because it was the right thing to do for the game and for everybody involved in the game.”

Fehr, the NHL Players' Association executive director, not only agreed with Bettman, but went out of his way to credit the owners for the approach

“I was persuaded well before the end of March that not only was this different, but it was being approached in a fundamentally different way. I always thought we would find a way to reach an agreement,” Fehr said.

The bond established between the two was apparent during the 55-minute session, with Fehr agreeing with Bettman and then acknowledging how unusual that was by by saying: “I think that indicates something about the approach that was taken in these talks.”

Training camps are set to open Monday, which also represents the deadline for players to determine whether to opt out without penalty. If all goes as planned, teams will depart for their two respective hub cities, Toronto and Edmonton, Alberta, on July 26 to open a two-month playoff leading to the awarding of the Stanley Cup.

Many uncertainties remain, with Bettman and Fehr unable to provide definitive answers.

While acknowledging the likelihood of players testing positive for COVID-19, deputy commissioner Bill Daly was unable to say how many players would have to do so for the league to postpone or cancel the playoffs altogether.

Though conference playoffs and Stanley Cup Final are scheduled to be held in Edmonton, a person with direct knowledge of the plans told The Associated Press the site might change if the pandemic spikes in Alberta's capital. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because it is an alternate plan that's not been discussed publicly.

Bettman and Daly, who are based in New York, weren't even sure if or when they could cross the border to personally attend games because those entering Canada are required to self-isolate for a 14-day period.

The only certainty is the NHL became North America's latest professional sport to forge a path back to playing, but minus the public hiccups experienced by its counterparts.

Major League Baseball's season was nearly scuttled before the two sides agreed to a 60-game format. Less than three weeks before NFL training camps are set to open, the league is experiencing push-back from its players on whether to play preseason games next month. Major League Soccer has had two teams already withdrawing from competition because of the number of players testing positive for the coronavirus.

And not only is hockey on the verge of returning, the CBA extension assures 12 straight years of labour peace, the NHL's longest stretch since Bettman took over in 1993. During that time, play has been halted three times by lockouts, the last in 2012-13, when the season was shortened to 48 games.

“I think Don and I both recognize labour peace was something we couldn't even quantify how important it was,” Bettman said. “But we both knew that for the business of the game to come back strong, there was enough disruption going on in the world that we didn't have to add to it.”

Fehr said the months-long talks to reach a solution were a matter of perseverance.

“This is a very bad analogy, but you have to sort of navigate the kayak in a storm until the storm's over, and then make sure the kayak isn't full of holes so that you can go on and sail it in calmer seas,” Fehr said in a separate interview with The AP. “Or to put it another way there was never any pretense that this was business as usual.”

Owners benefit because they can generate much-needed revenue through sponsorships and advertising, even though games will be played in empty arenas.

Though players will likely lose a portion of their salaries for seasons to come to make up for 50-50 split of revenue, they benefit from a CBA that includes the possibility of returning to the Olympics, after the NHL opted out from the 2018 Winter Games in South Korea. The new labour agreement also addressed players' demands to gain a post-career subsidy for health care.

The Cliffs of Fundy in Nova Scotia and the Discovery Geopark in eastern Newfoundland were both designated UNESCO Global Geoparks Friday by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.

UNESCO says global geoparks are places that offer visitors a glimpse of exceptional geological heritage.

The Cliffs of Fundy Geopark stretches 125 kilometres, from Debert, N.S., to the Three Sisters cliffs past Eatonville, N.S. -- and out to Isle Haute in the Bay of Fundy.

""We have about 40 different geosites along that location. It's not a one-stop shop. You can spend many days visiting our different sites,"" manager Beth Peterkin said.

The site is well known for having the world's highest tides, Canada's oldest dinosaur fossils and stunning landscapes steeped in Mi'kmaq and Acadian legends.

""We are the site where the Pangaea continent split apart 200 million years ago. You can see where the rocks split apart. You can see the different types of rocks. You can see the cliffs, and the clam flats, and the shores,"" Peterkin said.

""At low tide you can walk out on the floor of the Bay of Fundy for a mile or more in many places, but watch the tide, because in six hours and 13 minutes it's going to be 50 feet higher up the shore,"" she said.

Peterkin and others have been working to get the UNESCO designation for the last five years.

Meanwhile staff at the Discovery Geopark, located on the upper half of Newfoundland's Bonavista Peninsula, have been working for the past 13 years to get their designation.

The park contains some of the earliest fossils of animal life, with rock dating back more than a half-billion years.

""You can see really unique geology that is of national and international significance,"" said John Norman, chairman of Discovery Geopark.

""There are some of the oldest complex life fossils on the planet,"" he said.

Many of the fossils are still in place in the rocks, while others have been removed for display in the provincial museum, The Rooms, in St. John's.

The Discovery Geopark now has 10 sites with interpretation, trails and other infrastructure.

""We have dozens of other sites within our geosites inventory that aren't yet showcased to the public,"" Norman said. ""Some of them will never be. Some of them are for research. Some of them are for academic only and others will be showcased to the public as more infrastructure is added.""

There are now 163 global geoparks in 44 countries, and Peterkin said being part of that group provides important exposure.

""People who travel to one geopark will soon learn about the next geopark. We'll be able to reach visitors that we were never able to reach on our own,"" she said.

Norman said the designation puts them on the world stage, especially in Asia and Europe where geoparks are popular.

Cliffs of Fundy and Discovery join three other UNESCO Global Geoparks in Canada: Stonehammer in New Brunswick, Perce in Quebec and Tumbler Ridge in British Columbia.

Some say aliens have,['Jen Rose Smith'],2020-07-09 08:57:00-04:00,"Erich von Däniken dried his sweaty palms with granite dust as he scaled the Great Pyramid of Giza, crawling block by block up the nearly 4,000-year-old monument.

It was 1954, when you could still climb the pyramids. Von Däniken, a 19-year-old with a Catholic education and a passion for flying saucers, was captivated. Fourteen years later, he published an influential book called ""Chariots of the Gods,"" arguing that extraterrestrials influenced ancient sites, the pyramids included.

The magnificent Giza Pyramids are among the world's most famous ancient places, part of a sprawling UNESCO World Heritage Site that brings travelers to Egypt from across the globe.

Visitors come to explore hidden burial chambers, go eye-to-eye with the mysterious Sphinx and take in the sheer scale of Egypt's grandest monuments.

Von Däniken proposed that aliens offered technological help in building them.

WHAT THE SCIENTISTS SAY ABOUT THESE FAMOUS PLACES

Mainstream archeologists disagree with Von Däniken, retorting that ancient Egyptians developed their remarkable building tradition with no help from extraterrestrials.

But while scientists are generally united in rejecting the aliens idea, sometimes known as ""ancient astronaut theory,"" Von Däniken's ideas have endured.

He went on to write 32 additional volumes, selling more than 63 million copies. Penguin Random House, his publisher, claims Von Däniken is ""arguably the most widely read and most-copied nonfiction author in the world.""

And the pyramids aren't the only UNESCO site swept up in his theories, or in those of people he's inspired.

Some speculate that the UNESCO site of Teotihuacan, where the Aztec kings once ruled near modern-day Mexico City, could have been a space port, pointing to mica and liquid mercury found among the ruins that they say are anachronistic.

For travellers, Teotihuacan is a glimpse into an ancient, mysterious empire. Researchers believe the city predates even the Aztecs, who were living there when Europeans first arrived in Mexico.

Archeologists, who have carried out painstaking excavations here for centuries, see it as the crowning achievement of a little-known -- but earthbound -- civilization.

Instead of peering up toward space, they dig into the ground. Archaeologists have spent years excavating a tunnel at Teotihuacan, which leads to chambers full of ritual offerings that some believe symbolize the underworld.

Nearly 3,000 miles away is another enigmatic UNESCO site that draws travellers, researchers and alien enthusiasts alike.

At the Nazca Lines geoglyphs in Peru, visitors take sightseeing flights to view earthen shapes that are too massive to appreciate from ground level. For decades, some have conjectured that the shapes are some sort of ancient airport.

Peruvian scientists agree that the Nazca Lines are mysterious, but believe they are linked instead to rituals and water.

In recent years, researchers have used satellite imagery to discover more than 140 additional geoglyphs, carefully poring over data to find patterns in the landscape.

""They were not drawn by aliens, that's for sure,"" expert Javier Puente told CNN.

TEACHING AN ALTERNATIVE TO ANCIENT ASTRONAUTS

Archeologist Sarah Parcak teaches a seminar on debunking archeological myths and hoaxes at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.

In the class, she pushes back on theories about ancient aliens like those proposed by Von Däniken. She sees it as important work.

""The belief that aliens built the pyramids, or in fact any ancient monument, is deeply racist,"" Parcak says. It's no coincidence that alien theories focus on places home to black, brown and Indigenous people, she notes.

Not only that, Parcak thinks that aliens are a distraction from the real wonders of archaeology. ""It's not a mystery, it's a puzzle. And puzzles take time to put together,"" says Parcak.

One example of Parcak's step-by-step detective work is the city of Itjtawy in Egypt. It was missing for thousands of years, but Parcak found it by analyzing satellite images and NASA topography data.

Sometimes, piecing together archeological puzzles feels personal.

At Parcak's very first excavation, in the Egyptian Delta site of Mendes, she made a discovery that's fresh in her mind more than 20 years later.

""I found an intact pot that was kind of mashed, but we put it back together,"" she recalls. On the handle, Parcak could make out a clear fingerprint left behind in once-wet clay.

""In that moment, I could imagine the person who made it,"" she says. ""It kind of helps us to bridge the divide between past and present and create a sense of empathy.""

Parcak's work offers a personal contact with the past, but you don't need an archeology degree to connect with the ancient world.

On UNESCO-listed Easter Island, travelers can learn how ancient islanders cooked in earthen ovens and built stone-walled gardens. (Easter Island is a favorite with alien theorists, too. Archaeologists chalk up the island's remarkable stonework to Polynesian ingenuity.)

At the temple of Dendera, part of a sprawling UNESCO site in Upper Egypt, visitors follow vivid stories and myths on brilliant wall paintings. (Dendera? Also popular with alien theorists, who interpret one wall painting as proof the ancient Egyptians had electric light bulbs. Researchers say the painting is of a pillar and a lotus flower.)

WHY LEARNING ABOUT ANCIENT HUMANS MATTERS

Learning about ancient humans is fun, but Parcak says it's important, too. For travellers and researchers alike, exploring the ancient world can shed light on the present day -- and maybe the future.

In early April, Parcak was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship to write a book about collapse and resilience in the ancient world. Coronavirus, she says, has lent a new urgency and relevance to the work.

""It's like everything we study is happening in real time,"" she says. Now, she hears echoes of ancient strife whenever she turns on the news. ""The headlines we're seeing, it's like they could be archeology articles.""

For Parcak, though, visiting these ancient sites can be a source of hope. Itjtawy, the ancient city Parcak discovered using satellite imagery, is an example.

It became the capital of the Egypt after a period of widespread political instability, civil war and drought. The Old Kingdom, whose rulers built some of the greatest pyramids, had fallen.

But as power structures shifted, greater economic equality emerged. And from tomb decor to storytelling, Parcak says the area she studies represents a flourishing after chaos.

""I'm not saying it's always rosy,"" she cautions. ""But the site itself is a real symbol of what can happen after great turmoil.""",[]

Golf Canada reports that there were 17 per cent more scores registered with the national sport body this June compared to the same month last year.

A total of 1,483,506 scores were submitted to Golf Canada's handicap calculator last month compared to 1,271,782 in June 2019.

That ended a streak of three months when recreational rounds played in Canada dropped precipitously due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

As restrictions were lifted across the country in May, the number of scores registered increased.

In May, 165,026 people registered their scores between the 1st and the 15th but 265,480 submitted scores in the final two weeks of that month.

The May 1-15 numbers are a nearly 40 per cent drop from the same period in 2019 (211,809) but the May 16-30 numbers are just five per cent lower than last year (269,266).

The upward trend comes even as Golf Canada had to cancel all of its amateur and professional championships due to travel restrictions put in place to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.

A shift in how scores are registered has also been seen, with most recreational players entering their scores online instead of in the course's clubhouse or pro shop, which have largely been closed this summer because of physical distancing protocols.

Golf Canada plans to launch an updated version of its scoring app later this month, helping to keep players physically distant and improve their game.

Ready to return to Vancouver after two years in China, Robertson and her husband ran into hurdle after hurdle trying to book a plane ticket for their rescue terrier mix as the coronavirus pandemic was taking hold of the world -- shutting cities and airports down.

Soon they'd realize they were far from alone in their efforts to get their dog on a plane. Five hundred people joined a WeChat group the two created -- initially meant as a tool to gather ideas and information on transporting pets.

Other owners were mostly from cities throughout Canada and the U.S. Many had left China hurriedly months ago to see friends or family, thinking they'd be back with their furry roommates in days. But then coronavirus hit and hundreds of travelers were stranded, while their pets remained in the care of either boarding facilities or acquaintances.

Soon, an idea emerged: They'd charter a plane from Shanghai to fly their dogs and cats home, which would touch down in Vancouver, then Seattle. That plane will also help reunite families by bringing back Americans or Canadians stuck in China.

They're calling the effort ""Mission Impawsible.""

'CAN WE EVEN PULL OFF SOMETHING LIKE THIS?'

Arranging the flight was no easy task. Dozens of group members -- from China, the U.S. and Canada -- collaborated on different parts of the plan often with more than half a day's hour difference between them. Nights were long and sleepless.

Many, like dog owner Catherine Hildreth, tasked themselves with learning how to edit videos and design T-shirts, in order to help the group raise awareness of their efforts and fundraise.

The group shared details of the flight on social media and messaging apps and began selling tickets to other Canadian or American citizens hoping for a flight back to their families, after meeting with each consulate. And they enlisted some of those passengers to accompany each dog and cat on the flight.

""It's been a whirlwind and definitely never in my wildest dreams did I think that creating a WeChat group was going to lead me here six weeks later,"" Robertson told CNN. ""Chartering a flight across the ocean for my dog.""

And finally, the group secured a flight for July 18. One hundred furry passengers are booked.

The journey has been a ray of light amid dark times, some group members say, a reminder of what strong collaboration can look like when everyone feels so isolated.

""It's just been kind of one of those things where we've been like, .... at first, 'Whoa, can we even pull off something like this?'"" Robertson said. ""We don't even know each other, we haven't even met in person, we're from different places.

""If you kind of just put your mind to it and just work really hard... you can make this happen,"" she said. ""I think that's what's been amazing for me.""

A COMPANION ON HIS WAY

One of the people waiting for her dog on the other side of the ocean is Kaitlyn Hooper, who now lives in Ontario after a string of devastating news she had to endure without her best friend.

One of the last moments she recalls spending with her rescue, Ted, was the dog's long licks on her face, shortly before a phone call let her know her dad had passed away.

Hooper, who until December taught at a Canadian international school, flew back with return tickets scheduled in three weeks' time. But then another piece of news hit: her mom was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer and passed away shortly after.

""The world was just in a dark place,"" she said. ""So I started looking for ways to get my dog home.""

She tried working with an agent and once she gathered the money to get Ted on a plane, the flight was no longer operating. So when a friend passed along information of the charter flight that would get pets to their owners, she started paying attention. But having no one to accompany her dog on the flight, as required, she shared her story with the group in hopes of a volunteer to accompany him.

That volunteer was Robertson, who along with her husband and their one dog, signed up to be Ted's plus one.

""I've never met Kyla and she's willing to accompany my dog on a 12-hour flight. And that's amazing,"" Hooper said. ""When the world has been so dark for the last few months, it's really added a lot of light in the last few days.""

And it's brought light to the past few weeks as well, she says, seeing a group of strangers form their own determined committee to bring their pets back home. The long nights and endless communications, she says, have been worth it.

""It's hard to get out of bed in the morning and having a dog, it makes you get up, go outside, get some fresh air,"" she says. ""And I think that mental health benefit of having a pet outweighs any costs or frustrations or 3 a.m. text message exchange trying to coordinate all aspects of the flight.""

ANOTHER 20-HOUR DRIVE HOME

In North Carolina, Hildreth has busied herself creating videos and designing T-shirts for the cause -- and counting down the days until she's reunited with her ""fur baby.""

Hildreth and her husband, who both worked for the U.S. Army, rescued their German short-haired pointer in 2015. She says the dog looked so sad, she instead decided to name him -- fittingly -- Happy. The two planned a four-day trip in January to the U.S. from China to begin coordinating for a hopeful move here over the summer.

But the trip, amid a spreading virus, turned into a permanent change.

She is now coordinating efforts to bring dogs to the East Coast once the charter flight lands in Seattle -- about a 2,000-mile journey from North Carolina. During a global pandemic when more families across the world were separated or remain stranded, the group's efforts have given her hope.

""Every night, I stayed up to talk to people in China,"" she said. ""Can you imagine? Those people back in China stayed up all night to talk to Canada and to talk to everybody to try to figure these things out.""

While her friends in China suggested she give her dog to another family, it wasn't an option for her.

""He's my family. I cannot give up on him. I've got to do anything I can to bring him home,"" she said.

""So it is a Mission Impawsible,"" she said. ""Right now, the people who love their pets is the main focus.""",[]

Melanie Knutson was out for her regular walk around the neighbourhood of Canyon Meadows when she spotted a mother duck and a group of ducklings near the intersection of Canterbury Drive and 124th Ave. S.W..

""There was a woman trying to get a picture with her dog and the dog was freaking out,"" she said.

""Then on my second lap, I do the same route three times, I heard some chirping and I went over to the (storm drain) and I looked down and I saw one (duckling).""

Knutson raced home to call 311 and found her partner, Gregory Robottom, was also there, having returned home after forgotting some tools for work.

""I said 'We have to get this duckling out, I know where the mother is,' so we ran back and he lifted the grate off and there was four,"" she said.

Using an equipment case as a carrier, the pair managed to corral three of the ducklings, but the fourth scooted further into a pipe.

""So he hovered the case in the hole so it could hear its siblings, then it finally poked out and he got it,"" said Knutson.

That's when the search began for the mother hen.

""We went walking down an alley to where I thought she was but she wasn't there,"" said Knutson.

""Then an older couple that live around the corner said 'she went that way,' and further down the alley was mom with four (ducklings).""

Robottom walked as close as he could without disturbing the mother duck, then tilted the case so the rescued ducklings could get out.

""We were about (four to five metres) away and they went out and went 'chirp, chirp, chirp' and the momma perked up and came walking toward them with the other four then they all kind of huddled together then waddled away into another back yard.

The weather agency has issued a weather advisory for communities, including Barrie, Collingwood, Orillia, Innisfil, Angus and New Tecumseth.

Environment Canada says the type of funnels that could spring up are generated by rotation under fast-growing clouds or weak thunderstorms. They are not usually a danger but could intensify into weak landspout tornadoes.

It does caution that funnel clouds can appear with little or no warning and that you should be prepared to take cover.

Ritu Tenaja, owner of the Cottage Canoe Restaurant and Bar saw a steady flow of customers all day.

""Rain or shine, you know people are really looking forward to the experience of sitting and being served.""

Flying Monkeys Craft Brewery was busier than they expected to be on a wet day, and over the last month.

""I think people have been cooped up for so long they are just dying to get out, it doesn't matter, so it's been nice. It's been a nice change of pace,"" said manager Ryan Perry.

But Queens Hometown Pub manager Chris Gerrard found rain does put a damper on business.

""Last night when it rained, we had to close two hours earlier than expected, and there is a lot of people running for cover when it rains, but they can't go inside,"" he said.

Cottage Canoe set up a make-shift patio in their parking lot four weeks ago. Without it, Tenaja says the business wouldn't have survived.

""We're still losing money. I don't think there's a lot of restaurants that are making money through this environment...four tables does not account for a full dining room. ""

Tenaja says her staff are on the edge of their seats, waiting for permission to reopen the dining room.

""We go from losing money, to starting to break even as soon as Mr Ford says 'come on in!'. ""

The third stage of the provincial government's COVID-19 recovery plan would allow most businesses to relaunch operation with limits on capacity. As for when that might be announced, it's very much a waiting game.",[]

An Amber Alert had been issued for Romy, six, and Norah, 11, in Levis, south of Quebec City on Thursday. It was lifted earlier Saturday when the bodies were found. The girls had gone missing along with their father Martin Carpentier, 44, after a crash on Highway 20.

The search continues for the father.

Nous confirmons, malheureusement, que les deux personnes #retrouvées plus tôt dans le secteur de Saint-Apollinaire sont #décédées et qu’il s’agit des deux jeunes filles manquant à l’appel, soit Norah et Romy Carpentier. — Sûreté du Québec (@sureteduquebec) July 11, 2020

""The important thing currently, in mobilizing the population, is to be vigilant because we are actively looking for Martin Carpentier who could be in the Saint-Agapit, Saint-Apollinaire sector. Anyone who sees this individual is asked to contact 911 immediately,"" said SQ Srgt. Ann Mathieu.

Premier Francois Legault joined many in the province in lamenting the news.

2/4 J’ai une pensée particulière pour la mère de Norah et Romy. Pour tous leurs proches aussi. C’est le Québec entier qui pleure avec vous aujourd’hui. — François Legault (@francoislegault) July 11, 2020

This is a developing story and will be updated as more details emerge.

ITEMS FOUND THAT MAY BE RELATED

SQ officers searching the Saint-Appollinaire area for the two girls and their father found some objects that may be connected to them on Friday.

Mathieu said the objects may suggest that the missing family is in the area teams are searching.

“We found some objects yesterday, but we can find a lot of different objects in the woods, so what we have to do right now is to be sure that those objects could be related to Martin Carpentier and his two daughters,” said Mathieu.

A command post was established on Friday on Veilleux Street, south of Rang Bois Joly.

Quebec provincial police ATV, horse, K-9 and foot patrols are still searching the heavily wooded area along with search and rescue volunteers.

GIRLFRIEND MAKES DESPERATE PLEA

Martin Carpentier's girlfriend, Cathy Gingras, recorded a desperate plea to him on Friday morning, shared by the SQ on Twitter.

""Martin, we're worried. We haven't heard anything from you since the accident. We want to know if you're okay, and the girls, Romy, Norah. We want to know if they're okay... if you're okay. Give us some news, let us know, call your parents, whatever it is. The important thing is that you're all alright,"" she said. ""We just want to know you're alright.""

Officers and volunteers have scoured the area near the site of the crash since Wednesday night. They are asking anyone who lives in the area to check any building, shed or trailer they might have on or near their property. An SQ helicopter was deployed to search the wooded area.

""We have some information that they may still be in the area,"" said SQ spokesperson Louis-Philippe Bibeau.

The Sûreté also told CTV that it had received word that a neighbour heard screams in the middle of the night. But police wouldn't confirm if it appears to be related to this case.

Premier Legault said Friday afternoon that about 80 people were involved in the search, both on the ground and in the air, and that the province had put all of its resources into finding the girls.

""All my thoughts are with the family, and we really hope that this ends well, that we find the two young girls safe and sound,"" Legault said.

The three were last seen Wednesday at 8:30 p.m. in the Saint-Nicholas neighbourhood of Levis, near a convenience store, police said.

At 9:30 p.m. a 2008 Volkswagen Passat with the licence plate P75 PXV was involved in a crash on Highway 20 east in nearby Saint-Apollinaire. When emergency services arrived, the vehicle was unoccupied and the three have been missing since.



Saint-Apollinaire Mayor Bernard Ouellet said the crash took place in a rural area about four kilometres from the main exit off the highway into town.

""There are many wooded areas -- many, many wooden areas -- but there are many rural roads, too. It's not completely isolated,"" said Ouellet about the territory around the crash site, which he added also contains several small cottages and shacks.

He said residents have been searching their properties for any sign of the three.



""It's worrying everyone a little bit,"" he said.



DESPERATE PLEA FROM MOTHER

Their loved ones have reason to be concerned for their health and safety. Authorities say they don't know the reason for the disappearance and have spoken to witnesses and family members.



""All the hypotheses are on the table, and kidnapping is among them,"" SQ spokesperson Audrey-Anne Bilodeau said, ""but the priority for us is that we have missing people that could be injured.""

The girls' mother posted photos of them on Facebook on Thursday with a plea for help: ""We need to find my daughters and their dad.""



WITNESS SAW CRASH, SEARCHED FOR MISSING FAMILY



A woman driving in the area, Lyne Provencher, said she witnessed the crash.



She said she saw a car headed toward Quebec City fly off the road, hit a sign and some trees, and then flip over.

""I was driving towards Montreal when I saw a cloud of dust and, boom, the car ended up in front of me suddenly,"" Provencher said, adding that she had to think fast to avoid a collision.

""I stopped on the side of the road and I ran to see if there were people inside – nobody,"" she said, adding that three people called authorities at the same time.

""We were screaming and panicking,"" she said.

When firefighters arrived, they used spotlights to search the area.

""Only Martin's cell phone was in the car,"" she said. ""His stepfather called saying he was waiting for Martin to arrive, and that he's told him he was going for ice cream with his daughters,"" adding that he thought it had been a long time.

Provencher said authorities then contacted the girls' mother to inform her and ask if she had her daughters with her, since the children didn't appear to have been in the car.

Provencher shot video from the scene and posted it to Facebook. The post has since been removed.

""There's nobody. The tires are blown out, the windows are blown out. There's no one in the car or in the field,"" she is heard saying in the video. ""It's crazy. I don't understand.""



Provencher said she hoped the person was safe, noting there were child seats in the car.

""I really hope there wasn't a child in the car, because it's really serious. The car is finished,"" she said.

It is possible that one or all of the three missing people are injured, said Surete du Quebec spokesperson Stephane Tremblay.



The subsequent police investigation led officers to launch the Amber Alert Thursday afternoon.



""The car is very damaged and that's why we are looking for them, to see what condition they are in,"" said police spokesperson Anik Lamirande, adding that signs point to the three leaving the scene of the crash on foot.

Health officials recorded 130 new cases of the disease on Saturday, bringing the provincial total to 36,594.

Today, Ontario is reporting 130 cases of #COVID19, a 0.4% increase as the province processed over 29,500 tests. With 267 resolved, there are 137 fewer active cases in the province for a total of 1,462 currently active cases in Ontario. — Christine Elliott (@celliottability) July 11, 2020

The province also added six COVID-19-related deaths, bringing the total number of fatalities to 2,716.

The number of resolved patients also increased on Saturday by 267.

Officials confirmed an additional 116 new cases of the novel coronavirus on Friday. This comes after 170 new cases were reported on Thursday, the highest number noted in more than a week.

Where are the COVID-19 cases?

Twenty-eight of Ontario's 34 public health units reported five or fewer cases of COVID-19 on Saturday, with 18 of them reporting no new cases at all.

According to Saturday's epidemiology report, 26 of the new cases were found in Peel Region, 12 were found in York Region, 42 were found in Toronto and 12 were found in Windsor-Essex, a region that has been grappling with outbreaks among migrant workers.

Of the new cases in Ontario, 82 are between the ages of 20 and 59. There are 20 patients who are 19 years old or younger and 28 patients who are over the age of 59.

The majority of total deaths to date have been reported in people over the age of 79. One person under the age of 19 who had COVID-19 has died in Ontario, but it is not clear if the death was caused by the disease or other health issues.

Eleven patients who died were between the ages of 20 and 39, while 111 were between the ages of 40 and 59, and 722 were between the ages of 60 and 79.

More than 1,800 people over the age of 80 have died of the disease.

COVID-19 testing in Ontario

In the last 24 hours, just over 29,500 COVID-19 tests were conducted by officials.

Ontario health officials have conducted more than 1.6 million tests for the disease since the pandemic was declared.

For many Canadians, a cottage by the lake is a dream that more people are trying to make a reality.

""We have had record sales,"" said realtor Catharine Inniss, Johnston and Daniel Rushbrooke Realty.

In June 2019, 161 cottages were sold in the District of Muskoka while last month, 278 were sold, which is an increase of 73 per cent year over year.

Jodi Kovitz lives in a condo in downtown Toronto with her daughter and said she's on the hunt for a Muskoka cottage.

""We're doing great. We're healthy, and we live in 11-hundred square feet, and we haven't really left it for four months,"" Kovitz said she's looking to find her dream cottage.

It's a trend taking shape across the world.

A recent article in the Wall Street Journal reported 39 per cent of urban dwellers in the United States are thinking about moving somewhere more rural because of the pandemic.

But if you are considering a move, Inniss has some tips, including using a local realtor.

""They know whether there's flooding, shore allowances, septics, etc.,"" she explained.

Inniss added that while properties are moving quickly, there are still plenty out there.

The city recently stepped up enforcement after swarms of people packed the beach and lined the residential street with parked cars, the city going so far as to remove the word 'beach' from the sign at Wilkins Beach.

In Ramara Township, council dealt with the issue of overcrowding by closing all public beaches and some water access points.

""This is a temporary closure until we can somehow get control of the numbers, and then we can try and figure out a system that we can reopen the beaches for our locals only,"" said Mayor Basil Clarke.

The township has been overwhelmed with out-of-towners this summer.

Not with swabs and test tubes, but with road barriers and patios extending beyond the sidewalk's edge.

Every Friday for the rest of the summer stretches of Mississaga and Peter streets will close between 4 p.m. and 8 p.m.

The closures, which began July 10, are meant to be a lifeline for businesses struggling because of the pandemic.

Blocked streets allow restaurants, cafes, and bars to serve more guests outside while maintaining physical distancing.

The Downtown Orillia Management Board says 27 eateries planned to take advantage of the extra space, setting up tables and chairs on the road.

After an 83 per cent plunge in revenue, Samir Hanna has added six tables to the front of Sanafir Mediterranean and Middle Eastern restaurant.

""Just try to make some money. We had a bad time, three months. Hopefully, that will make up for that bad time,"" Hanna said.

Some businesses that don't serve food or drink are extending hours Friday to try and cash in on the potential extra foot traffic.

Others aren't convinced it's worth their financial while to stay open late but want neighbouring patios to thrive.

""We're all in this together,"" said Julia Belleghem at Manticore Books. ""None of us want to see empty storefronts downtown. None of us want to lose businesses because a vibrant downtown helps everybody.""

The chair of Orillia's Economic Recovery Task Force hopes people will take advantage of the extra space, even if they aren't grabbing a bite on a patio.

""Walk out on the street. Get together, for a change,"" said councillor Ted Emond.

An art stroll is part of the late day closure, with talk of maybe adding street performers down the line.

The late afternoon into early evening time frame has been pitched as a compromise that allows restaurants to serve more guests without cutting off access to shops during their peak period.

But the program could be tweaked.

""As we progress through the summer, we will likely expand into other areas as the businesses request it, and then if it's going well, and Saturday evening looks like an option as well, we'll move into that.""

Neither the city nor downtown management board is offering specific benchmarks to measure the success or failure of the road closures. But they say foot traffic is being monitored, feedback requested from business owners, and adjustments will be made as required.",[]

This year, their trip to Kenya was cancelled, but many students still wanted to do something to help a needy cause.

Grade 12 student, now a graduate, Christian Strong, said he understands why the trip was cancelled, but admitted he was still disappointed.

""When we got closer to the date we were supposed to leave it kind of hit, and I was like, 'oh wish I was doing something bigger then what I'm doing now,'"" said Strong.

That's when Strong and his classmates decided to turn their efforts closer to home.

Through tireless fundraising, the students raised $21,000 for their trip, initially going to supplies, materials, and travel costs.

While in Kenya, they planned to help build homes, find sources of water, and give to the communities.

The students decided to take the money raised for the trip and give it to four national charities and five Orillia charities.

""Just because the pandemic happened and shut everything down, doesn't mean these problems aren't shut down as well,"" said Strong.

Brett Carron said the trip is an experience that every student could learn from, and the teacher was pleased with the way the students jumped at the opportunity.

""They quickly realized that this isn't just Patrick Fogarty, or Orillia, this is a global pandemic,"" said Carron.

The Orillia Youth Centre is one of the organizations receiving a portion of the money.

Director Kevin Gangloff said the donation couldn't have come at a better time, and the money would go towards food and groceries for local youths.

Another portion of the donation will benefit the Building Hope campaign for The Lighthouse, helping to bring it one step closer to its fundraising goal of 1.3 million dollars.

Peart's sister, Nancy Burkholder, wanted to shine some light on a dark time.

Burkholder immediately though of the Regional Cancer Centre at Royal Victoria Regional Health Centre (RVH) in Barrie.

The family had planned on a memorial concert, but it was put on hold because of COVID-19.

Burkholder has instead asked her brother's admirers and collaborators to donate items for an auction.

While staff at RVH don't know how much money the auction will raise, they have big plans to improve and expand radiation treatments.

For Burkholder, the last few months without her brother have been rough, but she's found comfort in hearing stories from his fans and seeing their adoration in donations.

""I have to say this is one thing that is keeping us going, and the support is just phenomenal,"" she admitted. ""It surprises us every day.""

Trump flew by helicopter to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in suburban Washington to meet wounded servicemembers and health care providers caring for COVID-19 patients. As he left the White House, he told reporters: “When you're in a hospital, especially ... I think it's a great thing to wear a mask.”

Trump was wearing a mask in Walter Reed's hallway as he began his visit. He was not wearing one when he stepped off the helicopter at the facility.

The president was a latecomer to wearing a mask during the pandemic, which has raged across the U.S. since March and infected more than 3.2 million and killed at least 134,000. Most prominent Republicans, including Vice-President Mike Pence, endorsed wearing masks as the coronavirus gained ground this summer. Republican governors have been moving toward requiring or encouraging the use of masks as the pandemic has grown more serious in some states in the South and West.

Trump, however, has declined to wear a mask at news conferences, coronavirus task force updates, rallies and other public events. People close to him have told The Associated Press that the president feared a mask would make him look weak and was concerned that it shifted focus to the public health crisis rather than the economic recovery. They spoke on condition of anonymity to describe private matters.

While not wearing one himself, Trump has sent mixed signals about masks, acknowledging that they would be appropriate if worn in an indoor setting where people were close together. But he has accused reporters of wearing them to be politically correct and has retweeted messages making fun of Democrat Joe Biden for wearing a mask and implying that Biden looks weak.

Questions remain whether Trump will wear a mask with any regularity.

The wearing of masks became another political dividing line, with Republicans more resistant to wearing them than Democrats. Few masks were seen at recent Trump campaign events in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Phoenix and South Dakota's Mount Rushmore.

The only time Trump has been known to wear a mask was during a private part of a tour of a Ford plant in Michigan.

On its website, Walter Reed carries this recommendation: “Whenever you're out in public, like at your local grocery store or pharmacy, where it's difficult to maintain 6 feet of social distance, you should wear a cloth face covering.” The facility also notes that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends wearing cloth face coverings to slow the spread of the coronavirus.”",[]

Philippe Monguillot, 59, was left brain dead after the attack in the southwestern city of Bayonne on July 5. His family decided to switch off his life support on Friday, news agency Agence France-Presse reported.

""We decided to let him go. The doctors were in favour and we were as well,"" the victim's 18-year-old daughter, Marie Monguillot, told AFP.

Four men were detained and charged following the assault.

The attack occurred on Sunday around 7:15 p.m. on the 810 bus travelling to Biarritz after the bus driver checked the ticket of one of the men and asked all four to wear face masks, which are compulsory in French public transport, according to the public prosecutor's office.

On Wednesday, Monguillot's family organized a march in his honour, with all attendees wearing white.

Prime Minister Castex confirmed Monguillot's death on Twitter late Friday, writing that the case had ""touched our hearts.""

""The Republic recognizes him as an exemplary citizen and won't forget him. The law will punish the perpetrators of this despicable crime,"" he wrote, describing the attack as ""cowardly.""

French Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin also expressed his condolences to Monguillot's frends, family and colleagues.

""This heinous and cowardly act must not go unpunished. I'll be travelling to Bayonne tomorrow to make a point of safety in the city with state officials and meet with public transport drivers and unions,"" he wrote on Twitter.

Shortly after 1 p.m., emergency crews were called to the area of Plains Road East and King Road for reports of a shooting.

Upon arrival at the scene, officers said they located two male victims suffering from gunshot wounds. One victim was pronounced dead at the scene and the other was transported to hospital with serious injuries.

A third male victim was located at the scene with unknown injuries. Officers said he was not shot.

The deceased male has since been identified by police as Pat. He was 52 years old.

Pat was a well-known fixture of Ontario’s organized crime scene for many years.

Pat and his brother Angelo were charged with first-degree murder in the 1997 deaths of Hamilton mob boss Johnny “Pops” Papalia and his underboss Carmen Barillaro. The hitman who pleaded guilty in both shootings said the Musitano brothers had ordered the killings. The brothers pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder in Barillaro’s death as part of a plea deal and the charges relating to Papalia’s death were withdrawn.

The brothers were sentenced to 10 years behind bars in 2000 and were released from prison in 2006.

On May 2, 2017, Angelo was fatally gunned down while sitting in his vehicle in the driveway of his home in Hamilton, Ont.’s Waterdown neighbourhood. He was 39 years old.

One man was arrested in connection with Angelo’s death and two other suspects are wanted on Canada-wide warrants.

Meanwhile, Pat’s vehicle was torched in his driveway back in 2015 and a month after Angelo was killed Pat’s home was sprayed with bullets.

Pat was targeted once again last year. He was shot on April 25, 2019 in a Mississauga, Ont. parking lot while leaving his lawyer’s office at around 7 a.m.

The family’s patriarch, Pat and Angelo’s uncle, Tony Musitano died of natural causes at the age of 72 in April 2019. He was described as a former mobster.

No threat to public safety, police say

In the aftermath of the Burlington, Ont. shooting, Halton Regional Police said there is no ongoing or immediate threat to public safety.

Speaking at the scene of the shooting just before 4 p.m., Const. Ryan Anderson with Halton Regional Police told reporters officers are searching for a male suspect who fled the area westbound on Plains Road East in a newer model grey four-door sedan with a sunroof, similar to an Infiniti Q50.

According to investigators, the suspect vehicle would have “fresh damage to the driver’s side in the area of the doors.”

No further suspect description has been provided by officials thus far.

“Our investigators are going to be doing an extensive investigation,” Anderson said. “We are going to be canvassing the area for evidence, cameras, those sorts of things. It requires a large road closure at this point and a large scene.”

“We do have some witnesses and we would love to hear from anyone else who may have seen something, who may have been driving in the area, who has a dashcam from the approximate time of 1 p.m. on Plains Road East in Burlington.”

Among them was Wang’s roommate Shayla Raine.

Raine explained that she wasn’t home on the January night when security video captured Kelowna RCMP officer Cpl. Lacy Browning executing the now controversial wellness check at her apartment.

“When I came back and opened the suite it looked like a crime scene,” she said. “I had to stuff my nose with tissue because the smell of blood.”

Troubling video of the incident emerged in June, prompting the head of B.C. RCMP’s southeast division to issue an apology to Mona Wang.

“When I first saw the video I was deeply concerned. And I’m very sorry to Ms. Wang for what occurred,” said Chief Superintendent Brad Haugli on July 2.

Mona Wang has launched a lawsuit claiming she was assaulted and abused by Browning who was dispatched to Wang’s residence to check on her wellbeing.

Surveillance video shows a handcuffed Wang, dressed only in a bra and leggings, being dragged facedown by her wrists and arms down a hallway and through the building’s lobby by the female officer.

No video has emerged to show what took place in the apartment but Raine believes much of the alleged assault happened out of view of cameras.

“Mona could not have possibly gotten broken blood vessels in her eyes or bruises on all of her legs and abdomen from only being dragged down the carpet or having her head stepped on or hair pulled,” Raine said.

“There was definitely more that happened inside the apartment and it was evidently clear from the crime scene I had to clean up.""

At the Vancouver rally close to 100 people also gathered to support Wang’s advocacy for an end to wellness checks without mental health professionals present.

None of the allegations against Browning have been proven in court. The RCMP has said a code of conduct review and a criminal investigation is underway.

""The RCMP will also be asking an outside police department to independently review the findings of our criminal investigation once completed,"" Staff-Sgt. Janelle Shoihet of the B.C. RCMP previously told CTV News Vancouver.",[]

Gov. Denny Tamaki said he could say only that a ""few dozen"" cases had been found recently because the U.S. military asked that the exact figure not be released. The outbreaks occurred at Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, which is at the centre of a relocation dispute, and Camp Hansen, Tamaki said.

Local media, citing unnamed sources, said about 60 people had been infected.

""Okinawans are shocked by what we were told (by the U.S. military),"" Tamaki told a news conference. ""We now have strong doubts that the U.S. military has taken adequate disease prevention measures.""

Tamaki demanded transparency in the latest development and said he planned to request talks between the U.S. military and Okinawan officials. He said Okinawan officials also asked the Japanese government to demand that the U.S. provide details including the number of cases, seal off Futenma and Camp Hansen, and step up preventive measures on base.

Okinawan officials made similar requests to the U.S. military on Friday in order to address local residents' concerns, Tamaki said.

The Marines said in a statement Friday that the troops were taking additional protective measures to limit the spread of the coronavirus and were restricting off-base activities. The statement said measures are ""to protect our forces, our families, and the local community,"" without providing details on the infections.

The Marines did not immediately respond Saturday to an Associated Press inquiry about the latest outbreak.

Okinawa is home to more than half of about 50,000 American troops based in Japan under a bilateral security pact, and the residents are sensitive to U.S. base-related problems. Many Okinawans have long complained about pollution, noise and crime related to U.S. bases.

Okinawans also oppose a planned relocation of the Futenma air base from the current site in a densely populated area in the south to a less populated area on the east coast.

Local media reported that the Okinawan assembly adopted a resolution Friday protesting the U.S. military's lack of transparency about its outbreak on base.

Okinawa has about 150 cases of the coronavirus. In all, Japan has about 21,000 cases and 1,000 deaths, with Tokyo reporting more than 200 new cases for a third straight day Saturday.",[]

But it remained to be seen if Trump's most recent defiance of the conventions of his office to commute the sentence of political confidant Roger Stone, just four months before Election Day, would matter to voters grappling with a deadly COVID-19 surge and a national discourse on racial justice.

Shortly before heading out Saturday morning for his Virginia golf club, Trump made unfounded accusations against his political foes while taking another swipe at special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, which led to convictions for six Trump aides or advisers, including Stone, a larger-than-life political character who embraced his reputation as a dirty trickster.

“Roger Stone was targeted by an illegal Witch Hunt that never should have taken place,” Trump tweeted. “It is the other side that are criminals, including Biden and Obama, who spied on my campaign - AND GOT CAUGHT!”

Roger Stone was targeted by an illegal Witch Hunt that never should have taken place. It is the other side that are criminals, including Biden and Obama, who spied on my campaign - AND GOT CAUGHT! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 11, 2020

Trump has long sought vengeance against the Russia investigation that helped define his first two years in office. And now that the coronavirus pandemic has imperiled his reelection chances by crushing the economy and sending his poll numbers sliding, he has taken to testing the limits of his power in order to reward loyalty and fire up his conservative base.

The decision to commute the sentence of the 67-year-old Stone, who was convicted of lying to help the president and set to report to prison on Tuesday, was loudly celebrated by some in Trump's orbit as a triumph over deep state prosecutorial overreach.

But the move announced Friday evening came over the advice of a number of the president's senior advisers, who warned him it would be politically self-destructive to reward Stone for his silence. Trump had long floated the idea of clemency for Stone - as well as for other associates in legal trouble, including his former national security adviser Michael Flynn and campaign chairman Paul Manafort - which itself was viewed by some as witness tampering by encouraging them not to co-operate with prosecutors.

The reaction from Democrats was swift and furious.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Saturday called it “an act of staggering corruption,” saying legislation is needed to prevent a president from pardoning or commuting the sentence of someone who acted to shield that president from prosecution. House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff called it “offensive to the rule of law and principles of justice.”

And Trump's Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, resurfaced a 2019 tweet in which he said that “Trump has surrounded himself with people who flout our laws - we shouldn't be surprised that he thinks he is above the law.” He added: “Still true.”

Republicans largely stayed silent on the issue Saturday, reluctant again to challenge a president who remains very popular with rank-and-file GOP voters. But one loud voice was Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, who was also the lone GOP senator to vote to convict the president during his impeachment trial earlier this year.

“Unprecedented, historic corruption: an American president commutes the sentence of a person convicted by a jury of lying to shield that very president,” Romney tweeted Saturday.

Unprecedented, historic corruption: an American president commutes the sentence of a person convicted by a jury of lying to shield that very president. — Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) July 11, 2020

Sen. Pat Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican, signalled dismay with the commutation, saying in a statement Saturday that it was a mistake while calling the Russia investigation “badly flawed” and a source of “frustration.” He added that Stone had been duly convicted and that any objections to the conviction and trial “should be resolved through the appeals process.”

Mark Sanford, the former South Carolina congressman who made a short-lived primary challenge to Trump, wrote: “So much for the Republican Party being the party of law and order. Have we not lost our minds in not condemning as a party the president's corruption by Roger Stone.”

But most of Republicans who did speak out about the decision supported it. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Trump confidant, said Stone was convicted of a “nonviolent, first-time offence” and the president was “justified” in commuting the sentence.

Advisers who had previously talked Trump out of acting on Stone's behalf awaited the possible fallout, but they considered that Congress may be too consumed with virus relief packages while wondering if the electorate long ago tuned out any talk of the complicated Russia investigation, particularly during a pandemic.

But Trump likely could not afford more political damage. He is decidedly trailing Biden, per his campaign's own private admissions, and his effort to reboot his reelection bid took another blow when his planned rally Saturday night in New Hampshire was postponed. Campaign officials had deeply worried about low turnout. While an impending storm was blamed for the cancellation, sunny skies were seen in Portsmouth an hour before the president had been due to arrive.

By commuting Stone's sentence, Trump evoked other controversial acts of clemency by his predecessors, though his was done in the height of an election year.

President George H. W. Bush pardoned former Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger on Christmas Eve 1992, six weeks after he was defeated for reelection, prompting an uproar from Democrats and the independent counsel investigating the Iran-Contra affair. And President Bill Clinton waited until his final hours in office in 2001 to issue a raft of pardons, including of financier Marc Rich.

But one president who resisted the use of pardon was Richard Nixon, who privately discussed acts of clemency but never followed through even as many of his associates faced legal trouble during the Watergate scandal.

A few months after resigning, Nixon himself received a pardon from his successor Gerald Ford.

Stone, a former Nixon aide, told the AP he expressed his gratitude to Trump in a phone call.

“You know, he has a great sense of fairness,” Stone said. “We've been friends for many, many years, and he understands that I was targeted strictly for political reasons.”

These Alta. researchers think so,[],2020-07-10 11:15:00-04:00,"TORONTO -- Two researchers in Alberta believe new strains of cannabis could potentially prevent the most fatal respiratory effects of COVID-19 and maybe even block the virus from entering the body at all.

The husband and wife team of Drs. Igor and Olga Kovalchuk at the University of Lethbridge have been studying the use of new strains of cannabis to fight cancer and inflammation. When the pandemic struck, they turned their attention to the novel coronavirus.

They hoped to find strains of cannabis that would interfere with the virus’ ability infiltrate the body by hijacking special proteins or receptors. One of the receptors, known as ACE2, has previously been determined to be a key doorway for the COVID-19 virus to enter the body.

The Kovalchuks believe certain cannabis strains can work in two ways – blocking the virus from gaining entry to the body in the first place, and preventing its propagation if it’s already in a person’s system.

Their research has found certain cannabis strains show the potential to control an immune system that’s gone into overdrive in COVID-19 patients. When that happens – the dreaded cytokine storm – the immune system starts attacking the body itself. That can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the need for the patient to be placed on a ventilator.

Igor Kovalchuk says their lab has developed more than 1,500 hybrid strains of cannabis over the last five years and have tested about 400 of them against the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19.

So far, they have found about a dozen that are able to “substantially decrease the expression of the ACE2 receptor, the one that is required by the virus to enter our cells,” he told CTV’s Your Morning Friday.

Two or three strains developed in the Kovalchuks’ lab and tested on human tissue models can decrease that receptor’s acceptance of the virus – essentially closing the door to infection – by 75 per cent or more, said Igor Kovalchuk. That gives the body a much better chance of fighting the viral invader.

Strains the scientists are working with are cannabidiol (CBD)-predominant. That means they have high presence of the medicinal ingredient of cannabis and relatively little of the tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is the psychoactive component of cannabis that causes a high.

Igor Kovalchuk says it’s generally recommended that THC dosage be limited to 25 mg a day to prevent impairment, so the strains they are studying as potential answers for COVID-19 would allow a dose of 500 mg of CBD without hitting that limit.

Cannabis has a good safety profile and often can improve quality of life through reducing anxiety, improving sleep and boosting appetite, says Olga Kovalchuk.

The couple’s work was published as a preliminary report in a May issue of the online medical journal Research Square. It is undergoing peer review. https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-30927/v1

The next big step is real-world testing of the cannabis strains that have performed well in the lab, says Olga Kovalchuk.

“Right now, what’s most important for us is to actually find partnerships and develop clinical trials.”

The Kovalchuks, both professors in University of Lethbridge’s Department of Biological Sciences, are working in partnership with Pathway RX, a company founded and headed by Igor Kovalchuk that is focused on developing custom cannabis therapies.

The hope is to eventually develop medical formulations inhalers, mouthwash and gargling products that could be used to prevent and treat COVID-19.

The researchers have not tested smoking cannabis and say none of the strains they are studying are available for sale at local cannabis shops.",[]
77,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/indoor-airborne-spread-of-coronavirus-possible-who-1.5019109,Indoor airborne spread of coronavirus possible: WHO,[],2020-07-10 12:26:00-04:00,"LONDON -- The World Health Organization is acknowledging the possibility that COVID-19 might be spread in the air under certain conditions -- after more than 200 scientists urged the agency to do so.

In an open letter published this week in a journal, two scientists from Australia and the U.S. wrote that studies have shown ""beyond any reasonable doubt that viruses are released during exhalation, talking and coughing in microdroplets small enough to remain aloft in the air.""

The researchers, along with more than 200 others, appealed for national and international authorities, including WHO, to adopt more stringent protective measures.

WHO has long dismissed the possibility that the coronavirus is spread in the air except for certain risky medical procedures, such as when patients are first put on breathing machines.

In a change to its previous thinking, WHO noted on Thursday that studies evaluating COVID-19 outbreaks in restaurants, choir practices and fitness classes suggested the virus might have been spread in the air.

Airborne spread ""particularly in specific indoor locations, such as crowded and inadequately ventilated spaces over a prolonged period of time with infected persons cannot be ruled out,"" WHO said.

Still, officials also pointed out that other modes of transmission -- like contaminated surfaces or close contacts between people in such indoor environments -- might also have explained the disease's spread.

WHO's stance also recognized the importance of people spreading COVID-19 without symptoms, a phenomenon the organization has long downplayed.

WHO has repeatedly said such transmission is ""rare"" despite a growing consensus among scientists globally that asymptomatic spread likely accounts for a significant amount of transmission. The agency said that most spread is via droplets from infected people who cough or sneeze, but added that people without symptoms are also capable of transmitting the disease.

""The extent of truly asymptomatic infection in the community remains unknown,"" WHO said.

The Canadian Medical Association has released a list of ""critical issues"" the country needs to address before a potential resurgence of the novel coronavirus, including clear messaging, effective testing and an immense medical backlog.

Whether there will be a dramatic surge akin to a “wave” remains to be seen. Instead, CMA President Sandy Buchman thinks Canada might see “little bumps here and there” like we’re at the top of a ski hill.

“It’s a hill full of moguls. We need to find our way through the moguls, the bumps that are bound to occur,” he told CTVNews.ca over the phone on Wednesday.

Canada will be best equipped to navigate those bumps if the critical issues identified by the CMA are addressed, he said.

COMPLACENCY AND MESSAGING

Canadians must continue to adhere to public health measures, including physical distancing that has proven to help flatten the curve of coronavirus infections across the country. It could be a challenge with COVID-19 “fatigue” settling in as much of the country closes out its 17th week of widespread restrictions.

“We can’t let up,” said Buchman. “We have to continue to be vigilant about the public health measures. If we’re not doing that we can suffer another lockdown and way more restrictions.”

To ensure public health measures are clear and feasible, the messaging from health authorities should be consistent, said Buchman. But this has been an issue since the pandemic began and it became clear that people were confused by guidance being issues, particularly as it related to face coverings.

“It’s clearer lately with regards to mask wearing,” said Buchman, noting numerous jurisdictions that have started to enforce mandatory face coverings in indoor public spaces.

But messaging around contact tracing, which can help identify and contain new infections, has proven to be a new challenge for public health officials.

TRACING AND TESTING

In June, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that a new voluntary mobile app for contact tracing would be tested in Ontario and arrive for use in July. Last week, the provincial government announced that the app was delayed​, but officials were working with federal partners to release the it “shortly.”

This is the kind of messaging snafu that Buchman said authorities need to iron out before further outbreaks of the virus take hold.

“It is now July 9. We haven’t heard anything,” he said of the app. “We should be getting clear consistent messaging and why the delay.""

In addition to improved contact tracing across the country, the CMA recommends that “proactive strategic testing” be expanded across essential worker groups and other susceptible populations.

FRONT-LINE WORKERS AND MARGINALIZED PEOPLE

While production of personal protective equipment (PPE) has mitigated an earlier crisis, the health and wellness of front-line workers remains a concern.

“Governments need to do more to recognize the unique risks and financial hardships experienced by our frontline health-care workers,” the CMA said in a news release Thursday.

Canada has also “failed dramatically” in protecting vulnerable groups that have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic so far, the CMA said, including marginalized populations and residents of long-term care facilities, where most of the Canadian deaths have occurred.

‘NON-ESSENTIAL’ BACKLOG

Early in the pandemic, surgeries, procedures and consults deemed “non-essential” were cancelled and postponed to maintain physical distancing and to better equip hospitals for an influx of cases. An immense backlog of cases has piled up over recent months that health officials have said could take years to clear.

“As health services begin to resume, health systems will be left to grapple with a significant spike in already lengthy waiting times,” the CMA wrote in its news release.

Despite the prospect of new outbreaks, Buchman says he’s optimistic as long as Canada begins to attend to the issues the CMA has outlined.

“Let’s do it now,” he said. “Let’s just ensure that we’re on this path and we can get through it.”",[]

A guide to symptoms,['Ryan Flanagan'],2020-03-02 10:21:00-05:00,"TORONTO -- As the COVID-19 pandemic spreads around the world, here is what you need to know about the signs and symptoms of the novel coronavirus and what to do if you think you may be infected.

SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) says symptoms can vary and these are some of the most commonly reported ones.

New or worsening cough

Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

Temperature equal to or higher than 38 C

Feeling feverish

Chills

Fatigue or weakness

Muscle or body aches

New loss of smell or taste

Headache

Gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting)

Feeling very unwell

PHAC also noted there are more reports of children having abdominal symptoms, and skin changes or rashes.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the most common symptoms include:

Fever

Dry cough

Tiredness

The international health body also listed these less common symptoms:

Aches and pains

Sore throat

Diarrhea

Conjunctivitis (pink eye)

Headache

Loss of taste or smell

Rash on skin, or discolouration of fingers or toes

The WHO also lists serious symptoms, including:

Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath

Chest pain or pressure

Loss of speech or movement

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) lists a number of symptoms that may indicate a COVID-19 infection. These include:

Fever or chills

Cough

Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

Fatigue

Muscle or body aches

Headache

New loss of taste or smell

Sore throat

Congestion or runny nose

Nausea or vomiting

Diarrhea

The CDC advises people to seek emergency medical attention if they have any of these “emergency warning signs”:

Trouble breathing

Persistent pain or pressure in the chest

New confusion

Inability to wake or stay awake

Bluish lips or face

Symptoms can occur anytime within 14 days of a patient's exposure to the virus – and, as the virus can be transmitted from one person to another, it can be difficult to pinpoint exactly when exposure occurred.

The symptoms are common ones when it comes to respiratory diseases. In addition to COVID-19, they can suggest a far more typical illness such as influenza or the common cold. Some of those who contract the virus may never display any symptoms, and may pass it on to others without realizing they ever had it.

This makes it virtually impossible for the average person to determine whether their symptoms are being caused by the new coronavirus or something else.

According to PHAC, there are three main ways the virus that causes the disease can be transmitted: close personal contact such as shaking hands, respiratory droplets spread through coughs and sneezes, and touching a surface with the virus on it then touching one's own face without first handwashing. Studies have shown that the virus can survive for up to 72 hours on plastic and stainless steel and less than 24 hours on cardboard.

HOW LONG IT LASTS

Once a person is exposed to the virus, it typically takes about five to six days before they begin to experience symptoms. However, symptoms can appear as early as one day after exposure and as late as 14 days after, according to the WHO.

Scientists are still learning how long a person is contagious, but a Chinese study of 191 patients observed that “viral shedding” — the process by which the virus replicates inside the body and is released — lasted for a median period of 20 days. The longest period of viral shedding researchers observed was 37 days.

How long a person is sick varies widely. About 80 per cent of COVID-19 patients are considered mild, and those patients typically recover within one to two weeks. More severe cases of the virus can last anywhere from three to six weeks, according to the WHO.

Dry coughing — a hallmark of COVID-19 — appears to be a lingering symptom and lasts about a week longer than fever, according to a Chinese study.

Shortness of breath is a major indicator of whether or not someone with COVID-19 requires hospitalization, and a Chinese study published last month in The Lancet suggests that shortness of breath begins about five to six days after the initial onset of symptoms.

The federal government has directed people with COVID-19 to isolate at home for 14 days.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) advises people who have COVID-19, but have not been tested, to not leave the home until they have had no fever for at least 72 hours, their other symptoms have improved, and at least seven days have passed since their symptoms first appeared.

OTHER POTENTIAL SYMPTOMS

There are also suggestions that COVID-19 might cause some patients to suddenly lose their senses of smell and/or taste, and several studies have found clues that pink eye, also known as conjunctivitis, could be an overlooked symptom and transmission method of the virus.

Doctors have also identified a new potential symptom in younger patients: skin lesions seen primarily on their toes.

The so-called ""COVID toes"" are often characterized by blueish-red or purple bumps on the toes that hurt or feel warm when touched. Physically, they look similar to frostbite, but notably develop without the extreme temperatures that trigger similar lesions.

These lesions primarily appear in younger patients — young adults or children — who have not displayed any other symptoms. They typically appear on the feet, but have also been observed on fingers.

Although there is not enough supporting research yet to make it one of the officially recognized symptoms of the virus, the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program has issued an alert warning doctors and parents about skin changes as a possible sign of infection. Doctors recommend that those who develope these lesions should self-isolate.

There's also growing evidence that COVID-19 can also cause the blood to clot in unusual ways, leading to reports of sudden strokes occurring in adults in their 30s and 40s who are not otherwise terribly ill.

As of April 28, there have been more than 49,000 cases of COVID-19 and 2,852 related deaths in Canada.

Although initially, the vast majority of the reported illnesses were linked to travel or people who had been in contact with recent travellers, community spread has become much more prevalent.

WHAT SHOULD I DO?

Advice for Canadians is evolving rapidly as the pandemic grows.

The federal government is urging all Canadians to stay at home unless it is absolutely necessary to go out in public. All travellers returning to the country and anyone who has had contact with a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19 should self-isolate for 14 days. Some provinces have shut down non-essential businesses in order to further emphasize the need for physical distancing.

The government has also launched an online questionnaire that can be used as a self-assessment tool by anyone who is concerned that they may have COVID-19, and an app that provides up-to-date information and guidance regarding the virus.

The questionnaire advises whether users should visit an emergency room, contact telehealth, self-isolate or do nothing, and provides links to provincial and territorial advice when appropriate.

Those who must visit a health-care professional are advised to call ahead or tell them upon arrival that they have a respiratory illness. PHAC says that you may be asked to wear a mask to prevent the spread of the virus.

Doctors cannot provide any specific treatment for COVID-19 – there is no known cure or vaccine – but can ensure a patient's case is properly reported to public health authorities. The flu vaccine will not protect against the coronavirus.

Most people with mild symptoms of the coronavirus recover on their own.

""When you're sick, definitely stay home, cover your cough, wash your hands a lot. We can't repeat that too frequently,"" said Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief officer of public health.

The WHO estimates that 80 per cent of COVID-19 patients will recover without the need for any medical intervention.

AVOIDING COVID-19

Even if you are not sick, public health officials are requiring ""physical distancing,"" which includes avoiding large gatherings, working from home when possible, and keeping two metres between yourself and strangers when you venture outside. Businesses and organizations across the country, as well as different levels of government, have announced closures, reduced services and limits on crowd gatherings to encourage social distancing.

Just as the new coronavirus presents similarly to other respiratory illnesses, advice for keeping it at bay runs along the same lines as tips for avoiding more commonplace colds and coughs.

PHAC says that people who appear healthy can improve their chances of staying that way if they avoid close contact with people who are sick, do not touch their face with unwashed hands, regularly wash their hands with soap for 20 seconds or more, and use their sleeves to cover coughs and sneezes.

There is an increased risk of more severe outcomes for people who are 65 or older, who have compromised immune systems or who have other underlying medical conditions, the government agency said.

The risk for testing positive with COVID-19 may be increased on cruise ships, heavily affected areas and international conferences and other large indoor gatherings, PHAC said.

Additional recommendations for day-to-day life include immediately disposing of used tissues and regularly cleaning surfaces that come into contact with human hands, such as toilets, doorknobs and smartphones.

Surgical masks and N95 masks are best left to the frontline workers and health-care workers who desperately need them, as the country’s supply of personal protective equipment is low, but some experts are now saying that wearing homemade cloth face masks in some situations is a good idea for the general population.

“For example, if you’re in public transit and you cannot easily practice the two metres (of physical distancing), for example, then having that additional covering, like covering up your cough, I think, is a good idea,” Tam said in early April.

Several provincial health officials have started recommending the use of homemade face masks as well.

Wearing face masks will not protect you from the novel coronavirus, but does help those who are sick to not spread the virus. As there has been evidence of asymptomatic spread, wearing cloth face masks in public can cut down on the risk of a carrier who does not know they are sick from spreading it.

There is also no known evidence to suggest that animal-to-human infection has occurred in Canada. However, there are still ""many unknowns"" in this area, PHAC says, and a small handful of animals worldwide have tested positive, including two pet cats in New York state.

If you are diagnosed with COVID-19 and you have a pet, PHAC advises against snuggling or kissing your pet, sharing a bed with them, having your pet sit on your lap or letting them lick you.

PHAC advises that people with COVID-19 should have another member of your household care for your pet, limit your pet’s contact with other people and animals and wash your hands before touching or feeding them.

In an open letter addressed to Public Safety Minister Bill Blair, 29 bipartisan members of Congress called on the Canadian government to plan a phased reopening of the Canada-U.S. border and to consider easing existing measures.

""We are asking that the United States and Canada immediately craft a comprehensive framework for phased reopening of the border based on objective metrics and accounting for the varied circumstances across border regions,"" read the letter, which was published on Western New York Congressman Brian Higgins' website on July 3.

The members of Congress, who represent the northern states along the border, also implored the Canadian government to consider easing restrictions on family members and property owners impeded by the border closure.

""We understand the importance of prioritizing the safety of our communities as we all navigate the complex calculation of minimizing public health risks and resuming economic activity. However, the social and economic partnership between our two nations necessitates a clear pathway forward,"" the letter read.

They crafted the letter following the latest joint Canada-U.S. agreement to extend the current border closure until July 21. This is the third time the agreement to maintain the border closure has been extended.

Despite the United States' plea, a spokesperson for Canada’s Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland told CTVNews.ca in a Friday statement that the health and safety of Canadians is ""absolutely priority.""

""Decisions about Canada's border are made by Canadians, for Canadians,"" said Freeland's spokesperson, Katherine Cuplinskas, in the statement.

""Since the beginning of this global pandemic, we have been having friendly ongoing conversations with our American partners about our shared border. Both sides agree that the current measures in place, which are set to expire on July 21st, have worked well in restricting non-essential travel while allowing essential crossings to continue unimpeded.""

Freeland's office wasn’t alone in pushing back against the call. Higgins posted the open letter in full on his Twitter page and he was swiftly met with backlash on the social media platform.

One comment, which had three times as many likes as Higgins' original post, slammed the call.

""No thank you...clean up your backyard before you attempt to enter ours..sincerely Canada,"" wrote a user who goes by the name @MichelletypoQ.

Another user, @rachelinTO, wrote that ""most of our earliest cases came from the U.S. So...... that's a firm 'no'. Sorry, eh.""

Other users called the request ""disastrous"" and multiple accounts said they’d only be comfortable easing restrictions after seeing improvement in the number of COVID-19 cases in the U.S.

The United States reached a macabre milestone at the end of June when it became home to the world’s highest number of reported infections: more than 2.2 million. It also has the highest death toll in the world, with 120,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.

Shortly after the news broke about the soaring cases in the United States, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the government was considering next steps for the looming deadline of the current border closure.

Speaking in a press conference on June 29, with just over three weeks until the agreement expires, he said the government will continue to assess the situation at our shared border.

""We have extended the border measures with the United States until July 21. We will continue to assess the situation and work with the Americans on what steps need to be taken into the month of August,"" Trudeau said.

And as COVID-19 continues to affect countries around the world, Trudeau said the health of Canadians remains the top priority when considering the loosening of any border restrictions.

""We are going to be very, very careful about when and how we start reopening international borders,"" Trudeau said.",[]

Sarah Campbell and Jacob Taylor were planning to get married in June, but had to postpone their wedding after COVID-19 hit and travel restrictions forced him to remain in the U.K.

""We realized we weren't able to have our wedding here in Canada. I'm planning to move to the U.K. after we get married anyways so my first thought after that was, 'Well I'll just get on a plane and go because the U.K.'s borders have stayed open this whole time',"" Campbell explained to CTVNews.ca in a phone interview on Thursday.

Campbell said that was the couple's plan until she was diagnosed with thyroid cancer last week.

""You have all of this with COVID going on and postponing my wedding indefinitely and then all the health issues, but also, he can't come here and be with me,"" Campbell said.

""It's heartbreaking. I've had days where I have just fallen apart.""

Despite her diagnosis, Campbell said Taylor is still not allowed to enter Canada.

On March 17, Canada announced it was shutting the border to international travellers in an effort to prevent further spread of the novel coronavirus. The Canada-U.S. border was also later closed on March 21 to all non-essential or ""discretionary"" travel. These travel restrictions currently remain in place.

""You can talk and talk and talk, but at some point, you really just need to hug. You just need them to be there and he can't. It's this sense of complete helplessness and like no one is listening to us,"" Campbell said.

Campbell, who lives in Stratford, Ont. and has dual Canadian-British citizenship, was set up with Taylor last June by their parents, who have been friends for years. After months of long-distance dating, Taylor proposed to her in February at Toronto's Pearson International Airport.

""It was like the best moment of my life the day I got to see him again. He just dropped to one knee right then and there and said, 'I can't wait anymore',"" Campbell said.

Later that Month, Taylor returned to the U.K. and the couple has now been separated for five months. Campbell said she does not know when she will see him next.

""I fully expect the border closures to continue to be extended. So how long is it going to be? Six, seven, eight, nine months, a year? Do I have to go through all this treatment without him? It’s so preposterous,"" Campbell said.

While Britain has kept its borders open to non-essential visitors from Canada, the 25-year-old said she cannot travel due to her medical condition as the United Kingdom National Health Service has suspended all cancer treatments amid the pandemic.

Campbell said she has various treatments to remove her entire thyroid scheduled until November and won’t be able to leave the country before then.

""We should have been married by this point. He's not coming here just to kind of be a tourist and just visit with me, we're supposed to be husband and wife already,"" Campbell said.

As of June 9, immediate family members of citizens or permanent residents who are foreign nationals can enter Canada to be reunited, under a new limited exemption to the current border restrictions.

Eligible immediate family members will be spouses, common-law partners, dependent children and their children, parents, and legal guardians. In order to be allowed in, the family members must have a plan to stay in Canada for at least 15 days, and they will have to self-quarantine for 14 days as soon as they enter the country.

However, fiancés are not included as eligible family members.

""I really want to make it clear that we don't want the borders to open, that's not what we want at all. I think everyone can see how bad things are right now,"" Campbell said. ""But we just want Prime Minister Trudeau to include fiancés and long-term partners in his definition of family because there's people who are being left out.""

""It's just a very, very narrow definition of family.""

It is ultimately up to individual Canada Border Service Agency (CBSA) officers to have the final say on whether a traveller's reason for crossing the border should be permitted.

Campbell said she hopes the CBSA will make an exemption for Taylor. However, she has sent multiple emails to the agency, the London High Commission and her locals MP's, all of which have said there is nothing they can do to help.

In a statement emailed to CTVNews.ca on Thursday, the CBSA said it understands the challenges the COVID-19 pandemic has put on families and that it has been looking at ways to ""support family unity while respecting measured public health controls.""

""We recognize that these are difficult situations for some, however these are unprecedented times, and the measures imposed were done so in light of potential public health risks and to help reduce and manage the number of foreign travel-related cases of COVID-19,"" CBSA senior spokesperson Rebecca Purdy said in the email.

Campbell said she is frustrated that NHL and MLB players will be granted exceptions but fiancés will not.

""The fact that the NHL players can come and go -- they may be confined to a specific hotel and have minimal contact with people and be tested -- but if we're doing that for hockey, why can't we do that for fiancés?"" Campbell said.

""That means that Canada values hockey above family.""

Campbell understands the public health risks with letting foreign nationals into Canada but said Taylor would follow all health guidelines including self-isolating for 14 days and get tested for the virus.

Campbell said she ""cannot face cancer"" without Taylor by her side and remains hopeful that he will somehow be allowed into Canada.

""We hope that the government will not change the border, but just its definition of family,"" Campbell said. ""We just want to be able to be together while we're working through this really difficult time.""",[]

The Department of Health says the man in his 50s lives in the Eastern Health region and had recently returned from the United States.

The department says the man self-isolated when he returned to the province and he did not travel through other Atlantic provinces.

It's the first case of COVID-19 confirmed in the province since May 28, bringing the provincial total to 262.

Three people have died from the illness in Newfoundland and Labrador, and 258 people have recovered.

There have now been 16 patients who have tested positive and 16 staff members. A total of six people have died from COVID-19 in connection with the outbreak at the hospital.

Admissions at the hospital are still closed, and day procedures and visitors are still being postponed or rescheduled at other hospitals.

Anyone who needs emergency care is urged to visit another hospital or to call 911 if needed.

Expectant mothers will be moved to the Grey Nuns Community Hospital to deliver.

Hospital staff is continuing to follow cleaning protocols to minimize the risk of spreading.

Also on Thursday, the province confirmed 37 new cases of COVID-19 across Alberta. The number of active cases fell by 24 to 584 while the number of recoveries grew by 58 to 7,774.

A total of 161 Albertans have now died due to COVID-19.

On Wednesday, officials confirmed that cases connected to the Misericordia hospital had risen to 35: 20 patients and 15 staff members.

As a result, the facility stopped taking new patient admissions.

Lucita Sanoma lost her two-month-old baby to suspected coronavirus on May 25. The boy was buried, without her knowledge, 300 kilometres (185 miles) from her village.

The infant died in hospital in Boa Vista, capital of the northwestern state of Roraima.

The burial followed government health guidelines that run counter to Yanomami culture, which dictates that the deceased must be cremated.

The authorities ""have to understand and respect the cultural issue,"" indigenous leader Mauricio Yekuana told AFP, outraged at the suffering of the young mother and three other women with similar experiences.

As part of the Yanomami's funerary rites, the remains are displayed in the forest before they are cremated. The ashes are collected in an urn to be buried in a new ceremony much later.

""I want to bring my son's body back to the village, we must mourn him together,"" Lucita Sanoma told AFP through an interpreter.

Her long black hair falling over her shoulders, the young woman wiped away tears as she described her distress in her own language.

""I went straight to the hospital with my son...The last word I received is that he died. I never saw him again,"" she said in a soft, rhythmic voice.

Not being able to mourn in her community, according to her ancestral rites, ""is a lack of respect, which has a strong psychological effect on the mother,"" said Junios Yanomami, president of the Yanomami Indigenous Health Council.

After her ordeal, Lucita Sanoma returned to her village in the region of Auaris, in Brazil's northwest.

But her son's body remains in an unmarked grave in a Boa Vista cemetery, until the authorities decide if she can bring him home to grieve with her relatives.

DISREGARD FOR INDIGENOUS CULTURE

Mauricio Yekuana said such situations are the result of health policies that disregard the indigenous perspective.

""The government just wants to impose its view of things on the indigenous people and force them to listen to what it wants to do,"" he told AFP. ""It uses them for propaganda.""

An online appeal for donations has been started by the Uniao Amazonia Viva collective to buy medical equipment, including respirators, to avoid sick people having to travel to the city.

In the meantime, the villagers are trying as best they can to respect social distancing measures and wear protective masks.

But their task has been made even more difficult by far-right President Jair Bolsonaro. On Wednesday, he watered down a law that would force the government to provide indigenous people with access to health care and clean drinking water.

Of the nearly 8,000 cases of COVID-19 the government has registered in indigenous communities, 186 are from the Yanomami, four of whom died. Most were infected in the city.

Although there are no confirmed cases in Auaris, home to some 4,000 Yanomami and Yekuana people, the concern is palpable.

'WE ARE AFRAID'

Many locals wear masks and gloves, and the word ""coronavirus"" has entered the vocabulary.

""We are afraid,"" said Paulo, a community leader who wears a mask, a T-shirt and shorts and uses an arrow as a cane. He says that many went into the jungle to escape the virus.

Last week, the army distributed medicines and protective equipment to the indigenous people in the Auaris region.

""Nobody dares threaten our Amazon,"" reads a sign at the entrance to the military base where rapid COVID-19 tests are being carried out.

Nearby, youngsters play football in a field, oblivious to a sudden, soaking downpour.

The government minister for indigenous health, Robson da Silva, says the main reason indigenous people contracted the virus was due to their constant movement.

But the Yanomami, who measure distances in terms of the time it takes to walk somewhere, say the danger to them has come from outside, especially from illegal gold miners who make regular incursions into their 96,000 square kilometrE (37,000 square mile) territory.

""Without that, we'd be safe,"" says Mauricio Yekuana, whose white mask contrasts sharply with the black genipap-based paint that lines his face.",[]

An animal health expert and an epidemiologist will meet Chinese counterparts in Beijing to set the ""scope and terms of reference"" for a WHO-led international mission aimed at learning how the virus jumped from animals to humans, a WHO statement said.

Scientists believe the virus may have originated in bats and was transmitted to another mammal such as a civet cat or an armadillo-like pangolin before being passed on to people.

A cluster of infections late last year focused initial attention on a fresh food market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, but the discovery of earlier cases suggests the animal-to-human jump may have happened elsewhere.

In an effort to block future outbreaks, China has cracked down on the trade in wildlife and closed some markets, while enforcing strict containment measures that appear to have virtually stopped new local infections.

The WHO mission is politically sensitive, with the U.S. -- the top funder of the UN body -- moving to cut ties with it over allegations it mishandled the outbreak and is biased toward China.

""China took the lead in inviting WHO experts to investigate and discuss scientific virus tracing,"" Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said Friday.

In contrast, he said, the U.S. ""not only announced its withdrawal from the World Health Organization, but also politicized the anti-epidemic issue and played a buck-passing game to shift responsibilities.""

More than 120 nations called for an investigation into the origins of the virus at the World Health Assembly in May. China has insisted that WHO lead the investigation and for it to wait until the pandemic is brought under control. The U.S., Brazil and India are continuing to see an increasing number of cases.

The last WHO coronavirus-specific mission to China was in February, after which the team's leader, Canadian doctor Bruce Aylward, praised China's containment efforts and information sharing. Canadian and American officials have since criticized him as being too lenient on China.

An Associated Press investigation showed that in January, WHO officials were privately frustrated over the lack of transparency and access in China, according to internal audio recordings. Their complaints included that China delayed releasing the genetic map, or genome, of the virus for more than a week after three different government labs had fully decoded the information.

Privately, top WHO leaders complained in meetings in the week of Jan. 6 that China was not sharing enough data to assess how effectively the virus spread between people or what risk it posed to the rest of the world, costing valuable time.",[]

India's fragile health system was bolstered during a stringent monthslong lockdown but could still be overwhelmed by an exponential rise in infections.

Here is where India stands in its battle against the virus:

STEADY CLIMB, MULTIPLE PEAKS

India has tallied 793,802 infections and more than 21,600 deaths, with cases doubling every three weeks. It's testing more than 250,000 samples daily after months of sluggishness, but experts say this is insufficient for a country of nearly 1.4 billion people.

""This whole thing about the `peak' is a false bogey because we won't have one peak in India, but a series of peaks,"" said Dr. Anant Bhan, a bioethics and global health researcher. He pointed out that the capital of New Delhi and India's financial capital, Mumbai, had already seen surges, while infections had now begun spreading to smaller cities as governments eased restrictions. The actual toll would be unknown, he said, unless India made testing more accessible.

DUBIOUS DATA

The Health Ministry said Thursday that India was doing ""relatively well"" managing COVID-19, pointing to 13 deaths per 1 million people, compared to about 400 in the United States and 320 in Brazil. But knowing the actual toll in India is ""absolutely impossible"" because there is no reporting mechanism in most places for any kind of death, said Dr. Jayaprakash Muliyil, an epidemiologist at the Christian Medical College in Vellore who has been advising the government.

Official data shows 43% of the people who have died from the coronavirus were between the ages of 30 and 60, but research globally indicates that the disease is particularly fatal to the elderly, suggesting to Muliyil that many virus deaths among older Indians ""don't get picked up"" or counted in the virus fatality numbers.

""NO CENTRAL Co-ordinatION""

In India, public health is managed at a state level, and some have managed better than others. The southern state of Kerala, where India's first three virus cases were reported, has been held up as a model. It isolated patients early, traced and quarantined contacts and tested aggressively. By contrast, Delhi, the state that includes the national capital, has been sharply criticized for failing to anticipate a surge of cases in recent weeks as lockdown measures eased. Patients have died after being turned away from COVID-designated hospitals that said they were at capacity. It led the Home Ministry to intervene and allocate 500 railway cars as makeshift hospital wards.

But as the capital rushes to conjure new beds, officials admit that they're worried about the lack of trained and experienced health care workers. According to Jishnu Das, a professor of economics at Georgetown University, there is ""no central co-ordination"" to move health care staff from one state to another, exposing India's relative inability to use data to guide policy decisions.

""The one big thing that we're learning from this pandemic is it takes any cracks in our systems and it drives a chisel to them. So, it's no longer a crack, it's a huge chasm,"" Das said.

INDIA'S ROLE IN GLOBAL FIGHT

India has seven vaccines in various stages of clinical trial, including one by Bharat Biotech that the Indian Council on Medical Research pledged would have results from human trials by Aug. 15, the country's Independence Day. The top medical research body quickly backtracked, but regardless of whether India comes out on top in the global race for a vaccine, the country will play a critical role in the world's inoculation against COVID-19.

The Serum Institute of India in the central Indian city of Pune is the world's largest vaccine manufacturer. India makes about 1,000 ventilators and 600,000 personal protective equipment kits per day, according to government think-tank Niti Aayog, making it the second largest kit maker in the world after China.

THE ECONOMIC CURVE

Although Indian airspace remains closed to commercial airlines from abroad, India's economy has largely reopened. Consumer activity has rebounded to pre-pandemic levels, government data showed, and factory workers who fled cities when India imposed its lockdown March 24 have begun to return, enticed, in some cases, by employers offering free room and board.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has used the health crisis along with a military standoff with China over a disputed border region to rally the country around the idea of a ""self-reliant India"" whose home-grown industries will emerge stronger. Approval ratings that U.S. pollster Morning Consult estimate at 82% suggest many Indians are with him, even after the hasty lockdown triggered a humanitarian crisis, with thousands of migrant workers fleeing on foot toward their natal villages, and as two top government scientists on the front lines of the coronavirus fight stepped down in recent weeks. With the coronavirus nowhere near abating in India, how Modi will fare as the toll of infections and deaths continues to rise is still unclear.",[]
88,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/defund-the-police-this-is-how-much-canadian-cities-spend-1.5018506,Defund the police? Here's a look at how much Canadian cities spend on policing,[],2020-07-10 07:30:00-04:00,"TORONTO -- An analysis by CTVNews.ca of 18 of Canada’s largest cities, regions and provincial capitals found more than half allocated 15 per cent or more of their 2020 operating budget to policing, with cities in Western Canada budgeting 20 per cent or more.

Coast-to-coast, from Vancouver to Charlottetown, P.E.I., Canadian cities are spending 15 to 20 per cent or more of their budget on law enforcement, the bulk of it coming from municipal taxes. Cities that do not have a municipal force were excluded from the analysis.

Cries to defund the police have rung out in protests across the United States, sparked by the death of George Floyd, seen in a video pleading and gasping for air as a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee against his neck -- long after he had already gone silent.

Around the world and in Canada, cities are also facing public pressure to reduce their law enforcement budgets to reallocate funds to other areas including mental health and community social support services.

It is a contentious issue, however. Ontario Premier Doug Ford has already dismissed the idea for the Ontario Provincial Police, saying he believes in strengthening policing through better community involvement.

In recent months, several deaths that followed “wellness checks” by Canadian police have sparked further discussion over whether police officers are properly trained or even the appropriate authority to deal with someone having a mental health crisis, in particular those who are Black, Indigenous, or a person of colour.

In June, 62-year-old Ejaz Choudry was killed in his home by police in Mississauga, Ont., after the family said it called a non-emergency helpline because he was having a mental health episode. Paramedics who arrived called the police after Choudry was seen with a knife in his hand. Earlier in the month, Chantel Moore, an Indigenous woman, was shot and killed by police in New Brunswick during another wellness check, while Regis Korchinski-Paquet, a Black, Indigenous woman, fell from her apartment balcony in Toronto last month while police officers were in her home.

BIGGEST POLICE BUDGET IN CANADA

At the end of June, Toronto city council rejected a 10 per cent cut to the police budget, about $107 million, and instead passed a motion on police reform that includes implementing body cameras and overhauling the way Canada’s largest municipal police force responds to people in crisis.

A 10 per cent reduction would have meant cutting about 1,000 police officers, according to the Canadian Press, a move that could take years to implement due to collective bargaining agreements with the union.

The Toronto Police Service operating budget for 2020 is $1.22 billion, about 9 per cent of the city’s $13.53 billion operational budget for 2020. More than $3 billion is distributed for various social support and development programs including employment, social assistance, child-care, long-term care services, helping under-resourced neighbourhoods, housing and shelter support.

In early June, the Vancouver Police Board rejected a motion by city council calling for a 1 per cent cut to the police’s $339 million budget, about 21 per cent of the city’s $1.62 billion operating budget for 2020.

Meanwhile, Edmonton city council approved a motion in early July that included cutting the police service’s budget by $11 million over the next two years amid weeks of debate around police reform.

South of the border, the city of Los Angeles voted on July 1 to cut police department hiring, slashing the LAPD’s budget by US$150 million. The cut brings the department’s staffing down to its lowest level in 12 years, the Los Angeles Times reported. The city said the money would eventually be reallocated into services like hiring programs and summer youth jobs for Black, Latino and other marginalized communities.

BIGGEST LINE ITEM ON THE BUDGET

For cities in Western Canada including Victoria, Vancouver, Saskatoon, Regina, Winnipeg, policing accounts for at least 20 per cent of their 2020 operating budgets. Among them, all but Vancouver have policing as the city’s biggest expenditure. (Utilities is listed as Vancouver’s biggest operating expenditure in its 2020 budget, though annual financial reports show that police is the city’s biggest expense.)

In Victoria, the police force accounts for roughly 23 per cent of the city’s total operating expenses for 2020. For Vancouver, Saskatoon and Regina, it’s just over 20 per cent. Edmonton and Calgary are the exceptions.

The Winnipeg Police Service is getting $304.1 million this year, or 26.6 per cent of the city’s $1.14 billion tax-supported operating expenditures. It is the largest percentage among the cities examined by CTVNews.ca. By comparison, community services in Winnipeg are getting $115 million, or 10 per cent of the budget.

As in many other cities, a petition has been circulating calling for change and defunding the Winnipeg police. Chief Danny Smyth said in June that it was too early to “just say defund the police and forward that all to social services” but added there was room for conversation on what such a move could look like.

Even places with modest budgets, like Charlottetown, P.E.I., which has a budget of $59.7 million, allocates more than 16 per cent to police. In Fredericton, N.B., more than 14 per cent of its $124.4 million budget (including capital expenditures) goes to policing. That portion is more than 18 per cent if capital expenditures are excluded.

In larger southern Ontario, Toronto-area cities and regions including Hamilton, Waterloo, Peel, and York, hundreds of millions of dollars are spent each year on policing. Peel and York, which have similar operating budgets of approximately $2.5 billion, spend about $445.8 million and $384.2 million, respectively, or 17 and 16 per cent. The Waterloo Regional Police, which also serves Kitchener, Ont., accounts for just over 17 per cent of the region’s operating budget. Hamilton’s police budget accounts for nearly 19 per cent of the city’s net operating budget. (That portion is halved however, if calculated based on the tax and rate supported gross operating expenditure).

Nearly all cities that spend roughly 10 per cent or less on policing have operating budgets of at least $1 billion. These include Toronto, Calgary, Ottawa, Quebec City, Montreal and Halifax, which has a budget just shy of a billion.

According to Statistics Canada data, the average salary among municipal police officers was $100,962 for 2017/2018, the latest year in which data is available. And while police spending has increased, the number of police officers per 100,000 people has been shrinking, the data showed.

In the United States, data varies depending on the source, but the percentage allocated to police departments for the 10 largest cities in the country ranged from 6 per cent to 17.4 per cent based on an analysis by U.S. News & World Report. Data compiled by the Center for Popular Democracy, a progressive advocacy group, which includes other cities, showed that percentage ranged as high as 20 to 45 per cent, with such cities as Minneapolis accounting for more than 35 per cent and Milwaukee making up nearly 48 per cent.

One important caveat to note is that cities are all structured differently and may report their finances or categorize their spending differently as well, so a true apples-to-apples comparison is extremely difficult. A few cities include utilities as part of its operating expenses, for example, while many do not.The Canadian police data in this analysis was collected and calculated based on figures presented in 2020 budget proposals and reports released by each city and region. As much as possible, comparable figures were used. In general, total operating budget or expenditure budget excluding capital expenditures as presented in the budget reports were used. In some cases, for example, figures provided may be net of recoveries and/or transfers, terms for certain types of financial transactions in accounting.

The incident was posted on Twitter and shows a woman walking by a lone man while describing him on the phone to a 911 operator.

The man who posted the video said it was taken by his brother, 21-year-old Ntwali Bashizi, and said the woman called police because his brother wasn't two metres away from her while they crossed a bridge.

""I do believe it was racialized - there was no reason to stop me,"" Bashizi told CTV News on Friday. ""Even if I got off the bridge, we would have been the same distance.""

In the video, the woman turns the call on to speakerphone and the operator talks directly to the Bashizi to tell him he's intimidating the woman.

“Sir... do we really need to send a police officer just for you let this girl by?"" the operator asks.

""I'm not stopping her from coming by,"" Bashizi said before being interrupted.

""You're intimidating her, sir, okay, can you just stand to the side,"" the operator says, as he replies that he's already standing to the side.

Bashizi remains at a distance from the woman throughout the video and she eventually walks away while still on the phone.

He said he started recording the interaction when the woman started taking photos of him with her phone. His full video of the entire interaction is about nine minutes long, he said.

""How do I sound intimidating?"" he told CTV News Ottawa. ""I'm not doing anything. She approached me. She actually could have left me alone and I wouldn't have said anything to her.""

Ottawa Police say they are fully reviewing the incident and have offered Bashizi a full apology.

""At this point it is clear that this was not an appropriate use of the 911 system and the Service did not act appropriately in handling the call,"" police said on Twitter.

CTV News has not been able to identify the woman in the video.

The man's lawyer, Michael Spratt, told Newstalk 580 CFRA that the incident is an example of ""the weaponization of 911.""

""This is exactly the type of situation that can lead to dangerous and deadly encounters with the police that disproportionately impact racialized individuals and Black men,"" he said.

Ottawa Police Acting Deputy Chief Mark Ford said the incident was a misuse of the 911 system. He said the woman mentioned the man's race twice on the phone call. The police force is reviewing whether it should have sent officers to the scene, he said.

“We’ve got to make sure that we fully understand and appreciate both sides of the story when we’re delaing with a dispute like this,"" Ford told Newstalk 580 CFRA. Police are planning to speak with all parties, he added.

Police said no charges have been applied related to the incident at this time. Ford said it's premature to ask whether the 911 operator will be disciplined.

The incident comes months after a video in New York's Central Park showed a white woman calling police after a Black man requested she leash her dog.

In that video, she told the man that she'd call police and tell them he was threatening her.

She then called police and told the operator that the man was threatening as he stood at a distance from her.

The woman, who was since identified as Amy Cooper, has been charged with filing a false police report and was fired from her job over the May incident.

Cooper has since apologized and said she reacted emotionally and made false assumptions about the man's intentions.

The incident occurred at a T&T Supermarket on July 5 and was captured on video and posted to YouTube, where it has been watched more than 380,000 times.

In the nearly four-minute long video, a man and a woman who are not wearing masks are seen in the aisle of a store surrounded by staff. The man then appears to go on a rant about how masks make people ill and he shouldn’t have to wear one.

At one point, the man yells at an Asian man, saying “go back to China where you came from and take your coronavirus back to Wuhan.""

Experts have been saying for months that masks or face coverings protect individuals from spreading micro droplets and can help curb the spread of COVID-19, a disease that has infected more than 36,000 people in Ontario and killed more than 2,700.

It is now mandatory to wear masks inside public places across most of the Greater Toronto Area.

A spokesperson for T&T told CTV News Toronto that the man in the video was arguing with another customer and store colleagues for several minutes prior to what was seen on the video.

“When politely asked to wear a mask, which is store policy, the man initially refused because he said it was ineffective. He then became irate and aggressive, claiming to have allergies and then proceeded to claim he and his friend both had asthma,” T&T spokesperson Tina Lee said in a statement.

“Due to the customer’s behaviour, we stand by the store manager’s decision to ask the customer to leave.”

The store noted that the man’s accusations were unacceptable, and that they have a number of protocols set in place for customers with medical conditions who may not be able to wear masks for health reasons.

Video of racist rant is ‘hard to watch,’ prime minister says

The incident has since garnered the attention of numerous politicians as well as Peel Regional Police, who say that once they saw the video they sent an officer to the supermarket to “proactively take a report.”

Police are now investigating the incident as hate-motivated and have identified a suspect. They are urging him to seek counsel and turn himself in.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau posted on Twitter Friday that the video of the racist rant is “hard to watch.” He went on to thank the employees who “took a stand against ignorance and hatred.”

“We all have a responsibility to call out racism and discrimination - so call it out whenever and wherever you see it,” Trudeau said.

New Democratic Party Leader Jagmeet Singh also commented on the incident, calling for an end to hateful speech.

“We have a collective responsibility to deny any space to this type of hateful, divisive and racist speech,” he said. “And let’s be clear, the consensus of health-care experts is that wearing a mask helps prevent the spread of COVID-19. Wear a mask and don’t be a racist.”",[]

Service New Brunswick Centres to Reopen Monday

On Friday, the province announced Service New Brunswick centres will reopen on Monday and operate at regular hours – but the typical customer experience has yet to return.

""We are recommending that residents wait a few more days before visiting a service centre in person or do their business online or through Teleservices if they are able,"" said Service New Brunswick Minister Sherry Wilson in a statement on Friday.

Wait times at service centres could dramatically increase. The province says wait times at Service New Brunswick have traditionally averaged just under 15 minutes – compared to the North American average of 44 minutes. However, due to the increased demand, lines and wait times are expected to be much longer.

Customers who must visit a service centre in person are reminded to keep two metres of physical distance from others and have a mask with them if physical distancing cannot be maintained. The number of people allowed to wait inside air-conditioned waiting rooms will be limited in accordance with Public Health guidelines.

Anyone with a pre-booked appointment for a road or written driver’s test should identify themselves to the commissionaire.

Many of Service New Brunswick’s services can be conducted online or by calling Teleservices at 1-888-762-8600, including renewing a driver’s licence, registering a vehicle or booking a driving test. The renewal of all licences, registrations, certificates and permits has been extended to July 31, 2020, unless suspended by a court or by other authority

95,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/mueller-defends-russia-probe-says-stone-remains-a-felon-1.5020696,"Mueller defends Russia probe, says Stone remains a felon",['Eric Tucker'],2020-07-11 19:22:00-04:00,"WASHINGTON -- Former special counsel Robert Mueller sharply defended his investigation into ties between Russia and Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, writing in a newspaper opinion piece Saturday that the probe was of “paramount importance” and asserting that a Trump ally, Roger Stone, “remains a convicted felon, and rightly so” despite the president's decision to commute his prison sentence.

The op-ed in The Washington Post marked Mueller's first public statement on his investigation since his congressional appearance last July. It represented his firmest defence of the two-year probe whose results have come under attack and even been partially undone by the Trump administration, including the president's extraordinary move Friday evening to grant clemency to Stone just days before he was due to report to prison.

Mueller said that though he had intended for his 448-page report on the investigation to speak for itself, he felt compelled to “respond both to broad claims that our investigation was illegitimate and our motives were improper, and to specific claims that Roger Stone was a victim of our office.

“The Russia investigation was of paramount importance. Stone was prosecuted and convicted because he committed federal crimes. He remains a convicted felon, and rightly so,” Mueller wrote.

Mueller did not specify who was making the claims, but it appeared to be an obvious reference to Trump, who as recently as Saturday derided the investigation as this “whole political witch hunt and the Mueller scam.”

The mere publication of the op-ed was striking in itself for a former FBI director who was tight-lipped during the investigation, refusing to respond to attacks by the president or his allies or to even make public appearances explaining or justifying his work. In his first public statement after the conclusion of his investigation, Mueller had said that he had hoped his report would speak for itself. When he later testified to House lawmakers, he was similarly careful not to stray beyond the report's findings or offer new evidence.

But that buttoned-up approach created a void for others, including at the Justice Department, to place their own stamp on his work. Even before the report was released Attorney General William Barr issued a four-page summary document that Mueller privately complained did not adequately capture the gravity of his team's findings.

In the months since, Barr assigned a U.S. attorney to investigate the origins of the Russia probe, and the Justice Department moved to dismiss the criminal case against former Trump administration national security adviser Michael Flynn even though Flynn had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about contacts with the Russian ambassador during the presidential transition period.

The op-ed traced the basis for the Stone prosecution, with Mueller recounting how Stone had not only tampered with a witness but also lied repeatedly about his efforts to gain inside information about Democratic emails that Russian intelligence operatives stole and provided to WikiLeaks, which published them in the run-up to the election.

Those efforts, including his discussions with Trump campaign associates about them, cut to the heart of Mueller's mandate to determine whether anyone tied to the campaign co-ordinated with Russia in the hacking or disclosure of the stolen Democratic emails.

Stone was particularly critical to the investigation, Mueller writes, because he claimed inside knowledge about WikiLeaks' release of the stolen emails and because he communicated during the campaign with people known to be Russian intelligence officers. He also communicated with members of the Trump campaign about the timing of the WikiLeaks releases, something that he denied.

“We did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian government in its activities,” Mueller wrote. “The investigation did, however, establish that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome. It also established that the campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts.”

Stone was found guilty last fall of witness tampering, false statements and obstructing a congressional investigation into Russian election interference. He was sentenced in February to 40 months in prison and was due to surrender on Tuesday, until the president commuted his sentence.

“Roger Stone was treated horribly. Roger Stone was treated very unfairly,” Trump told reporters on Saturday.

He was one of six former Trump associates or advisers to be convicted in the Russia investigation. In total, the investigation produced charges against 34 individuals, including 25 Russians accused either of hacking into Democratic email accounts of engaging in a covert social media campaign to divide American public opinion ahead of the election.",[]

Last week, the island nation’s prime minister, Mia Mottley, revealed that her government is looking at introducing a 12-month “Barbados Welcome Stamp.”

Mottley said the stamp would give visitors the opportunity to “come and work from here overseas, digitally so, so that persons don’t need to remain in the countries in which they are.”

According to the Barbados Government Information Service website, Mottley said the COVID-19 pandemic had made short-term travel more difficult because of requirements for testing for the virus.

As an alternative, the prime minister proposed the idea of travellers coming to Barbados for a lengthier stay, during which, they could continue to work remotely.

“You don’t need to work in Europe, or the U.S. or Latin America if you can come here and work for a couple months at a time; go back and come back,” Mottley said during a speech at the official reopening of a restaurant in the St. Lawrence Gap neighbourhood on July 1.

Even though Barbados is mulling over a one-year “welcome stamp” to visitors, the Canadian government still advises against all non-essential travel outside of Canada until further notice.

“The governments of those destinations that have opened their borders to tourists could impose strict travel restrictions suddenly, should they experience an increase in cases of COVID-19,” an advisory on the Canadian government’s website reads. “International transportation options could be reduced significantly, making it difficult for you to return to Canada.”

Barbados is set to reopen its borders to international travellers on Sunday, July 12.

According to the U.S. embassy in Barbados, the resumption of commercial flights will begin on July 12 with Air Canada, which will run flights to and from the island nation on Thursdays and Sundays.

British Airways, Jet Blue, Virgin Atlantic, and American Airlines will also operate flights to Barbados on dates after July 12.

There will be a number of new health protocols for visitors arriving to the airport in Barbados, including a PCR test for coronavirus, mandatory face mask use, and health screening. Travellers from high and moderate-risk countries, including Canada, will be monitored for the onset of symptoms for seven days.

Even before the borders reopen, Barbados has already started relaxing COVID-19 pandemic measures and lifting curfews.

On June 15, the government lifted restrictions on open hours for beaches and parks. On July 1, physical distancing requirements were reduced to a one-metre distance and all curfew restrictions were cancelled.

According to the U.S. embassy in Barbados and data compiled by John Hopkins University, the Caribbean country currently has 98 confirmed cases of COVID-19.",[]

Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom are reopening Saturday, while Epcot and Disney's Hollywood Studios will follow four days later.

“It's the chance to come back and be in the magic,” said Diane Watkins, a preschool teacher from Helena, Alabama, who visits the park about eight times a year. “Hot or not, mask or not, we're just happy to be here. I feel like everybody here is in the same frame of mind. Everybody is just so excited to be here.”

Watkins said that when she and her 16-year-old daughter walked into the Magic Kingdom on Saturday morning, then saw all the cast members lined up and clapping on Main Street, she cried.

“It was very emotional,” she said.

The reopening comes as a huge surge of Floridians have tested positive for the new coronavirus in recent weeks. On Saturday, there were about 10,000 new cases reported, according to state statistics. Many cities and counties around the state have recently reinstated restrictions that had been lifted in May, when cases seemed to drop.

All of Disney's Orlando parks closed in mid-March in an effort to stop the virus's spread. Universal Orlando and SeaWorld Orlando closed around the same time but reopened several weeks ago after instituting similar rules to protect employees and customers from the virus.

Lori Lovell of Evansville, Indiana, strolled around Frontierland on Saturday morning with friends.

“I have missed coming here. It just feels really good to be back. This is where I've made so many memories. It's kind of our second home. Not being able to come here was hard.”

Disney's new rules include mandatory masks and social distancing. Visitors will need reservations to enter a park, and they won't be allowed to hop between parks. Both visitors and employees will receive temperature checks when they enter. Fireworks shows and parades have been suspended to prevent drawing too many people together.

Park-goers say that nearly everyone in sight wore masks on Saturday morning. Capacity is nowhere near where it is under normal circumstances, they said.

“I've been here on spring breaks where you can barely walk around. The walkways are very wide open,” said Lovell.

There were lots of hand sanitizer stations around, and people were respecting the physical distancing cues and guidelines. Since the park is at lower capacity, there was only a five-minute wait for the popular Buzz Lightyear ride - normally it's about 90 minutes, Watkins said.

Some attractions and dining areas aren't yet open. Another change: visitors can't hug and greet the costumed Disney characters. Instead, the characters are in “cavalcades,” or motorcades, as they make their way through the park.

Disney has been opening its parks back up around the globe for the past two months. In May, the company opened Disney Springs, a complex of shops, restaurants and entertainment venues in Lake Buena Vista.

But the couple came together for a special Friday edition of her ""Red Table Talk"" show on Facebook to share their side of the controversy surrounding her relationship with singer August Alsina.

According to the superstar couple they ""were going through a very difficult time"" and had broken up when Pinkett Smith started a romantic relationship with the 27-year-old singer.

During their ""Red Table Talk"" chat Smith pushed his wife to be clear about what her relationship had been with Alsina.

""I got into an entanglement with August,"" Pinkett Smith said.

In a recent interview with radio host Angela Yee, Alsina said he had been involved in a romantic relationship with Pinkett Smith, who has been married to Smith since 1997.

""I actually sat down with Will and had a conversation,"" Alsina said during the interview. ""Due to the transformation from their marriage to (a) life partnership that they have spoken on several times, and not involving romanticism, he gave me his blessing.""

Alsina said he had lost money and relationships because of rumours he had been involved with Pinkett Smith, 48.

The actress and her 51-year-old husband have long been the subject of rumours that they have an open marriage.

The couple has denied this, but says their marriage is not traditional and that they have a ""life partnership.""

On Friday's episode the pair said they felt compelled to speak out because there was so much speculation after Alsina's interview.

""We specifically never said anything,"" Will Smith said. ""Coming to the table was like we just felt like it got to the point where you gotta say something.""

Pinkett Smith said she began a friendship with Alsina about four and a half years ago and that became more once she and her husband hit a rough patch.

She also said she wanted to clear up Alsina having said her husband had given permission for the affair, though she added that she understood why the young singer may have believed that to be the case.

""The only person that can give permission in that particular circumstance is myself,"" she said. ""I could actually see how he would perceive it as permission because we were separated amicably and I think he also wanted to make it clear that he's also not a homewrecker. Which he's not.""

The actress said she was ""in a lot of pain"" and ""broken"" during the relationship.

She and Will tried ""everything we could to get away from each other only to realize that wasn't possible.""

Pinkett Smith said her relationship with Alsina ended, the Smiths reconciled, and she said she has not spoken to the singer in years.

She said she and her husband have now gotten to a place of ""unconditional love.""

Smith said he had been unsure as to whether he would ever speak to Pinkett Smith again when they were having problems, but he reminded her of their commitment.

""I told you the first year we were married, that I could love you through anything,"" Will Smith said.

The couple bumped fists as they jokingly recited their rendition of his ""Bad Boys"" movie motto: ""We ride together, we die together. Bad marriage for life.""",[]

The combination of forced closures, decreased consumer spending and limited rent relief measures has left some retailers unable to maintain their existing operations.

Here is a look at some of the major retail closures announced in Canada in 2020, both before and during the pandemic.

Scholar’s Choice: The educational toys and teaching materials retailer announced on July 10 it was closing 13 stores across the country. Only three stores will remain open – London, Ont., Winnipeg and Moncton – and act as regional sales and distribution centres. Scholar’s Choice also filed for creditor protection through a notice of intention to propose a reorganization plan to restructure the company.

DavidsTea: The Montreal-based beverage retailer announced on July 9 that it was closing 82 of its locations in Canada and all 42 of its U.S. stores to focus more on its e-commerce business and supplying grocery stores and pharmacies. The company, which also filed for creditor protection, said it was closing shops that were unprofitable and that it hoped to negotiate more favourable lease terms for the 100 remaining locations in Canada. The company said COVID-19 pandemic had worsened an already challenging retail market.

Microsoft: The technology company revealed on June 26 that it would be closing nearly all of its 83 physical stores around the world as part of a “strategic change” for its retail business. Microsoft has seven stores in Canada, which will all be closing. Only four locations in London, New York City, Sydney, and Redmond, Wash. will remain as “reimagined” physical spaces.

GNC: Health and nutrition retailer GNC announced June 23 that it has filed for bankruptcy in the U.S. and says it will close at least 29 stores in Canada as part of its restructuring.

The Children's Place: Approximately 200 locations of child clothing store The Children's Place will close this year and 100 more next year in Canada and the U.S., company executives said June 11 on an earnings call.

Starbucks: Filings with U.S. regulators dated June 10 show that Starbucks plans to close 200 Canadian locations as part of a new two-year business plan.

Sail: Outdoor retailer Sail said June 4 that it will close four stores in Quebec and two in Ontario, leaving it with a total of 12 outlets remaining open in the two provinces.

Bestseller Canada: The company that operates Jack & Jones and Vero Moda filed for creditor protection June 2. Retail Insider reported in February that the Canadian subsidiary of the Danish company was shutting five of its Bestseller branded stores. It reported this month that sources indicated all nine Vero Moda locations would be closed and 13 of the 51 Jack and Jones stores would also close.

Thyme Maternity and Addition Elle: Financial woes at Reitmans left the company seeking creditor protection and announcing plans to close all stores under its Thyme Maternity and Addition Elle banners, as was announced June 1.

Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works: L Brands announced May 20 that it will close 13 of the 38 Victoria's Secret stores in Canada, as well as one Bath & Body Works location, as part of a larger restructuring that also affects the company's American operations.

Army & Navy: The 101-year-old Western Canadian department store chain announced in May that it was closing its doors permanently. CEO Jacqui Cohen cited the “unsurmountable” challenges caused by the pandemic. Touted as the country’s first discount department store, the company said it would be closing its five remaining locations in Vancouver, New Westminster, B.C., Langley, B.C., Calgary and Edmonton.

Henry’s: Cranbrook Glen Enterprises Ltd, the parent company of the Toronto-based camera and accessories chain, filed a NOI (Notice of Intention) in May. The company said it plans to close seven of its 29 store locations once COVID-19-related measures were loosened.

Aldo: Montreal-based The Aldo Group said May 7 that it was entering creditor protection. Although the footwear retailer said it will gradually reopen its stores as public health guidelines permit, legal filings reportedly state that an unspecified number of stores are not expected to ever reopen.

Ronsons: The Vancouver-based shoe retailer announced on April 8 that it was in receivership and closing its 18 stores, all of which are located in British Columbia. The company was founded 32 years ago by CEO Tony Aronson and his father.

Pier 1: Home decor chain Pier 1 announced Feb. 17 that it will close all of its stores in Canada, as the retailer began bankruptcy proceedings in the United States.

Carlton Cards and Papyrus: On Jan. 22, the owner of greeting card retailers including Carlton Cards and Papyrus announced it was closing all of its stores in North America, including 76 Canadian locations.

The league and NHL Players' Association announced Friday the return-to-play protocols - featuring Toronto and Edmonton as hub cities - and a four-year extension to the current collective bargaining agreement have been ratified.

The NHL board of governors and the union's full membership gave the documents, which were tied together in an all-or-nothing bundle, the thumbs up in separate votes.

“It was pretty civil,” Vancouver Canucks captain Bo Horvat said of negotiations on the deal that was tentatively agreed to Monday. “We're happy to get things going.”

Bringing the hubs to Canada, where coronavirus infection rates are largely under control, proved to be the logical choice after a significant spike in cases across the United States in recent weeks.

“While we have all worked very hard to try to address the risks of COVID-19, we know that health and safety are and will continue to be our priorities,” NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said in a statement. “We know that all of our fans are excited about our return to the ice.”

Training camps for the 24 teams primed to compete in the league's restart to a 2019-20 campaign that was suspended March 12 are scheduled to begin Monday - also the deadline for players to opt out of participating with no penalty - in each franchise's home market.

The plan will then see Eastern Conference clubs report to Toronto on July 26, while those from the Western Conference head to Edmonton before the games resume Aug. 1. The conference finals and Stanley Cup will be held in Edmonton as part of a first-of-its-kind NHL Final Four that could stretch all the way to Oct. 4 and result in next season being pushed into December or early January.

Once in Canada's largest city and Alberta's capital, players are set to be kept away from the general public in so-called “bubbles” that include strict health measures, daily testing, and mostly confine teams to hotels and empty arenas.

The extension of the current CBA, which was slated to expire in September 2022 and now runs through at least the 2025-26 season, provides both players and owners clarity on a number of challenging financial realities caused by COVID-19.

It also give the green light for negotiations with the International Olympic Committee and the International Ice Hockey Federation on participation at the 2022 and 2026 Winter Games. The NHL skipped the 2018 Olympics after taking part in five straight between 1998 and 2014.

The salary cap's upper limit will remain at US$81.5 million in 2020-21 and stay there until hockey-related revenue returns to $4.8 billion - this season's projected total prior to the pandemic. Players have agreed to defer 10 per cent of next year's salaries, and have owners pay that back over three consecutive seasons starting in 2022-23.

“This agreement is a meaningful step forward for the players and owners, and for our game, in a difficult and uncertain time,” NHLPA executive director Don Fehr said. “We are pleased to be able to bring NHL hockey back.”

Escrow payments, a consistent thorn in the side of players that guarantees a 50/50 split of HRR with owners, will be capped at 20 per cent in 2020-21, and decrease throughout the deal. If teams are still owed money following the 2025-26 campaign, the CBA will be extended another season.

The agreement marks the first time in Bettman's 27-year tenure as commissioner the NHL has bridged two CBAs without a work stoppage. Both the 1994-95 and 2012-13 seasons were cut to 48 games because of lockouts, while the 2004-05 campaign was cancelled.

Alberta Premier Jason Kenney was the most outspoken politician with regards to having his province host one of the hubs, pointing to a low infection rate and Edmonton's facilities.

He also penned a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in hopes of securing a waiver for the NHL when it came to Canada's mandatory 14-day quarantine for anyone arriving in the country. The federal government approved the league's proposal of a cohort quarantine last month, granting an exception that paved the way for Toronto and Edmonton to get the nod as hubs.

Speaking outside Rogers Place, Kenney said Friday's news will create jobs and millions of dollars in economic activity.

“The Stanley Cup is coming back to Edmonton, to Alberta,” Kenney said in a video posted to Twitter as he stood next to a statue of Wayne Gretzky. “We are going to get an unbelievable amount of free advertising across North America and around the world that will set us up well for the future relaunch of our tourism industry when travel comes back post-COVID.”

The Cup was last awarded in Edmonton when Gretzky hoisted it over his head for a fourth and final time on May 26, 1988.

Each team will be permitted to bring a maximum of 52 people into the bubbles, including a maximum of 31 players.

Meanwhile, it was also announced the NHL draft lottery's second phase has been tabbed for Aug. 10. The eight losing teams from the qualifying round will have an equal shot at the first pick in the draft, which is tentatively scheduled for Oct. 9-10.

Much like Kenney, Ontario Premier Doug Ford and Toronto Mayor John Tory supported their city's hub potential.

“There is no better place for the NHL season to continue,” Tory said. “We will make sure we put on a great show for the game of hockey ... while following all proper health and safety protocols.”

Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist at Toronto General Hospital, said choosing to hold the NHL's restart in Canada reduces the overall risk, but it's far from a fool-proof endeavour.

“We'd be blind to think that there isn't COVID-19 in Canada, there's just significantly less of it here compared to parts of the U.S.,” he said. “Everyone has to pay close attention to COVID-19 because even with the best laid plans, there still can be small weaknesses that might be exploited by this virus.”

Vancouver was the other Canadian city originally in the running to host, along with seven American markets, before the provincial government expressed concerns about the NHL's health and safety protocols.

Ford was asked prior to Friday's announcement why the plan worked for his province when it didn't for British Columbia.

“They have very stringent rules and regulations for their players,” Ford said of the NHL. “When they told me (players are) getting tested every single day, I'm no medical professional, but I don't think they need testing every day.”

The 24-team format - which includes every Canadian franchise, save for Ottawa - will see the top-4 clubs from both the East and West play mini-tournaments to determine playoff seeding, while the other 16 will battle in a never-before-seen qualifying round.

Boston, Tampa Bay, Washington and Philadelphia are set to compete for the No. 1 slot in the East, while defending champions St. Louis, Colorado, Vegas and Dallas will do the same out West.

The East's best-of-five qualifying series include Pittsburgh vs. Montreal, Carolina vs. New York Rangers, New York Islanders vs. Florida and Toronto vs. Columbus. In the West, the matchups are Edmonton vs. Chicago, Nashville vs. Arizona, Vancouver vs. Minnesota and Calgary vs. Winnipeg.

In all, there will be as many as 52 games played over the first nine days before the teams get a break on Aug. 10.

The four winners of the best-of-five series in each conference will then be pitted against the top-4 seeds to fill out the usual 16-team playoff bracket.

There could, however, still be choppy waters before the 2019-20 season can actually resume.

Players won't be quarantined during training camp, but instead asked to practise physical distancing when not at the rink in hopes isolation and testing will be enough to avoid any outbreaks.

Of the 396 NHLers tested at team facilities between June 8 and Monday during voluntary workouts, 23 results came back positive. The league said it's also aware of 12 other positive tests for players not taking part in those optional sessions.

The Stanley Cup has been awarded every year since 1893, except for 1919 because of the Spanish flu outbreak and in 2005 when the lockout scratched the entire season.

There's now a firm plan in place to - hopefully - see it handed out this fall.

""We're presuming that an accident happened and we're presuming she drowned in the lake,"" Deputy Chris Dyer said at a news conference Thursday.

Search and rescue efforts for the actress have now shifted to a recovery operation, Dyer said.

""The goal is still to bring Miss Rivera home to her family,"" he said.

Rivera, 33, vanished from Lake Piru on Wednesday evening. She went to the lake that afternoon and rented a pontoon boat with her 4-year-old son, according to authorities.

Dyer said Thursday that the boat was overdue for return around 4 p.m. local time. A rental employee found the boat on the north end of Lake Piru.

Rivera's son was on the boat, but she was nowhere to be found, Dyer said. One life jacket was found on the boat and the boy was wearing another. Investigators found Rivera's purse and her identification, but no other clues on the boat.

Search efforts began immediately and continued until about 10 p.m. Wednesday. The search resumed Thursday morning and will continue until sunset and resume at daybreak if necessary, the sheriff's office said.

Video from the dock shows Rivera and her son as the only two people getting on the boat, Ventura County Sheriff's Sgt. Kevin Donoghue said at a separate news conference.

Detectives have spoken to Rivera's son and as a result of that conversation do not believe Rivera made it to shore, he said.

The boat was not anchored, and was not near the shore when found, the sheriff's office said. The area in which it was found is approximately 30 feet deep.

The lake has very low visibility with numerous plants and trees in the search area, making it unsafe for divers and a more complicated search, according to Donoghue.

""If the body is entangled in something beneath the water, it may never come back up,"" Donoghue said.

Another spokesman for the Ventura County Sheriff's Office, Capt. Eric Buschow, previously said that the child and his mother went swimming and that she did not get back on the boat.

The child is healthy and with family, Dyer said Thursday morning. CNN has reached out to Rivera's representatives for more details.

Rivera's son is ""doing as well as can be expected,"" according to Donoghue. ""Our hearts and our prayers and thoughts go out to the Rivera family. This is a terrible tragedy for all of them and we hope to bring closure for that family,"" he said.

The lake has been closed during the operation, which involves more than 100 people, Donoghue said.

Specialized dive teams from the nearby counties of Tulare, San Luis Obispo, and Los Angeles are also searching the lake. Others are using helicopters, boats and personal watercraft to look for clues.

Searchers are using sonar and other technology to assist in the recovery. For now, the search is focused on the north end of the lake.

""We don't think it would have traveled the whole distance of the lake,"" Donoghue said, explaining that they are looking where the boat was initially found and working their way outward from there.

""I think it's too early to say what happened here. We're still investigating and just still trying to find out what happened,"" he said, noting that Rivera had been to this lake before.

Rivera played Santana Lopez on the Fox show for six years from 2009, and appeared in nearly every episode of the musical-comedy-drama. She was also on the CBS sitcom ""The Royal Family"" and in the comedy film ""The Master of Disguise.""

Fellow celebrities, including her ""Glee"" co-star Harry Shum Jr., shared their concern on social media.

Actress Jackée Harry tweeted a scene she shared with Rivera on ""The Royal Family,"" which was Rivera's first acting job at the age of 4.

""Prayers up for the lovely Naya Rivera,"" Harry tweeted. ""We starred alongside one another in her first very television series, The Royal Family, and I've watched her career blossom ever since. Please God, don't cut this life short.""

Zack Teperman, who described himself as Rivera's former publicist, said he was shocked by the news of her disappearance.

""I still can't believe what I'm hearing and hoping it isn't true,"" he posted on social media. ""I'm just sad. Naya Rivera was one of the first people I had the honor of working with back in 2009 when I got into public relations and moved to Hollywood. One of the first people to allow me to give her advice and guide her through those crazy Glee days.""

Mostly anonymous allegations are being posted to an Instagram page that has garnered more than 49,000 followers and is focused on prominent Quebecers, including musicians, concert promoters and comedians. The page, which is less than a week old, contains more than 80 posts.

As of Friday, accounts with identical usernames (other than the city they represent) have surfaced across Quebec: they exist for Gatineau, Laval, Outaouais, Sherbrooke, Monteregie, Lanaudiere, Joliette, Saguenay, and the Laurentians, among other places.

The people running the Montreal account posted a message Friday saying that, overwhelmed with submissions, they were taking a hiatus, but planned to return after recruiting more people to help.

One of the biggest names to fall is David Desrosiers, bassist for Montreal rock band Simple Plan, who said Thursday he is leaving the group after he was anonymously accused on the social network of predatory behaviour against his female fans.

The accuser posted Wednesday that Desrosiers started making inappropriate ""jokes"" with her when she was a minor, and they had consensual sex after she came of age. She alleged he invited others for group sex without asking and threatened and demeaned her.

Desrosiers wrote on Instagram that allegations ""have led me to acknowledge that some of the interactions I have had with women have caused them harm."" In a statement on Instagram, Simple Plan also apologized to the women affected as well as fans who are disappointed by the ""regretful situation.""

Maripier Morin, a major TV personality in Quebec, has apologized publicly and La Presse reported she has put her career on pause after singer Safia Nolin posted to the Instagram page July 8 -- with a copy on her personal page as well -- accusations that Morin uttered racist statements in her presence and bit her on the thigh in 2018.

Nolin wrote that Morin made a derogatory comment after learning she was of Arab descent. Nolin said Morin also made racist comments about a Black bartender.

""After that, she bit me on the thigh so hard that I had an enormous bruise for two weeks,"" Nolin said.

According to multiple media reports, Morin apologized on her Instagram page, said she remembered the night in question and called her actions ""reprehensible"" without going into details. By Friday, however, Morin had removed the posts from her Instagram page, which is followed by almost 550,000 people.

Bell Media said Friday it has dropped all the shows it carried on its streaming networks featuring Morin.

Company spokesman Patrick Tremblay said in an email: ""We respect the decision by Maripier Morin to put her professional activities on pause. For that reason, we are pulling all the shows that feature her from our platforms Z, VRAK and Crave.""

Quebec singer-songwriter Bernard Adamus was dropped from his label following an anonymous post to the Instagram page accusing him of improprieties.

Adamus replied Thursday on his Instagram that he had been vulgar, arrogant and drunk too many times in his life, and he apologized to all the women he's hurt.

ADISQ, the association representing Quebec's music industry, issued a statement Friday saying that its board of directors has decided to exclude Adamus from nominations for its annual awards.

The Montreal police confirmed Friday the force ""is aware"" of the Instagram page and the accusations. ""However, in order to conduct an investigation, there needs to be an official complaint filed,"" a spokesperson for the police said in an email.

The police did not say if they had received any official complaints tied to the accusations on the Instagram page.

On Friday afternoon, the people behind the Montreal account posted an update saying they were taking a break.

The person who began the account last week never imagined it ""blowing up this big,"" they wrote.

""We are receiving messages from what seems like the entirety of Quebec, which is extremely overwhelming.""

They said they had over 1,000 messages currently waiting to be reviewed, and that multiple people were helping run the account, including some who had put their ""jobs on hold.""

""Our mission was to deal specifically with the Montreal scene, regarding the tattoo/piercing industry & the music scene. As the page got more traction, the influx of stories we received did as well,"" they said, and they wanted to respect all the stories people were sending.

They said they were going to use the break to recruit more people to help run the account. ""During this weekend break, we will be interviewing people with various backgrounds to join our team,"" they wrote.

They said many people had messaged them offering to help, but they were working through personal contacts only.

""We are prioritizing those in our immediate circle to assist us, as this is a serious matter of security.""

The song touches on a number of topics, from people refusing to wear masks to police brutality.

The pair released an animated video of the new track, which features Kid Cudi and Eminem as what appears to be crime fighters or superheroes.

Never one to back down from controversy, Eminem appears to take aim at the Trump administration and calls out people who refuse to wear a mask.

Bunch of half-wits up in office

Half of us walking around like a zombie apocalypse

Other half are just pissed off and

Don't wanna wear a mask and they're just scoffing

And that's how you end up catching the s--- off 'em

I just used the same basket as you shopping

Now I'm in a f------ casket from you coughin'

Eminem, not one to mince words, is very critical of those who refuse to wear masks and talks about police brutality.

Prayers to George Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery

How the f--- is it that so many cops are dirty?

Stop, man, please, officer, I'm sorry

But I can't breathe when I got you on top of me

Your goddamn knee's on my carotid artery

Eminem even takes a shot at New Orleans quarterback Drew Brees, possibly in response to his recent comments about disrespecting the flag. Brees would later apologize for his ""insensitive"" comments.

The song hints at the possibility of two more collaboration tracks between the two artists, saying that the ""trilogy continues.""

Eminem released his 11th album titled ""Music to Be Murdered By"" in January. Kid Cudi has released two other songs this year and he recently had a role on HBO's ""Westworld.""",[]
107,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/with-new-name-and-album-the-chicks-voices-ring-loud-again-1.5019293,"With new name and album, The Chicks' voices ring loud again",['Kristin M. Hall'],2020-07-10 13:57:00-04:00,"NASHVILLE -- The Dixie Chicks are no more. Breaking their ties to the South, The Chicks are stepping into a new chapter in their storied career with their first new music in 14 years.

The Texas trio of Emily Strayer, Martie Maguire and Natalie Maines have been teasing new music for a year, and ""Gaslighter"" finally drops on July 17 when the nation is embroiled in divisive politics, cancel culture and reckoning with inequality. The timing is right for their voices to be heard again.

""It just seemed like a good reflection on our times,"" said Maines. ""In 20 years, we'll look back at that album cover and title and remember exactly what was going on in the country right then.""

""Gaslighter"" is a slang term, inspired by a 1944 Ingrid Bergman film, to describe a psychological abuser who manipulates the truth to make a person feel crazy. In recent years, it's been used to describe powerful men like Harvey Weinstein or Donald Trump.

""I think most everybody has a gaslighter in their lives somewhere,"" said Strayer. ""But, yeah, it was so weird how it echoes our current administration.""

As the bestselling female group in RIAA history, The Chicks appealed to generation of country fans that saw themselves in the band's stories, whether it was ""Wide Open Spaces"" or ""Cowboy Take Me Away."" After three independent albums, their first major label record in 1998 sold 13 million copies in the U.S. alone.

With Maguire on fiddle and Strayer on banjo, they were all steeped in bluegrass and classic country, but relished in fun country-pop on crossover songs like ""Goodbye Earl."" They were country music's next big thing until suddenly the door was slammed on them.

In 2003, as then-President George Bush was preparing to invade Iraq, the trio were playing a show in London when Maines announced they were ashamed that the president was from Texas.

The fallout became country music lore, a warning to stay away from political talk, especially of the liberal kind. They were booed on awards shows, radio stations pulled their music off the air and fans destroyed their CDs. Maguire only recently showed her daughters the 2006 documentary called ""Shut Up and Sing"" that showed how the backlash affected them behind the scenes.

""I was putting off showing them because I have one that's 11 and I just thought she was a little young,"" Maguire said. ""I thought she might be upset by just the death threat stuff.""

Instead, her daughters, living in a social media generation when everyone is afforded an opinion, were confused by the reaction to Maines' tame comments compared to the vitriolic criticism lobbed by politicians and pundits every day.

""And it was just funny hearing 16- and 11-year-olds going, `Why? What? Wait. She said that? And people got so mad?""' said Maguire.

The trio are all now parents of teenagers when youth activists are taking the lead on gun control, climate change and racial inequality. Their song ""March March,"" which was released the same day they announced they were dropping the word Dixie from their name, was inspired by student-led demonstrations over gun control in 2018.

""We were all at March for Our Lives with Emma Gonzalez leading that charge,"" said Strayer. ""We were in the hundreds of thousands of people in that march. And it's the first time I've ever experienced something like that. And it was very powerful.""

On ""Juliana Calm Down,"" their daughters and nieces are name-checked in a song that encourages young women to keep their heads held high when struggling through life's obstacles. Maines is speaking to her two teenage boys on ""Young Man,"" a song for divorced parents who feel like they've let down their kids.

Still fans have been quick try to associate very specific lyrics from ""Gaslighter"" to Maines' contentious divorce to actor Adrian Pasdar. Between the three women, they've had five divorces, so they said people shouldn't read too literally into the words.

""I think people had it in their minds that this album is about one thing and one thing only, and it's not,"" said Maines. ""People are jumping to conclusions.""

Hit pop songwriter Justin Tranter, who has penned hits for Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez and Imagine Dragons, helped The Chicks co-write some of the album's most raw, vulnerable breakup songs, including ""Sleep at Night.""

""Some of those pre-choruses are not songs,"" said Tranter. ""Natalie was just talking and I was literally writing down what she was saying and then I found a way to put it to a melody.""

""Gaslighter"" was recorded and co-written with Jack Antonoff, the Grammy-winning producer-artist known for recording with pop's female elite: Taylor Swift, Lana Del Rey, Lorde and Sia. Antonoff pushed them to use their core strength, the three-part harmonies backed by fiddle and banjo, in new ways.

Maguire's fiddle playing is rhythmic on ""Texas Man"" backed by electric guitar from Grammy-winner St. Vincent. Strayer's banjo leads a chorus of electronic melodies, cello and double drums on ""Sleep at Night."" Their voices, strong, sharp and haunting, blend and build in cinematic ways.

Their last album, 2006's ""Taking the Long Way,"" earned five Grammys, including album, record and song of the year, and won over masses of fans who never listened to them before. But it's unlikely the fans who turned their back on The Chicks 17 years ago are going to feel any different about the band's return.

When The Chicks and Beyonce performed at the Country Music Association Awards in 2016, a vocal minority unleashed their anger on social media at the idea that both artists would be invited to perform.

The Chicks knew the high-profile awards show performance would get some criticism, but they were upset after the CMA briefly removed promo videos online of the performance. The CMA later said the clips were not approved, so they were removed before the broadcast.

""The CMAs were absolutely wrong to cower to that racism,"" said Maines. ""It was disgusting. It's good that they put it back up, but it should have never come down.""

""When you invite (Beyonce) knowing that she's going to bring that elevation to the show and those eyeballs and then you diss her like that, it's twisting the knife,"" said Strayer.

Although their fallout occurred before Twitter or Facebook, The Chicks have a unique viewpoint on the rise of cancel culture, when prominent people are attacked online in an almost mob mentality.

""On one hand, you know, it's freeing now. People just are way more vocal,"" said Maines. ""But then the downside is one slip up, one major slip up, and no publicist can make that go away.""

Maines said for movements like .MeToo, those speaking out online held people accountable. ""And you can't silence or quiet them when you've got so many women coming forward,"" Maines said.

The phrase ""shut up and sing"" is still used as a weapon against women, minorities and anyone straying from their musical lane. But The Chicks think younger music fans don't adhere to that idea.

""There's not a whole lot of respect anymore if you're just going to smile and entertain,"" Maines said. ""They want you to have a point of view.""

Strayer added, ""My 15-year-old won't even let me use a filter on my phone! They want real.""

While the break between albums was longer than any of them anticipated, they realized they still had important things to say.

""We have to say things when the time is right to say them, and we've been quiet for 10 years, so get ready,"" Strayer said with a laugh.",[]
108,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/movie-reviews-greyhound-a-naval-thriller-propelled-by-action-1.5015264,Movie reviews: 'Greyhound' a naval thriller propelled by action,[],2020-07-10 07:30:00-04:00,"GREYHOUND: 4 ½ STARS

Tom Hanks is the above the title star of “Greyhound,” a new naval thriller now streaming on Apple TV+, but the star of the film is the tension that takes hold in the first ten minutes and does not let go.

Set during the onset of the United States' involvement in the Second World War, Hanks plays Commander Ernest Krause, a stoic sailor on his first command. His mission is to lead an international convoy of 37 Allied ships across the North Atlantic with a wolfpack of German U-boats in hot pursuit. Running out of depth charges and fuel, the convoy needs air cover, which is hours away.

That’s it. “Greyhound” isn’t so much story driven as it is propelled by the action. In a breathless ninety minutes director Aaron Schneider, working from a script written by Hanks, adapted from C. S. Forester’s 1955 book “The Good Shepherd,” ratchets up tension, creating an old-fashioned action movie that mines a life and death situation for real cinematic thrills. That being said, there’s no fight scenes, you never see the face of the enemy and the only dead bodies are wrapped in linen, getting a proper burial at sea.

Inspired by the Battle of the Atlantic, the movie takes place completely on board the USS Keeling (Call sign ""Greyhound""). Krause is in the ship’s claustrophobic helm for ninety percent of the running time, barking orders, peering through binoculars, making hard decisions with consequences that will affect the lives of hundreds of people.

Hanks plays Krause as a man with nerves of steel who hides his concern behind his furrowed brow. In the heat of battle every second counts and both Hanks and Schneider understand that the mental gymnastics required to do the job must be front and centre. This is a movie where the fiercest action is verbal. Sure, there’s gunfire, torpedoes and explosions, but the exciting stuff comes from Krause’s mental perspective. Never have coordinated turn equations and rudder work been this exciting.

“Greyhound” was originally set for a theatrical release. The more sweeping shots, those of the ships as specks in the vast ocean, feel like they would have benefited from the big screen treatment, but the story, driven by intellect, the effectiveness of team effort, and old-fashioned thrills, works well in any format.

THE OLD GUARD: 2 ½ STARS

“The Old Guard,” a new superhero flick starring Charlize Theron on Netflix, has the earmarks of an action flick, but brings the genre kicking and screaming into the twenty-first century by focusing the story on not just one, but two female characters.

Theron channels the dark side that made her characters in “Mad Max: Fury Road” and “Atomic Blonde” so compelling. She’s Andy, a tough-as-nails immortal mercenary with the power to heal herself, no matter how deep the wound.

“She has devised more ways to kill than entire armies will ever know,” says unkillable sidekick, and former soldier for Napoleon, Booker (Matthias Schoenaerts). For centuries they have fought the good fight—depending on which side you take—along with Joe (Marwan Kenzari) and Nicky (Luca Marinelli), sticking up for the maltreated and oppressed. “Through history, we’ve protected this world,” says Andy, “fighting in the shadows.”

In modern day they come across Nile (KiKi Layne), a Marine who shares their “extremely rare skillset.” “She stabbed me,” Andy says admiringly, “I think she has potential.”

Nile is the first of their kind they have come across since 1812 and soon they recruit her to join their ranks. “You haven’t figured this out yet?” Andy asks her. “You can’t die.” At the same time a mad-scientist big pharma type (Harry Melling) sets his sights on them as lab rats in his experiments to find a cure for death. “If we can unlock their genetic code, the entire world will be begging us for the key.”

“The Old Guard” is an action film, with carefully staged and exciting fight scenes, but first and foremost it’s a set-up for a franchise. Like an action-packed trailer for a movie it teases the possibility of the next film. The origin story is talky, illustrated by flashbacks, while the main plot is resolved quickly in a hail of bullets and a few swings of an axe. Then the set up begins, as they hint at further adventures. Trouble is, I’m not sure “The Old Guard’s” appeal is as immortal as its characters.

Theron and Layne are strong characters who deliver in the fist-to-the-face action department, but the movie doesn’t let them shine. As mentioned, the fight scenes are well staged but their relationship is never fully developed. Everyone, except for Melling who appears amped up on something he didn’t share with the rest of the cast, is on a slow simmer which gives the movie a laid-back vibe which doesn’t spark interest.

“The Old Guard” does a good thing by placing two women at the center of an action movie but the all-set-up all-the-time script doesn’t do the characters or the movie any favors.

FISHERMAN’S FRIENDS: 3 ½ STARS

Another entry in the Real-Life-Underdog-Brits-Overcoming-Adversity genre of movies—think “The Full Monty,” “Calendar Girls” and more recently “Military Wives”—“Fisherman’s Friends,” now on VOD, is a good-natured crowd pleaser with some deep laughs but no major surprises.

Daniel Mays is Danny, a “proper bigshot” London music biz executive, on a quick weekend get-a-way with some mates in Port Isaac in Cornwall. They are fish out of water in the village. The locals poke fun at their city-slicker ways, treating them like outsiders. “We have our ways down here,” Jim (James Purefoy) warns Danny, “and once you cross the River Tamar you’re not in England anymore. We’re a land apart. You get my drift, son?”

After hearing a local group of fishermen, led by Jim, Jago (David Hayman) and Leadville (Dave Johns), singing a cappella sea shanties Danny’s pals jokingly convince him that he should sign the band to a record contract. He’s skeptical at first, but there’s something about the music that speaks to his soul. But first, he has to persuade the fishermen who are suspicious of his motives. “We have no need to sell our souls for fifteen minutes of fame,” Jim tells him.

His friends can’t believe he fell for the joke. “Do you really think we’d sign a boy band with the combined age of 643?”

But, convinced the public will want to see real people with real talent communicating 500 years of naval history, Danny perseveres. “In a world saturated with manufactured pop bands,” he says, “the fishermen are a real catch.” Plus, he’s fallen for life in the village and Jim’s daughter Alwyn (Tuppence Middleton).

The story of the band’s success is almost stranger than fiction. In real life The Fisherman's Friends “buoy band” signed a contract with Island Records and their debut went on to become the biggest selling traditional folk album of all time.

“Fisherman’s Friends” keeps the bones of the real story but amps up the big emotional moments. The highs soar and the lows have a heartfelt sentimentality. None of it quite feels like reality but by the time the end credits roll it’s clear that Port Isaac in Cornwall is a nice place to visit for 115 minutes.

“Fisherman’s Friends” is formulaic, clearly manipulative, and any sense of subtlety was clearly cut adrift around the second draft of the script but the story’s feel-good underdog story mixed with innate messages of decency and loyalty make it as refreshing as a gust of sea air in our cynical times. “We stick together down here,” Says Jago. “One and all. That’s the difference between sinking or swimming in a place like this.” A good message, even when delivered with a heavy hand.

WHITE RIOT: 4 STARS

The cultural, moral and emotional impact that music has is undeniable. Songs like “Times They Are A-Changin’,” “Them Belly Full (But We Hungry),"" and “What’s Going On” or events like Live Aid or The Concert for Bangladesh brought with them societal change by mobilizing music fans to action. “White Riot,” new documentary from director Rubika Shah streaming on Virtual Cinema Screening sites (see below), details the fight between Rock Against Racism and Britain’s National Front.

In the macro the film’s story is set against the rise of xenophobic politician Enoch Powell and violent, far-right hate group the National Front. Language that would get anyone kicked off Twitter or cancelled today was casually tossed around in the papers and on television. In one inspired sequence Shah pieces together a montage of outrageous racist remarks pulled from mainstream sitcoms.

In August 1976 guitarist Eric Clapton, whose entire career was based on the elements of blues created by Black American musicians, added his voice to the rhetoric, endorsing Powell from a stage in a drunken rant.

“I think Enoch’s right,” he said. “I think we should send them all back. Stop Britain from becoming a Black colony. Get the foreigners out.""

His comments caught the attention of music photographer Red Saunders who wrote a letter to the music press, calling for rock to be a force against racism. Bigtime outlets like NME, Melody Maker and Sounds all published the letter. The resulting and overwhelming response from like-minded Brits inspired Saunders to create the grassroots movement, Rock Against Racism (RAR) and a fanzine, Temporary Hoarding geared toward reporting on the stories the mainstream press ignored.

“Our job,” Saunders says, “was to peel away the Union Jack to reveal the swastika.”

Their reports on immigration and the police’s racist “suspected persons” powers among other hot button topics appealed to a generation of young people who embraced new ideas politically and musically, in the form of rebel music, punk rock and reggae.

Despite violent resistance from the National Front RAR persevered and “White Riot” ends, not at the end of Rock Against Racism’s mandate—they remained a potent force until 1982—but with their first massive public outing, 1978’s Carnival Against the Nazis. Headlined by The Clash, Steel Pulse and Tom Robinson, it attracted 100,000 people who began marching a march at Trafalgar Square, before the concert at Victoria Park.

“White Riot” pieces together archival footage, like unsettling shots of National Front supporters parading through London, recent interviews with the main RAR players and piles of ephemera, like old gig posters, punk badges and photos, to define the film’s time and place. Shah weaves the elements together, punctuating the info with sonic blasts of music courtesy of live footage of The Clash, The Selecter, Sham 69, Steel Pulse and others.

It is compelling stuff and even though it details a time more than forty years ago it doesn’t feel dated. Racism and rise of neo-fascism are still with us but “White Riot” reminds the viewer that resistance not only comes in many forms but that fighting the good fight is never out of date.

VOLITION: 3 ½ STARS

James (Adrian Glynn McMorran) is a young man with extra sensory perception, but is it an ability or an affliction? That is the question asked in “Volition,” a new thriller now on VOD.

“They say when you die, your whole life flashes before your eyes,” James says in the opening minutes of the movie. “I wish it were that simple.” It’s a signal of sorts to the viewer that nothing in the next ninety minutes is going to be simple or follow the accepted rules.

James, a clairvoyant, makes his money using his insight into the future and doing odd jobs for local crime outfits. On one such job, involving a load of stolen diamonds and a gangster named

Ray (John Cassini), James intuits a bad end for the caper and himself. With the help of a stranger, Angela (Magda Apanowicz), he tries to find a path to alter the future and his fate.

“Volition” is a mix-and-match of speculative fiction and neo-noir crime drama. Driven by ideas rather than special effects, it favors intellect over action, philosophy over fisticuffs. There are tense scenes and gun play but, like movies such as “Looper” or “Next,” it uses time as an ever fluctuating, nonlinear construct.

The bending of the sequence of time makes for some heady filmmaking but the story never allows itself to get lost amid the twists and turns. Director Tony Dean Smith, who co-wrote the script with brother Ryan W. Smith, teases out the thrills and the head-scratching in equal measure, making for a film made up of fragments, to come together to form one fascinating mosaic.",[]

Tom Hanks is the above the title star of “Greyhound,” a new naval thriller now streaming on Apple TV+, but the star of the film is the tension that takes hold in the first ten minutes and does not let go.

Set during the onset of the United States' involvement in the Second World War, Hanks plays Commander Ernest Krause, a stoic sailor on his first command. His mission is to lead an international convoy of 37 Allied ships across the North Atlantic with a wolfpack of German U-boats in hot pursuit. Running out of depth charges and fuel, the convoy needs air cover, which is hours away.

That’s it. “Greyhound” isn’t so much story driven as it is propelled by the action. In a breathless ninety minutes director Aaron Schneider, working from a script written by Hanks, adapted from C. S. Forester’s 1955 book “The Good Shepherd,” ratchets up tension, creating an old-fashioned action movie that mines a life and death situation for real cinematic thrills. That being said, there’s no fight scenes, you never see the face of the enemy and the only dead bodies are wrapped in linen, getting a proper burial at sea.

Inspired by the Battle of the Atlantic, the movie takes place completely on board the USS Keeling (Call sign ""Greyhound""). Krause is in the ship’s claustrophobic helm for ninety percent of the running time, barking orders, peering through binoculars, making hard decisions with consequences that will affect the lives of hundreds of people.

Hanks plays Krause as a man with nerves of steel who hides his concern behind his furrowed brow. In the heat of battle every second counts and both Hanks and Schneider understand that the mental gymnastics required to do the job must be front and centre. This is a movie where the fiercest action is verbal. Sure, there’s gunfire, torpedoes and explosions, but the exciting stuff comes from Krause’s mental perspective. Never have coordinated turn equations and rudder work been this exciting.

“Greyhound” was originally set for a theatrical release. The more sweeping shots, those of the ships as specks in the vast ocean, feel like they would have benefited from the big screen treatment, but the story, driven by intellect, the effectiveness of team effort, and old-fashioned thrills, works well in any format.

THE OLD GUARD: 2 ½ STARS

“The Old Guard,” a new superhero flick starring Charlize Theron on Netflix, has the earmarks of an action flick, but brings the genre kicking and screaming into the twenty-first century by focusing the story on not just one, but two female characters.

Theron channels the dark side that made her characters in “Mad Max: Fury Road” and “Atomic Blonde” so compelling. She’s Andy, a tough-as-nails immortal mercenary with the power to heal herself, no matter how deep the wound.

“She has devised more ways to kill than entire armies will ever know,” says unkillable sidekick, and former soldier for Napoleon, Booker (Matthias Schoenaerts). For centuries they have fought the good fight—depending on which side you take—along with Joe (Marwan Kenzari) and Nicky (Luca Marinelli), sticking up for the maltreated and oppressed. “Through history, we’ve protected this world,” says Andy, “fighting in the shadows.”

In modern day they come across Nile (KiKi Layne), a Marine who shares their “extremely rare skillset.” “She stabbed me,” Andy says admiringly, “I think she has potential.”

Nile is the first of their kind they have come across since 1812 and soon they recruit her to join their ranks. “You haven’t figured this out yet?” Andy asks her. “You can’t die.” At the same time a mad-scientist big pharma type (Harry Melling) sets his sights on them as lab rats in his experiments to find a cure for death. “If we can unlock their genetic code, the entire world will be begging us for the key.”

“The Old Guard” is an action film, with carefully staged and exciting fight scenes, but first and foremost it’s a set-up for a franchise. Like an action-packed trailer for a movie it teases the possibility of the next film. The origin story is talky, illustrated by flashbacks, while the main plot is resolved quickly in a hail of bullets and a few swings of an axe. Then the set up begins, as they hint at further adventures. Trouble is, I’m not sure “The Old Guard’s” appeal is as immortal as its characters.

Theron and Layne are strong characters who deliver in the fist-to-the-face action department, but the movie doesn’t let them shine. As mentioned, the fight scenes are well staged but their relationship is never fully developed. Everyone, except for Melling who appears amped up on something he didn’t share with the rest of the cast, is on a slow simmer which gives the movie a laid-back vibe which doesn’t spark interest.

“The Old Guard” does a good thing by placing two women at the center of an action movie but the all-set-up all-the-time script doesn’t do the characters or the movie any favors.

The rising star died of an accidental drug overdose six days after his 21st birthday in December.

But a collection of tracks he recorded before his death was compiled for the album, which was released just after midnight Friday morning.

The record opens with an emotional skit featuring audio of the star talking about anxiety and substance abuse, and sharing an encouraging message to fans.

""Music is just a beautiful thing, like I love myself so much, as far as the way I make music, the way God made me, the way God wired me to do the things that I do, and to change the world the way that I can,"" he says in the track.

""Before I get up out of here, I wanna tell you that you can do anything you put your mind to, period.""

The 55-minute record features collaborations with Marshmello, Halsey and rapper Trippie Redd, and includes three singles that had already become popular on streaming services -- ""Righteous,"" ""Tell Me U Luv Me"" and ""Life's A Mess.""

The release had a positive, and sometimes emotional, reaction from fans. ""Juice Wrld album in rotation NOW!!"" popular YouTuber DJ Akademiks wrote on Twitter.

""Yes I'm a grown man, yes I'm crying listening to this juice wrld album,"" another fan added in a tweet that quickly went viral.

The album ends with another skit, ""Juice WRLD Speaks From Heaven,"" which features audio of him talking in 2019. ""I'm on Instagram Live from Heaven, huh. I made it y'all, I'm up here, I'm boolin'. Haha, I love y'all to death. How can I ask for better fans or supporters?"" he says in the ominous recording.

Some fans reported on social media that Juice's artist page on Spotify crashed in the hours after the album's release, sharing screenshots of an error message. CNN has contacted Spotify for comment. Later on Friday, Spotify's app appeared to stop loading for many users.

Juice was an ascending star on the American rap scene and had featured on Eminem's release ""Godzilla"" before he died. He also collaborated with some other top names in music, including Ellie Goulding and Future.

His biggest hit, ""Lucid Dreams,"" peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Top 100 in October of 2018, according to the music chart, and tracks like ""Robbery"" have enjoyed sustained success throughout 2020.

Juice, who was born Jarad Anthony Higgins, died as a result of oxycodone and codeine toxicity, the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office said in January.

The medical examiner determined the rapper's death to be an accident.

Juice suffered a medical emergency shortly after arriving at Chicago's Midway International Airport in early December, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told CNN at the time. The musician died in a hospital, according to police.",[]

Forget sold-out shows, cramming together at the stage, blasting speakers and crowd-surfing musicians.

Free-wheeling gigs are a thing of the past, at least for now.

Crowds are small. Think dozens, not hundreds or thousands. And in many places, patrons must remain in assigned seats.

Concerns about spreading droplets are leading to new rules in Newfoundland limiting the number of singers and wind instrument players to a maximum of two at a time. They must be separated from others by at least 4 metres or a physical barrier.

Audiences have to be at least 4 metres from the stage.

“In many small pubs, that means the audience has to be in the bathroom,” says music promoter Dustin Parsons, who lives in Corner Brook. “And I’m not kidding about that.”

In Toronto and Ottawa and other Ontario cities, it’s instrumental music only, no singing. (And no dancing.) Venues can only host live music on patios, nothing indoors.

In many places, bands are being asked to keep the decibels down, over concerns about loud singing projecting particles and patrons having to talk closer or shout to be heard.

Vancouver has seen a return of music but venues can only be 50 per cent full, no more than six people can sit at one table and at some venues, the stage is blocked off by plastic barriers – the equivalent of a “musical aquarium,” said one music publication.

Guests have to sign in (in case contact tracing is necessary) and patrons signal to masked staff with a light on their tables.

Seeing artists in pubs, bars and concert venues won’t be the same for a long time, says Erin Benjamin, CEO of the Canadian Live Music Association.

When concert halls reopen, she says, fans will likely receive texts telling them when they can enter the venue, have their temperatures taken at the door, and be seated in bubbles of friends or family.

VIP concert tickets, with access to sound checks, meet and greets, and photos with artists are likely a thing of the past, at least for the foreseeable future, says veteran music publicist Eric Alper. Artists can’t risk getting sick and they may not be able to get insurance if they come into contact with fans, he says.

Concerts at arenas of 25,000 people may be over, too. Global entertainment giant Live Nation has said it’s going to experiment with broadcasting fan-less concerts to people’s homes, and will replace arena shows with multiple performances in spaced-out theatres or clubs.

This artist rendering released by Live Nation shows the set up for Live Nation's 'Live from the Drive-In,' concert series taking place July 10-12. (Live Nation via AP)

With or without a vaccine, live music is going to look entirely different, says Alper. A reckoning was already on the horizon before COVID-19, because at least so far, most of today’s teens and twenty-somethings have not embraced going out to hear music.

Festivals – a staple of summer in Canada – are prohibited across Canada but event organizers, promoters and venues are coming up with ideas that would have sounded crazy just a few months ago.

Drive-in concerts, where fans stay in their cars, are the new rage. Restaurants are hiring bands to play from balconies and rooftops, solo acts and ensembles are heading off to driveways, lawns and porches for private concerts.

Alper has even heard of hotels renting out rooms to music fans to watch poolside concerts.

Home concerts – paid gigs of 40 or 50 people in a living room or, more likely these days, a backyard – will become more common, says Alper, especially if venues permanently shutter.

“I think they will come back in a big way. Artists love them because the audience actually listens to the music and the homeowner commits to selling the tickets.”

LIVING ON LIVESTREAMS

The irony is that while halls and arenas are dark, there has never been more live music being produced, says Benjamin at the CLMA, which represents show promoters, festival organizers and owners and operators of music venues.

Musicians in all genres and at all levels of celebrity are connecting with fans through livestreams, some selling tickets, usually at low dollar amounts, while others are asking fans for donations. Most livestreams are coming from an artist’s living room or recording studio, while a few have come from empty venues or with a very small and spaced out audience.

Benjamin says livestreams have provided much entertainment and relief in times of uncertainty, but can’t replace either the social or economic impact of in-person shows.

The live music industry in Canada accounts for 72,000 jobs – not including performers – and generates $3.5 billion in economic activity, according to the CLMA. Benjamin says 2020 was poised to be one of the biggest years in live music in Canada and globally, but in an industry dominated by small players operating on slim profit margins, COVID-19 has been devastating.

Where the true effect will be felt is at the venue level, says Benjamin. Her organization is predicting -- based on polls of members -- that up to 96 per cent of live music venues in Canada are in danger of being permanently shut down.

That will affect generations of artists to come who will have few places to perform and leave a void in communities across the country, says Benjamin. While non-profit festivals and theatres have been given some emergency relief and Toronto and Montreal are among municipalities rolling out financial support for music venues, the CLMA is lobbying for co-ordinated federal support for the industry to keep it afloat.

The Canadian Heritage Ministry earmarked $20 million this week for for-profit live music in Phase 2 of the $500-million COVID-19 Emergency Support Fund for Cultural, Heritage and Sport Organizations.

The money will go to artist managers, booking agents, concert promoters, for-profit festivals and venues through the Canada Music Fund.

In a statement, Benjamin welcoming the funding, saying it will be the first time for-profit live music will get federal support. “Unfortunately, we have already lost venues and companies. But this will make a difference for others, and comes not a moment too soon.”

Venues on the edge worry Larry Feudo, president of the Hamilton Musicians Union and a guitarist in blues band Trickbag. He says already underpaid musicians are going to be squeezed even tighter.

“When Live Nation is only guaranteeing 25 per cent of the usual rates for the big acts in arenas, you know things are going to be tough for everyone else.”

Trickbag was booked through September when COVID-19 swept in and wiped out the lucrative summer festival season.

“Everyone is starting to feel the pinch and hit the panic button,” says Feudo, who represents more than 600 local musicians.

Feudo is worried many venues won’t be able to outlast fear of the virus and that music lovers will get used to watching music online long-term.

“Live music may never come back as it was.”

Industry surveys indicate a majority of even the most diehard music lovers won’t return to live music venues for months and many not until there is a vaccine.

Benjamin worries that crowds won’t return even in 2021.

THE END OF THE ROAD?

Veteran Canadian rocker Kim Mitchell says after a career of four decades, he is reconciled with the possibility that he may not tour again. He was just weeks into a tour for his first album in 13 years, The Big Fantasize, when the pandemic lockdown hit.

“Who knows when a crowd can gather in a sweaty, rock ‘n’ roll room or an arena again?” he said to CTVNews.ca from his Oakville, Ont. home. He won’t venture on a plane or play in front of a crowd until there is a vaccine.

He’s set aside savings and is only “vaguely interested” in drive-in shows or rooftop concerts. He won’t step behind plastic shields to perform.

That’s not to say he will miss touring if it comes to that. Playing live with a band and crew “gives me life. Nothing has been more magical in my life and there isn’t anything I’m more grateful for.”

Many of today’s top draws on tours are what Alper, the music publicist, calls heritage acts, including the Rolling Stones, Metallica, Bon Jovi and Fleetwood Mac. No one knows how many performers and fans in that age category will want to head back to arenas again, he says.

Even Alper says he won’t risk going to a concert until a vaccine is found.

But touring and selling merchandise is the bread and butter of veteran performers, along with those in traditional genres such as folk, blues, jazz and roots, says Alper, who spoke to CTVNews.ca from his home in Markham, Ont.

“I think it’s fair to say that about 80 per cent of income comes from live performance for people over 30 these days.”

Young artists in pop, hip hop and rap haven’t been as affected by COVID-19 shutdowns because they don’t tour much anyway, says Alper. They rely on streaming, releasing videos and performing live on social media platforms.

The artists at the top of the streaming platforms are making big money, says Alper, roughly about $4,000 per 100,000 streams. So Canadians The Weeknd or Drake make millions on that.

But for indie artists, says Alper, the streaming money just isn’t there. And now neither is the money from touring that could gross a performer attracting 150 people roughly $1,000 to $1,500 a night or generate $10,000 to $25,000 a show before expenses for acts in small concert halls.

“In this time of coronavirus, there may be a whole generation who figure out that music isn’t a financial option for them. They might not enter the business because there are no places to play or sell merchandise.”

Halifax-based singer-songwriter Christina Martin fears it will take two years for live music to rebound.

So she’s spent the last few months concentrating on using performance and engagement platforms that generate a regular income, including livestream site Crowdcast and Patreon, a kind of crowdsourcing for creators.

Martin says she’s been surprised by her success so far “but I don’t know what to expect down the road. I don’t know if I can sustain myself on virtual events.”

But she doesn’t feel safe booking home concerts, once a mainstay of her performing life. She’s got just one show in Dartmouth booked this summer and consulted with her doctor about it because she’s nervous.

SYMPHONIES GOING SMALLER

Many of Canada’s orchestras are too big to come together to perform under pandemic gathering restrictions, never mind adding an audience.

The Vancouver Symphony Orchestra has cancelled 48 performances so far and it will be a very long time before its 2,500-seat Orpheum concert hall will be filled again, president and CEO Angela Elster told CTVNews.ca from Vancouver.

The VSO has worked through dozens of performance scenarios, including small ensembles in smaller venues, community concerts in places like hospitals and seniors homes, outdoor and drive-in performances, livestreams to movie theatres, and shows where the audience travels to various venues.

“It’s a time to explore and experiment … Music has been a balm for the soul during COVID-19 and we take that responsibility seriously,” said Elster, who was in her role just three months before the pandemic shutdown hit.

“We are in our 102nd year, so we’re not about to let the music stop now.”

Under current physical distancing rules, the VSO could have a maximum of 28 of its 65 musicians on stage at one time. It’s created a proposal to the B.C. Ministry of Culture that calls for three shorter, back-to-back shows with 500 to 600 audience members at a time.

But Elster acknowledges that provincial health authorities have been adamant that indoor gatherings will be limited to 50 people until a vaccine is developed.

The VSO and other orchestras across Canada are carefully watching what has unfolded in Europe and other regions that have more broadly reopened. The Berlin Philharmonic, for instance, began performing in late May. Only 15 musicians could be on the stage together, with string players sitting two metres apart and woodwinds and brass spaced out five metres apart.

There have been concerns raised about the playing of wind instruments and how the blowing of vast amounts of air – of course, without a mask – could heighten risk of virus spread. (Similar red flags have been raised about singing.) Scientists have been scrambling for answers.

Since its first performance, the philharmonic and other orchestras in Germany have adopted guidance from infectious disease experts to surround the wind-blowing musicians with plastic barriers. Musicians are tested for COVID-19 before rehearsals and concerts and they must agree to maintain strict physical distancing between gatherings.

Audiences have definitely returned, with many music lovers complaining they couldn’t get tickets. Some European orchestras doled out coveted seats in a lottery for subscription holders. Audience members must bring a registration form with their ticket in which they much vouch for being symptom-free. They are sprayed down with hand sanitizer at the door and led to their seats.

Household members can sit together but in between are gaps of three or four seats and every other row is left empty.

The Manitoba government has drafted guidelines for vocalists and instrumentalists, which included recommendations that the length of an instrument be considered an extension of the individual for physical distancing purposes, sharing of equipment such as drumsticks or music stands be avoided, and that brass players empty their instruments of accumulated saliva into disposable containers rather than onto the floor as is normal practice.

The 67 musicians in the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra have not been together since March 13 when they packed up their instruments mid-rehearsal and headed home. Twenty performances and a tour to the Netherlands the orchestra has been planning for five years have been cancelled.

The WSO is planning to perform in small ensembles through the fall and winter, with the hope to be back to full-scale concerts next spring, says executive director Trudy Schroeder.

“We don’t want to give up. Some organizations are scrapping the whole season.”

That includes the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, which cancelled all of its 2020-2021 season this week.

Schroeder says Centennial Concert Hall, where the WSO performs, can fit up to 40 players sitting 2 metres apart, but many fewer when more distancing of wind players is necessary. The WSO is also looking at adding barriers.

Audiences will be assigned doors through which to enter and exit to minimize the route to their seats. Concerts will be shorter and without intermissions, to reduce crowding in bathrooms, she says.

Travel restrictions will mean the WSO will focus on featuring its own musicians and other Manitoban performers as soloists, she says. Reduced ticket sales means performances are already sold out.

SHIFT TO VIRTUAL

Major music festivals have been iced across the country, including Boots and Hearts and Big Sky in Ontario, the Edmonton Folk Festival, jazz festivals in Vancouver and Ottawa, and the Dawson City Music Festival in the Yukon.

Some music festivals have shifted to virtual this year, including the Winnipeg Folk Festival. Folk Fest at Home will present three hours of music, instead of three-and-a-half days. The free online show, premiering on both Facebook and YouTube on July 11 at 7 p.m. CT, will be a mix of new recorded performances along with archival footage from past headliners.

Lynne Skromeda, the festival’s executive director, says the 47-year-old festival is a summer tradition for generations of Manitobans, including herself. She first attended in 1980 at six years old and hasn’t missed one since.

Festival supporters are embracing the virtual edition, she says, with food vendors putting together festival specials that can be ordered for delivery, and fans sharing their plans for gatherings in backyards, cottages, living rooms and parking lots to watch the livestream.

Many in the business think the pandemic has ushered in an era of livestream or pay-per-view type options for everything from arena-scale national tours to gigs at local venues and music festivals.

Skromeda says going online gives the Winnipeg Folk Festival a “global reach” it’s never had before. She says licensing rights for artists have been a sticking point up until now, but she believes the effects of COVID-19 will motivate all sides to sort that out.

She doesn’t share the fear that going virtual, even for free, will reduce crowds at the shows.

“The live music experience, that emotional impact, can’t be replicated.”

Parsons, the music promoter in Newfoundland, agrees that hybrid events will be the new normal. For instance, he’s organizing an upcoming rooftop concert by emerging band Fairgale at a new Corner Brook boutique hotel. Capacity would normally be 100 but 40 VIP tickets will be sold, and the goal is to attract an audience of 1,000 online.

“That’s a great audience for the band and raises awareness of the venue.”

Parsons is not going to chase a paying crowd though. “You’re seeing $20 or $30 events on Zoom but my experience is that that’s going to fail. It won’t take off because you might get 50 people. Attracting large free audiences is the way to go because sponsors see value in that.”

Online tools and platforms will only improve the virtual experience, says Parsons, but he thinks when it’s safe again, there will be a surge in interest in physical events. Audiences will crave the emotional and social impact of live concerts seen in person.

“It’s like being in church sometimes. The power isn’t there when you’re on your couch on your phone,” he said.

‘POWERFUL’ HUMAN FORCE

There is science behind the “powerful” force of the shared musical experience, says Laurel Trainor, director of the McMaster Institute for Music and the Mind in Hamilton, Ont.

Whether it’s playing music together or being there for a live performance, it’s an intensely emotional and social experience, she says.

Research at the institute, which includes a fully functional concert hall featuring an array of monitoring equipment, has found that when audiences watch a concert video, they don’t move as much or report experiencing as much pleasure as when watching something performed live in front of them, said Trainor.

And scientists have shown that when people move in time to music together, it boosts their sense of trust and willingness to co-operate with each other. Trainor’s own lab work has found that shows up in babies as young as 14 months.

For a host of reasons, Trainor, a professor in McMaster University’s neuroscience, psychology and behaviour department, and a flautist in a local orchestra, is confident that many people will return to live music when it’s safe again.

“I just think that is something humans will want to do again.”

BACK TO THE DRIVE-IN

And until they can do that seated or standing side-by-side, there is the drive-in. No one could have predicted drive-in theatres would be a saviour of live music, but here we are.

The phenomena where the past is the future seems to have begun in Europe in May where car-bound music fans blew their horns, waved out their windows and even “cheered” with their windshield wipers. One show in Denmark even featured a video teleconference link for attendees that allowed them to get closeups of the concert and for the performer to connect directly with people in their cars for requests or to share stories.

Among the biggest North American shows was superstar country singer Garth Brooks’ pre-recorded performance that was beamed to 300 drive-ins across Canada and the U.S., last month. Canadian country singer Brett Kissel played a series of sold-out live concerts in parking lots across Saskatchewan last month, too.

Brad Paisley, Blake Shelton and Toronto band July Talk are among the artists planning drive-in summer shows and new urban drive-ins have hastily been constructed in Ottawa and Toronto to host movies and concerts.

The Ottawa Bluesfest initially cancelled its July event but then quickly shifted to planning for a drive-in festival in Gatineau, Que.

Attendance will be capped at 500 cars spaced at least two metres apart. The hope is that health officials give the OK for attendees to sit outside their cars in lawn chairs, says executive director and founder Mark Monahan. Music will come over car stereos and the all-Canadian lineup over four days of concerts will be projected onto large screens.

Tickets have been “very strong,” says Monahan. “This will be something of an outdoor concert experience. There are only so many virtual concerts you can watch.”

But at the same time, Monahan is among those who sees a permanent shift to a virtual option for music events. The entire Bluesfest event, presented in partnership with the National Arts Centre, will be streamed on Facebook Live for free. He says that will expand Bluesfest’s reputation and audience reach and give a wider platform to artists.

“I think virtual is going to play a role going forward. There are usually early adopters and late adopters but we’ve all been forced to be early adopters.”

Afro-pop singer Michelle Oluwatomi Akanbi, who performs under the name TOME, is one of the featured acts at The Together at the Drive-In event happening July 25-26 at the Stardust drive-in near Newmarket, Ont.

It was supposed to be a big year for her, including performances at South by Southwest in Austin, Tex. and a festival in Jamaica, but instead she released a new album and performed through livestreams.

“I’m just happy to be able to perform outside for a crowd, but it will feel different than a normal show,” the singer said from her Mississauga, Ont. home.

Fellow Together at the Drive-In performer DJ 4Korners, best known for his role as official DJ of the Toronto Raptors, says he’s impressed by the innovation happening in presenting live music as restrictions ease.

“Interacting with people is something I need more than I even thought. I can’t express how excited I am to do this event,” the Toronto resident told CTVNews.ca.

He’s hopeful many will embrace a new appreciation for live performance after the pandemic.

“I think we took it all for granted.”

Forget sold-out shows, cramming together at the stage, blasting speakers and crowd-surfing musicians.

Free-wheeling gigs are a thing of the past, at least for now.

Crowds are small. Think dozens, not hundreds or thousands. And in many places, patrons must remain in assigned seats.

Concerns about spreading droplets are leading to new rules in Newfoundland limiting the number of singers and wind instrument players to a maximum of two at a time. They must be separated from others by at least 4 metres or a physical barrier.

Audiences have to be at least 4 metres from the stage.

“In many small pubs, that means the audience has to be in the bathroom,” says music promoter Dustin Parsons, who lives in Corner Brook. “And I’m not kidding about that.”

In Toronto and Ottawa and other Ontario cities, it’s instrumental music only, no singing. (And no dancing.) Venues can only host live music on patios, nothing indoors.

In many places, bands are being asked to keep the decibels down, over concerns about loud singing projecting particles and patrons having to talk closer or shout to be heard.

Vancouver has seen a return of music but venues can only be 50 per cent full, no more than six people can sit at one table and at some venues, the stage is blocked off by plastic barriers – the equivalent of a “musical aquarium,” said one music publication.

Guests have to sign in (in case contact tracing is necessary) and patrons signal to masked staff with a light on their tables.

Seeing artists in pubs, bars and concert venues won’t be the same for a long time, says Erin Benjamin, CEO of the Canadian Live Music Association.

When concert halls reopen, she says, fans will likely receive texts telling them when they can enter the venue, have their temperatures taken at the door, and be seated in bubbles of friends or family.

VIP concert tickets, with access to sound checks, meet and greets, and photos with artists are likely a thing of the past, at least for the foreseeable future, says veteran music publicist Eric Alper. Artists can’t risk getting sick and they may not be able to get insurance if they come into contact with fans, he says.

Concerts at arenas of 25,000 people may be over, too. Global entertainment giant Live Nation has said it’s going to experiment with broadcasting fan-less concerts to people’s homes, and will replace arena shows with multiple performances in spaced-out theatres or clubs.

With or without a vaccine, live music is going to look entirely different, says Alper. A reckoning was already on the horizon before COVID-19, because at least so far, most of today’s teens and twenty-somethings have not embraced going out to hear music.

Festivals – a staple of summer in Canada – are prohibited across Canada but event organizers, promoters and venues are coming up with ideas that would have sounded crazy just a few months ago.

Drive-in concerts, where fans stay in their cars, are the new rage. Restaurants are hiring bands to play from balconies and rooftops, solo acts and ensembles are heading off to driveways, lawns and porches for private concerts.

Alper has even heard of hotels renting out rooms to music fans to watch poolside concerts.

Home concerts – paid gigs of 40 or 50 people in a living room or, more likely these days, a backyard – will become more common, says Alper, especially if venues permanently shutter.

“I think they will come back in a big way. Artists love them because the audience actually listens to the music and the homeowner commits to selling the tickets.”

LIVING ON LIVESTREAMS

The irony is that while halls and arenas are dark, there has never been more live music being produced, says Benjamin at the CLMA, which represents show promoters, festival organizers and owners and operators of music venues.

Musicians in all genres and at all levels of celebrity are connecting with fans through livestreams, some selling tickets, usually at low dollar amounts, while others are asking fans for donations. Most livestreams are coming from an artist’s living room or recording studio, while a few have come from empty venues or with a very small and spaced out audience.

Benjamin says livestreams have provided much entertainment and relief in times of uncertainty, but can’t replace either the social or economic impact of in-person shows.

The live music industry in Canada accounts for 72,000 jobs – not including performers – and generates $3.5 billion in economic activity, according to the CLMA. Benjamin says 2020 was poised to be one of the biggest years in live music in Canada and globally, but in an industry dominated by small players operating on slim profit margins, COVID-19 has been devastating.

Where the true effect will be felt is at the venue level, says Benjamin. Her organization is predicting -- based on polls of members -- that up to 96 per cent of live music venues in Canada are in danger of being permanently shut down.

That will affect generations of artists to come who will have few places to perform and leave a void in communities across the country, says Benjamin. While non-profit festivals and theatres have been given some emergency relief and Toronto and Montreal are among municipalities rolling out financial support for music venues, the CLMA is lobbying for co-ordinated federal support for the industry to keep it afloat.

The Canadian Heritage Ministry earmarked $20 million this week for for-profit live music in Phase 2 of the $500-million COVID-19 Emergency Support Fund for Cultural, Heritage and Sport Organizations.

The money will go to artist managers, booking agents, concert promoters, for-profit festivals and venues through the Canada Music Fund.

In a statement, Benjamin welcoming the funding, saying it will be the first time for-profit live music will get federal support. “Unfortunately, we have already lost venues and companies. But this will make a difference for others, and comes not a moment too soon.”

Venues on the edge worry Larry Feudo, president of the Hamilton Musicians Union and a guitarist in blues band Trickbag. He says already underpaid musicians are going to be squeezed even tighter.

“When Live Nation is only guaranteeing 25 per cent of the usual rates for the big acts in arenas, you know things are going to be tough for everyone else.”

Trickbag was booked through September when COVID-19 swept in and wiped out the lucrative summer festival season.

“Everyone is starting to feel the pinch and hit the panic button,” says Feudo, who represents more than 600 local musicians.

Feudo is worried many venues won’t be able to outlast fear of the virus and that music lovers will get used to watching music online long-term.

“Live music may never come back as it was.”

Industry surveys indicate a majority of even the most diehard music lovers won’t return to live music venues for months and many not until there is a vaccine.

Benjamin worries that crowds won’t return even in 2021.

Veteran Canadian rocker Kim Mitchell says after a career of four decades, he is reconciled with the possibility that he may not tour again. He was just weeks into a tour for his first album in 13 years, The Big Fantasize, when the pandemic lockdown hit.

He says that will expand Bluesfest’s reputation and audience reach and give a wider platform to artists.

“I think virtual is going to play a role going forward. There are usually early adopters and late adopters but we’ve all been forced to be early adopters.”

Afro-pop singer Michelle Oluwatomi Akanbi, who performs under the name TOME, is one of the featured acts at The Together at the Drive-In event happening July 25-26 at the Stardust drive-in near Newmarket, Ont.

It was supposed to be a big year for her, including performances at South by Southwest in Austin, Tex. and a festival in Jamaica, but instead she released a new album and performed through livestreams.

“I’m just happy to be able to perform outside for a crowd, but it will feel different than a normal show,” the singer said from her Mississauga, Ont. home.

Fellow Together at the Drive-In performer DJ 4Korners, best known for his role as official DJ of the Toronto Raptors, says he’s impressed by the innovation happening in presenting live music as restrictions ease.

“Interacting with people is something I need more than I even thought. I can’t express how excited I am to do this event,” the Toronto resident told CTVNews.ca.

He’s hopeful many will embrace a new appreciation for live performance after the pandemic.

“I think we took it all for granted.”

Detectives arrested the group Thursday morning.

Los Angeles police had initially discounted a robbery theory in the days after the 20-year-old rapper's death February 19th at a home in the Hollywood Hills.

Pop Smoke's legal name is Bashar Barakah Jackson.

Captain Jonathan Tippet, who oversees the Los Angeles Police Department's elite Robbery-Homicide Division, said three men and two teenage boys likely went to the home because they knew Pop Smoke was there from social media posts.

They stole items from the home, though Tippet said he could not divulge what was taken.

The teens were 15 and 17 years old.

Tippet says they believe that it was a robbery and initially they didn't really have the evidence but then discovered some other evidence that showed this was likely a home invasion gone bad.

The five suspects were arrested yesterday morning as detectives served several search warrants in Los Angeles.

All are believed to be members of a South Los Angeles gang, which Tippet would not name, and at least some of them are believed to be linked to the 2019 homicide of an 18-year-old man when a fight escalated into a shooting outside the Rose Bowl in Pasadena.",[]
115,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/depp-at-libel-trial-says-heard-relationship-was-tailspin-1.5017212,"Depp, at libel trial, says Heard relationship was 'tailspin'",['Jill Lawless'],2020-07-09 09:53:00-04:00,"LONDON -- Johnny Depp denied assaulting ex-wife Amber Heard on a private Caribbean island and during a furious rampage in Australia in a third day of evidence Thursday in his libel suit against a tabloid newspaper that called him a ""wife-beater.""

Depp is suing News Group Newspapers, publisher of The Sun, and the paper's executive editor, Dan Wootton, over an April 2018 article that said he'd physically abused Heard. He strongly denies being violent to Heard.

Under cross-examination by The Sun's lawyer, Sasha Wass, Depp depicted a volatile relationship with Heard, during a period when he was trying to kick drugs and alcohol and sometimes lapsing. He said he came to feel he was in a ""constant tailspin"" but denied being violent.

Depp rejected Heard's claim that he subjected her to a ""three-day ordeal of assaults"" in March 2015 in Australia, where Depp was filming the fifth ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movie.

""I vehemently deny it and will go as far as to say it's pedestrian fiction,"" he said.

He said his relationship with Heard was a ""constant barrage of insults and demeaning footnotes and accusations of things that never happened.""

Depp and Wass sparred over disputed details of the Australia episode, which ended up with the couple's rented house being trashed and Depp's fingertip being severed to the bone.

Depp accuses Heard of cutting off his fingertip by throwing a vodka bottle at him. She denies being in the room when the digit was severed.

According to Heard, Depp snorted cocaine, swigged Jack Daniels from the bottle, smashed bottles, screamed at Heard, threw her against a ping pong table and broke a window.

""These are fabrications,"" he said.

He denied taking drugs but agreed that the couple had argued and at one point he ""decided to break my sobriety because I didn't care anymore. I needed to numb myself.""

Wass also alleged that Depp had lashed out at Heard during an attempt to break an addiction to the opioid Roxicodone on his private island in the Bahamas in 2014. He denied physical violence, but said Heard's claim that he was ""flipping"" and ""screaming"" might be accurate.

""I remember that I was in a great deal of pain and uncontrollable spasms and such. ΓÇª So flipping could be a word that was correct,"" he said.

""I was not in good shape. It was the lowest point I believe I've ever been in in my life.""

Depp accused Heard of telling ""porkie pies"" -- slang for lies -- about his behaviour. He acknowledged striking out at objects, saying it was better than ""taking it out on the person that I love.""

He denied he could have been physically abusive and not remember it.

""There were blackouts, sure, but in any blackout there are snippets of memory,"" Depp said.

On Wednesday Depp acknowledged that he may have done things he can't remember while he was under the influence of alcohol and drugs.

""I may have done things that I have no memory of,"" Depp said. But he insisted ""I am certainly not a violent person, especially with women.""

The Sun's defence relies on a total of 14 allegations by Heard of Depp's violence between 2013 and 2016.

The case is shining a light on the tempestuous relationship between Depp and Heard, who met on the set of the 2011 comedy ""The Rum Diary"" and married in Los Angeles in February 2015. Heard, a model and actress, filed for divorce the following year and obtained a restraining order against Depp on the grounds of domestic abuse. The divorce was finalized in 2017.

While neither Heard, 34, nor 57-year-old Depp is on trial, the case is a showdown between the former spouses, who accuse each other of being controlling, violent and deceitful during their tempestuous marriage.

Wass read the court an email to Depp that Heard had composed in 2013 but never sent, saying he was ""like Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. Half of you I love madly, and the other half scares me.""

Depp accused Heard of making up ""hoax"" abuse claims. He has acknowledged heavy drinking and drug use, but said Heard's claim that drugs and alcohol made him a monster was ""delusional.""

He also denied claims he hit Heard when she laughed at one of his tattoos, dangled her Yorkshire terrier, Pistol, out a car window and threatened to put the dog in a microwave.

Depp acknowledged having a ""rather skewed"" sense of humour and said the microwave comment was a running joke because the dog was so tiny.

Heard is attending the three-week trial and is expected to give evidence later.

Depp is also suing Heard for US$50 million in the U.S. for allegedly defaming him in a Washington Post article about domestic abuse. That case is due to be heard next year.",[]
116,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/memoirs-and-misinformation-jim-carrey-gets-real-with-a-satirical-fictional-memoir-1.5017333,'Memoirs and Misinformation': Jim Carrey gets real with a satirical fictional memoir,['Jake Coyle'],2020-07-09 11:09:00-04:00,"NEW YORK -- When Jim Carrey and Dana Vachon handed in the book they had toiled on for eight years -- a satirical ""anti-memoir"" about Carrey's life but with increasingly extreme flights of absurdity -- to Sonny Mehta, the late Knopf publisher said he would put it out as a novel. Carrey and Vachon protested.

""But Sonny, the project was to blow up the celebrity memoir,"" they argued.

""Well, yes,"" replied Mehta. ""But how then would you explain the flying saucers?""

""Memoirs and Misinformation,"" which was published Tuesday, is not an easy book to label. It opens with Carrey binge-watching Netflix while nursing a split from Renee Zellweger (who, here, leaves him for a bullfighter), pleading for his home security system to ""Tell me I'm safe and loved"" and craving the box-office success that brought him ""closer to god.""

There's much that's straight from Carrey's life, but it's an inflated version of his persona -- ""a hyperactive child making yuk-yuks,"" as the book describes him. With overtones of ""Network,"" Carrey skewers celebrity, Hollywood, ego and himself. There's Brazilian jiu-jitsu with Nic Cage, spiritual guru gatherings with Kelsey Grammar and a Tom Cruise referenced only as ""Laser Jack Lightning."" Carrey, himself, is juggling movie options: a Mao Zedong film by Charlie Kaufman or ""Hungry Hungry Hippos"" in 3-D. Oh, and an apocalypse is approaching.

It may sound far-out, but for Carrey, truth lies in fiction. Even fiction in which Kelsey Grammar and U.F.O.s collide.

""There's a lot of real feeling in this book,"" said Carrey in a Zoom interview from his home in Hawaii. ""It may be done in an out-there way but it sure is real to me.""

""Memoirs and Misinformation"" is the latest reinvention of the 58-year-old star of ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective,"" ""The Mask,"" ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" and ""The Truman Show."" After veering into painting and political cartoons, it's yet another new medium for Carrey. (Vachon wrote 2007's ""Mergers & Acquisitions."") The book, Carrey says, ""is dearer to me than anything I've done.""

The ""illusion of persona"" is the chief subject of ""Memoirs and Misinformation."" In the last decade or more, Carrey has worked to deconstruct the best-known version of himself and make room for an emotional life that his public identity -- ""unflappably fun,"" Carrey calls it -- didn't allow. He has spoken about bouts with depression and his ongoing spiritual journey. He has worked less frequently and sought satisfaction away from Hollywood.

""All personas after a while become sarcophagal. You want to claw your way out of them,"" says Carrey. ""You're met all the time with `Why don't you just be funny?' I go, `Well, funny is one of the fingers on my hand.' But I'm learning to use the whole hand.""

Make no mistake: ""Memoirs and Misinformation"" is funny. But it's also a sober meditation on mortality, selfhood and the drive to entertain. A conventional memoir was never an option. ""At the very least they're reordered for effect,"" says Carrey.

""From an early age, what I've always noticed about Jim is that he can change form,"" says Vachon, who, after flying out to finish the book, has been stranded in Hawaii by the pandemic. ""His memoir needed to be one that did that because that's his truth.""

For Carrey, a cartoonishly malleable, head-to-toe comedian of absurdist abandon, the urge to perform began in his working-class upbringing outside Toronto with a mother who fought depression and prescription pills and a father he calls ""a magical being.""

""I watched him be animated and loving in sharing this gift that he had. I went: That's a great thing to be,"" says Carrey, the youngest of four. ""I could make my mother feel better. A lot of comics come from moms in need. My mother was a child of alcoholics and she didn't get the love that she needed, so her kids were there to give her that love that she was missing. Especially me. I thought I could heal her. I thought I could save her life.""

That desire to be bigger than yourself and to bring joy to others is something Carrey both values sincerely and considers dangerous. ""If it becomes an addiction to exceptionalism,"" he says, ""that's a bad place to be.""

The book reminds Carrey's longtime friend and ""The Cable Guy"" director Judd Apatow of when he first met Carrey. He was then a successful impressionist who, ""on a dime,"" stopped doing impressions and began improvising his entire act, Apatow recalls. ""It was like he just cracked open his brain to see what was inside.""

""We all start out young and ambitious and we have our dreams and we think our dreams will make us happy,"" says Apatow. ""And I think Jim was aware very early on that that's not how it would go down.""

Carrey isn't sure when he began to feel ""Jim Carrey"" cleaving away from himself. Fame was fun, he says, until it wasn't.

""I tripped along for a long time,"" Carrey says. ""No one understands the value of anonymity until they lose it. You could say, `Well, that's what you asked for.' Yes, but it's what a child asks for before they become an adult and understands what something means. I'm not saying it's a bad thing, but it's an odd thing and it keeps you in the house.""

There were low points. After the apparent suicide of Carrey's former girlfriend Cathriona White, he was sued for wrongful death by White's husband and her mother. Carrey denied involvement and counter-sued. By 2018, the suits were dismissed. ""Memoirs and Misinformation"" features plenty of farce, but there are also scenes of Hollywood tragedy that echo some of Carrey's heartaches.

""It really became an exercise of being able to say the things that are important to say in the most creative and abstract way possible and to deal with real painful and jarring movements in my life,"" says Carrey.

Lately, Carrey has seemed to find an equilibrium. He's starring in ""Kidding,"" a Showtime series with darker and more melancholic tones, and he was widely praised for his performance in ""Hungry Hungry Hippo"" -- correction, ""Sonic the Hedgehog."" He has been busy sending out letters and book copies to everyone who makes cameos in the book.

""You can't make a book about persona without personas,"" says Carrey, quickly noting ""it's done with love."" ""One day I had to call Nic (Cage) and say, `I wrote you into my fictitious memoir.' I hardly got the sentence out and he said, `I'm so honoured.' He was amazed I had given him all the best lines.""

Is Carrey at peace? ""I get there,"" he says, smiling. As eager as he seems to be to take ""Jim Carrey"" and tear him to pieces, he seems -- at least through a computer window thousands of miles away -- at ease in his own skin.

""Whatever it was, it was the perfect cocktail to get us here to this moment,"" Carrey says of his life. ""So I don't regret it at all.""",[]

The actress, who previously starred in ""God Friended Me"" on CBS, is set to debut in the iconic role in January 2021.

Leslie replaces Ruby Rose, who left the show in May after one season in a shocking move.

""I am extremely proud to be the first Black actress to play the iconic role of Batwoman on television, and as a bisexual woman, I am honored to join this groundbreaking show which has been such a trailblazer for the LGBTQ+ community,"" Leslie said in a statement.

Ryan, who will be lesbian on the series, is described as a ""likable, messy, a little goofy and untamed,"" according to a description.

Notably, she's also described as ""nothing like Kate Kane, the woman who wore the Batsuit before her"" and ""not your stereotypical all-American hero.""

The character is a former drug runner who now lives in a van.

""I'm outraged today because I'd rather be paying for 8-year-old Secoriea Turner's college than her funeral,"" Perry said in a statement to People magazine. ""When does this end?""

Secoriea was riding in a Jeep Cherokee with her mother and another adult on Saturday night when they encountered ""a makeshift roadblock that was manned by numerous armed individuals,"" Atlanta police Lt. Pete Malecki said. When the driver tried to go around the roadblock, shots were fired and the girl was hit, Malecki told reporters at a news conference Tuesday.

Police released a short video Tuesday of an armed man who they described as a person of interest in the girl's shooting. Malecki said the video comes from a surveillance camera near where Secoriea was shot. It shows a Black man in a white shirt and dark pants carrying an AR-15 rifle with a tan stock and grip.

A reward of up to $20,000 has been offered for information leading to the arrest and indictment of a suspect in the case.

The girl was shot near the Wendy's restaurant where a Black man, Rayshard Brooks, was killed by a white police officer June 12. The fast food outlet was later burned, and the area has since become a site for frequent demonstrations against police brutality. Perry also paid for Brooks' funeral last month.",[]

The Grammy-winning vocal group filed the lawsuit on Wednesday in federal court after negotiations with Anita White broke down in recent weeks. According to the lawsuit, the band is seeking a ruling that their use of the trademark ""Lady A"" does not infringe on White's alleged trademark rights of the same name. The band is not seeking monetary damages.

The group made up Hillary Scott, Charles Kelley and Dave Haywood announced the name change last month, saying they were regretful for not taking into consideration the word antebellum's associations with slavery.

But White, who has been releasing blues and soul music for years as Lady A, complained publicly that the band never reached out to her before changing their name. Negotiations over the name failed to reach an agreement. A manager for White did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

According to the lawsuit, the band applied for trademarks for the name ""Lady A"" for entertainment services and for use on clothing back in 2010 and no oppositions were filed by any person or entity.

""When we learned that Ms. White had also been performing under the name Lady A, we had heartfelt discussions with her about how we can all come together and make something special and beautiful out of this moment,"" said the group in a statement.

In the now-shuttered world of musical theatre, the name “Hamilton” is said in hushed reverential tones. The groundbreaking show, which mixes-and-matches hip hop, R&B, pop, soul and traditional show tunes to tell the story of American Founding Father Alexander Hamilton, was called “the phenomenon of the season, perhaps of a generation,” by Forbes.

Its appeal to a younger audience, who packed NYC’s Richard Rodgers Theater night after night, gave Broadway a desperately needed shot in the arm and at one point the show was responsible for more than 5% of the Broadway districts total gross.

A new, filmed version, headed by creator Lin-Manuel Miranda, offers up a chance for people who couldn’t afford to blow a mortgage payment on tickets to the original production to watch the show from the comfort of their Disney+ stream.

The movie, shot in June 2016 at the height of “Hamilton”-mania is anything but hushed or reverential. The show, which features a diverse cast including Black, LatinX and Asian actors to tell the story described as being about “America then, as told by America now,” is passionately political, raucously rebellious and emotionally deep.

“Just like my country, I’m young, scrappy and hungry,” Miranda sings in a phrase that could be about the musical as much as it is Hamilton’s personality.

A toe-tapping history lesson, the show details the American Dream life of Hamilton, from an outsider born to unwed parents on the Caribbean island of Nevis to war hero to George Washington's Revolutionary War aide, and, as first Secretary of Treasury under Washington's administration, the founder of America’s economic system. It’s a bootstrap story about legacy, reputation, honor and if that wasn’t enough, there’s an extra-marital affair and, of course, the fateful duel with Aaron Burr.

Director Thomas Kail, who also directed the show’s Off-Broadway and Broadway productions, keeps the camera work to a minimum, simply and effectively capturing the show from a front row center perspective. It’s handsome work that tries to preserve the integrity of the live presentation while still creating a kind of cinematic experience.

As far as the show goes, what the filmed “Hamilton” presents is a moment in time when the musical lived at the very center of pop culture. The original cast, including Miranda, Phillipa Soo, Leslie Odom Jr., Daveed Diggs and Jonathan Groff among many others, are working in peak form.

As a document of a special show the filmed version doesn’t add anything to the presentation, but perhaps that’s the point. Miranda’s daring, genre busting show speaks for itself, often with beautiful tongue-twisting wordplay, and doesn’t need flashy cinematic theatrics to bolster what is already a provocative and timely story of creating a union where none existed.

SHIRLEY: 3 ½ STARS

When reclusive author Shirley Jackson died in 1965 she left behind a body of work, including “The Haunting of Hill House,” a supernatural horror novel sometimes called one of the best ghost stories ever written.

An influence on two generations of speculative fiction writers like Neil Gaiman, Stephen King, Sarah Waters and Richard Matheson, she is brought to vivid life in a new fictionalized drama, now on VOD, starring Elisabeth Moss.

Set just after the publication of “The Lottery,” a controversial short story about the ritual sacrifice of a town citizen to ensure good crops, published in a 1948 issue of The New Yorker, the film sees Shirley (Moss) paralyzed by the expectations that hang heavy over “Hangsaman,” a novel she is struggling to complete. Prickly and quick with a line, she is less than pleased when Stanley (Michael Stuhlbarg), her college professor husband, arranges for his new assistant Fred Nemser (Logan Lerman) and his pregnant wife Rose (Odessa Young) to live in their house while the young couple searches for a place of their own.

As the days and weeks stretch into months the relationship between the two couples becomes a blend of art and reality, a claustrophobic rabbit hole where Rose becomes the model for Shirley’s new main character, a college student who went walking on Vermont's Long Trail hiking route and never returned.

“Shirley” uses elements of Jackson’s life but places them in context of one of her novels. The result is a psychological drama; a haunting look at a person driven to agoraphobia by the weight of her success and a domineering, philandering husband.

Moss is fascinating as the title character. Her take on Shirley is that of a woman who has lived under years of oppression by her bullying husband, a man whose misogyny has left her embittered, desperate and anxious.

“To our suffering,” Stanley says as a toast to his wife. “There’s not enough Scotch in the world for that,” Shirley snorts, in a line that could have been borrowed from “Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” She’s vulnerable and filled with rage, compassionate and spiteful, often in the same scene.

Shirley and Stanley, as compelling as they are as characters, do not comprise the film’s defining relationship. Director Josephine Decker feeds on the psychological aspects of Jackson’s work to tease out a story of Shirley and Rose, two women drawn together by frustration, talent and obsession over the missing woman at the heart of the new novel.

""Let's pray for a boy,” Shirley says to the pregnant Rose, “The world is too cruel for girls.” Their time on screen together is complicated, occasionally unsettling as reality and imagination meld. It’s fascinating work in a film that is a slow burn.

“Shirley” takes its time to get where it is going, building an atmosphere of oppression slowly and carefully. Decker’s distorted dream-like visual approach is often beautiful, as though we’re watching the film through a psychological prism. It creates atmosphere but doesn’t provide the thrills that Jackson herself might have been able to infuse into the telling of this tale.

AMERICAN WOMAN: 3 STARS

“American Woman,” the first feature directed by “Mad Men” producer and writer Semi Chellas, is a fictionalized version of real events. A series of title cards set the stage. The year is 1975. “After multiple investigations, the President of the United States has been forced to resign.” “America’s disastrous involvement in the war in Vietnam is finally coming to an end.” “Some radicals still believe a revolution is necessary.”

Amid this time of political turmoil is Jenny Shimada (Hong Chau), a bomb maker who once blew up a draft board office. On the run, she is hiding out in upstate New York, working as a house keeper for a rich, conservative woman (Ellen Burstyn). She comes out of her semi-retirement when a publisher and old colleague-in-the-cause contacts her with a new mission. He wants her to look after three fugitive Symbionese Liberation Army members, Juan (John Gallagher), his wife Yvonne (Lola Kirke), and Pauline (Sarah Gadon), the kidnapped daughter of a newspaper magnate, as they write a book about their experiences.

“You can’t just sit around waiting to die or be caught,” she tells them. “You have to start writing. Write the book, make the money. It’s the only way you’ll survive underground.” Jenny’s reward? Enough cash to leave the country.

The basics of the story are borrowed from the well documented kidnapping and radicalization, of American heiress Patty Hearst. Pauline is an obvious surrogate for Hearst while Jenny is a fictionalized version of Wendy Yoshimura, the woman who was with Patty Hearst when she was apprehended.

The names have been changed and some of the details, but this sharply written story isn’t a history lesson. It’s a study of people who have chosen a radical path in life. It showcases Jaun’s ideological rantings but also wonders aloud if Pauline truly converted to the cause or was simply trying to survive. “I don’t want to be an outlaw,” she says. “Outlaws always die at the end of the story.”

Add in themes on toxic masculinity—Juan may be a free thinker but his behavior toward women is anything but enlightened—sexuality, class, gender and race and you have film big on ideas while leaving the action scenes for other movies.

“American Woman” is a movie that values words. Some may find the storytelling a bit too low key for such an explosive subject, but the performances, particularly Chau, give the story layers. Chellas, who wrote the script in addition to directing, uses the main characters, Jenny and Pauline, as conduits to help us understand a complicated and slow-simmer story of survival.

STRANGE BUT TRUE: 3 ½ STARS

“Strange But True,” a neo-noir thriller on VOD starring Amy Ryan and Margaret Qualley, examines grief in the context of an ordinary family thrown into extraordinary situations.

The action takes place against the backdrop of loss. Five years ago Ronnie Chase (Connor Jessup) and Melissa’s (Margaret Qualley) prom night began as they all do, with a rented tux, a frilly dress and proud parents taking photos. It ended in tragedy, with Ronnie dead in a car crash, an event that sent shock waves through the family. Stricken, his folks Charlene (Amy Ryan) and Richard (Greg Kinnear), split under the weight of their grief. Younger brother Philip (Nick Robinson) hightails it to NYC to pursue his dream of being a photographer and girlfriend Melissa is wracked with guilt, left with only her dreams of her late boyfriend.

Cut to present day. Charlene’s life has fallen apart. Her husband and job are gone, so when Melissa shows up, five years after the fateful night, claiming she is pregnant with Ronnie’s baby, she is not met with hugs and congratulations.

“If you think about it,” says Phillip, home recuperating from a badly broken leg, “there’s a chance what she said is true. If, and it’s a big if, if Ronnie’s sperm was somehow frozen before he died there’s a chance Melissa could have used it and impregnated herself years later.”

“That’s ridiculous,” Charlene snarls. “He was a teenager with his whole life ahead of him. Why would he do that?”

She sets off to find a rational explanation while Phillip grasps at straws, consulting psychics and leaving no possibility off the table. “I might not believe that this is Ronnie’s baby,” he says to Melissa,” but I believe that you believe it and I believe that Ronnie would have too. If that makes me an uncle, so be it.”

That search is the bedrock for a story packed with secrets and intrigue. Adapted from John Searles’s 2004 novel, “Strange But True” is a bit of a nesting doll of mysteries. Everyone has a backstory and a different relationship with the intrigue that forms the plot and the action toggles between past and present. That means there’s a lot to wade through in the film’s tight ninety-minute running time but director Rowan Athale manages it. He weaves psychological drama, a hint of paranormal, suspense and even some gothic horror into the story.

In the end, the pregnancy is a McGuffin, simply a device to put all these elements into motion, but the result is a tightly wound thriller that leads to a gripping and satisfying conclusion.",[]
123,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/movie-reviews-eurovision-song-contest-not-as-funny-as-it-ought-to-be-1.4996231,Movie reviews: 'Eurovision Song Contest' not as funny as it ought to be,[],2020-06-26 08:00:00-04:00,"EUROVISION SONG CONTEST: THE STORY OF FIRE SAGA: 2 STARS

Will Ferrell is a wonderfully weird and committed actor. Like a dog with a bone when he latches onto a part he doesn't let go, come hell or high water. When it works, it really works, and the result is an indelible comedic creation like the deluded Ron Burgundy that not only makes us laugh, but also reveals the character's humanity. When it doesn't work, as in ""Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga,"" now streaming on Netflix, it is all commitment and little humanity.

Ferrell plays Lars, a middle-aged Icelander whose love for the Eurovision Song Contest began in 1974 when he was dancing in front of the TV to ABBA's winning performance of ""Waterloo,"" much to his father's (Pierce Brosnan) chagrin. No one believes in his musical dreams except for his childhood friend Sigrit (Rachel McAdams), who loves him even though her affections don't seem to be reciprocated. She believes in elves and drops little pearls of wisdom like, ""Anger cannot churn butter.""

Together they are Fire Saga, a synth-pop duo who play to crowds at the local pub who only want to hear songs like ""Ja Ja Ding Dong,"" and not the ""real music"" Lars writes. Through a series of unlikely events they stumble into a spot on the Eurovision show. Lars' father doesn't want them to go. ""All of Iceland will laugh at you,"" he says. Undeterred, Lars soldiers on. ""I have to become an international star to prove to my very handsome father and all of Iceland that I have not wasted my life.""

Lars and Sigrit's experiences in their tiny fishing village of Húsav´ík do not prepared them for the cutthroat world of Eurovision. Will predatory singers, like Russian superstar Alexander Lemtov (Dan Stevens with a George Michael frosted-tip bouffant), and stage mishaps dampen Lars' dreams of Eurovision fame?

""Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga"" should be a lot funnier than it is. It's a little too loving of Eurovision's kitschy spectacle to be a satire; a little too sincere to be truly silly, despite Ferrell's ridiculous hair and even more outlandish sweaters. The comedy is further blunted by the film's main conceit: that Lars and Sigrit are talentless wannabees. ""We all know they are awful,"" says the local Húsav´ík cop, ""but they are our awful."" Thing is, in context, they fit like a puzzle piece next to other over-the-top acts the movie showcases.

Ferrell brings the usual commitment to his trademarked arrogant man-child character, but never pushes the characterization much beyond the way the townsfolk see him. ""Lars is weird,"" they all say, and Ferrell obliges, playing the character as the result of a damaged psyche — he feels unwanted by his father — and just a little too much confidence. It's familiar ground for him and us.

McAdams feels like an odd choice to play opposite Ferrell's exaggerated character. She's good, but her more natural performance feels like it belongs in another movie.

The real Eurovision Song Contest won't be happening this year, another victim of COVID-19, so perhaps ""The Story of Fire Saga"" will fill that gap for fans. If you tune in expect some scattered good moments. Ferrell delivers a few laughs and Stevens has fun, but Lars and Sigrit's protracted love story pushes the movie to an unwieldy 123 minutes with not quite enough laughs to justify the running time.

IRRESISTIBLE: 3 ½ STARS

Big time politics invades small town America in “Irresistible,” an election-year satire from director Jon Stewart, now available on VOD.

Former “Daily Show” correspondent Steve Carell reteams with his old boss to play Gary Zimmer, a Washington insider and the Democratic National Committee's top strategist.

In the midst of creating a strategy to win votes in America’s Republican heartland—""We need some way to road test a more rural friendly message,” he says.—he’s directed to a YouTube video of retired Marine colonel Jack Hastings (Chris Cooper), giving an impassioned speech in defense of undocumented workers at a townhall meeting in Deerlaken, a small right-wing Wisconsin town.

He’s like “John Wayne and tractor had a baby,” says Gary as he concocts a plan to entice Hastings to run for mayor of Deerlaken, giving the Dems a strong presence in a state sea of red.

“Colonel Jack Hastings is our key back into the swing state of Wisconsin,” Gary says. “He just doesn’t know it yet.”

The citified Gary takes off his suit and tie, buys some dungarees and jumps on a private jet to Deerlaken to win over the colonel and his daughter (Mackenzie Davis), who is first seen with her arm inserted where the sun don’t shine, giving relief to a constipated cow. Appealing to Hastings’ sense of duty, Gary convinces the Marine to run and fires up the political machine.

Soon Deerlaken is overrun with Democratic operatives—like demographic profilers played by Topher Grace and Natasha Lyonne—but the real race heats up when the Republican National Committee sends in Faith (Rose Byrne), Gary’s nemesis and now campaign manager to Hastings’ rival.

“Twenty bucks says I do better with fear than you do with shame,” she says, taunting Gary. Soon the national media takes notice and the mayoral race in Deerlaken becomes one of the most debated elections in the country.

There’s more, but that would involve giving away a plot twist and spoilers. Just keep in mind that the word “resist” is tucked away in the film’s title.

“Irresistible” is equal parts heartfelt and darkly humorous. Stewart begins conventionally enough, with the fish out of water story of bigshot Gary in a town of rubes, then slowly calibrates the story to ask, “Who are the real rubes here?”

It’s a damning indictment of how political situations are manipulated, how the media allows outright lies on the airwaves, and how both Democrats and Republicans are culpable and clueless to the real needs of the people.

It doesn’t exactly blaze new ideological ground but the as a reminder of why the political system is twisted and broken, it’s a timely tale.

HAMMER: 3 ½ STARS

“Hammer,” a new VOD thriller starring Will Patton, uses many of the genre’s puzzle pieces but rearranges them in a new and interesting way.

Chris (Mark O’Brien) is having a very bad day. Estranged from his parents and deep in debt to some very bad people, he arranges a deal with an old associate, Adams (Ben Cotton). They arrange to meet on a rural road to exchange $200,000 in cash in return for drugs. The deal goes wrong, bullets are fired. Adams (Ben Cotton) and his girlfriend Lori (Dayle McLeod) are wounded as Chris, covered in blood splatter, makes a getaway on a motorcycle with the drugs and money.

As he speeds through town, his father Stephen (Will Patton), out doing errands, spots him and immediately knows something is wrong. The situation escalates as Adams, looking to find Chris and the stash, grabs Chris’ younger brother Jeremy (Connor Price) as a hostage.

“You haven’t changed,” Stephen says as he and Chris drive toward an uncertain outcome. “You haven’t changed one bit.”

Just after everything goes sideways in Chris’ life director Christian Sparkes stages a scene in a cornfield that tells us everything we need to know about Chris in one potent image. Hidden among the plants is a snake devouring itself. It’s a quick shorthand for the cyclical nature of Chris’ self-destruction.

He’s been in trouble before, and the imagery suggests the pattern will continue, even if he makes it out of this scrape alive. It’s details like this that elevate a standard crime drama, complete with crooked ex-colleagues, innocent family members and bad debts, from the same-old to something new.

But it is the father and son relationship that gives the movie its momentum. It asks, and mostly answers, big questions about unconditional love and how far a father will go to help his son. Sparkes builds tension all the way through the tight eighty-minute running time but never forgets to allow the relationship between the father and his ne’er do well son to slip from the forefront of the storytelling.

“Hammer” is an engaging and offbeat thriller that makes the most of its lead performances. O’Brien manages to make Chris almost likable despite his constant foul-ups and Patton, as a father caught up in a breathless situation, is all strength and goodwill, even when he’s doing terrible things. Why this wasn’t released on Father’s Day I’ll never know.

EXIT PLAN: 1 ½ STARS

The name “Exit Plan” sounds like one of those 1990s direct-to-VHS action titles that might have starred Don ‘The Dragon’ Wilson or someone with a famous last name like Don Swayze, Frank Stallone or Chad McQueen. That this movie, new to VOD this week, stars Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, he who played Jaime Lannister on the blood-soaked “Game of Thrones,” would further suggest chills and thrills.

Instead, it is an anti-action, minor key movie. A film so stark and dreary that you might want to plan to hit the exit button on your remote.

Coster-Waldau plays Max, a mild-mannered insurance investigator who shares his life with wife Laerke (Tuva Novotny) and cat Simba. His latest case, the disappearance of man, presumed dead, leads him to a place called the Hotel Aurora, a Scandinavian resort where people go to meet their “beautiful end.”

It’s a fortuitous turn of events for Max, whose attempts to hang and drown himself were unsuccessful. He’s suffering from an inoperable terminal brain tumour and wants to end it all before the pain becomes too much for him and his family to bear.

But, what seems to be the answers to his problems raises some very troubling questions in Max’s mind.

“Exit Plan” deals in some heavy human dilemmas, but is as cold and angular as the glass and steel that make up the façade of the Hotel Aurora. The mix-and-match of real and illusory makes Max’s existential crisis hard to grasp, impossible to care about.

Even the meaning of a late-stage mystery twist, as Max decides he wants out of the hotel, is obscured by flashbacks and dream sequences, leading to a conclusion that promises to make a point but fails to deliver. Add to that obtuse dialogue like, “You can go but you can’t escape,” that sounds like a rough draft of the “Hotel California” lyrics and you have a movie that promises much but delivers very little.",[]

He was 51.

O'Brien mixed humour and pathos in chronicling his four-year illness on his blog The Big Diseasey and had posted a meditation about faith -- or lack thereof -- just hours before his death.

He died at his Winnipeg home on Sunday night, said his agent Lisa Marie Schwartz.

""(He) was not only an amazing actor but a great friend,"" Schwartz said in a statement.

""Corner Gas"" executive producer Virginia Thompson said O'Brien's blog, which included satirical observations on his condition and poignant musings about his time left, is his legacy.

O'Brien's ability to find humour in even the bleakest situation was one of his defining traits, Thompson said.

""The thing about people that truly understand comedy is they have a way of twisting things so that we can see things in a different light. They see the irony of the world and they're able to deliver it to us,"" Thompson said in a telephone interview.

""That's exactly the guy that was on our set. That's the guy that we fell in love with.""

Last November, O'Brien blended fact and humour in a mock obituary he penned for his blog.

Facts about his life, such as his childhood spent in Victoria and Inuvik and his adult years living in Regina and Winnipeg, appeared alongside a self-deprecating summary of his professional accomplishments.

""As an actor, he made you feel like he was standing right where the director told him to stand; a skill he shared with Olivier, Brando and many puppets,"" O'Brien wrote.

""As a radio producer, he boosted television ratings. As a comedy writer, he was tall.""

In reality, O'Brien's resume was both more diverse and more celebrated. He began his career as a journalist for the Medicine Hat News and Regina Leader Post and eventually switched to acting.

He landed recurring roles on some prominent Canadian comedies and is best known for his portrayal of Wes Humboldt, the combination liquor store owner and insurance salesman on CTV's ""Corner Gas.""

Thompson said O'Brien quickly became a beloved member of the ""Corner Gas"" family, adding that cast members organized a fundraiser for him and his family when his cancer was first diagnosed in 2011.

Series star Brent Butt took to social media to express his condolences.

""Sad to say, the lovely & clever Mike O'Brien -- who, among many things, played Wes Humboldt on 'Corner Gas' -- has passed away. .CancerSucks,"" Butt tweeted.

O'Brien also had a recurring role on the HBO Canada comedy ""Less than Kind.""

But it was radio where he spent the better part of his later career, working largely as a comedy writer for the CBC.

On his blog, O'Brien penned a largely serious post on the subject of faith in the hours before he died, downplaying the role of religion in his life and expressing more confidence in his medical team.

He also referenced the wife and four-year-old son he left behind, citing optimism for their future as a key source of comfort.

""Above all, I have faith Robin will guide Will toward a fine life,"" he said. ""That's the belief I treasure the most.""

In an interview with CTV Vancouver Island, 'Corner Gas' actor Mike O'Brien spoke about making the most of the time he has left.",[]

California police confirmed late Wednesday that Rivera rented a pontoon boat at the Lake Piru reservoir and that her 4-year-old son was found aboard wearing a life vest.

""We're going on the belief that she did go in the water and we have not been able to locate her. So this may well be a case of drowning,"" Captain Eric Buschow said during a news conference.

Rivera’s disappearance is the latest tragedy to strike the cast of ""Glee."" The program ran for six seasons from 2009 to 2015 and was considered by critics as one of the cheeriest shows on TV at the time. However, the years since its conclusion have been tumultuous for some of its cast and crew, leading to claims that the show is ""cursed.""

CTVNews.ca looks at some of the other deaths, controversies, and tragedies associated with the popular TV series:

NAYA RIVERA'S ARREST

Before her suspected drowning, Naya Rivera, who played cheerleader Santana Lopez in 113 episodes of the hit musical show, was arrested in November 2017 for domestic battery. The 31-year-old's then-husband, actor Ryan Dorsey, told a deputy that she struck him in the head and face. The couple were reportedly arguing over their son.

The charges were dropped in January 2018, after Dorsey decided not to seek prosecution. The couple finalized their divorce in June 2018, after nearly four years of marriage.

MARK SALLING'S CRIMINAL CHARGES AND DEATH

Mark Salling, who played Noah 'Puck' Puckerman on the show, died by suicide in late January 2018, months after he pleaded guilty to possessing child pornography. He was due to be sentenced in March 2018, and could have faced four to seven years in prison. Prosecutors said a search in May 2016 found more than 50,000 images of child porn on a computer and thumb drive belonging to Salling.

An autopsy later determined that Salling died from asphyxia after hanging himself. The 35-year-old's body was found in a riverbed area in northeast Los Angeles. The actor had appeared in only a handful of projects before his breakout role in ""Glee” and dated co-star Rivera from 2007 to 2010.

CORY MONTEITH'S DRUG OVERDOSE

Canadian actor Cory Monteith, who played quarterback-turned-singer Finn Hudson, was found dead in a Vancouver hotel room in July 2013. A coroner's report blamed the 31-year-old's death on a fatal combination of heroin and alcohol. Four months before his death, Monteith had completed a stint in rehab.

The star's mother later confirmed that Monteith had battled substance abuse since his early teens. While he managed to get clean for a time, she told People Magazine that Monteith fell back into bad habits when he went to Hollywood and began using drugs again in December 2012.

Monteith was dating co-star Lea Michele at the time of his death. Michele, who is expecting her first child with husband Zandy Reich, began dating Monteith in 2012. At the time of his death, Michele issued a statement saying, ""There was no greater man than Cory. So, for the time we spent together, I consider myself very lucky.""

Monteith was set to return to ""Glee""for the fifth season after having missed the last few episodes of the fourth season while attending rehab. His death has been considered by fans and cast members as the start of the show's decline.

CREW MEMBERS' PASSING

Between 2013 and 2014, two of the show's crew members died. Three months after Monteith's 2013 death, the show’s assistant director Jim Fuller suddenly passed away in his sleep. He died of suspected heart failure at just 41.

Production assistant Nancy Motes, who is also the half-sister of actor Julia Roberts, died in February 2014. Motes died aged 37 after drowning in her bathtub. She was found surrounded by non-prescription and prescription medications, according to the Los Angeles County Coroner. Motes left a suicide note describing Roberts as a “so-called sibling” and claimed Roberts drove her into a deep depression.

MELISSA BENOIST REVEALS SHE IS SURVIVOR OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

Melissa Benoist, who currently stars as Supergirl in the CW series, joined the cast of Glee in 2012 during the show’s fourth season, where she played Marley Rose for 42 episodes.

Last November, the 31-year-old shared a 14-minute long video on Instagram detailing her past experience with intimate partner violence from a previous relationship. She does not name her abuser, but described him as “charming, funny” but also “manipulative” and “devious”.

What began as jealousy and possessiveness escalated to violence several months into their relationship, she said in the video. Benoist detailed being repeatedly slapped, punched, dragged by her hair, choked, and slammed against a wall hard enough to break the drywall. She revealed that an eye injury she had previously attributed to being accident-prone on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon in 2016 was a result of abuse during the relationship. The injury, which she said tore her iris and nearly ruptured her eyeball, left her eye permanently damaged.

LEA MICHELE CONTROVERSY

Lea Michele, who played Rachel Berry on the show, has been plagued by rumours in recent weeks after various cast and crew members accused the show's lead actress of bullying on-set.

Former co-star Samantha Marie Ware accused Michele of ""traumatic microaggressions that made me question a career in Hollywood."" Michele is white and Ware is Black. The comments were made in early June amid growing anti-Black racism protests across the U.S following the death of George Floyd, a Black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee into his neck for several minutes.

Michele tweeted her support of Black Lives Matter movement and said police violence on Black people must end. Ware responded by tweeting that Michele had made her first TV job a ""living hell."" Other co-stars then piled on with their own allegations, including Heather Morris, Dabier Snell and Yvette Nicole Brown.

Michele issued a statement a few days later saying that, while she didn't recall any incident or judge anyone by their background, she was sorry and blamed her privilege and ""immaturity.""

Some farmers rejoice after much needed rain falls across Southern Ontario, Friday.

Agriculture in Chatham-Kent is a $3-billion dollar industry that provides over 16,000 jobs.

But the harsh heat felt across Ontario has some farmers concerned for the health of their harvest.

Leon Leclair, former Chatham-Kent councillor and present farmer says he was ""worried"" for his land; all 1000-acres of it.

""Without rain we have nothing...no rain and all that heat, the question was...was I worried? I was definitely worried,"" says Leclair.

""In 40-years of farming for me, the (heat) has never been this bad.""

Environment Canada reports that areas in Chatham-Kent saw just under 75 millimetres of rain overnight, which Leclair says is the perfect amount for his Sugar-Bean-fields.

""Last nights rain was just awesome for me... the sugar-bean-field has seen limited rain. Yesterday I’m walking around the field worried, (then) we got three inches (of rain) and my land took all the water with no damage.""

If farmland receives an overflow of water, there is a draining system nearby that pumps the excess water into Lake Saint Clair.

Leclair says the water designing system is the second-largest in all of Canada.

A large downpour of rain also brings the risk of basement flooding.

Leclair says that the drainage system is built to help with that as well.

""In Chatham-Kent the basement flooding is draining into this drain also so they are benefiting from it. Some of the sub pumps may go into a combined sewer but some water will also drain into this drain,"" says Leclair.",[]

""It's Important to have events like this in small rural towns,"" says Emanuele.

""Often times our youth and LGBTQ community go to bigger cities for events like this. We wanted to have a space like this closer to home where people could meet others in the community and allies and have a good time.""

Businesses around town have started to come on board, including the Rusty Wrench Brewing Co. owned by pride co-organizer Kirby Bennett.

""I work in mental health, so I see firsthand the differences that happen in community,"" says Bennett.

""I really wanted to be part of that change and do some education and have a safe space to come together. The more exposure to celebrating diversity then people can find something in themselves.""

They've already made progress within the community as a couple told organizers via email they had never met another member of the LGBTQ community in 15 years. They want to play a role in next year's celebrations.

Emanuele says it's important for those who are gay to be visible.

""We don't hide that we are gay family, and we celebrate that every day. I think everybody should.""

Sponsored by the Rainbow Optimist of Southwestern Ontario, the five-hour long event was held. They had drag queen story time, musical entertainment and a speakers panel.

In a statement issued Friday, the organization said Toronto Animal Services is currently in the process of removing the cats from the home and caring for the animals, which have a number of health issues, including upper respiratory infection and ear mites.

""Only a day after rescuing cats from a hoarding situation in North Bay, Toronto Cat Rescue has been called upon to help with a desperate situation here in the city,"" the news release read.

Toronto Cat Rescue said it is working to bring between 50 and 70 cats into its program.

""The cats have already been assessed and are known to be suffering from upper respiratory disease, ear mites, thin body condition and dermatitis,"" the news release read.

""These are health issues that can be resolved with proper medical care, and the special loving care that only our foster homes can give. We expect that because of the condition that these sweet cats are in, it will take months of care and attention to get them into good shape.""

The group noted that foster homes in Kitchener-Waterloo have already taken in some of the cats and Toronto rescues are also working to take in some of the animals as well.

""Hoarding is a serious and complex problem,"" the rescue group's statement continued, noting that only six cats are allowed in a single household under City of Toronto bylaws.

""It is impossible to responsibly care for many more, and 150 cats cannot endure living together in one house.""",[]

From Canada to South Korea, every country has responded differently - in some cases, quite significantly.

Chart and compare the progression for jurisdictions that have reported more than 100 cases using our interactive graphs below.

Brief context and a timeline up to late March have been included for a few countries, focusing on their containment measures. Economic measures have been excluded.

These are a few examples of how Canada's reported data compares to other countries on a per-population basis. Choose countries from the dropdown menus to create your own comparisons or scroll down to read detailed timelines of select nations.

Note: On July 2, the U.K. changed their methodology “to ensure that a person who tests positive is only counted once,” resulting in a large negative number of new cases in the dataset for July 3. The number of reported cases for July 3 has now been set to 0.

* Provinces, territories and global jurisdictions with fewer than 100 cases are not included.

Canada (Population 37.59 million, 2019)

Note: each region's timeline is adjusted to begin when the region announced its 100th case.

For a long time, the messaging from Canadian health officials was that the novel coronavirus outbreak risk for Canadians was low and that efforts would be concentrated on containing the spread. Government officials were also guided by advice from the World Health Organization, which had initially discouraged travel restrictions, border closures and the wearing of masks, positions that were later criticized as the spread became increasingly dire in many countries. As the tally of cases grew in Canada, an increasing number involved travel to and from the United States, where the current number of identified cases alone has already surpassed a million. Residents in both countries together made more than 65 million cross-border trips in 2017, according to Statistics Canada; the level of movement between the two countries made containment impossible without drastic measures. The 8,891 kilometre-long border was closed to non-essential travel by March 20.

Germany (Population 82.79 million, 2018)

The country has been hit hard by COVID-19, but has received attention due to its low mortality rate of less than 1.5 per cent, compared to other European countries like Italy, where the mortality rate stands at around 12 per cent, and roughly 9 to 10 per cent for Spain, France and Britain. But the testing rate of the latter three countries is a fraction of Germany's (as of April 9) - which may also account for the higher death rate. Germany’s current testing rate for the same period seems comparable to Italy's, though some media reports indicate that Germany was able to ramp up extensive testing more quickly and earlier. Germany also has more than double the number of hospital beds than Italy and Spain, according to OECD data, and many media reports cite Germany's ""expensive and extensive"" public health care system as a key reason for the lower mortality rate. Like many other countries, however, there has been ongoing concern over a shortage of masks and other protective equipment.

Germany's outbreak also began mostly among young and healthy skiers who caught the virus at European ski resorts and the overall average age of infected patients is still more than a decade younger than its neighbouring countries. At first, the government appeared reluctant to impose physical distancing measures, travel restrictions, school and border closures, even as it advised against unnecessary travel and asked recent travellers from high-risk destinations to stay home. Despite the low fatality rate, the number of Germany's overall infection numbers is still among the highest in the world and some German health experts worry that the situation could worsen.

There is significant worry that COVID-19 could be devastating for India, the world’s second most populous country. Despite the high risk of spread due to its dense population, testing has been extremely limited. According to the OECD, India also has just 0.5 hospital beds for every 1,000 people - China, by comparison, has 4.3 beds. Already, there are reports of outbreaks in slums, where families live in extreme poverty and crowded conditions. A sudden lockdown imposed across the country sparked a mass exodus of migrant labourers back to their home villages, raising worries of possible outbreaks in regions poorly equipped to handle a health-care crisis.

Testing criteria also varied between jurisdictions; in the small town of Vo, mass testing was said to help quickly contain the spread. Leaders, including the president, downplayed the outbreak in the early days, resulting in initial complacency.

New Zealand (Population 4.794 million, 2017)

New Zealand, which reported its first case roughly a month after Europe and North America, may have benefited from seeing how its counterparts in Europe and North America fared and is notable due to how quickly it moved to mitigate the spread by closing its borders even when only a handful of cases were reported. Nearly two and a half months after its first case, the country is already reporting a decline in the number of new cases and has only had a 19 deaths.

United States (Population 327.2 million, 2018)

Testing was severely hampered in the first several weeks according to medical journal articles and numerous media reports. Screening was “rationed” because only CDC – not public health or hospital labs – could run the tests initially, with a strict criteria for testing only those with known exposure. State labs also ran into verification problems with the CDC test kits, with results coming back “inconclusive or invalid due to failure of the negative control”. Under pressure by state labs to expand testing capacity, the FDA finally allowed them to develop and use their own tests by the end of February. But even when the testing criteria was loosened and testing capacity ramped up, the demand far exceeded availability. Compounding the regulatory and technical problems with testing was the political response at all levels of government, with responses between cities and states and the White House varying from skepticism to urgency to conflicting over the situation, despite warnings. Even prior to the outbreak in China, government reports, pandemic prep exercises as late as last year were not taken seriously. For a pandemic where the situation can take a drastic turn from one day to the next, the world’s richest country “squandered” an entire month, a New York Times investigation said.

South Korea (Population 51.47 million, 2017)

South Korea aggressively ramped up their testing capacity, contact tracing, tracking, and quarantine measures in a national, co-ordinated, and detailed fashion. “Patient 31” was identified around mid February, and was the source of a mass outbreak. Drive-through testing sites were established quickly, offering citizens an efficient way of getting tested while minimizing exposure to others, with test results sent via text within three days. A high-level of transparency, at times seen as controversial and intrusive, allowed for real-time anonymous information being shared with the public as well as tracking. Using phone GPS tracking and credit card information, and CCTV cameras, officials can trace the movements of an infected patient and alert those who were in contact or nearby. Officials are also alerted when an infected individual ventures outside their quarantine zone through a phone app. Outside Daegu, the centre of the biggest outbreak cluster and a few other cities, many parts of South Korea are operating under relatively minimal restrictions, though schools remain closed. Mask wearing is extremely common everywhere.

Losing his full-time IT job six months ago he was finding it tough to find employment.

“It was very hard I think I applied to five or six different places didn't even get a call back,” says Matheson.

He landed on his feet after getting a job at a new cannabis store on Fanshawe Park Road called One Plant.

“It's been nothing but full-time hours and they provided me work since the crisis,” says Matheson.

Even opening the new business was a gamble for owner Kirk Anast.

“It's very tough times right now, so we definitely took a chance here.” says Anast.

He’s aware of the stark unemployment figures because of all the applications he has received.

“Right now we have about 12 staff and there's a pile of resumes, we're trying to get through all of them, people are looking for work right now.” says Anast.

The latest job figures show unemployment in London and St. Thomas at 12.6 per cent in June. That’s almost double when you compare it to February of this year.

Acting Mayor Jesse Helmer says urban centres are the hardest hit in the province.

“I think it goes to show you the kind of impacts are not even”, sasy Helmer.

“You've got certain areas like restaurants, bars and major entertainment venues like Bud Gardens, and the casino, they're still severely impacted by the pandemic.”

Helmer says the city is trying to tackle the unemployment situation next week with the new Community Recovery Network.

“Until there's a vaccine, we're going to be dealing with the impact of this virus on our community for a long time.” added Helmer.",[]

Fears working families have as September approaches",['Celine Zadorsky'],2020-07-10 14:15:00-04:00,"LONDON, ONT. -- Single mom of three Stephanie Cipolla says she’s beyond worried about how she will juggle work and having her kids at home in September if part time school is implemented.

“I think a lot of people are going to be in that position where they will be choosing between their job and their children because there is really no other option.”

Cipolla who works two jobs in order to provide for her family says she can’t quit her job to be home with the kids.

“I’m like up at night kinda trying to figure out every possible scenario like if they go these days and split them up what will I do? So I’m driving myself crazy trying to think of every possible outcome.”

She’s not alone.

Bakery shop owner of Laurie’s Cookies, Laurie Butterworth, has four kids. Three of her kids are school age and her youngest is a toddler. She says she’s worried about what work and family life is going to look like in just under two months

“It’s pretty, pretty scary to think it’s all unknown right now,” says Butterworth.

Her bakery business already took a blow when the pandemic hit and now she’s working with reduced hours and can’t afford to scale back any further.

“With the school and staggered schedules it’s going to be fewer days working, it’s going to be shorter hours, so it will be more of a struggle I think.”

It’s an issue plaguing tens of thousands of working families and was addressed by London West MPP Peggy Sattler in the Legislature earlier this week.

“Speaker, does this minister think that forcing people to quit their jobs because they can’t find childcare, will do anything to help Ontario’s economic recovery?” said Sattler during question period.

Sattler along with the NDP party have been asking the government to come up with either a childcare plan for school aged kids for the fall, or work towards full time a school for everyone.

The group was formed after events that transpired following an OPP raid on several cannabis stores on the outskirts of Oneida Nation of the Thames.

“Seven men entered our political office and demanded our Indigenous families that work in there, that were the chief and councillors, were demanded to leave the political office but not in a good way,” said march organizer Kahwani Doxtator.

She added that the chief and several councillors were assaulted during the occupation that lasted several days. prompting the women to take action.

“Us women gathered inside the community centre and discussed all the issues happening within our community,” Doxtator says. ""It’s been going on for a long time, and we’re now just bringing attention to it because they went too far.”

The group was formed and is planning a larger role within the community - making decisions on several issues and creating a seal that will indicate they have approved any decisions made for the community.

“And once the women of the community make a decision, we put that decision down on paper with a seal on it.”

One of the most dire situations according the Yukwanulha Yukwanikoliyo is drugs, and protecting the community’s youth, which is why the solidarity march was planned.

Police say a large quantity of drugs was seized at the London International Airport on March 1.

Officers were informed of a passenger allegedly in possession of more than 1,900 pills, suspected of being a combination of oxycodone and acetaminophen (Percocet).

Canadian Air Transport Security Authority officials conducted a routine security screening and discovered pills inside two stainless steel containers in luggage presented by a passenger prior to boarding, police say.

The passenger was arrested without incident by police.

Pill samples were submitted to Health Canada, which reported that the seized pills contained fentanyl.

Police say other seizures of fentanyl in London include: 26 fentanyl pills in March, 2017; three fentanyl pills in March, 2017; and fentanyl pills in January, 2020.

As a result of the investigation, Charles Bailey, 41, of London, is charged with one count of possession for the purpose of trafficking in a schedule I substance.

His next court appearance is September 4.

“Given the quantity of pills in this seizure, the potency of fentanyl relative to other opioids, and the fact these pills were marked to resemble pharmaceutical Percocet tablets (“TEC”), the public is advised to be aware that similar products may be in circulation and reminded that pills obtained outside legitimate medical/pharmaceutical channels may not be as they appear or as they are held out to be,” police say in a news release.",[]

Horace was shot and killed at a home on Pochard Lane in the early morning hours of June 21 after suspects forced their way in.

The 44-year-old old is alleged to be a former warlord with the National Patriotic Front of Liberia.

The two women are each facing a charge of being an accessory after the fact to the offence of assault with a weapon.

They were arrested Tuesday by London police and have a court date in London on Sept. 28.

Two other people are already facing charges in relation to Horace’s death.

Forty-six-year-old Det.-Const. Trevor Gregory, a Toronto police officer, was charged this week with breach of trust, for allegedly misleading another officer to obtain unauthorized information.

His son, 22-year-old Keiron Gregory, is charged with second-degree murder in the case. A warrant for his arrest was issued June 25.

He, along with three other suspects, remain at large. They are all believed to be in the Greater Toronto Area.

“Many people who are physically challenged find themselves in dire financial circumstances,” explains Lorenzo Palumbo, a board member with Italian Seniors’ Project.

“So we decided one of the markets we want to cater to is people who need barrier free units.”

A partnership has been announced with Cheshire London that will see 12 of the fully-accessible units become homes for their clients.

Cheshire’s Executive Director Judith Fisher says two or three people currently in longterm care facilities will move into the apartments— freeing up beds in the community.

Cheshire’s remaining spaces will be filled by people on a wait list.

""We have 506 people on the waiting list for Cheshire. All of the people on the list require extensive personal support,” says Fisher.

Aiming to replicate the success of common areas in Residenza Italia across the road— its hoped the fully accessible event rooms will bring tenants together.

“One of the things we try to do in our buildings is try to create a culture and a community, we do that by having common rooms, we have two common rooms,” adds Palumbo.

Government funding doesn’t cover the cost of the common rooms, so the Italian Seniors Project paid for their construction through fundraising.

“I can envision parties, and I can envision gatherings. I can envision us being able to use the common areas because there is also wheelchair accessible bathrooms,” says Fisher.

Ten of the other affordable apartments are earmarked for veterans through a partnership with the Royal Canadian Legion.

In March, Canada and the U.S. agreed to temporary close the border to non-essential travel while keeping it open for commercial traffic.

Since then the agreement has been extended on a number of occasions with the latest iteration lasting until at least July 21.

At this point it is unclear whether the border closure will be extended again, though Ford said at his daily briefing on Friday that he has already told Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland that he is not supportive of opening it up this month.

“I said very clearly I am not in favour of opening up the borders July 21. As long as the goods and products are flowing which they have been (we should keep it closed). I love our American neighbours but not right now,” he said. “Come and visit us when things cool down especially south of the border.”

The U.S. recorded nearly 60,000 new cases of COVID-19 on Friday, including a near-record 11,433 in Florida alone.

In Canada, meanwhile, transmission of the virus continues to wane and over the last week there have been about 380 new cases per day on average.

Ford said on Friday his hope is that government officials will continue to be “very cautious” when it comes to reopening borders, particularly the one to the south.

“I talked to a very smart doctor the other day and I said ‘Doc when do you think the second wave is coming?’ and he said ‘Doug, as soon as you open up the border to international travel that is when you are going to get hit.’ So that is concerning,” he said.

There have now been more than three million confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the United States, making it the hardest-hit country in the world.

There have also been more than 133,000 deaths.

Speaking with CP24 earlier on Friday, infectious disease specialist Dr. Issac Bogoch said that Canada is now at the point where it has the pandemic mostly under control and the United States is “the complete opposite.”

He said that so long as that is the case, the border should be closed.

“If we reopen our border we are going to import more cases to Canada and we could undo everything we have done here which would be really upsetting,” he said. “I think it should be closed for the foreseeable future.”",[]

147,ctvnews,http://london.ctvnews.ca/beautiful-canola-one-of-the-most-eye-catching-crops-1.5017667,Beautiful canola one of the most eye-catching crops,['Scott Miller'],2020-07-09 14:13:00-04:00,"WINGHAM, ONT. -- It’s one of the most “eye-catching” crops grown in Ontario fields. It’s colourful, creating a sea of yellow as far as the eye can see.

“This is a canola field behind me,” says Jeff Drudge, who has grown canola for the past five or six years on his family's farm near Wingham.

“This is spring canola, planted early this spring. It just started to flower two weeks ago again, and flowers for one to two weeks. It’s a beautiful crop. We love growing canola,” says Drudge.

Although it’s the lovely yellow flower that gets all the fanfare, it’s the pods that hold the secret to canola.

They hold canola seeds, which are green now, but when they’re harvested come August, they’re black.

These canola seeds are made up of 40 per cent oil, so they’re ultimately crushed in order to extract canola oil, which is used in cooking the world over. What’s left over is turned into livestock feed.

“It’s a very versatile crop,” says Drudge.

Over 20 million acres of canola are grown in Canada each year. Only 45,000 of those acres are grown in Ontario, so canola isn’t likely to challenge corn or beans for Southwestern Ontario acreage anytime soon.

“It’s almost too warm here for spring canola. Further north it goes better. Further south, there’s winter canola grown, and we’re too far north for that. It’s maybe not that hugely popular in this part of Ontario for that reason,” says Drudge.

Because it is so rare and attractive looking, canola fields do attract a crowd. Drudge says many a car driving by has stopped to take pictures of the field, or selfies with the sea of yellow in the background.

“I think that’s a good thing. It gives us a connection between farmers and non-farmers. So, we’re excited to be a part of that intervention and conversation,” says Drudge.

Drudge says canola is also a good crop for soil health, and attracts a lot of bees each summer.

“It’s a good food source for the bees, so we think it’s good for the environment to grow canola, as well,” he says.",[]

A new provincially-led pilot project is installing 24/7 electronic monitoring stations around several suspected odour emitting sites.

The Ministry of Environment, Conservation, and Parks has been in discussions with two waste processing companies in the area, StormFisher Environmental and Convertus (formerly Orgaworld) to create an odour monitoring area.

City staff have been approached about including the W12A landfill.

""We are basically the guinea pig for this program,” says Brockley resident Allan Tipping. “It’s never been tried anywhere else, and I don’t think London or the money being spent by StormFisher is properly spent by putting these up.”

Tipping says this is the 13th year that foul garbage-like odours have made it impossible for London residents living south of Highway 401 to enjoy their yards.

A new staff report to city council recommends spending $80,000 to $140,000 per year to include the municipality’s landfill in the three to five year monitoring program.

“The sensors will basically pick up odorous compounds and be able to identify a profile and create almost a fingerprint,” explains Jay Stanford, Director of Environment, Fleet, & Solid Waste.

Tipping doubts electronic devices that detect specific chemical compounds in the air, will adequately measure the intensity of foul odours, “All this is numbers, and how do you prove offensiveness with numbers from a machine?”

Stanford says accurate and timely data will direct ongoing process improvements at the landfill better than sporadic responses to complaints.

“If we know certain conditions are creating odour, we can adjust our operations,” explains Stanford.

But after a decade of studies, pilot projects, and promises, Tipping remains skeptical.

“We’ve asked them to actually step up and correct this problem. But none of them have the nerve to,” he says.

Council’s Civic Works Committee will discuss the procurement process for the pilot project at its July 14 meeting.",[]

""Number one we don't need landfills, we need to take care of our waste in other ways. And number two, that you must ask the municipalities whether they want it on your doorstep or not,” said Mayor Ted Comiskey.

The new legislation states municipalities, within 3.5 km of a proposed dump have the right to approve or reject it.

Without approval the provincial government would not go ahead with the landfill.

it's a major victory for the town and its neighbouring municipalities including Zorra, where the former limestone quarry is located.

However, the mayor admits there is caution as the bill is only past first reading.

With the support of the Doug Ford’s PC’s and the opposition NDP it’s likely to succeed as early as late summer.

The mayor says the new legislation is the way it should have been for municipalities in the first place.

“We deserve that right. There is no way that another municipality should be dumping 18-million tons of their waste, on another, without asking them.”",[]

Patients with HIV can manage the virus with treatment and anti-HIV drugs, but if a person stops their life-long therapies the dormant, hiding virus can rapidly re-emerge.

The hiding virus is known as the “latent reservoir” and is what prevents a cure for HIV.

“The aim is to get it all out of dormancy with a targeted punch, so the remaining virus can be killed,” said lead researcher Prof. Eric Arts.

“Now that we’ve shown that this can be done with patient samples at early HIV disease, the hope is this will lead to targeted cure strategies.”

Arts and his team say they have developed a way to pull HIV out of the latent reservoir making it visible to the immune system and providing the chance to be killed by treatment.

By studying cells from individuals who are HIV positive and receiving treatment early in disease, the team, in collaboration with Case Western Reserve University and Imperial College London, has shown that their formulation, called Activator Vector (ACT-VEC), was successful in targeting the latent HIV reservoir.

“If the virus is not replicating, the drugs can't have an effect on it. By reactivating the virus, we can either inhibit it through antiretroviral therapy or it can be targeted by the body’s immune response,” said Jamie Mann, researcher on the study.

This strategy is known as “shock and kill.” Essentially the virus is shocked out of hiding, now researchers need to determine if they can kill it.

The team looked at whether the virus was actually hiding in the very cells that are designed to kill it, mainly T cells.

“ACT-VEC is designed specifically to activate these cells that had previously responded to HIV that now remain dormant,” said Arts.

“This activation has a dual purpose - it stimulates the remaining virus out of dormancy and induces the immune system.”

The team will now move into studying ways to kill the newly reactivated virus.

The study was published in the journal eBioMedicine where it can be read in full.",[]

Every May the Crime Writers of Canada name their Arthur Ellis Award Winners for excellence in Canadian crime writing.

Those awards were announced Thursday night in Toronto. Although COVID-19 concerns caused the cancellation of the normal awards gala, the winners were no less honoured.

The best crime novel award was won by Michael Christie for his novel Greenwood. His story is told in the future and the past, and reveals a tragedy that bonds two boys over the course of time. It is a family story that grows over time to include omissions, half-truths and outright lies. This is not the only honour secured by Greenwood; it was also long listed for the prestigious Scotiabank Giller Prize last fall.

The best crime first novel award went to Philip Elliott for Nobody Move, a hard-boiled crime story set - where else - but Los Angeles. A debt collection turned double murder fuels the plot that draws in the debt collector, his mob boss employer, an ex-assassin, the femme fatale, and of course, police.

Author Robin Harlick served as one of the judges this year and praises the quality of the work submitted.

She says “For the most part the entries were well-written with good story telling and engaging characters.”

In fact, she says there are more Canadian crime writers out there than she realized, “many of which would stand up to the best in British or American crime writing, a standard often used by avid crime fiction readers.”

Harlick was also pleased to see that many of authors set their books here in Canada.

In a genre where location is often a character in its own right, she says there is persistent pressure from international publishers to “set crime fiction anywhere else other than Canada.”

Other winners included: best crime novella, won by Wayne Arthurson for The Red Chesterfield. Arthurson’s award was sponsored by Mystery Weekly, an online monthly journal of short crime fiction based in London, Ont.

The best crime short story was won by Peter Sellers for Closing Doors.

The best French crime book honour went to Andree A. Michaud for Tempetes.

The best juvenile or young adult crime book went to Keep This to Yourself by Tom Ryan.

The best nonfiction crime book was won by Charlotte Gray for Murdered Midas: A Millionaire, His Gold Mine, and a Strange Death on an Island Paradise.

And the Unhanged Arthur award for an unpublished manuscript wen to The Dieppe Letters by Liz Rachel Walker.

The pandemic may have eliminated the annual Arthur Ellis gala, but some of the winners are doubtless conducting their own physically distanced celebrations.

And being writers, they may be considering this odd circumstance for future plot lines.",[]

It’s been seven years since Marilyn Reid last saw and spoke to her husband John. It was in February of 2013 that he was brought to Victoria Hospital via ambulance, suicidal and in crisis.

“When we got him there I was very relieved and I thought he was safe and in good hands.”

John, a veteran of the Canadian Armed Forces suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and was having suicidal thoughts.

“He was in the hospital in crisis and was there a week in crisis and then was released, but nobody contacted me to tell me that he was leaving the hospital. I was actually in shock.”

Reid says she received a phone call from the hospital, one that forever changed her life.

“The only phone call I got from them was to tell me that he was deceased and that he died on hospital grounds. He took his life, just very shortly after they released him.”

Reid says after seeing the CTV News story last week about a suicidal woman going missing after being discharged from Victoria Hospital, she knew she had to speak out.

“I cant believe that people are being released from the hospital and their loved ones aren’t being contacted. It’s been a few years since my husband died and I can’t believe this is still going on.”

The London Health Coalition believes the care for mental health patients is only going to get worse if there continues to be a lack of services and funding for mental health care.

“We in this community have already suffered from losing so many beds, thousands literally,” says Peter Bergmanis from the London Health Coalition. “There was the London Psychiatric Hospital and the St. Thomas Psychiatric Hospital that are vacant. So where are these people supposed to go?”

Reid agrees more funding and services would be key, but in the interim would like to see hospitals contacting family before discharging mental health patients.

“I, in my heart feel if I could have seen him and talked to him again that the outcome would’ve been entirely different.”

Policies differ from hospital hospital when it comes to notifying family of patient discharge.

In a statement the London Health Sciences Centre said, “Our care providers work with patients to support their discharge, including calling their families/supports when needed. We welcome families sharing their concerns with us, and we are committed to working with them directly.”

Meanwhile St. Thomas Elgin General Hospital states, “When a patient presents in the Emergency Department, they are triaged by a nurse and assessed by a skilled emergency physician. Based on the assessment, a decision to admit or discharge would be made. The decision to notify a family member is determined through a conversation with the patient. This process remains unchanged during COVID.“",[]

It was earlier this year she shared her success story with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Legault says for the first time she was seeing a positive change with her mental health, but that all changed months ago.

“Because of the coronavirus all of my ECT treatments were discontinued,” says Legault. It’s been around two months without ECT treatments and her mental health has severely declined.

Just two weeks ago, she was suicidal, and police and ambulance were called when she attempted to take her life at her grandparents home in St. Thomas.

She says, “I saw a GP (general practitioner), I wasn’t formed and I didn’t see a psychiatric nurse. Actually they were more concerned with my physical health than my mental health.”

Legualt says about two hours after arriving at St. Thomas Elgin General Hospital via ambulance, she was discharged without a next of kin being contacted.

“They just gave me directions on how to leave the hospital and I walked around Elm Street in St. Thomas at 2:30 a.m. by myself in my pyjamas.”

Her grandmother, Joanne Donkers, found her and got her home safe.

“She just walked out of hospital and I think that’s totally wrong. She could’ve gone anywhere and she was in real crisis and needed help.”

CTV News reached out to St. Thomas Elgin General hospital for comment, hospital communications staff replied via email saying:

""When a patient presents in the Emergency Department, they are triaged by a nurse and assessed by a skilled emergency physician. Based on the assessment, a decision to admit or discharge would be made.

""The decision to notify a family member is determined through a conversation with the patient. This process remains unchanged during COVID.""

Days later and still feeling suicidal, Legault’s GP sent her to the London Health Sciences Centre's (LHSC) Victoria Hospital on a form for mental health crisis care.

She said again, less than two hours later she was released from the emergency department.

Her grandmother, who found her outside Victoria Hospital, says their family is desperate for help.

“We are not equipped to take care of Kristin in crisis. We do the best we can but we really think there should be more help for her.”

Legault says she’s feeling hopeless, “I feel like - Am I ever going to get better? Is anyone ever going to help me?”

“We were at capacity Saturday and today will likely be the same,” said Lambton Shores Mayor Bill Weber.

Bylaw officers and municipal staff were out trying to control a crowd of thousands, as one London resident says the numbers on the beach looked similar to the Canada Day turnout.

“COVID-19 has not gone away,” said Weber. “COVID-19 is still here and it can come back and bite us.

“We’ll keep the beaches open as long as people follow the rules.”

The mayor added that people are trying to physically distance, but doesn’t know if that will be enough.

Weber has called the past weekend a test to see how well visitors are following the rules.

“Everyone’s keeping their distance the best they can,” said Kitchener resident Jack Ross. “I mean, it can get a little tight when you’re walking to the water.”

Lexie Levac and Sierha Luxton Dayeh, both Kitchener residents, said people are trying to stay in their groups and are doing pretty well.

“They’re trying, but it’s not really the best,” said Kitchener resident Rami Dayeh.

Weber added that they won’t hesitate to close the beach if necessary, but that doing so would be extremely difficult for the business community.

Alex Figlarski, whose business is close to the shoreline, said there has been more people walking by than usual.

“The beach is always the number one attraction,” said Armand Malette, owner of Hobo Pies. “Serving on average every day, even weekdays, is probably 5,000 people.”

In its decision, the Ontario Court of Appeal decided the statute of limitations barred a claim by David Carmichael against GlaxoSmithKline, makers of Paxil.

The decision overturned a lower court ruling that had allowed Carmichael's claim to proceed.

Carmichael, 62, drugged and killed his 11-year-old epileptic son Ian in a hotel in London, Ont., in July 2004. Carmichael, who was severely depressed, psychotic and taking Paxil, believed the boy was dangerous and would live a life of suffering.

Charged with first-degree murder, Carmichael -- who had promoted fitness in children as national project director for the now-defunct ParticipAction -- was found not criminally responsible by reason of a mental disorder in 2005. The Ontario Review Board granted him an absolute discharge in December 2009 -- the point at which he argued he first became capable of filing a claim against GlaxoSmithKline. He filed his lawsuit in October 2011.

Normally, a plaintiff must launch a suit within two years of the alleged wrongdoing. However, the clock does not start ticking as long as a claimant can prove they were in no condition physically or mentally to take the legal action.

The company turned to Superior Court, saying the action was statute-barred. Carmichael countered that he had experienced ""incapacitating psychological problems"" until his absolute discharge, and was therefore only capable of suing after that date. As such, he maintained he was within the allowable timeframe when he did finally sue in 2011.

In April last year, Justice Thomas Lederer sided with Carmichael. GlaxoSmithKline appealed, arguing Lederer had made several errors.

The Appeal Court decided to take a fresh look at the evidence, something it generally does not do. Ultimately, the court agreed with one of the company's grounds of appeal: that Lederer had misapprehended the evidence regarding Carmichael's mental competence before his discharge.

In reviewing Lederer's decision, the higher court noted that between killing his son and the discharge, Carmichael had worked with, and instructed, several lawyers. He also travelled to Texas to meet an American lawyer to discuss suing GlaxoSmithKline.

Carmichael also published a website and booklet describing how he believed Paxil had caused his psychosis, gave media interviews, and even approached GlaxoSmithKline about sponsoring or buying his site.

The Appeal Court rejected opinion evidence from a medical expert that Carmichael suddenly regained the psychological capacity to sue after the Ontario Review Board granted him a discharge. The expert said the plaintiff would have faced ""considerable psychological risk of a relapse"" had he sued before then.

""Nothing in the proceedings before the board suggested that Mr. Carmichael lacked any form of capacity until Dec. 2, 2009, or at least not for a long time before then,"" Justice Mahmud Jamal wrote for the court. ""To the contrary, the medical evidence before the board consistently confirmed Mr. Carmichael's capacity.""

The court ordered Carmichael to pay GlaxoSmithKline $30,000 in legal costs.

159,ctvnews,http://london.ctvnews.ca/masks-in-grey-bruce-establishments-to-become-mandatory-1.5019329,Masks in Grey Bruce establishments to become mandatory,[],2020-07-10 14:44:00-04:00,"LONDON, ONT. -- A third area public health unit will mandate masks in certain indoor public spaces.

The Grey Bruce Health Unit says a health order mandating the wearing of face coverings in indoor establishments will be implemented in conjunction with the provincial Stage 3 re-opening.

“The order will enable establishment(s) to require face covering use by employees and customers and the means to remind the customer that they should be wearing a face covering as a result of the order,” a news release says.

“For greater clarity, there is not a need to turn away the customer to achieve the best effort standard.”

The release, issued Friday, says optimally three days' notice will be given following the provincial announcement, to provide sufficient time for affected parties to be adequately prepared.

The health unit says enforcement in general will be based on the good faith of individuals to participate as rigorous enforcement will not be desired.

Grey Bruce joins Huron-Perth and Middlesex-London in making masks or face coverings mandatory in some situations.

Grey Bruce says the order only applies to areas that are normally accessible to the general public and would not include areas such as an administrative area within the establishment.

Considerations will allow exemptions for children under the age of two years; or in some under the age of 5 years for those unable to tolerate face covering, or refusing to wear a face covering. Those who cannot tolerate face coverings for any medical condition or any reason required under the Human Rights Code will also be exempt.

Some establishments in Grey and Bruce Counties may be able to obtain masks for no cost, based on donations, for people who cannot purchase their own masks. Bruce Power has donated 120,000 one-time masks to local organizations including Chambers of Commerce and food banks in support of the re-opening.

“Asking people to wear a face covering is another tool we can use to prevent spread of COVID-19,” says Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Ian Arra.

“We are seeing increasing complacency in the community with earlier recommendations of physical distancing. That and the Stage 3 re-opening plan will, by definition, include activities with highest contact intensity and that would require significant modifications to maintain public health safety. Mask use will reduce the risk for the most vulnerable of us.”

The health unit says the order will remain in place for four weeks, and can be renewed. This will provide time to develop more permanent solutions such as municipal by-laws or provincial regulations.",[]

In a news release, Haldimand-Norfolk Public Health said the outbreak at Scotlynn Group in Vittoria was officially declared over on Friday.

“I think we’re all happy for Scotlynn, for the migrant workers, and certainly for the community,” said Kristal Chopp, Norfolk County mayor and chair of the Board of Health. “When you look at the totality of this, the program was really an employer-focused program as oppose to an employee-focused program.”

Around 200 workers tested positive for COVID-19 at the peak of the outbreak, and one person died from complications.

Chopp says there are lessons to be learned from what happened.

“We have two workers that have now admitted to concealing symptoms,” she said. “I think one of the biggest things we need to look at is who is taking those wellness checks and really evaluating them.”

Norfolk and Haldimand counties now administer serial sentinel testing on farms as a proactive measure.

Chopp describes this process as taking the highest risk population in a certain bunkhouse and testing around 10 per cent every couple of weeks.

“The idea being here is that it would give some sort of a signal in advance of a large outbreak, like we saw,” she said.

Chopp says she sent letters weeks ago calling on the provincial and federal governments to take control over the screen and quarantine process for migrant workers in a similar way that British Columbia has done.

She adds that they haven’t heard a response yet.

“This is a tragedy and crisis that could have been prevented a long time ago,” said Chris Ramsaroop, an organizer Justice for Migrant Workers. “Permanent status on arrival at the federal level is essential. It’s time.”

On the provincial level, Ramsaroop is calling for the inclusion of minimum wage for all farm workers and ensuring they have equal access to occupational health and safety.

“If people are getting sick here in Canada, or injured here in Canada, it’s our responsibility to take care of them,” he said. “This isn’t about good and bad employers. This is systematic overhaul that needs to happen.”

Ramsaroop adds that municipalities should enact their own Section 22 orders similar to the one by the Haldimand-Norfolk Health Unit.",[]

They say the number of CMV crashes last year is the highest in 20 years, and includes a 67 per cent increase in fatalities from the year before.

“We had 96 people die last year in over 84,000 crashes that we were called to on OPP-patrolled roads,” said Sgt. Kerry Schmidt of the OPP.

With the launch of Operation Safe Drive on Sunday, provincial police hope to focus on speeding and other contributing factors in these collisions.

John Way, the owner of Wayfreight Services in Guelph, says he attributes the close calls that they review on dash cam footage to improper lane changes, driver inattention, and losing control.

“We’ve seen an increase in close calls fortunately, not necessarily collisions,” he said. “You need to be hyper aware in these kinds of times.

“Trucks are in a hurry, they’re under time constraints to deliver freight, and cars don’t give trucks the room to maneuver or stop.”

OPP say the majority of the CMV collisions in 2019 were linked to the factor of speed.

“We want to make sure drivers of all vehicles are sharing the road properly and understanding what vehicles are around them and what their limitations are,” said Schmidt.

The campaign will also focus on unsafe driving behaviours.

“We have heavy loads,” said Manader Kumar, a transport driver for West Coast Commodities. “If someone is going to break in front of us it’s hard for us to break in an instant.”

On Saturday, Kumar had a 24-hour drive in front of him to North Dakota.

He says some of the drivers he is sharing the road make him worried about arriving safely.

“They’re driving like firefighters today,” said Kumar. “Every day there’s too many accidents going on, people are driving crazy.”

Other areas of focus in the OPP campaign include making sure drivers are scheduling maintenance and conducting daily inspections.",[]

Environment Canada says it is possible for 50-100 mm of rain on Saturday in the area.

The heavy rain could produce localized flooding, according to the agency.

On Friday, a summer thunderstorm rolled through Waterloo Region, lighting up the sky and bringing some much-needed rain to the area.

Friday also marked the 10th straight day with temperatures over 30 C.

Environment Canada issued a severe thunderstorm warning around 6:30 p.m., warning of flash flooding, strong winds and possible hail. That warning ended shortly after 8 p.m.

Social media users showed flooding on some Kitchener streets as storm drains worked to keep up with rain. Forsyth Drive in the Westmount neighbourhood turned into a pond during the storm.

An Environment Canada meteorologist said 63 millimetres of rain fell from the thunderstorms over the course of a few hours. The four hours of rain brought 70 per cent of normal monthly levels.

The rain also helped rivers return to normal levels. Conestogo River returned to its normal summer flow level on Friday night.

Here are some photos of the storm as it rolled through southern Ontario and Waterloo Region:

""It's definitely an exciting weekend for us,"" said May Hermiz, co-owner of Toast.

""It’s our first closure of six of the summer,"" said Filip Rocca, President of the Erie Street Business Improvement Association.

Throughout the via Italia neighbourhood, restaurant and bar owners are extending their patios into the streets on select weekends this summer, while other retailers stretch out to the sidewalks as well.

""We can’t obviously open dining just yet. So it gives us something to work with. It obviously has more business. It’s been great,"" said Hermiz.

Hermiz opened Toast on Erie Street four years ago, and is grateful for the opportunity to expand her restaurant capacity.

""We’ve definitely quadrupled our business outside. It’s been great honestly, the BIA has been amazing. It definitely gives us something to work with. We have more tables outside and more people coming in. We have takeout orders coming in.""

Approved by city council, the Via Italia street expansion is one of many the city is launching to help struggling businesses recover from the pandemic.

""It was a long and stressful time without being able to get outside and enjoy our community,"" Rocca said. ""Now that the nice weather is here and we are allowed to operate in stage 2 safely, we’d love for people to come down to Windsor's little Italy and experience all that Via Italia has to offer.""

""It’s just a minor setback that we had, but we’re gonna keep on continuing and moving to the right path,"" said Hermiz.

Dining at Toast on Saturday, owner of Mezzo Restaurant and Lounge and President of Via Italia BIA, Rocca says this street set up allows for more space for patios, sidewalk sales, and safer pedestrian access.

""The BIA is encouraging all merchants to be creative and put the product out on the street whatever it is,"" said Rocca.

""Everyone’s loving it. We’re happy to be here. It’s a gorgeous sunny day today. We’re also happy. It’s good for business so it’s been great,"" said Hermiz.

Many patrons, like Slavisa Simovic would like to see more street closures across the city.

""I think it’s a good thing, not only for Erie, but for the whole area and the city itself. If it was up to me I would extend it for the whole year,"" said Simovic.

""We’re just so grateful. We’re blessed to be here. We’re blessed to be still in business,” said Hermiz

The street closures begins at 5:00 p.m. on Friday evenings and continues Sunday nights at 11:00 p.m.

Rocca tells CTV News all mandated Ontario and local health and safety regulations regarding COVID-19 will be enforced during the street closures.

Masks will be mandatory when entering and patronizing indoor businesses.

Social distancing is required at all retailers, cafes and restaurants.

Extra sanitary precautions will also be implemented throughout each workplace to ensure both staff and customers’ safety.

The full list of weekend closures are as follows:

It happened in the area of Jane Street and Woolner Avenue, north of St. Clair Avenue West, just before 10:20 p.m.

In a video obtained by CTV News Toronto from a nearby business, it shows a dark-coloured vehicle driving into the parking lot where dozens of people, including a child, have gathered.

A few seconds later, as the vehicle drives by and out of the camera's view, people were seen suddenly scrambling for cover. Police said that was the moment the suspects began ""indiscriminately"" firing shots at the crowd.

The vehicle was then seen speeding away.

""A car drove up and opened fire into a group of people,"" Deputy Police Chief Shawna Coxon said Saturday at the scene. ""The reason this is so concerning is it's a brazen shooting.""

""We have had more than a dozen rounds recovered at this time.""

Coxon said the gunmen opened fire into the group and that ""innocent bystanders were at risk.""

""It could have been much worse.""

When officers arrived, three people were located suffering from gunshot wounds, police said, adding two more victims then walked into hospital.

One victim, a 21-year-old man, remains in a life-threatening condition, while the four others are expected to survive, police said.

Last month, the province introduced a new policy requiring customers to provide their contact information for public health inspector records. However, the new regulations are receiving mixed reactions from residents and raising privacy concerns.

In Moncton, Hynes Restaurant owner, Jamie Hynes, has recently begun signing in his customers before they dine. The new protocol at his establishment is in accordance with a contact tracing system implemented by New Brunswick Public Health as part of new COVID-19 guidelines.

""Right now, we're just taking your name and your phone number, and keeping a log each day,” says Hynes. “If Public Health comes in, and they ask for it, we can give it to them.""

According to Public Health, records of attendees are required, not encouraged, for seated venues and larger gatherings. The mandatory order states ""where anyone admits patrons to a venue at which seating is offered for purposes of eating, drinking, socialization, celebration, ceremony or entertainment, they are required to maintain a record of the names and contact information of all persons who attend, and must make those records available to Public Health inspectors.""

Some patrons say they don’t mind sharing their information.

""I think it's a great idea,” says customer, Alida LeBlanc. “I love that because it protects us.”

""It doesn’t bother me,” says customer, Jessie Brown. “It’s an extra measure of safety, and they can contact me if something happens.""

However, questions have been raised as to how and when the information will be accessed.

""Does this mean that the organization that's hosting the people have to make it available daily, or just if they're asked? They keep the records,"" says Moncton South MLA Cathy Rogers.

While the province says the requirement came into effect on June 19 – many business owners and customers were unaware of the rule until recently.

""I think its great thing,” says Hynes. “I just wish I would’ve found out by not reading the newspaper.""

""I have meetings at coffee shops and different places; the first time I experienced being asked to sign in was yesterday,"" says Rogers.

However, after months of lockdowns and business closures, many customers say sharing personal information is a small price to pay for greater freedoms.

""I think that’s a great idea because that’s a safety issue,"" says customer, Raymond Richard.

Meanwhile, local politicians, like Rogers, say while they agree with the policy, there has been feedback from the community calling it a violation of privacy.

""I do understand people’s uneasiness with this,” says Rogers. “We have a tendency to mistrust who is going to have this information and what it will be used for.""

However, despite concerns, restaurants such as the Hynes Restaurant will continue to keep track of who comes through their doors in the event health authorities need to track customers who may have COVID-19.

Meanwhile, although the policy is most commonly found in restaurants, Public Health has stated the same requirements apply wherever anyone hosts, organizes or permits gatherings larger than 50 people.",[]

HALIFAX -- The family of a woman facing criminal charges after a video posted online showed a dog being swung by its leash in an apparent altercation, has released a statement on her behalf.

Police say it started after women in one vehicle confronted women in another vehicle about being cut-off near a drive-through cold beer store in Dartmouth.

Twenty-seven year old Clarissa Crawley is charged with assault with a weapon and willfully causing unnecessary suffering to an animal in the incident, which happened on Canada Day.

Crawley was arrested by Halifax Regional Police on Wednesday and has been released on conditions to appear in court in August.

The Crawley family has provided a statement to CTV News, saying it ""is in response to the flurry of wrong information to the public, and damaging racially charged hate circulating on social media and elsewhere.""

The statement goes on to say ""the owner of the dog was driving in the other lane in an attempt to cut in front of Clarissa … the person recording (the video) did not catch the beginning nor the end of the incident, which would have captured racial slurs, including the n-word, being hurled at Clarissa.""

""The use of the n-word, especially in these racially charged times, is categorically and unmistakably meant to insight a negative or violent reaction. As the argument ensued, one of the women ripped Clarissa’s necklace from her neck and the other woman put it in her purse. The women continued with the verbal assaults, a physical altercation, and still a refusal to return the necklace.""

According to the statement, Crawley retrieved the puppy in an attempt to get the women to return her property.

""The situation escalated quickly as the woman threatened Clarissa and ran toward her. She was unsure at that point if the woman had taken anything from her car as a weapon, and without thinking, used the dog as a shield in the heat of the moment. It does not make the action acceptable, and Clarissa has continually expressed deep remorse over the dog’s safety, and never intended any harm to come to the dog. She also expressed immediate remorse for how the situation between them had escalated so quickly.""

For her part, Brittany McGuire, the owner of the dog, says she was in the line of cars for over an hour and a half and that Crawley cut her off.

She also says she never used the n-word or any racial slur. She says she has black family members, including a black father-in-law.

""Race has nothing to do with this and it’s a shame that’s what they’re trying to turn this into,"" McGuire said.

When asked about the alleged physical altercation – including having the necklace ripped off the other woman, McGuire said ""when (Crawley) reached into my passenger side window and assaulted my passenger, during that altercation her necklace was ripped off. I was trying to look for it to throw it out the window so we could leave the scene. In fact, I gave her full access to my car to look for her necklace … and she found it, wrapped around (the base of) the steering wheel.""

As the incident escalated, McGuire says ""of course when somebody takes your animal out of the car you’re going to go after them and at that point all I was screaming was 'give me back my dog, don’t take my dog,' and I was screaming for people to help me. Her life was not being threatened and the only life that was being threatened at that time was my dog's.""

McGuire says she did call Crawley a ""psycho bitch"" after her dog was allegedly taken. She repeatedly denies using any racial slurs.

McGuire also says that she believes the threats and racism Crawley and her family have received on social media is ""absolutely unacceptable.""

She says she just wants justice. She also says her dog will be taking puppy classes to help with the trauma of this incident.

Halifax police say they are investigating this incident in its totality. They continue to ask anyone who saw what happened to come forward with any information they can provide.

The comet will come closest to the Earth on July 22, when it will be about 103 million kilometres away from our plant, says NASA. The comet should become even easier to spot later in July though NASA warns comets are unpredictable.

From now until mid-July, you can see the comet about 10 degrees above the northeastern horizon. After the middle of the month, NASA suggests looking for the comet in the evening, when it will rise “increasingly higher above the northwestern horizon.” The comet will appear higher in the sky the farther north you happen to be looking for it.",[]

Chants of “Kill Bill 1!” rang out outside of Calgary’s City Hall and the Legislature in Edmonton as Albertans spoke out about a new bill they believe could make it more difficult to protest.

They’re worried about Bill 1: a piece of legislation passed through the United Conservative Party government in mid-June.

“A lot of people are quite worried,” organizer Adam Quraishi said. “When you have the entire system of democracy being torn apart, where do you go from there? A protest is a starting point.”

About 200 Calgarians held signs and chanted for part of the afternoon.

The Critical Infrastructure Defence Act implements tougher punishments on protesters who set up blockades along or near ""essential infrastructure”.

It allows the UCP government to levy heavy fines and possibly imprison anyone unlawfully interfering with things like pipelines, highways, utilities and oil and gas production facilities.

It was tabled following a series of rail blockade protests in support of the Wetʼsuwetʼen hereditary chiefs in British Columbia and their opposition to the Coastal GasLink Pipeline project.

But since being announced in February, it’s been a lightning rod for controversy.

“Bill 1 is against democracy,” NDP MLA Joe Ceci said from Calgary City Hall Saturday. “It tries to silence dissent in our province.”

It’s not just opposition party members who oppose the bill. Both the Alberta Union of Public Employees (AUPE) and Alberta Federation of Labour have spoken out against the passed legislation, the latter’s president calling it “undemocratic” at the protest in Edmonton on Saturday.

“Albertans have to read the fine print of this legislation,” Gil McGowan said. “(The provincial government) has defined almost every public space that you can think of as critical infrastructure for the purpose of this act.”

McGowan believes it’s a way for the UCP to quiet opposing viewpoints.

AUPE has asked the courts to throw out the legislation altogether.

But the province argues the bill is needed, saying it will keep Alberta’s projects moving without interference.

In a statement, the premier's press secretary Christine Myatt points to “a number of public gatherings on public spaces since Bill 1 passed, showing...concerns are unfounded.”",[]

Toronto and Edmonton will be the host cities for all playoff games.

The NHL, Edmonton Oilers, Alberta's Premier and Edmonton’s mayor were supposed to provide details about what being a hub city means on Saturday, but less than an hour before it was scheduled, the NHL cancelled it.

“While we believe we’re buttoned down at the provincial level in Ontario and Alberta there’s still a couple of details that we’re just finalizing with the federal government,” said NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman during a conference call Saturday morning.

The NHL would not tell CTV News Edmonton what those details are.

Despite the day's news, Alberta politicians were in a celebratory mood heading into the weekend.

“A score for Edmonton!,” said the city’s mayor Don Iveson in a statement Friday.

“We can’t wait to delight hockey fans and show off everything our beautiful city has to offer,” he said.

While Premier Jason Kenney posted a video, shot outside Rogers Place shortly after the announcement.

“One of the core reasons the NHL is coming here as opposed to some of the big American cities that were offering subsidies and all kinds of hand outs is because we have the lowest level of infections and hospitalizations of any NHL city,” he said.

The Premier expects it will bring about 2,000 jobs to Edmonton while pumping $60 million into the economy at a time when Alberta needs it most.

“That alone is not going to turn around our economy but it’s a great shot in the arm. It’s a great morale boost. It’s a great job creator,” said Kenney.",[]

With the five-year milestone marked and no new leads, Robert Krull is offering a cash reward for anyone with information on his wife's case.

""One hundred thousand dollars to anyone that comes forward to the police [with information],"" said Krull. ""For the crime of abduction, murder, and disposing of [Thelma's] body.""

With no arrests made and no new information, Robert Krull is still looking for answers about his wife's death.

He said Thelma was his rock, and he misses her every day.

""I can see people walking down the street, or a couple holding hands, that gets emotional for me,"" said Krull.

Thelma Krull disappeared on July 11, 2015. She left her home in the Grassie Boulevard area and walked to Civic Park near East Kildonan Collegiate around 8 a.m.

Winnipeg Police Service believe it was there where she was involved in some incident and abducted.

Three years later, in October of 2018, a hunter found human remains in the RM of Tache, which were later identified as Thelma.

Krull said he's grateful for the resources WPS put into his wife's case, but he wants answers, and he's hopeful this reward will spark some progress.

Frank Cormier, a criminologist at the University of Manitoba, said clearance rates for homicides in Winnipeg are generally above 90 per cent, and a case like this going unsolved in the city is very unusual.

He said a cash reward could persuade someone to speak out.

""Perhaps they were reluctant to come forward, maybe it was an acquaintance or possibly even a family member,"" said Cormier.

""Perhaps at this point, the money might actually get them to overcome their reluctance.""

Cormier said an unsolved homicide can leave families feeling helpless, and offering a reward can help them stay hopeful.

""It's been five years. I just felt like I had to do something. She deserves something,"" said Krull.

Krull said the reward is available for the next six months.

He's asking people who want to come forward with information to contact the police, not him or his family.",[]

""I was sick for about two weeks, I was in isolation within our home in a guest bedroom and there was about three days where I was gasping for air,"" Gullacher said.

The Gullacher family has been hit hard by COVID-19.

Paul’s father Butch is the only person from Regina to die from the virus, while his wife and kids also showed a variety of symptoms.

Gullacher’s wife, Aimee, lost her sense of taste and smell for 10 days. His daughter, Athena, had a fever and headache, but Gullacher says she showed her normal energy, and his son, Willem, had pink eye.

He says they did everything they could to avoid the virus.

""Prior to even my dad showing symptoms, we had been exercising social distancing, we were disinfecting door handles, we were doing all the things,"" Gullacher said.

Gullacher’s father had reduced kidney function and hadn’t travelled prior to contracting COVID-19.

He was admitted to hospital on March 19 and put into an induced coma a few days later. He battled the virus for weeks before dying on Apr. 10.

The 69-year-old was the fourth person in Saskatchewan to die from the virus.

""It’s funny that when my mom called me on the Thursday, I didn’t realize that I’d seen my dad for the last time already,"" Gullacher said.

The family still hasn’t been able to have a funeral for him.

""At the time it doesn’t really set in because everything is so unknown, everything is so sudden, it’s not totally clear to you how this is going to work out and you don’t think it’s going to happen to you,"" Gullacher said.

In the aftermath, Gullacher says he’s learned how precious his memories with his father have been.

""You need to cherish your family and spend time with your family now because there’s no guarantee that time is going to be available at the end,"" he said.

He’s disappointed that his father won’t be able to create more memories with his grandchildren.

""He fully unfolded as a human being when he became a grandpa, I’d never really had a ton of strong memories of my dad smiling as much as when he became a grandfather, his grandkids meant everything to him,"" Gullacher said.

Gullacher says his son believed he may have been responsible for his grandfather contracting the virus.

""All he knew is kids don’t get really sick and kids make their grandparents sick, that’s all he was seeing in media, so even though the timeline doesn’t work out for him to have infected him, he felt guilt,"" he said.

Cases in Saskatchewan have remained low during the pandemic and Regina hasn’t had an active case in almost a month.

Gullacher says his family’s experience should serve as a warning against letting your guard down.

""Because so few people have been infected here in Regina, it’s easy to believe that this is someone else’s problem, that it can’t effect us here,"" he said.

Since recovering, Gullacher says his family has continued to take precautions and remain close to home.

He also made the decision last month to donate convalescent plasma, which is being used in a clinical trail by Canadian Blood Services to prove whether antibodies can be effectively used to treat COVID-19 patients.

Gullacher hopes it can help save a life.

The most recent death occurred in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, bringing the province’s total number of COVID-19 deaths to 187.

“We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic,” said provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix in a joint statement Friday.

Meanwhile, Friday’s new cases brought the total number of coronavirus cases in B.C. to 3,053 since the pandemic began.

Health officials say that no new outbreaks have appeared in health-care facilities or in the community over the past 24 hours.

However, two outbreaks at long-term care facilities and one outbreak at an acute-care facility are ongoing.

The two long-term care facilities that are currently managing outbreaks are the Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, and the Maple Hill long-term care facility in the Fraser Health region.

Health officials added that while no active community breaks have been declared, “new cases and community exposure events continue to occur in the community.”

There are currently 187 active cases of COVID-19 in the province. Of those cases, 16 people are in hospital for treatment, five of whom require critical care.

As B.C. continues to ease restrictions as part of Phase 3 of its restart plan, health officials say that fundamental health practices should continue to be followed.

“When spending more time with friends and family, whether that is close to home or on vacation elsewhere in the province, we remind all British Columbians to avoid closed spaces, crowds and close contact with others,” said Henry and Dix.

Health officials are urging regular hand washing, the use of non-medical masks and physical distancing to help keep the curve of COVID-19 transmission flat.

Each of these health measures improve in effectiveness when used in combination with other safety steps, say Henry and Dix.

“We know that the more layers of protection we use, the safer we will be,” said the pair.

“Let’s all ‘layer up’ by washing our hands regularly, using barriers, staying a safe distance from others and using a mask when that is challenging.”

Most of B.C.’s COVID-19 cases have been located in the province’s Lower Mainland.

Since the pandemic began, there have been 990 cases found in the Vancouver Coastal Health region and 1,610 discovered in the Fraser Health region.

Elsewhere in the province, the Interior Health region has reported 202 cases and the Northern Health region has diagnosed 65.

Meanwhile, the Island Health region has reported 135 cases, an increase of two since Thursday.

For the second time this week, a Victoria tattoo studio is announcing it has fired an employee due to claims of sexual assault.

Painted Lotus Studios released a statement on its social media platforms on Tuesday, July 7th, saying the company had terminated Corey Lyon and that it supports the work of Victim's Voices Canada, where a post was made claiming Lyon had sexually abused a client.

Artist Dave Hadden was also terminated this week from Carne Tattoo following allegations of sexual assault.

The post in question, made anonymously a day after Painted Lotus's post, says the artist was examining her for an under breast tattoo when he picked her up and put her on his table.

""That's when the little lightbulb in my head went on and I realized this was sexual. This was close to another particularly traumatizing sexual assault experience so I froze up and allowed everything else that happened to happen including aggressive oral sex.""

Lotus Tattoo said they were shocked by the allegations.

""We hope for everyone's sake that this was an isolated incident, but cannot in good conscience stand by Corey's actions. He is no longer employed at Painted Lotus. We are grateful for, and stand by the work that Victims Voices Canada does giving a platform for victims to be heard. This is an industry with a long history of toxic behaviour that has been swept under the rug. We want to support survivors and prevent abuse wherever possible.""

Another poster on Victims Voices Canada claims Lyon was also inappropriate with her.

""The incident with Corey Lyon is not an isolated one. I was tattooed by him a few years ago and the entire experience was uncomfortable for me. The tattoo I was getting was on the back of my arm so I was laying down while getting it done. Corey continuously ran his hands up and down my back and the backs of my thighs and at certain points would rest his hand on my butt. Throughout out the tattoo he kept calling me baby girl and sweetheart and repeatedly asked if I was single.""

In an email to CFAX 1070, the owner of Painted Lotus said they are focusing on the mental health of their clientele, studio and staff.

""The damage caused by abusers traumatizes their victims, and from this experience, we know it also goes beyond that. Our entire community is damaged, families torn apart, and the sacred professional trusts between artist and client have been broken. We hope that the current whistleblowing movement gives victims a voice and a chance to heal first and foremost. For those seeing these accounts from the outside, we hope it creates more opportunity for accountability and self-assessment in our industry. As tattooers, we can all do better to create a place of trust and safety. We are humbled by every human who allows us to work with them everyday. The trust they extend to us is deserving of the utmost respect and we will continue to evolve with this as our focus.""

Lyon has not been charged and none of the allegations have been tested in court.

On Friday in B.C. Supreme Court in Victoria, Madame Justice Jennifer Power passed sentence over the 51-year-old Mostowy, the former owner of All-Canadian Construction.

He was convicted of sexually assaulting his employee over two to three weeks between May and June of 2014.

Mostowy assaulted the female employee on six separate occasions while he was out on bail after being accused of sexually assaulting five women who worked in his Langford-based office in 2010 and 2011.

During Friday’s sentencing, Power referenced a written victim impact statement in which Mostowy’s victim wrote she has suffered with depression and has been subjected to financial hardship since the sexual assaults.

Power also noted the similarity of the sexual offences suffered by the female employee in 2014 and the circumstances of a previous sexual assault conviction in January 2016.

In January 2017, the Langford contractor was sentenced to 36 months in prison for sexually assaulting five female employees. At his 2016 trial, the court heard all five of the female employees describe similar circumstances. At that time, the women said Mostowy gave them unwanted massages which escalated over time to unconsentual sexual touching and sexual acts.

In Friday’s sentencing decision, Power noted that Mostowy used his position of trust and power over his victim to work alone with her at job sites. It was while they were alone on those job sites that Mostowy tried to coerce the victim into touching his exposed genitals. Power suggested that Mostowy exploited his female employee’s vulnerability because, as her employer, she relied on him to earn her living as a dry-waller.

Power also noted that Mostowy continues to deny he assaulted the female dry-waller and he has shown no remorse for his actions.

Two reports from psychologists prepared for Friday’s sentencing stated that Mostowy poses a low to moderate risk to re-offend.

In a news release, Haldimand-Norfolk Public Health said the outbreak at Scotlynn Group in Vittoria was officially declared over on Friday.

“I think we’re all happy for Scotlynn, for the migrant workers, and certainly for the community,” said Kristal Chopp, Norfolk County mayor and chair of the Board of Health. “When you look at the totality of this, the program was really an employer-focused program as oppose to an employee-focused program.”

Around 200 workers tested positive for COVID-19 at the peak of the outbreak, and one person died from complications.

Chopp says there are lessons to be learned from what happened.

“We have two workers that have now admitted to concealing symptoms,” she said. “I think one of the biggest things we need to look at is who is taking those wellness checks and really evaluating them.”

Norfolk and Haldimand counties now administer serial sentinel testing on farms as a proactive measure.

Chopp describes this process as taking the highest risk population in a certain bunkhouse and testing around 10 per cent every couple of weeks.

“The idea being here is that it would give some sort of a signal in advance of a large outbreak, like we saw,” she said.

Chopp says she sent letters weeks ago calling on the provincial and federal governments to take control over the screen and quarantine process for migrant workers in a similar way that British Columbia has done.

She adds that they haven’t heard a response yet.

“This is a tragedy and crisis that could have been prevented a long time ago,” said Chris Ramsaroop, an organizer Justice for Migrant Workers. “Permanent status on arrival at the federal level is essential. It’s time.”

On the provincial level, Ramsaroop is calling for the inclusion of minimum wage for all farm workers and ensuring they have equal access to occupational health and safety.

“If people are getting sick here in Canada, or injured here in Canada, it’s our responsibility to take care of them,” he said. “This isn’t about good and bad employers. This is systematic overhaul that needs to happen.”

Ramsaroop adds that municipalities should enact their own Section 22 orders similar to the one by the Haldimand-Norfolk Health Unit.",[]

They say the number of CMV crashes last year is the highest in 20 years, and includes a 67 per cent increase in fatalities from the year before.

“We had 96 people die last year in over 84,000 crashes that we were called to on OPP-patrolled roads,” said Sgt. Kerry Schmidt of the OPP.

With the launch of Operation Safe Drive on Sunday, provincial police hope to focus on speeding and other contributing factors in these collisions.

John Way, the owner of Wayfreight Services in Guelph, says he attributes the close calls that they review on dash cam footage to improper lane changes, driver inattention, and losing control.

“We’ve seen an increase in close calls fortunately, not necessarily collisions,” he said. “You need to be hyper aware in these kinds of times.

“Trucks are in a hurry, they’re under time constraints to deliver freight, and cars don’t give trucks the room to maneuver or stop.”

OPP say the majority of the CMV collisions in 2019 were linked to the factor of speed.

“We want to make sure drivers of all vehicles are sharing the road properly and understanding what vehicles are around them and what their limitations are,” said Schmidt.

The campaign will also focus on unsafe driving behaviours.

“We have heavy loads,” said Manader Kumar, a transport driver for West Coast Commodities. “If someone is going to break in front of us it’s hard for us to break in an instant.”

On Saturday, Kumar had a 24-hour drive in front of him to North Dakota.

He says some of the drivers he is sharing the road make him worried about arriving safely.

“They’re driving like firefighters today,” said Kumar. “Every day there’s too many accidents going on, people are driving crazy.”

Other areas of focus in the OPP campaign include making sure drivers are scheduling maintenance and conducting daily inspections.",[]

Environment Canada says it is possible for 50-100 mm of rain on Saturday in the area.

The heavy rain could produce localized flooding, according to the agency.

On Friday, a summer thunderstorm rolled through Waterloo Region, lighting up the sky and bringing some much-needed rain to the area.

Friday also marked the 10th straight day with temperatures over 30 C.

Environment Canada issued a severe thunderstorm warning around 6:30 p.m., warning of flash flooding, strong winds and possible hail. That warning ended shortly after 8 p.m.

Social media users showed flooding on some Kitchener streets as storm drains worked to keep up with rain. Forsyth Drive in the Westmount neighbourhood turned into a pond during the storm.

An Environment Canada meteorologist said 63 millimetres of rain fell from the thunderstorms over the course of a few hours. The four hours of rain brought 70 per cent of normal monthly levels.

The rain also helped rivers return to normal levels. Conestogo River returned to its normal summer flow level on Friday night.

Here are some photos of the storm as it rolled through southern Ontario and Waterloo Region:

The comments from Venki Ramakrishnan come as two new peer-reviewed studies showed how wearing face coverings may help significantly reduce the spread of viruses such as COVID-19.

""It used to be quite normal to have quite a few drinks and drive home, and it also used to be normal to drive without seatbelts,"" Ramakrishnan wrote in a comment article.

""Today both of those would be considered antisocial, and not wearing face coverings in public should be regarded in the same way.""

Ramakrishnan stressed how masks are only genuinely effective if worn by most people.

""If all of us wear one, we protect each other and thereby ourselves, reducing transmission,"" he said.

The COVID-19 pandemic has spread at different speeds throughout the world and there are a number of public health interventions that appear to have flattened the curve of localised new infections, including lockdowns and social distancing.

Estimates vary, but it is thought around 40-60 per cent of transmissions occur when carriers are pre- or asymptomatic -- that is, they may not know they are ill but are still able to infect others.

One study by teams from the Universities of Pennsylvania and Cambridge analyzed pregnant women admitted for delivery in New York City who were screened for COVID-19.

They found that 13.7 per cent of the women were carrying the virus, 88 per cent of whom showed no symptoms.

Cloth face masks reduce oral particle dispersion between 50-100 per cent, depending on a number of factors, the researchers wrote.

In pre-symptomatic individuals, studies have shown that viral droplets are emitted not only by sneezing and coughing, but also by talking and breathing, meaning mass face coverings would significantly reduce the risk of new infections.

BRITAIN EXCEPTIONAL

Another study published Monday in the Royal Society outlined vast discrepancies in mask-wearing rates among rich nations.

In late April -- as COVID-19 raged throughout Europe -- mask-wearing uptake in Britain was around 25 per cent, the study found.

This compared to 83.4 per cent in Italy, 65.8 per cent in the United States and 63.8 per cent in Spain.

The authors said that while none of the countries studied had a culture of mask-wearing, those with established and clear public guidance had a far higher uptake.

""It isn't the public's fault for not wearing masks in the U.K.,"" said Melinda Mills, director of the Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science at the University of Oxford and lead author.

""Rather, consistent policies and effective public messaging is vital.

""People in countries like Italy, the U.S. and Spain... have rapidly adopted face coverings largely because the authorities provided them with clear guidelines to understand why they should wear them.""",[]

The Canadian Association of Police Chiefs released a report on Thursday recommending all police agencies recognize substance abuse and addiction as a public health issue.

""[It's] time for us to take a different, modernized, innovative and bold approach to managing addiction in our country,"" WRPS Chief Bryan Larkin said. ""Let's not criminalize addiction, let's actually move towards a public health model.""

The CAPC wants the federal government to establish a national task force to research drug policy reform.

Sanguen Health Centre clinical supervisor and educator Alice Maguire said decriminalization would help reduce the stigma associated with addictions.

""This has a lot of potential to be really, really helpful, to save lives,"" she said. ""That will ultimately lead to less overdose deaths and less crimes associated with substance use.""

However, Cambridge councillor Jan Liggett, who said she opposes consumption and treatment sites in the city, said adopting this approach could be dangerous.

""Decriminalized just gives free rein for more happening on the streets,"" Liggett said. ""You'll have more and more people actively using out in the open because there are no consequences, there's no enforcement of the law.""

Larkin said decriminalization isn't legalization, meaning police will continue to stop trafficking, producing and importing drugs.

""We don't support perpetual drug use,"" he said. ""We still believe drugs ought to be illegal, it's how we manage the outcome.""",[]

The associate last worked at the store at 300 King George Rd. on July 5.

A company spokesperson tells CTV that any other employees who were in prolonged contact with the infected person have been directed to self-isolate.

It's not clear how many people have been asked to self-isolate, but the spokesperson says that they are being paid for the two weeks they're doing so.

Walmart says it is in contact with the employee and has been in touch with public health.

The company says that the store undergoes enhanced cleaning, and that the company has put in place other physical distancing measures.

The spokesperson says that the store has increased its store cleanings, does wellness checks on staff at the start of each shift and offering associates gloves and masks.

Plexiglas dividers have been also been installed at cash registers and in pharmacies and shopping carts are being cleaned regularly, the store says.

""The local public health [unit] will be involved with issues of implementation and clarification that are specific to our settings in the region,"" she said at the region's COVID-19 update on Friday.

Education Minister Stephen Lecce said health officials will ultimately be responsible for deciding the best option for their regions. If students do go back for in-class learning, it will look much different than it did before the pandemic.

The instructions issued by Dr. Miriam Klassen, the area’s Medical Officer of Health, state that business ownersmust implement the policy for everyone entering commercial establishments.

“These additional instructions for commercial establishments that are open to the public build upon the diligent work many are already doing to ensure physical distancing and hand sanitizers,” said Dr. Klassen in a news release. “Face coverings are extra protection to prevent COVID-19 spread, they also send a message that the wearer wants to protect others.”

Public health describes a face covering as a medical or non-medical mask, a bandana, scarf, or other item that covers the mouth and nose.

Certain exemptions to the requirement are in place, like for those who have a medical condition that prevents them from wearing a mask.

“As we work towards a successful Stage 3 re-opening, we also increase the risk of spreading the virus,” said Klassen. “Normalizing the use of masks helps reduce this risk and helps keep businesses and services up and running.

“We ask everyone to be kind and understanding when others can’t wear masks, and to physically distance from them.”

Public health says business operators should use signs and verbal reminders to enforce the policy, but that there is no requirement to turn away customers.

According to public health’s website as of Thursday, Huron and Perth counties have 58 confirmed cases of COVID-19, five deaths, 52 resolved, and have tested 9,386 people.

Huron Perth Public Health is the latest region to enact a mandatory mask policy. Earlier this week, Waterloo Region voted in favour of bylaws that would make them mandatory on transit and in businesses.

Lucy Van Doormaal, who is just three months old, has spinal muscular atrophy. Without treatment for the rare neuromuscular disorder, her parents don't think she'll make it to her first birthday.

""She just looks like any normal three-month-old, but she is eating through a feeding tube,"" Heather Kendall, Lucy's aunt, said. ""It's very different and at night she sleeps with a respirator machine.""

An antibody test when Lucy was five weeks old showed she could be a candidate for a ground-breaking gene therapy called Zolgensma. The price tag of that treatment is $3 million.

""They had heard of this treatment and it's availability, but $3 million seemed like an insane amount of money,"" Kendall said.

The single-dose treatment isn't covered under Canadian health care.

""Every day that goes by, that quality or that ability gets lost,"" Lucy's grandfather Brian Van Doormaal said. ""We need to raise that money as soon as possible.""

There are other treatments available, but Brian said they're also expensive and more long term.

The family is raising money through a GoFundMe for the treatment and to keep Lucy from getting worse. It raised $1 million in one week. Donations came in from across the country, even garnering celebrity attention from Ryan Reynolds and Jillian Harris.

""It's been very overwhelming in a very positive way,"" Lucy's mother Laura Van Doormaal said. ""We are uplifted by the community's response to Lucy's story.""

""At low tide you can walk out on the floor of the Bay of Fundy for a mile or more in many places, but watch the tide, because in six hours and 13 minutes it's going to be 50 feet higher up the shore,"" she said.

Peterkin and others have been working to get the UNESCO designation for the last five years.

Meanwhile staff at the Discovery Geopark, located on the upper half of Newfoundland's Bonavista Peninsula, have been working for the past 13 years to get their designation.

The park contains some of the earliest fossils of animal life, with rock dating back more than a half-billion years.

""You can see really unique geology that is of national and international significance,"" said John Norman, chairman of Discovery Geopark.

""There are some of the oldest complex life fossils on the planet,"" he said.

Many of the fossils are still in place in the rocks, while others have been removed for display in the provincial museum, The Rooms, in St. John's.

The Discovery Geopark now has 10 sites with interpretation, trails and other infrastructure.

""We have dozens of other sites within our geosites inventory that aren't yet showcased to the public,"" Norman said. ""Some of them will never be. Some of them are for research. Some of them are for academic only and others will be showcased to the public as more infrastructure is added.""

There are now 163 global geoparks in 44 countries, and Peterkin said being part of that group provides important exposure.

""People who travel to one geopark will soon learn about the next geopark. We'll be able to reach visitors that we were never able to reach on our own,"" she said.

Norman said the designation puts them on the world stage, especially in Asia and Europe where geoparks are popular.

Cliffs of Fundy and Discovery join three other UNESCO Global Geoparks in Canada: Stonehammer in New Brunswick, Perce in Quebec and Tumbler Ridge in British Columbia.

The label's American designer Virgil Abloh said the spring 2021 collection will be unveiled in Shanghai on August 6 and in Japan afterwards.

Both will be open to the general public and will be livestreamed, he added.

The announcement came after Abloh made a mixed live action and animated film for Paris men's fashion week, which is being held online for the first time because of the coronavirus pandemic.

""Message in a Bottle"", the first in a series of teaser films, shows a character called ""Zoooom"" and his friends packing up crates at Vuitton's headquarters on the edge of the French capital and putting them on a barge on the River Seine before waving them off on their journey to the Far East.

Asia is becoming luxury brands' most important market, with China alone likely to account for nearly half of sales by 2025, according to some estimates.

Abloh, the first Black American creative director of a top French fashion house, also revealed that he was making a push toward greater sustainability in Vuitton's collections.

Abloh, who also founded the streetwear label Off-White, said this would involve both recycling, upcycling and even ""recycling of existing ideas for new creations"".

""This next show is probably the biggest leap that I've made in terms of proposing a new system, how it lives and operates,"" he told the industry bible, Women's Wear Daily.

The fashion industry has been thrown into turmoil by the coronavirus, with designers questioning how it operates, the frenetic calendar of seasonal collections and even catwalk shows themselves.

Paris men's fashion week ends Monday, with the avant-garde Chinese designer Sean Suen showing Friday alongside big hitters Dries Van Noten and the American Rick Owens.",[]

Data analyzed by the University of British Columbia suggests the gender gap has been widening since the country saw its first few cases of COVID-19.

In a news release Tuesday, the Vancouver-based school said the gap between fathers and mothers going back to work went from 0.8 to 7.3 percentage points for parents of school-aged children.

The gap also increased for those with preschoolers, from 1.0 to 2.5 percentage points.

The UBC researchers say child care is a major factor.

With schools closed across the country, parents were forced to find other options, and much of that responsibility fell to mothers.

Among the reasons why moms are staying home is which parent makes more money.

""A pre-existing gender pay gap has created an incentive in many families for fathers to remain in the workforce. Mothers are also more likely to work part-time jobs that are first to be cut during economic crises. And in families with less education, mothers often work in retail and hospitality jobs that were hit hard by lockdowns,"" the news release from UBC said.

""By this point it's become clear that the pandemic is not the 'great equalizer,'"" UBC sociology professor Sylvia Fuller said in a statement.

Fuller said the study she conducted with UBC's Yue Qian showed that, ""just as some people have proved more vulnerable to getting really sick, some groups are more vulnerable economically and socially as a result of the pandemic.""

Fuller described the pandemic as having a dramatic impact on mothers' employment.

It's not the first time a difference has been discussed. Last month, B.C. Finance Minister Carole James said the latest unemployment data showed gender, as well as age, income level and sector, were factors in who is being hit hardest.

""The majority of job losses have happened to people who are making at (or) near minimum wage. That means young people and women have been the most vulnerable,"" James said in mid-June.

Speaking about the unemployment rate in B.C. in May, James said women were 25 per cent more likely to be out of work than men, and nearly two-thirds of people who've lost their jobs in the service sector are women.

The service sector accounts for 90 per cent of B.C. job loss, James said last month.

At the time, she cited child care as among the reasons why women are disproportionately impacted.

UBC's study also looked at parents' impact based on education level.

Those with high school diplomas or less, whose children are school aged, saw the biggest widening of the gap.

In February, UBC says, women's unemployment was 1.6 percentage points behind men's.

But by May, that gap was more than 10 times larger, at 16.8 percentage points.

The data used in the study was obtained through Statistics Canada's Labour Force Survey. Researchers looked only at people who were employed at the start of the pandemic or in the previous year, which the school says amounted to about 110,000.

The study was posted Monday by Canadian Public Policy, a quarterly journal on economic and social policies.",[]

Patty Stop, located near Port Union Road and Lawrence Avenue East, got a highly coveted shout out from Drake on Instagram earlier this week. The rapper posted a photo of one of the shop’s stuffed patties to his 68.8 million followers and the response that followed was incredible, according to co-owner Freddy Gyebi.

“In terms of social media, my followers on my Instagram have been skyrocketing,” Gyebi told CTV News Toronto. “My views have been skyrocketing.”

Gyebi says he’s been friends with Drake for quite some time now, but admits he didn’t actually know the rap superstar would take to Instagram to show his support.

“A couple weeks back he was like ‘yo, I need to try one of your stuffed patties,” Gyebi said.

So the restaurateur made his way to Drake’s mega-mansion on The Bridle Path for a personal patty party.

“Set up the whole shebang, in terms of the lettuce, the tomatoes. I made the stuffed patty for him, he had it, he liked it. Then he had another one, said he liked it. And I didn’t know he was going to post it, I didn’t even know he posted it until one of my friends was like ‘yo he posted it.’”

The post that followed on Monday evening was simple, a stuffed patty on a countertop, tagged @pattystopinc with a head exploding emoji, the ultimate sign of respect.

According to Gyebi, the interest that came next has been immense and is more than welcome following a forced closure due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“We had to shut down,” Gyebi explains. “COVID has definitely taken a toll on the business, but we’re still here, we’re still able to sell our patties to the community.”

In the meantime, the owners started a GoFundMe campaign in an effort to provide food to Toronto’s front-line workers with a goal of serving up 300 meals a week.

And while Gyebi admits that he doesn’t have a culinary background, he and his co-owner Jason Cheddie agree that their product is different because of what goes into it.

“It’s definitely the love we put into it. We put a lot of quality ingredients into our patties. It’s just not your average patty,” Cheddie said. “Everything is homemade. Straight original from our recipes.”

Drake understands that effort, according to Gyebi, and says that’s why an endorsement from the city’s biggest artist is so significant.

“To me, it means a lot. It just shows that, you know, he believes in being Torontonian. He wouldn’t do it if he didn’t like it, that’s the type of person he is,” Gyebi said.

Windsor Castle, west of London, where the 94-year-old monarch has been staying since the start of the pandemic, will be open for pre-booked, timed visits from July 23.

The Royal Mews and the Queen's Gallery at her London home of Buckingham Palace will reopen the same day, as will the Palace of Holyroodhouse, her official residence in Edinburgh.

However, the State Rooms at Buckingham Palace, Frogmore House and Clarence House will stay shut over the summer months ""owing to the operational challenges of social distancing"".

The Royal Collection Trust, which looks after the Royal Collection of art and manages public access to the official residences, has reportedly suffered a major drop in income that has forced it to plan voluntary redundancies.

It had been expected to make £77 million (85.6 million euros, US$96.5 million) this year, but the lockdown has caused its earnings to fall to £13 million, according to the Daily Telegraph, citing an internal memo.

Visitors to the royal residences will be asked to book tickets in advance and new measures have been introduced, including one-way routes, to maintain social distancing to limit the spread of coronavirus.",[]

Fuji-Q Highland, an amusement park located in Fujiyoshida, posted a video June 17 in which two well-dressed men ride one of the park's roller-coasters in complete silence while wearing face masks.

A Japanese-language message appears at the end of the video. Google's Translate app converts the message into English as ""scream in my heart.""

However, a July 8 report on the video in the Wall Street Journal had a different take, translating the message as ""please scream inside your heart.""

That translation caught the fancy of many on Twitter. CNN reporter Jake Tapper labelled it ""the motto of 2020"", while author Jeff Sharlet called it ""a means of avoiding virus spray, and … a five-word summation of 2020.""

""I scream inside my heart every day,"" filmmaker Don Hertzfeldt noted.

Another Twitter user described ""please scream inside your heart"" as ""a very bad translation [but] a powerful sentence that enriches the English language.""

Fuji-Q Highland is not alone in asking its visitors to replace their screams with silence to minimize the potential for COVID-19 to spread. A major Japanese theme park industry group issued guidelines in May for safe thrill-seeking during the coronavirus era, recommending that nobody shout or scream when riding a roller-coaster and everybody practice physical distancing in haunted houses, according to travel publication TimeOut.

Founded in New York in 1818, Brooks Brothers survived two world wars, the Great Depression and even managed to stay afloat as dress standards eased in the office. But the pandemic pushed it into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection with so many stores closed and, with millions working from home, a crisp suit pushed to the very bottom of shopping lists.

Brooks Brothers will permanently close more than a quarter of its 200 stores.

The retail sector was under severe pressure even before the pandemic. Rival Barneys New York filed for bankruptcy protection late last year. Since COVID-19 began to spread in the U.S, J.Crew,Neiman Marcus,J.C. Penney and other national retail chains have followed suit.

The virus has hollowed out spending in many places and the accelerated the shift to online shopping, mostly to the benefit of big retailers like Walmart, Target and Amazon.com. Stores have begun to open in some parts of the country, but millions of people are still hunkered down at home. There are regions in the U.S. that are now getting hit with a wave of infections and some companies like Apple are shutting down stores again in those areas.

Brooks Brothers said Wednesday that it will continue operations as it restructures and is looking to reopen shops that are not being closed permanently. The company employed 4,000 people in March, before it furloughed about a third of its workers.

Jonathan Pasternak, a bankruptcy lawyer at Davidoff Hutcher & Citron, said that even before the pandemic, Brooks Brothers' store expansion and the cost of making clothes in the U.S. had created a financial burden, but he does not believe the company will disappear.

“The good thing about Brooks Brothers: It's a very strong brand,” he said.

The company has a storied history, dressing at least 40 American presidents, including Abraham Lincoln, who was wearing a Brooks Brothers coat when he was assassinated in 1865. Brooks Brothers' two-button suits were a favourite of President John F. Kennedy.

But its cultural influence has been broad.

Clark Cable wore Brooks Brothers and Jennifer Aniston appeared on the cover of GQ magazine wearing nothing but a red, white and blue Brooks Brothers tie.

The Duck Brand Stuck at Prom Scholarship Contest challenged students around North America to create their best prom outfit out of duct tape.

Lena Hart, who was one of about 400 applicants in Canada and the U.S., spent 146 hours and 12 rolls of tape to create her dress.

""I started by going through past sketchbooks that I had, and I had two prom dresses that I designed,"" said Hart. ""They were my dream prom dresses. So I took those two designs and combined them into one.""

The winner in both dress and tux categories will win $10,000, while the runners up will get $500 and $100-worth of products from the company.

Hart's dress includes dozens of gold tape roses and petals. A video on the company's website shows how she created sheets with the tape to resemble real fabric, and then cut them to shape and taped together the final product.

""I took giant pieces of paper, cut them out and put them on my body to see if they would fit and adjusted them from there, "" said Hart. ""Then I made sheets of duct tape to emulate fabric, cut out those pieces of fabric from the duct tape, and taped them all together. So it's 100 per cent duct tape.""

Hart is up against four other finalists, whose fates will be decided by voting. At the time of this writing, she was in third place with nearly 7,400 votes.

Le Chateau, which operates 129 stores in eight provinces as well as some manufacturing operations, issued the dire warning late Monday as it reported its latest quarterly earnings report. Although the results covered a period before the pandemic, the company also noted the significant effects that being ordered to close all of its stores has had on its business.

""There are material uncertainties that cast significant doubt upon [our] ability to continue as a going concern,"" the company said in a press release accompanying its earnings report.

Those uncertainties predated the pandemic, as the company said it was already in debt and has defaulted on loans. Now, though, the Montreal-based retailer says it needs to obtain new financing to stay afloat.

Although all of Le Chateau's stores had reopened as of last week, the company warned that the pandemic ""will have a material and adverse impact"" on its business and that it does not expect to fully resume normal operations until 2022.

The company said it is in negotiations with its existing lenders and seeking new sources of financing, while also talking to its landlords about possible rent relief. It announced last week that it is manufacturing up to 500,000 hospital gowns as part of a federal contract.

Le Chateau's fourth-quarter results included a sales decline of 6.5 per cent year-over-year, to $175.9 million, despite a significant increase in online sales. The company recorded a net loss of $51.2 million, up from $6.1 million the previous year, which included a $42-million write-off and write-down of long-term assets.

Despite revealing that its entire operation may not be able to survive another year, Le Chateau has not announced plans to close any stores. This is in sharp contrast to how many other clothiers have handled pandemic-exacerbated downturns, as retailers including The Children's Place, Aldo and Reitmans have announced plans to close stores belonging to some of their brands this year. One analyst has suggested that more than 2,500 big-brand store closures could be announced in Canada this year.

The cover is one of four covers for the magazine’s July and August issue, and was revealed this week in a post on the magazine’s Instagram account.

“It’s about mental health,” the caption read. “It’s about time.”

The photo shows a nude model crouched in a bathtub in a larger room decorated in blue and white tile, with two nurses standing above her, dressed in old-fashioned uniforms.

The cover triggered a wave of criticism calling out the “offensive” and “disrespectful” concept.

Comments below the original Instagram post accused the magazine of attempting to “aestheticize” the struggles of mental health by using a mental health institution as a setting for a fashion shoot.

“MENTAL ILLNESS IS NOT AN EDITORIAL CONCEPT,” one Instagram user commented.

Vogue Portugal issued a statement on July 3 saying the cover was intended to “open up the topic of mental health” and spark “discussion.”

The magazine did not address the backlash directly in their statement, or address concerns that the cover was tone-deaf, but said that the issue itself contained interviews with psychologists “and other experts in the field.” They also said the theme of mental health was “not linked to the theme of madness, but instead [was] covered as an aspect of human emotions and behavior.”

They claim the design of the room depicted in the cover was formed after “deep research of hundreds of reportage photographs from some of the most relevant and famous documentarists who have captured mental health hospitals,” confirming that the cover is drawing on the history of mental health institutions for its aesthetic.

“We acknowledge the significance of the topic of mental health and our intention, through visual storytelling, is to shine a light on the important issues of today,” the statement reads.

Advocates say this defence misses the point completely.

Poorna Bell, a journalist and author who has spoken up about mental health advocacy since losing her husband to suicide, said on Twitter that Vogue Portugal’s defence was “unbelievable.

“The discussion has been had,” she wrote. “You’re late to the table and offensive.

“I don’t have patience or time for people and brands that in the face [of] overwhelming upset and evidence around why what they’ve done is problematic, cannot apologize and say they […] will do better.”

Rose Cartwright, cofounder of Made of Millions, a non-profit platform that is dedicated to mental health advocacy, pointed out in a statement Sunday that a fashion magazine is uniquely ill-equipped to comprehend or discuss mental health struggles.

“You could barely design a more perfect engine of mental ill health than Vogue - an advertising machine that finds beautiful ways of lying to women about what will make them happy,” she wrote on Instagram.

She pointed out that “madness” and many issues with mental health develop because people “exist in impossible situations that their minds can't make sense of, or because they've inherited holding patterns from generations of poverty, discrimination and abuse.

“These subjects are tonally off-colour for a brand that's built on luxury.”

The model depicted in the cover, Simona Kirchnerova, initially described it as a “career highlight,” on her Instagram to have been featured on the cover with her actual mother and grandmother playing the nurses.

If you've ever wondered what space smells like, a new perfume may answer that for you. A Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign was recently launched for a new fragrance called Eau de Space to bring the smell of outer space back down to Earth.

The fragrance was developed by Steve Pearce, according to Eau de Space product manager Matt Richmond. Pearce is a chemist and the founder of Omega Ingredients, a company focused on the ""creation of the highest quality, provenance driven, natural flavours and ingredients for the food and beverage industry,"" its website says.

Pearce was originally contracted by NASA to recreate the smell in 2008 after he worked on a scent exhibition for which he recreated the smell of the inside of the Mir Space Station, Pearce told CNN.

Using notes from astronauts who described space smelling like ozone, hot metal and fried steak, Pearce used his knowledge of flavour and fragrance chemistry to produce combinations matching those descriptions, he said.

It took Pearce a few weeks to gather the ""right aroma chemicals"" to try out a few ideas before arriving at something he found satisfactory, he said.

The scent was created to help astronauts train before launching in orbit, and it was part of NASA's goal of eliminating any potential surprises astronauts might encounter or experience in space, according to the Kickstarter.

""It's kind of like a smell from a gun, right after you fire the shot,"" Peggy Whitson, an astronaut and former resident of the International Space Station, told CNN in a 2002 interview about the smell of space. ""I think it kind of has almost a bitter kind of smell in addition to being smoky and burned.""

Richmond said that he has struggled to describe how the fragrance smells, adding, ""Astronauts describe the smell as a mix of gunpowder, seared steak, raspberries and rum.""

The company's main goal with Eau de Space is to increase interest in STEM learning for K-12 students through what Richmond called ""experiential education."" He hopes that Eau de Space will start the discussion, with parents, teachers and scientists taking it from there.

Richmond revealed that they are looking into releasing a fragrance called Smell of the Moon based on the excitement around Eau de Space.",[]

Across Pakistan's ""mango belt"" in Punjab and Sindh provinces, farmers say a long winter and changing rain patterns have slashed production by up to half this year -- just as virus shutdowns sparked border restrictions and spiralling export costs.

""There are multiple problems that mango farmers are facing,"" said Rana Muhammad Azim, whose family has been producing the fruit in Punjab for generations.

""The situation is extremely worrisome for us. The mangoes are ready, but no exporter is willing to take the risk and place orders,"" he said, adding that he was already suffering from a 40 percent decline in the harvest.

Pakistan produced more than 1.5 million tonnes of mangoes in 2019 -- and exported a record 115,000 tonnes worth $80 million -- making it the sixth-largest exporter of the fruit in the world.

But Waheed Ahmed, head of a produce association in Pakistan, said exports have dropped around 40 percent compared to the same period last year, with just a few months left of the season.

Known in South Asia as the ""king of fruits"", the mango originated in the Indian subcontinent with two dozen varieties grown in Pakistan.

The country's most treasured variety is the greenish-yellow Chaunsa, known for its rich, unique flavour and juicy pulp.

The fruit also helps sweeten diplomatic relations, with Pakistan sending crates of its best produce to India's prime minister every year, regardless of the political climate between the hostile neighbours.

It has also earned a place in recent literary history, with renowned Pakistan author Mohammed Hanif longlisted for the prestigious Man Booker Prize for ""A Case of Exploding Mangoes"", a comic novel based on an unexplained 1988 plane crash that killed former president Muhammad Zia ul-Haq.

ROTTING FRUITS

With much of the world's air traffic grounded by the coronavirus, exports of the best prime, ripe fruit by plane to the US and Europe have been particularly hard hit, but ground transport has also been badly affected.

Dozens of trucks piled high with the yellow fruit were stranded at the border with Iran last month, their precious cargo rotting in the searing 40-degree heat.

Even where trading has continued via sea to the key Middle East market -- which accounts for 70 percent of exports -- demand has plunged.

Since the virus took hold shoppers are making fewer outings to supermarkets and are wary of spending on luxury items, while Pakistani migrant workers who relish the fruit have returned home.

The domestic market brings far less revenue.

In one bright spot, harvests were at least spared the ravages of the worst locust plague in 25 years, which wiped out entire vegetable and cotton harvests.

As flights resume and border restrictions are eased, growers hope to increase exports in the second half of the season to avoid a complete lost season.

Most noteworthy were a new bonus plan aimed at getting firms to retain workers that have been idle for months, as well as tax cuts for hard-pressed firms in the tourism and hospitality sectors and a new ""Eat Out to Help Out"" discount scheme.

Treasury chief Rishi Sunak said his latest major intervention is aimed at weaning the U.K. economy off emergency measures announced when the country was put into lockdown in March, while at the same time protecting and generating as many jobs as possible during the recession.

""People need to know that although hardship lies ahead, no-one will be left without hope,"" he told socially distanced lawmakers.

So far, Britain has been spared the sharp rises in unemployment seen in the U.S., for example, because of the Job Retention Scheme, whereby the government has been paying the majority of the salaries of workers who were not fired. Some 1.1 million employers have taken advantage of the program to furlough 9.4 million people at a cost to the government of 27.4 billion pounds ($35 billion).

While confirming that it will end in October, Sunak said the government is introducing a new program that could cost a further 9.4 billion pounds if everyone who has been furloughed is given his or her job back. Under this plan, the government will pay companies a 1,000-pound bonus for each employee they take back.

""Leaving the furlough scheme open forever gives people false hope that it will always be possible to return to the jobs they had before,"" he said. ""The longer people are on furlough, the more likely it is their skills could fade, and they will find it harder to get new opportunities.""

The government hopes employers will make use of the new program as they try to get back on track during what is a historically savage recession -- in March and April alone, the U.K. economy shrank 25%. Many economists think unemployment could more than double to over 3 million this year, to levels last seen in the 1980s.

Anneliese Dodds, the economics spokesperson for the main opposition Labour Party, said Sunak should have made the Job Retention Scheme more flexible rather than scrapping it outright.

""It should have been the day when the millions of British people worried about their jobs and future prospects had a load taken off their shoulders,"" she said.

Sunak reserved extra support for tourism and hospitality, which were shut down during the lockdown. Pubs and restaurants, for example, only reopened Saturday for the first time in over three months.

Sunak said firms within those sectors will see taxes on sales of food and non-alcoholic drinks as well as on accommodation and admission to attractions slashed to 5% from 20%. This measure, Sunak said, is worth 4 billion pounds and should help companies support 2.4 million jobs.

He also announced a new dining discount plan for August that will give people a 50% discount at participating restaurants, cafes and pubs between Monday and Wednesday up to a maximum 10 pounds per person.

U.K. Hospitality, which represents the sector, said the measures provide many firms ""much-needed help to get going again in earnest.""

However, Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the umbrella Trades Union Congress, said Sunak should have given low-paid workers a pay increase rather than offering ""a dining out discount for the well-off.""

Other measures announced included 2 billion pounds to fund work placement schemes for 16-to-24-year-olds, a 3 billion-pound environmental package and the temporary elimination of a tax on house purchases below 500,000 pounds.

Make U.K., which represents companies in the manufacturing sector, praised Sunak's ""bold intent"" and singled out the training measures for the young.

""This is not the beginning of the end of this crisis, however, but perhaps the end of the beginning as far as the economy is concerned,"" Chief Executive Stephen Phipson said.",[]

The San Francisco-based tech giant said Tuesday that users in Montreal and Toronto can now order groceries through its Uber and Uber Eats apps.

""They'll be able to place orders from local merchants and receive them in as little as one to two hours,"" Daniel Danker, who runs Uber's product team, told reporters.

A demonstration of the new service showed thousands of items available from retailers including Walmart, Metro, Rexall, Costco, Longos, Pet Valu and Well.ca.

The company's foray into the grocery sector comes after Uber advertised in November 2018 that it was hiring a head of grocery product in Toronto.

The company remained secretive about the role, but a year later, Uber's potential interest in a grocery service was a hot topic again when it announced it was acquiring a majority stake in Chilean grocery delivery start-up Cornershop.

The deal was held up by a Mexican Competition Authority investigation, but is supposed to close in the coming days.

Cornershop will serve as Uber's partner in the grocery delivery venture, which will launch in more than a dozen Latin American cities alongside the Canadian markets.

Uber faces stiff competition with its new service. Amazon.com Inc. and Instacart are already going head-to-head with supermarket brands like Walmart and Loblaw Companies Ltd.

Uber believes it can edge out some of the competition because it sees groceries as a natural extension of its booming food delivery service and a way for the company to become a one-stop shop for every meal.

Grocery delivery has only become more important during the COVID-19 pandemic because more Canadians have transitioned to work from home and Uber's ride-hailing business is still in ""recovery mode,"" according to Danker.

""I think this would have made a lot sense in a pre-COVID world, but our world has just fundamentally changed and so this represents even more of a huge responsibility for us,"" Danker said.

Representatives from Teamsters Canada, the United Food and Commercial Workers Union Canada and Unifor point to the dozens of retail and warehouse workers who remain sickened with COVID-19 and a report Monday from CTV News in Windsor, Ont. that two workers had just tested positive in the border city.

Some of those previously sickened have returned to work. A few workers have died from the novel coronavirus disease.

Speaking to a House of Commons committee Monday, the union leaders recommended stricter labour standards and oversight for the sector, beyond getting to the bottom of why the pay premium was abruptly rolled back by some of the largest grocery chains.

Unifor national president Jerry Dias said the fact two more workers now have COVID-19 ""is probably proof positive"" that the pandemic premium for hourly workers shouldn't have disappeared.

When the pandemic struck Canada in March, major grocery chains said they would boost front-line workers' wages on average about $2 per hour.

But late last month, one after another, the chains announced they were ending the pandemic pay bump because the pace of business had eased, giving the unions short notice about the decision.

MPs on the industry committee agreed to look into the matter and will have a chance to question retail executives at the end of the week.

""Look, the argument is nonsense and every one of us on this panel understands that and I will argue they understand that as well,"" Dias said, referring to grocery-chain executives.

""So this had nothing to do with somehow the pandemic, 'Oh we're seeing a pot at the end of the rainbow,' this was a decision made about money.""

Paul Meinema, national president of the food workers' union, said the federal government should play a more active role in boosting wages for workers in the sector.

Grocery stores were among the businesses governments deemed essential services that didn't have to close as public health restrictions forced companies to cut operations to slow the spread of COVID-19.

The pandemic pay was supposed to recognize that workers were being asked to come in to help feed a population ordered to stay home. Conservative MP Michelle Rempel Garner said she wanted to determine how to properly compensate workers who are being put in that situation.

Spending on things like gasoline and travel fell but spending on groceries has gone up -- one of the few areas of the economy where things appeared positive during the lockdowns of April and May.

NDP MP Brian Masse, who represents a riding in Windsor, Ont., said the industry needs more oversight, calling the committee probe ""the first dive at this.""

Stephanie Levitz, The Canadian Press





OTTAWA -- A new poll suggests turbulence ahead for airlines seeking public support for their current COVID-19 plans.

Seventy-two per cent of Canadians surveyed by Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies say they're not comfortable flying since a decision by some airlines to relax their own in-flight physical distancing requirements.

As of July 1, Air Canada and WestJet both ended policies blocking the sale of adjacent seats.

The measure was seen to align with a guidance document for the aviation industry issued by Transport Canada in April to help curb the spread of COVID-19.

Among other things, the department had suggested passengers should be widely spaced when possible, though they did not make it mandatory.

Airlines, however, are required to make passengers and air crews wear masks.

Only 22 per cent of those surveyed said they're comfortable getting aboard with no in-flight physical distancing and a requirement to wear masks.

There's more to it to keep flights safe, WestJet said in a statement last week after critics attacked its plan.

“What makes an airplane, and the entire journey, safe is the layers of enhanced cleaning, the wearing of masks and the hospital-grade HEPA filters that remove 99.999 per cent of all airborne particles,” the airline said.

“The hygiene standards we have now are world-class and backed by industry experts.”

Critics have also previously pounced on the airlines for another move: refusing to fully refund tickets for flights cancelled due to the pandemic.

Thousands of people have beseeched Transport Minister Marc Garneau to compel airlines to issue refunds, but he has refused, arguing that mandating reimbursements from a sector that's lost more than 90 per cent of its revenue would cripple the industry.

But 72 per cent of those polled say they totally oppose his decision.

In lieu of refunds, the airlines have offered vouchers but the poll suggests that it may take a while before people will rebook previously cancelled trips: 85 per cent of those surveyed told pollsters they have no plans to travel outside the country by the end of the year.

The survey polled 1,517 people and can't be assigned a margin of error because online polls are not considered truly random.

Pollsters were in the field between July 3 and 5, a historically popular few days for Canadians and Americans to be on the move between the two countries, given the July 1 Canada Day holiday and the U.S.'s July 4 Independence Day.

But the border remains closed to non-essential traffic, and the majority of Canadians surveyed said they feel it needs to stay that way. The current mutual closure agreement is due to expire July 21.

Of Canadians polled, 86 per cent said they totally disagreed with re-opening the border at the end of July, allowing Americans back into the country.

Americans seem more eager both to head north and to welcome Canadians south; 50 per cent agreed the border should re-open and 36 per cent disagreed.

The potential for cross-border transmission of the virus has been a key factor in the decision to keep the border closed. Currently, rates of COVID-19 infection in the U.S. continue to climb, while in Canada the curve appears to be on a downward trajectory nearly everywhere.

Still, the survey suggests Canadians don't feel they are out of the woods. Thirty-nine per cent believe the worst is yet to come, while 35 per cent believe the worst of the crisis has passed.

In the U.S., 42 per cent of those surveyed felt the darkest days are ahead, 25 per cent believe the U.S. is in the middle of the worst part now while 21 per cent think that's already passed.",[]

""PHAC officials, including Quarantine Officers, clinical screening officers and screening officers will be on-site to screen travellers entering Canada at these ports of entry.""

This process started eight weeks ago and is ongoing, said Jarbeau.

""All ports of entry, including airports and land borders, have 24/7 access to Quarantine Officers through a telehealth Centralized Notification System,"" she said.

At the same time, the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) is temporarily reducing its presence at 12 land and eight air points of entry while “deferring the seasonal opening” of one marine crossing and “deferring the shift to seasonal hours of operation” at another land point of entry.

Land travel also increased month over month, from about 137,000 to more than 175,400.

However, compared to 2019, volumes are still significantly lower: air travel during the week of June 22 to June 28 was down 96 per cent compared to the year prior, while land travel dipped by 87 per cent.

""On June 28, 2020 alone, travellers on US flights were down 97 per cent and international air travellers were down 95 per cent compared to the previous year. These numbers are consistent with the previous week,"" notes the weekly update from CBSA on traveller statistics.

According to the CBSA website, all travellers entering into Canada must self-isolate for 14 days if they have symptoms or a confirmed case of COVID-19, and quarantine for the same time period with no symptoms. Since March 31, new arrivals have been expected to provide contact information to border services about their whereabouts during these two weeks.

Joseph Cini told CTV News that his family was in Australia when they first heard about the novel coronavirus. He said China was supposed to be the family's final stop on their tour.

The family said they did not anticipate the virus to cause a global pandemic and continued on their trip to Vietnam before countries starting closing borders and entering lockdown.

""We started thinking, 'What are we going to do? We are a 30-hour flight home.' So we just said 'Forget it, let's find somewhere close and safe' so we headed to Phuket, Thailand,"" Joseph said.

Joseph added that the family remained in Thailand for the following four months before returning home on Saturday.

The teacher and his wife, Charo Cini, who is a nurse, decided to take sabbaticals from their careers to embark on a year of travel with their oldest son Marco, 11, and their 9-year-old twins Mateo and Daniela.

The family rented out their home and sold their car before jetting off on July 2, 2019.

Charo said in an interview with CTV News that the trip has made their children more cultured.

""It gives them perspective and not to take things for granted and becomes citizens of the world,"" Charo said.

Despite the pandemic, she says the family have enjoyed their experiences abroad and have memories that will last a lifetime.

However, Joseph said self-isolating in the family's Etobicoke home does not compare to their recent adventures.

Friends have dropped off groceries at the family's front door, but Joseph said it is difficult to not yet be able to spend time with their loved ones.

""The hard part is we have family and friends we want to see and they want to see us and we haven't seen them in a year,"" Joseph said.

The 10-day event was supposed to kick off Friday with its iconic parade of majestic horses, crowd-pleasing marching bands and colourful floats.

The COVID-19 pandemic cancelled the event for the first time since its inception in 1912, although organizers promise its proud energy and cultural experience is still alive and well.

""We may not be able to gather together or celebrate in traditional ways during Stampede 2020, but Stampede Spirit can’t be canceled,"" said Dana Peers, president and chair of the Calgary Stampede Board.

Masetti Leite swung into the saddle and started a 26,800 kilometre trek on horseback from the Calgary Stampede at the event’s centennial celebration in 2012.

For the past eight years, he has been crossing the Americas on horseback — an extraordinary dream passed down from his father and inspired by the legendary long-riders of the past.

He embarked on a journey from Calgary all the way to his native Brazil, which took him 803 days over the course of 16,000 kilometres. From there, he then headed to Ushuaia, Argentina at the very southern tip of South America.

""I knew I had to finish off the Americas after that so I went up to Fairbanks, Alaska and knew I had to compete the journey in Calgary,"" Masetti Leite said.

The Brazilian, who immigrated to Canada as a teenager, rode 2,600 kilometres last year from Fairbanks, Alaska to Grande Prairie, Alta.

On May 20 of this year, he started his final leg to Calgary with horses Max and Smokey.

""Every day I had to knock on a stranger’s door and ask for help and every day I received help, whether they had everything or they had nothing, they gave me what they had,"" explained Masetti Leie. ""That’s the most beautiful thing and something I want to share with people.""

""To be named the Calgary Stampede parade marshal is the biggest honour of my life. I love western heritage and the values that I’ve learned have made me who I am today.""

Masetti Leite is expected to enter Calgary from the northwest part of the city Friday where he will stop off at the Bowness off-leash park to prep for his final journey to the Stampede grounds.

The 2020 parade marshal will then ride down Memorial Drive to Stampede Park where he is expected to arrive between 12:15 to 12:30 for a special ceremony.

A new way to experience Stampede favourites

Despite restrictions on public gatherings, the Calgary Stampede has come up with some fun and creative ways to experience its iconic midway this year.

A number of 'grab-and-go' food events will allow Calgarians to enjoy the Stampede treats they love in a controlled environment.

A mini donut drive-thru, a BMO Kids’ Day drive-thru pancake breakfast and a Stampede food truck rally presented by Sentinel Self Storage is expected to offer up a wide variety of savoury treats.

""It’s hard to imagine a July in Calgary without a Stampede pancake breakfast, mini-donuts and other midway treats,"" said Dana Peers, president and chair of the Calgary Stampede Board.

""I’m extremely excited to share that enjoying all three of those Stampede staples will be possible this July and we also have a few more surprises in store!""

The events will take place during the following times.

Mini donut drive-thru:

Stampede Park, Noon – 9 p.m., July 6, 7, 9, 10 & 11

Pancakes to go, please?

The Community Pancake Drive-Thru presented by GMC hopes to keep the Stampede spirit alive with a free pancake breakfast at Cross Iron Mills this Saturday.

The event will run from 9 a.m. to noon and requires pre-registration online to reduce lineups and ensure breakfasts are hot and ready once people arrive.

Limited spots are available and food will only be offered to those inside vehicles, with no walk-up traffic permitted.

To register, head to CalgaryStampede.com

Bell Fireworks show lights up the sky

It wouldn’t be Stampede without fireworks, right?

The Bell Fireworks Spectacular will make good on bringing Calgarians a display that will be bigger and higher than traditional Stampede fireworks and available to anyone with a view of the city skyline.

Fireworks shows will take place at 11 p.m. on July 3 and 12.

Stampede Park will be closed to the public for the event, as the entire Stampede grounds will be utilized for the massive fireworks display.

CTV Calgary will broadcast the Bell Fireworks Spectacular live on television and a livestream will be available on our website.

Those who want to watch the fireworks outdoors are asked to follow physical distancing protocols.

Once you’ve found a spot, tune in to FUNNY 1060AM for a musical soundtrack that will accompany the display.",[]
237,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/thermometers-in-hand-dubai-opens-for-tourists-amid-pandemic-1.5013565,"Thermometers in hand, Dubai opens for tourists amid pandemic",['Jon Gambrell'],2020-07-07 02:52:00-04:00,"DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES -- From French soccer jerseys to slick online campaigns, Dubai is trumpeting the fact that it reopened for tourism on Tuesday -- but what that means for this sheikhdom that relies on the dollars, pounds, rupees and yuan spent by travellers remains in question.

With travel uncertain and the coronavirus still striking nations Dubai relies on for tourists, this city-state wants to begin coaxing people back to its beaches and its cavernous shopping malls. By instilling the idea that Dubai is safe, authorities likely hope to fuel interest in the sheikhdom ahead of its crucial winter months for tourism.

But all that depends on controlling a virus that the United Arab Emirates as a whole continues to fight. Armed with thermometers, mandatory face masks and hand sanitizer, Dubai is wagering it is ready.

""I think that will give people confidence -- when they're ready to travel -- to come to Dubai,"" said Paul Bridger, the corporate director for operations at Dubai-based Rove Hotels. ""It will take time to come back. ... We are expecting to be one of the first markets to be back because of the confidence that we can give to people that are travelling.""

That Dubai is a tourist destination at all is largely thanks to its ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, who used the state-owned long-haul carrier Emirates to put this one-time pearling post on the map. Attractions like the Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building, and the sail-shaped Burj Al-Arab luxury hotel draw transit passengers out of Dubai International Airport, the world's busiest for international travel.

In 2019 alone, Dubai welcomed 16.7 million international guests, up from 15.9 million the year before, according to the Dubai Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing. The top seven tourist-sending nations were India, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, Oman, China, Russia and the U.S. The city's 741 hotels saw around 75% occupancy for the year, with visitors staying on average 3 1/2 days.

Those travellers also fuel Dubai's vast restaurant, bar and nightlife scene. Though drinking is illegal in the neighbouring emirate of Sharjah and the nations of Iran, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, alcohol sales remain a crucial part of Dubai's economy. Though bars only briefly reopened to quickly close again, alcohol-serving restaurants abound.

But even before the pandemic, lower global energy prices, a 30% drop in the city's real estate market value and trade war fears have led employers to shed staff. The virus outbreak accelerated those losses, especially as Dubai has postponed its Expo 2020, or world's fair, to next year over the pandemic.

That makes reopening for tourism that much more important, even though Dubai's top three tourist-feeding countries remain hard-hit by the virus, said Rabia Yasmeen, a consultant at the market-research firm Euromonitor International. Even retail sales are affected by tourism, with some 35% of all revenue coming from tourists, she said.

""It's good for them to go ahead and announce because there needs to be a call for the confidence to come back,"" Yasmeen said. ""Someone has to take that step first to show the world.""

And Dubai has, in typical headline-baiting fashion, taken those steps. French football club Olympique Lyonnais, under a sponsorship with Emirates, wore ""Dubai Is Open"" jerseys at a recent match. Dubai passport controllers have begun putting stickers on foreigners' passports reading in English and Arabic: ""A warm welcome to your second home.""

But there's a risk, particularly in allowing more travel as the virus stalks other countries. Emirates stopped flying to Pakistan over virus fears. Across the seven sheikhdoms that form the United Arab Emirates, there have been 52,600 confirmed cases of the virus among the 9 million people living here, and 326 deaths.

At Rove Hotels, a new budget chain run by state-linked firms Emaar and Meraas, thermometer-carrying staffers check the temperature of everyone coming inside. Cleaners fog disinfectants over rooms and wipe down tables and chairs. Even a camel statue and an oversized stuffed animal wore a mask. The chain, like others in Dubai, also has sought outside certification over its cleaning routines on top of fulfilling government regulations.

""It's kind of the icing on the cake to give people comfort that we're following those standards,"" Bridger said.

There are still risks. In order to travel, tourists must take a COVID-19 test within 96 hours of their flight and show the airline a negative result. Otherwise, they will be tested on arrival and required to isolate while awaiting the results, which travellers say typically takes a few hours.

Travellers must also have health insurance covering COVID-19 or sign a declaration agreeing to cover the costs of treatment and isolation.

""A key question comes in: Is the traveller ready to come to Dubai?"" Yasmeen asked. ""That's a big question mark.""

238,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/lifestyle/simple-design-steps-can-take-your-garden-to-the-next-level-1.5003509,Simple design steps can take your garden to the next level,['John Raby'],2020-06-28 15:43:00-04:00,"CHARLESTON, W.VA. -- The flower beds are finished, the vegetables are growing, and yet something could be missing from the backyard landscape: That “wow” factor.

Adding a personal touch to the lawn and garden doesn't have to be complicated or break the family budget. Homeowners can transform an ordinary looking landscape with some imagination, design, and perhaps the help of a local agriculture extension service, landscape professional or private nursery.

“A garden is really never finished,” said Jonathan M. Lehrer, chairman of the Department of Urban Horticulture and Design at Farmingdale State College on Long Island, New York. “Sometimes the most difficult thing is kind of taking that plunge and deciding you're going to develop an area or start a project.”

Some ideas that gardeners can use to start taking their yards to another level:

THE STARTING POINT

An arbour, pergola, lattice - even posts with netting wrapped around them - will grab attention, especially at a yard's entrance. It also adds height where homeowners normally think only about length and width, Lehrer said.

Adding clematis, climbing roses or honeysuckle along them will provide long periods of blooms.

Arbors decorated with lights can also define garden rooms and set up views to the space beyond, inviting exploration, said Katharine Pinney, a landscape contractor and designer in Los Angeles.

“Use them to lead your visitor through the garden,” Pinney said.

THE PATHWAY TO SUCCESS

A path with mulch, gravel, brick, pavers or flagstone with edging will encourage a stroll.

Pinney said the simpler the path's route, the better. But Lehrer suggests avoiding a straight, linear pathway.

“Trying to use more curves, twists and turns, that kind of adds the illusion of a longer length than it might be, that mystery of what might be around the next corner,” he said.

Pinney said the choice of pavers should reflect the architectural style of the house. But mixing materials, such as brick and flagstones, adds visual interest.

“In short, use your imagination!” Pinney said.

Placing decorative pots loaded with flowers along the way will create a focal point and add colour.

PLACES TO REST

Benches and tables are a must for homeowners wanting to make their yards a hangout. Having limited room shouldn't be a deterrent.

Pinney said she designs numerous small gardens because the old bungalow neighbourhoods in her area have narrow but deep lots.

“Dividing that narrow space into rooms makes the garden seem larger,” she said.

Pinney and Lehrer suggest building a fire pit, a cooking area, or a place for dining or simply to enjoy morning coffee.

GET PERSONAL

Pinney suggests incorporating items that reflect the homeowner's personality. One of her clients loved wine and held tastings with friends. Pinney said she planted wine grapes for the customer and used old wine bottles from restaurants to border a path.

Old brick from another customer's 1920s bungalow was incorporated into the border of an outdoor groundcover “rug.”

“A homeowner should think about what would make the garden a reflection of their personality and interests,” Pinney said.

Due to the coronavirus pandemic, Lehrer added, “I've seen people that are not going to be going to the beach. “So they're creating pool areas, adding inexpensive holiday lights and lanterns and bringing music outside.”

TIMBERRR!

Landscaping timbers can create tiered walls and stairs to bridge elevation levels in the backyard while creating more planting beds in between. They're also great for creating individual planters. Timbers are available in both natural and synthetic types.

Pinney said treated lumber secured with timber screws is best for terraces, but not for vegetable gardens.

AGREE TO TREE

Depending on the climate and sun requirements, consider planting small trees along the edges.

Japanese tree lilacs and crape myrtles provide vibrant summer colour. Trees with spring blooms include redbuds, white and pink dogwoods, flowering crabapples, ornamental pears and star magnolias. To get the earliest spring blooms, consider planting forsythias.

For northern climates, Lehrer strongly suggests the cornelian cherry dogwood. It has yellow flowers in the spring and red cherry-like fruit in late summer and early fall. The leaves turn red and orange in the fall, and as the tree ages, the outer bark peels, revealing a orange-brown colour.

“It's a four-season plant that is extremely tough,” he said.

WINGED FRIENDS

A big garden bonus is a visit from a butterfly or hummingbird. Plants that produce nectar and pollen can lure them in.

The 4-H Children's Garden at Michigan State University includes a butterfly house that is open in the spring. Education co-ordinator Jessica Wright said attracting butterflies means having compatible plants for the caterpillars they begin as. These can include fennel, dill and milkweed. Other flowering plants can act as butterfly magnets.

Among the plants that attract hummingbirds are bleeding hearts, cardinal flower, impatiens and petunias. Both butterflies and hummingbirds are drawn to bee balm, butterfly bushes and zinnia. Birds and butterflies do require water, so consider adding feeders or a bird bath.

“The interaction with nature is the next level,” Wright said. “It's great to see them enjoying your garden as well.”",[]

In past years, the Niagara Region grower had no trouble selling to wholesalers by the thousands.

""Now we're just composting,"" VanZanten said. ""Since my kids are home every afternoon, they have to spend two hours throwing out the flowers that have bloomed out.""

Sales are down 30 per cent for the year and Easter came and went at the height of physical distancing measures. The uncertainty facing the industry as Mother's Day approaches -- ""you could liken it to Christmas for every other retailer"" -- and the critical spring planting season dawns are even more worrisome.

""If this goes till June we will most likely be at 70 per cent,"" he said of year-over-year revenue loss. ""My overdraft is maxed out at the bank. Obviously they're wondering when I'm going to start drawing that back, and I can't since I haven't sold anything.""

VanZanten is one of thousands of flower farmers across the country concerned about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Demand for non-perishable items pushed decorative plants out of the supply chain in last month's stockpiling frenzy, while the ongoing shutdown of garden centres in jurisdictions including Ontario and New York has cut off critical points of sale, threatening to leave growers high and dry.

""This is when we sell. We're on the cusp of a critical period,"" said James Farrar, director of the Canadian Ornamental Horticulture Alliance.

Trees, bushes and bedding plants are usually planted between May 1 and June 15, he said, with customers ranging from backyard gardeners to municipalities.

In Ontario, flower producers discarded about 40 per cent of their Easter crop, according to Flowers Canada Growers.

The province has designated garden centres as a non-essential service -- a painful exclusion for the industry, since nearly two-thirds of Canadian production stems from Ontario. Neighbouring New York and Ohio have also forced garden centres to lock their doors, while Michigan and Vermont have banned retailers from selling non-essential products, including home gardening items.

""If they don't open, the damage is going to be astronomical,"" said trade group head Andi Kuyvenhoven, noting garden centres' crucial role for bedding plants in particular.

British Columbia -- the second-biggest flower and plant producer -- Alberta and Manitoba and have allowed garden centres to keep running, while Quebec deemed them essential along with nurseries as of April 15, though not in time for Easter.

Kuyvenhoven, who with his wife co-owns a $2.5-million business selling potted Chrysanthemums and indoor calla lilies -- largely to U.S. distributors -- on a pair of farms west of Toronto, says clogged supply chains south of the border remain a problem.

""U.S. customers for a time closed their distribution systems to floral and so the main grocery chains were not purchasing plants,"" he said, which was hard on growers of cut flowers such as roses and tulips.

""If a truck can take 24 skids and four skids were flowers, the flowers came off the trucks and they put more food on the truck -- which we completely understand. The only challenge is, when you're growing flowers as we do, they also have a shelf life,"" said Kuyvenhoven, who bought his business from his parents in 1990.

""Now we're now facing liquidity issues...I haven't slept in five weeks.""

Flowers Canada Growers says exports to the U.S. make up about one-third of greenhouse flower and plant sales, which hit $1.6 billion in 2018, according to Statistics Canada. Nursery sales topped $500 million.

While garden centres can continue to operate across much of the continent, growers wonder whether bouquets and flower pots will remain on the shopping list of consumers struggling to make rent amid soaring unemployment numbers and a looming recession.

Kuyvenhoven is hoping that families confined to their homes for most of the day will choose to spend what they've saved from unpurchased vacations and lattes on plants for their vases and flower beds.

""That's part of what's carried us through downturns in the past,"" he said.

Growers associations are in talks with federal and provincial governments over potential financial relief, with Flowers Canada Growers asking for a ""cash injection"" as well as extended debt repayment plans secured in part by Ottawa, Kuyvenhoven said.

So far, the federal government has extended a stay of default for eligible farmers until Oct. 31, giving flower and potted plant producers an extra six months to pay off federal loans that would have been due at the end of April.

Ottawa has also granted exemptions on air travel restrictions to temporary foreign works and invested $50 million to help farmers fly in labourers on charter trips. ""New flights are being booked ever day,"" the agriculture department said in an email.

Back at the greenhouse, VanZanten mulls the overripe lilies and orchids.

""Flowers do make you happier, they do actually lift your spirits...but there are farms that can't bounce back from this,""

he said.

""This all happened at the wrong time.""

The doors of Golden Acre Home and Garden in Calgary are allowed to be open as an essential service in Alberta, but there are ample warnings about social distancing.

A steady stream of customers, many of them wearing face masks, walk through the store even though spring bedding plants aren't ready and the selection of seeds and flowers is somewhat limited.

Zannis said having an online presence puts his greenhouse on less shaky ground than many others.

The business has sent products to as far away as Nunavut and Nova Scotia in recent years but will be focusing primarily on the Calgary market now.

Online orders are up by 2,000 per cent from a year ago, Zannis said. But it's not a gold mine.

""It's very expensive to operate. Now you have to pay somebody to go and do the shopping,"" he said.

""But the online store has kind of kept us afloat ... We're just trying to survive, honestly. I just want to survive this year.""

In addition to Alberta, Manitoba, British Columbia and Quebec have designated garden centres as an essential service. Other provinces, including Ontario, have forced them to keep their doors closed.

""We are allowed to offer pickup at the curb, so we are doing that,"" said Mary Reid, owner of Green Thumb Gardening Centre in Nepean, Ont.

""A customer would either phone or email us what their order is, then we'd get it ready and say you can come and get it.""

Reid said she has basically had to start online orders from scratch but isn't able to do e-commerce.

She hopes gardeners will still be keen to shop when restrictions are eased.

""It's not a pretty picture at all ... it depends on how far into lockdown we get.""

The executive director of the Canadian Garden Council, the national umbrella body for provincial and national garden organizations, said there's been a huge increase in the number of Canadians who want to start gardening.

Michel Gauthier said it's a struggle for centres that have to stay closed.

""A lot of growers and greenhouses are having issues. Right now, there's a big movement to say horticultural products are essential and should be essential for the well-being of people,"" he said.

""We're saying ... if we want people to have that gardening experience and spend some time in their garden, then they need to have access to the material and access the product.""

Don Vanderwerf said it's almost like business as usual at his Kel-Lake Greenhouses in Kelowna, B.C.

Demand for seeds, soil and vegetables has been strong, he said.

Peak gardening season begins in three weeks to a month. Vanderwerf said products will be spread out on benches and into the parking lot at his site.

Still, Vanderwerf is expecting a financial hit. He's already losing business in flower baskets for hotels and restaurants.

""We'll be down a bit. But I feel fortunate that I'm not owning a restaurant or a pub, because they're hurting.""

As spring's arrival in the Northern Hemisphere coincides with government stay-at-home orders, the itch to get outside has turned backyard gardens into a getaway for the mind in chaotic times.

Gardeners who already know that working with soil is a way to connect with nature say it helps take away their worries, at least temporarily.

""I love to see things grow,"" Lindsay Waldrop said. ""It's incredibly therapeutic.""

Now more than ever.

Waldrop, a resident of Anaheim, California, has an anxiety disorder. Exercise is supposed to help, but her new job as a college biology professor had prevented her from getting into a routine.

Her grandfather, who introduced her to gardening by showing her how to plant seeds, died about a year ago.

Add the global coronavirus pandemic to all that, and it's easy to see where her focus is these days.

""Sometimes I just like to sit and dig holes in the quiet with my own thoughts,"" she said. ""Outside, it takes my mind off. It gives something for my hands to do. It gives you a separate problem to think about than whatever else is going on. It gets you off of social media.""

Waldrop and her husband moved last summer from New Mexico, where she didn't have much luck gardening in a scorching climate. At her new home, she got rid of the lawn, installed an irrigation system, and recently planted dozens of tomatoes, eggplant, peppers and other vegetables.

Over the years, Waldrop converted her skeptical husband, who initially wondered why digging in the dirt and moving things around was considered fun.

After tasting his first home-grown tomatoes, he was converted.

Families, too, are discovering that gardening gives cooped-up kids something to do, builds their self-esteem and brings variety to what has suddenly become a lot of time spent together.

In Miami, Annika Bolanos isn't a fan of the south Florida heat and mosquitoes. But going outdoors lately has been a lifeline.

Bolanos works at home making cakes and doing bookkeeping with her husband's golf cart business. Her three young children add an extra layer of busy, and together they've seeded a variety of vegetables and herbs.

""We have always loved the idea of growing our own food,"" Bolanos said. ""It feels good to eat something that you grew yourself too. It also helps my kids eat more fruits and veggies since they find it cool to eat what they have grown.""

Her children water the plants daily and concentrate on what's growing.

""You're feeling the sun and the breeze and don't have to worry about anything in the moment,"" Bolanos said.

In Britain and Germany, there's a premium on allotments -- popular parcels of land rented for growing food crops.

""Those with a garden are the lucky ones,"" said Heidi Schaletzky, standing on the lawn beneath a cherry tree in the north of Berlin.

Schaletzky and her husband have been cultivating a plot in the ""Free Country"" community garden for the past eight years, growing strawberries, salad greens and kohlrabi. So far, access to garden plots remains exempt from restrictions intended to stop the spread of the virus in Germany.

""We'll be able to see other people, too,"" she said. ""As long as they stay on their side of the fence.""

As the weather warms, garden shops are bustling as other businesses shut during the outbreak.

At the Almaden Valley Nursery in San Jose, California, rose expert John Harp has seen a mix of new gardeners and regulars. Customers can't come into the shop, so their online orders are brought to their vehicles in the parking lot.

""Around town everyone is gardening right now,"" Harp said. ""They're looking to be a little bit more self-sufficient.""

This home-grown attitude goes back to World War II, when millions of people cultivated victory gardens to protect against potential food shortages while boosting patriotism and morale.

Hollie Niblett, who lives near Kansas City, Kansas, hopes the victory gardens come back. Niblett, who has a degree in horticultural therapy, tends to a kitchen garden near her backdoor, perennial flowers, flowering trees and shrubs, and upper and lower grassy yards connected by a path through an area left in its natural condition.

""There are so many things about it that feed my soul,"" she said. ""Right now, more than anything, my garden gives me hope, gives me purpose and provides a sense of connection to something bigger than myself.""

For beginners, wonderment awaits. Just south of Atlanta, 10-year-old Ezra Gandy's love for playing baseball has been paused. He and his grandmother, Melanie Nunnally, recently started an outdoor garden, planting strawberries, cabbage, broccoli, kale and asparagus.

""I like digging in the dirt because I like to see all the bugs and stuff that's in the ground,"" he said.

The non-profit group KidsGardening.org suggests that children grow their own salads or do other activities.

The virus scare could even usher in a new crop of gardeners who start from seed rather than risk the crowds buying starter plants.

Kendra Schilling of Scott Depot, West Virginia, doesn't have space for a sprawling garden, so she's planting potatoes in a bucket and trying to figure out with her teenage daughter what to do with other vegetable seeds.

""I usually go buy the plants and stick them in the dirt. But this year we're going to try to do the seeds,"" she says. ""Thank God for YouTube.""

Allan']",2020-01-28 11:14:00-05:00,"Researchers have figured out which plant species bumblebees prefer to include in their diets, providing advice to those wishing to help with bee conservation efforts.

During the summer months of 2015 to 2016, authors captured bumblebees on more than 100 plant species across more than 400 plots in the Plumas National Forest in California -- a mountainous, meadowy area with wildlife habitats near running water, where bumblebees are abundant.

The findings, published Tuesday in the journal Environmental Entomology, revealed that the most popular plant species among the bees were Oregon checker-mallow and mountain pennyroyal flowers.

Many plants rely on bees as natural pollinators to produce some of nature's most nutritious foods. However, species of North American bumblebees have significantly declined in population in recent decades. Between April 2015 and April 2016, beekeepers in the US lost 44 per cent of their colonies.

Jerry Cole, lead author of the research and biologist at the Institute for Bird Populations in California, said there are a few potential reasons behind the declines: competition with other insect species, transfer of parasites from honey bees to bumble bees, loss of floral resources, or a mismatch between the phenology of plant species and the phenology of bumblebee species.

Phenology is defined by how plants and animals function in their environments in different seasons. Making sure the two are in sync is important, as our food supply depends on the timing of phenological events.

""Determining bumblebee species' plant selection is important for retaining and promoting high quality plant resources that will help populations persist,"" the authors said.

The plants bumblebees prefer

The authors assessed the five most abundant bumblebee species' plant selection by comparing the plants they used to what was available. Although they captured bees on more than 100 plant species, just 14 of them were chosen the most.

Each bumblebee species selected a different group of flowers, even though the bees were foraging across the same plots.

""It's important to consider the availability of plants when determining what's selected for by bees,"" Cole said. ""Often studies will use the proportion of captures on a plant species alone to determine which plants are most important to bees.""

""Without comparison to how available those plants are, you might think a plant is preferentially selected by bees, when it is simply very abundant.""

The selections by the five species remained constant over the study period, suggesting that maintaining, seeding or planting with those plant species could benefit the health of the bees, the authors said.

The most abundant species of bumblebees found was Bombus vosnesenskii, or, the yellow-faced bumblebee. And the plant species used most by that species was large-leaved lupine.

A. urticifolia, a flowering plant in the mint family, was the plant most strongly selected by three of five bumblebee species surveyed. Other commonly selected flowers included thickstem asters and Ryderberg's penstemon, a flower in the snapdragon family.

Yellow-faced bumblebees tend to stay consistent with their preference even when other plants become more available in different seasons.

Bumblebees don't necessarily have natural preferences, but will decide based on the quantity or quality of the nectar or pollen available, and how easily they can be accessed. Other factors driving bumblebee flower use include the length of their tongue, flower symmetry and color preference.

Though the researchers found certain plant species were more popular among bumblebees than others, they say their results ""should be interpreted with caution because they didn't record whether plants were being used as pollen sources versus nectar sources.""

There are other factors important to maintaining the health of bees, including the presence of other pollen sources and weather variations.

Bees and marijuana

A different group of researchers from New York recently found that cannabis crops are also proving beneficial to declining bee populations -- specifically, large numbers of 16 different species of bees thriving among recently-planted cannabis plants.

Marijuana crops are helpful to bee populations in that they don't require one of the main farming practices that is a threat to bees today: insecticides.

""As an exclusively wind-pollinated crop, hemp lacks nectar but produces an abundance of pollen during a period of floral dearth in agricultural landscapes,"" said the report published in the Oxford University Press.

Because of its unique flowering phenology, hemp can potentially provide nutrition to bees during a period of floral scarcity. In a time when cannabis is a rapidly expanding crop in the U.S. agricultural landscape, ""growers, land managers and policy makers should consider its value in supporting bee communities and take its attractiveness to bees into account"" when developing pest management strategies with the health of bees in mind, the report said.

Your backyard

The small group of preferred plant species the authors identified in the new study provide a helpful start for conservationists wanting to seed and restore habitats for bees in regions similar to the study's.

In that California region, plant blooming peaked during the summer each year, but Cole said that when planting, it's important to stagger the species you grow and plant a variety so that bees can have well-rounded food resources throughout the year.

""It wouldn't hurt to plant some of the species we identify here in your home garden,"" Cole said. ""But the way that these plants are beneficial are not just on their own. You have to have a nice complement of plants that provide food resources throughout the season and not just at one point in the season.""

Use of different plants by bees can also change between years if there are changes in what's available and when the plants are blooming.

""Maintaining, seeding or planting these 'bumblebee plants' while managing the surrounding landscape"" to support a ""diverse floral community is likely to benefit bumble bees, especially if some combination of favored plant species are blooming across the duration of bumble bee activity at a given location,"" the authors said.",[]

Any plant with fleshy stems or leaves is called a succulent. Aside from cacti, only a few other plant families have succulent members. All these succulents, cactus or not, are low-maintenance.

SOME NON-CACTUS SUCCULENTS

One family of non-cactus succulents is Crassulaceae, which counts among its members the familiar jade plant, which has thick stems and shiny green, fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves. After years of selective stem cutting, my jade plant has developed two thick trunks that give it the appearance of a venerable tree in miniature.

Kalanchoe is another family member, notable for the small plantlets that grow along the edges of its leaves and periodically drop off to give rise to new plants. Hence its other name: mother-of-thousands. Shortening daylight hours in fall coax out this plant's salmon-red or apricot-orange flowers, which contrast nicely with the bluish cast of the green leaves.

Sedums are yet another Crassulaceae. My burro's tail (Sedum morganianum) has braids of thick, fleshy leaves that hide its stems as they cascade over the edges of its hanging, coconut planter.

Moving on to another family of succulents brings us to the Euphorbiaceae. Milk-striped euphorbia is named for the milky line down its stem, but I think the Latin name, Euphorbia pseudocactus, is more descriptive. With thorns and upright stems off which branch ""arms,"" the plant could easily be mistaken for a cactus.

Crown-of-thorns, aside from its beautiful pink flowers, is another Euphorbia species, this one armed with spines as fierce as those of any cactus.

Not all Euphorbiaceae are succulent; poinsettia is one that's not.

The lily family, Liliaceae, is a third plant family with many succulent members. Aloe is most famous as an ingredient of hand lotions and shampoos, but the plant itself is attractive and care-free -- mine has gone whole winters without watering! Over time, it has filled its pot with whorls of thick, fleshy, lance-shaped leaves.

Sansevieria is a succulent lily with an unflattering common name: mother-in-law's tongue. Unflattering to mothers-in-law, that is, because the plant is a cluster of long, sharp leaves speckled like snakeskin.

WATERING: LESS IS MORE

An advantage and a disadvantage of succulents as houseplants is their adaptation to survive without water. If you remember to water your plants only when you're driving in your car, or if you want a living plant that needs water only slightly more often than a plastic plant, then grow succulents.

On the other hand, if you tip a glass of water on your plants every time you walk past them, you'll soon transform any succulent houseplant into a mass of brown rot. The key to caring for succulents is to hardly ever water them. Once every couple of months in winter, and a couple of times a month in summer, is sufficient. More generally, let the soil dry out between waterings.

When repotting is needed for any succulent plant, use a potting soil that drains water quickly, made so by adding equal volumes of sand or perlite to any mix used for other types of plants.

Besides their ease of care, succulents are easy to propagate. Use the leaves, stems or offshoots, letting any of these plant parts dry and heal for a few day before potting them up. Leaves that occasionally drop off my jade plant often take root just sitting on the soil.",[]

Toronto and Edmonton will be the host cities for all playoff games.

The NHL, Edmonton Oilers, Alberta's Premier and Edmonton’s mayor were supposed to provide details about what being a hub city means on Saturday, but less than an hour before it was scheduled, the NHL cancelled it.

“While we believe we’re buttoned down at the provincial level in Ontario and Alberta there’s still a couple of details that we’re just finalizing with the federal government,” said NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman during a conference call Saturday morning.

The NHL would not tell CTV News Edmonton what those details are.

Despite the day's news, Alberta politicians were in a celebratory mood heading into the weekend.

“A score for Edmonton!,” said the city’s mayor Don Iveson in a statement Friday.

“We can’t wait to delight hockey fans and show off everything our beautiful city has to offer,” he said.

While Premier Jason Kenney posted a video, shot outside Rogers Place shortly after the announcement.

“One of the core reasons the NHL is coming here as opposed to some of the big American cities that were offering subsidies and all kinds of hand outs is because we have the lowest level of infections and hospitalizations of any NHL city,” he said.

The Premier expects it will bring about 2,000 jobs to Edmonton while pumping $60 million into the economy at a time when Alberta needs it most.

“That alone is not going to turn around our economy but it’s a great shot in the arm. It’s a great morale boost. It’s a great job creator,” said Kenney.",[]

An Amber Alert had been issued for Romy, six, and Norah, 11, in Levis, south of Quebec City on Thursday. It was lifted earlier Saturday when the bodies were found. The girls had gone missing along with their father Martin Carpentier, 44, after a crash on Highway 20.

The search continues for the father. In a tweet Saturday night, the SQ wrote that all necessary resources had been deployed for the manhunt, including helicopters, ATV patrollers and dog handlers.

Nous confirmons, malheureusement, que les deux personnes #retrouvées plus tôt dans le secteur de Saint-Apollinaire sont #décédées et qu’il s’agit des deux jeunes filles manquant à l’appel, soit Norah et Romy Carpentier. — Sûreté du Québec (@sureteduquebec) July 11, 2020

""The important thing currently, in mobilizing the population, is to be vigilant because we are actively looking for Martin Carpentier who could be in the Saint-Agapit, Saint-Apollinaire sector. Anyone who sees this individual is asked to contact 911 immediately,"" said SQ Srgt. Ann Mathieu.

Premier Francois Legault joined many in the province in lamenting the news.

2/4 J’ai une pensée particulière pour la mère de Norah et Romy. Pour tous leurs proches aussi. C’est le Québec entier qui pleure avec vous aujourd’hui. — François Legault (@francoislegault) July 11, 2020

This is a developing story and will be updated as more details emerge.

ITEMS FOUND THAT MAY BE RELATED

SQ officers searching the Saint-Appollinaire area for the two girls and their father found some objects that may be connected to them on Friday.

Mathieu said the objects may suggest that the missing family is in the area teams are searching.

“We found some objects yesterday, but we can find a lot of different objects in the woods, so what we have to do right now is to be sure that those objects could be related to Martin Carpentier and his two daughters,” said Mathieu.

A command post was established on Friday on Veilleux Street, south of Rang Bois Joly.

Quebec provincial police ATV, horse, K-9 and foot patrols are still searching the heavily wooded area along with search and rescue volunteers.

GIRLFRIEND MAKES DESPERATE PLEA

Martin Carpentier's girlfriend, Cathy Gingras, recorded a desperate plea to him on Friday morning, shared by the SQ on Twitter.

""Martin, we're worried. We haven't heard anything from you since the accident. We want to know if you're okay, and the girls, Romy, Norah. We want to know if they're okay... if you're okay. Give us some news, let us know, call your parents, whatever it is. The important thing is that you're all alright,"" she said. ""We just want to know you're alright.""

Officers and volunteers have scoured the area near the site of the crash since Wednesday night. They are asking anyone who lives in the area to check any building, shed or trailer they might have on or near their property. An SQ helicopter was deployed to search the wooded area.

""We have some information that they may still be in the area,"" said SQ spokesperson Louis-Philippe Bibeau.

The Sûreté also told CTV that it had received word that a neighbour heard screams in the middle of the night. But police wouldn't confirm if it appears to be related to this case.

Premier Legault said Friday afternoon that about 80 people were involved in the search, both on the ground and in the air, and that the province had put all of its resources into finding the girls.

""All my thoughts are with the family, and we really hope that this ends well, that we find the two young girls safe and sound,"" Legault said.

The three were last seen Wednesday at 8:30 p.m. in the Saint-Nicholas neighbourhood of Levis, near a convenience store, police said.

At 9:30 p.m. a 2008 Volkswagen Passat with the licence plate P75 PXV was involved in a crash on Highway 20 east in nearby Saint-Apollinaire. When emergency services arrived, the vehicle was unoccupied and the three have been missing since.



Saint-Apollinaire Mayor Bernard Ouellet said the crash took place in a rural area about four kilometres from the main exit off the highway into town.

""There are many wooded areas -- many, many wooden areas -- but there are many rural roads, too. It's not completely isolated,"" said Ouellet about the territory around the crash site, which he added also contains several small cottages and shacks.

He said residents have been searching their properties for any sign of the three.



""It's worrying everyone a little bit,"" he said.



DESPERATE PLEA FROM MOTHER

Their loved ones have reason to be concerned for their health and safety. Authorities say they don't know the reason for the disappearance and have spoken to witnesses and family members.



""All the hypotheses are on the table, and kidnapping is among them,"" SQ spokesperson Audrey-Anne Bilodeau said, ""but the priority for us is that we have missing people that could be injured.""

The girls' mother posted photos of them on Facebook on Thursday with a plea for help: ""We need to find my daughters and their dad.""



WITNESS SAW CRASH, SEARCHED FOR MISSING FAMILY



A woman driving in the area, Lyne Provencher, said she witnessed the crash.



She said she saw a car headed toward Quebec City fly off the road, hit a sign and some trees, and then flip over.

""I was driving towards Montreal when I saw a cloud of dust and, boom, the car ended up in front of me suddenly,"" Provencher said, adding that she had to think fast to avoid a collision.

""I stopped on the side of the road and I ran to see if there were people inside – nobody,"" she said, adding that three people called authorities at the same time.

""We were screaming and panicking,"" she said.

When firefighters arrived, they used spotlights to search the area.

""Only Martin's cell phone was in the car,"" she said. ""His stepfather called saying he was waiting for Martin to arrive, and that he's told him he was going for ice cream with his daughters,"" adding that he thought it had been a long time.

Provencher said authorities then contacted the girls' mother to inform her and ask if she had her daughters with her, since the children didn't appear to have been in the car.

Provencher shot video from the scene and posted it to Facebook. The post has since been removed.

""There's nobody. The tires are blown out, the windows are blown out. There's no one in the car or in the field,"" she is heard saying in the video. ""It's crazy. I don't understand.""



Provencher said she hoped the person was safe, noting there were child seats in the car.

""I really hope there wasn't a child in the car, because it's really serious. The car is finished,"" she said.

It is possible that one or all of the three missing people are injured, said Surete du Quebec spokesperson Stephane Tremblay.



The subsequent police investigation led officers to launch the Amber Alert Thursday afternoon.



""The car is very damaged and that's why we are looking for them, to see what condition they are in,"" said police spokesperson Anik Lamirande, adding that signs point to the three leaving the scene of the crash on foot.

In an open letter addressed to Public Safety Minister Bill Blair, 29 bipartisan members of Congress called on the Canadian government to plan a phased reopening of the Canada-U.S. border and to consider easing existing measures.

""We are asking that the United States and Canada immediately craft a comprehensive framework for phased reopening of the border based on objective metrics and accounting for the varied circumstances across border regions,"" read the letter, which was published on Western New York Congressman Brian Higgins' website on July 3.

The members of Congress, who represent the northern states along the border, also implored the Canadian government to consider easing restrictions on family members and property owners impeded by the border closure.

""We understand the importance of prioritizing the safety of our communities as we all navigate the complex calculation of minimizing public health risks and resuming economic activity. However, the social and economic partnership between our two nations necessitates a clear pathway forward,"" the letter read.

They crafted the letter following the latest joint Canada-U.S. agreement to extend the current border closure until July 21. This is the third time the agreement to maintain the border closure has been extended.

Despite the United States' plea, a spokesperson for Canada’s Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland told CTVNews.ca in a Friday statement that the health and safety of Canadians is ""absolutely priority.""

""Decisions about Canada's border are made by Canadians, for Canadians,"" said Freeland's spokesperson, Katherine Cuplinskas, in the statement.

""Since the beginning of this global pandemic, we have been having friendly ongoing conversations with our American partners about our shared border. Both sides agree that the current measures in place, which are set to expire on July 21st, have worked well in restricting non-essential travel while allowing essential crossings to continue unimpeded.""

Freeland's office wasn’t alone in pushing back against the call. Higgins posted the open letter in full on his Twitter page and he was swiftly met with backlash on the social media platform.

One comment, which had three times as many likes as Higgins' original post, slammed the call.

""No thank you...clean up your backyard before you attempt to enter ours..sincerely Canada,"" wrote a user who goes by the name @MichelletypoQ.

Another user, @rachelinTO, wrote that ""most of our earliest cases came from the U.S. So...... that's a firm 'no'. Sorry, eh.""

Other users called the request ""disastrous"" and multiple accounts said they’d only be comfortable easing restrictions after seeing improvement in the number of COVID-19 cases in the U.S.

The United States reached a macabre milestone at the end of June when it became home to the world’s highest number of reported infections: more than 2.2 million. It also has the highest death toll in the world, with 120,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.

Shortly after the news broke about the soaring cases in the United States, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the government was considering next steps for the looming deadline of the current border closure.

Speaking in a press conference on June 29, with just over three weeks until the agreement expires, he said the government will continue to assess the situation at our shared border.

""We have extended the border measures with the United States until July 21. We will continue to assess the situation and work with the Americans on what steps need to be taken into the month of August,"" Trudeau said.

And as COVID-19 continues to affect countries around the world, Trudeau said the health of Canadians remains the top priority when considering the loosening of any border restrictions.

""We are going to be very, very careful about when and how we start reopening international borders,"" Trudeau said.",[]

Both said they had chosen to publicize the infections on their own, with one deciding to close for cleaning too, without being asked by authorities to do either thing.

“Although we have not been contacted by Quebec Public Health,” wrote management of La Voûte bar in Old Montreal on Friday, “it is our civic responsibility to inform you.”

They’re right, say public health authorities: bars are not required to warn clients in these cases, or to close.

“A bar does not have to close if there has been a [person who tested positive] that frequented it during his or her infectious period,” said Marie-Claude Lacasse, a spokeswoman for Quebec’s health department.

This, however, is because health authorities are supposed to already be on top of the situation through contact tracing, and their system doesn’t rely on establishments reporting this kind of concern.

Instead, it starts with individual people’s positive test results and works backwards, including checking if they’ve been at a bar or restaurant.

“These are assessments that are made by the public health [regional authorities], depending on the situation,” wrote Lacasse.

For example, in the case of a bar, was the infected person an employee or a client? How long did they spend in the bar, and were people complying at the time with other health measures?

“In the same vein, a public place or a workplace is not necessarily closed if a positive case has been present,” she said. It depends on a variety of factors.

It’s not that being forthcoming is to be discouraged, others said.

“It would be weird for us to say no, right,” if a bar owner wanted to take that initiative, said Jean Nicolas Aubé, a spokesperson for Montreal’s public health department.

However, he thinks people should know that contact tracers get to work quickly on every single positive test result, contacting the person involved.

“It generally is within the day. It’s very fast,” said Aubé.

Montreal’s public health department doesn’t comment on specific contact tracing cases, including the two bar-associated ones this week, he said.

An infectious diseases specialist agreed that it can’t hurt to give people more warning,

“As a physician I would say that is an admirable effort,” said Dr. Matthew Oughton of McGill, speaking of bar owners’ COVID-19 transparency.

However, he’d want to make sure they “can do it in a way that, as much as possible, protects the right to privacy of people's medical information,” he said.

Oughton also said people shouldn’t panic at the idea that they won’t always hear about cases they crossed paths with. The risk should still be fairly low, and it’s important to remember that prior to this kind of announcement, “what [public health] did behind the scenes is invisible.”

Closing and doing a deep clean makes a lot of sense for a business owner for other reasons, however, said Oughton.

“From a practical perspective, if I were a customer and I found out there were cases at a bar and the bar knew and didn't say anything… I don't think that would be a very smart public relations route,” he said.

There’s one last thing to keep in mind about human nature—a reason not to announce every single positive case, he said.

“Would I recommend that every single business declare every time they have an employee or customer who's positive?” he asked.

“My concerns there are... you hear an alert the first time, it catches your attention. You hear an alert the hundredth time, it loses its impact.”",[]

The state health department reported 96 new deaths, bringing the total for the week to 496 or an average of nearly 71 per day. Three weeks ago, Florida's seven-day average for deaths stood at 30 before it began creeping up and then exploded in recent days, as a record 120 deaths were reported Thursday and another 92 on Friday.

The state on Saturday reported 9,960 new confirmed cases and 421 addition hospitalizations. Since March 1, when the first Florida infections were recorded, the state has reported 254,511 confirmed cases and 4,301 deaths.

The previous weekly record average of 60 deaths per day had been set May 8. That was followed by a steep drop in fatalities caused by the economic shutdown that had begun about a month earlier.

Throughout May and into June, the state reopened much of its economy with some restrictions.

Testing has increased, but the percentage of people testing positive has risen even more dramatically. A month ago, fewer than 5% of tests came up positive on a daily average. Over the past week, the daily average exceeded 19%.

Because of the increase in cases and the positivity rate, doctors had been predicting a rise in deaths, saying the mortality rate usually increases two to four weeks later as some of those infected get sicker and eventually die.

On Saturday, the Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom reopened at Walt Disney World in Orlando, concerning health experts who urge people not to gather in groups. Guests at the park said that people were wearing masks and social distancing, and that Disney is doing a good job at keeping people apart.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said that even with the rising rates, he still wants the schools to reopen as scheduled next month, saying children have not proven to be vectors for the disease in states and countries where campuses are open. He said while each county will have to come up with procedures, depending on their local infection rate, not opening the schools would exacerbate the achievement gap between high- and low-performing students.

“We know there are huge, huge costs for not providing the availability of in-person schooling,” he said. “The risk of corona, fortunately, for students is incredibly low.”

He added that if his three children, who are all under 5, were old enough for school, he would send them.

Rocky View Schools (RVS), Alberta's fifth largest school board, announced its strategy for each of the scenarios set out by Alberta Education in May.

While the Kenney government implied Scenario 1 would see school open and operating as close to normal operations as possible, RVS has highlighted a number of areas that would be different in its schools.

In Scenario 1, RVS says all parents will need to ensure their children are well and not exhibiting symptoms of any illness, including COVID-19. If a student does become ill while at school, they will be moved to the school's infirmary and parents/guardians will be notified to pick them up within an hour of being notified.

The board has admitted in both scenarios, due to the number of students in the building, it would be impossible to maintain the two-metre physical distancing rule at all times.

""This is why it is so important that anyone showing symptoms needs to stay home, get tested and cleared before returning to school,"" the document reads.

Some of the other changes in Scenario 1 include:

Parents not allowed to enter school property without the principal's permission

Students and staff will be divided into cohorts that will remain together during the day – contact between different cohorts will be limited

Water fountains remain off-limits – students are encouraged to bring full water bottles from home and refill stations will be monitored by staff

Visitors, volunteers and guest presenters are prohibited until further notice

Extra-curricular activities, including sports and fine arts, are cancelled until further notice

Clubs will be allowed, but only in situations where physical distancing can be maintained and all surfaces are wiped down after the meeting is over

Field trips and other outings requiring group transportation will not be scheduled – excursions will be limited to those within walking distance of schools

No hot lunch or fundraising food programs are allowed

In order to reduce congestion in hallways, lockers will not be used

Capacities of washrooms will be posted and must be adhered to – students will be required to wait if the capacity has been reached

RVS says some optional courses will also change under the guidelines of Scenario 1. For example, music classes will not have in-person singing, cheering or shouting. Students enrolled in band will not be able to play wind instruments.

""Music/Band programs will need to consider alternative ways to achieve the learning outcomes while reducing risks.""

Food and cooking courses will be allowed, but must follow the rules set out by Alberta Health Services. Any food created as a result of the courses must not be consumed.

When it comes to transportation, RVS says school buses will continue to operate and regular fees will apply, but drivers will be asked to come up with a seating plan for students. Children from the same household will be expected to sit together.

Families will also need to decide if they want to provide their children with masks to wear, considering that the buses will remain quite full under Scenario 1.

Special measures will be taken if a child happens to appear ill or brings any concerns to the attention of the bus driver, RVS says.

""Should a child display or bring to the driver’s attention concerning symptoms when getting on the bus or while riding (atypical coughs, runny nose, fever, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, headache, sore throat, chills, painful swallowing, feeling unwell, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, unexplained loss of appetite, loss of sense of taste or smell, muscle or joint pain, pink eye) then the driver must stop, put a mask on the impacted student, move the student to the reserved row at the front, wipe down the immediate area that the student was in and report the student’s name and school to RVS' Transportation Department.""

The school board's guidelines for Scenario 2 include all the conditions set out in Scenario 1, as well as the following modifications:

Students will be broken into two cohorts, with one attending Monday, Wednesday and alternating Fridays and the other attending Tuesday, Thursday and alternating Fridays – when students are not at school, they will be expected to work from home

Class sizes limited to no more than 20 students

All extra-curricular activities are cancelled until further notice, as are all field trips no matter the distance from the school

Half of the stalls in washrooms will be blocked off and only one student from a classroom will be allowed to leave at a time

Transportation fees may be modified if Scenario 2 remains in place for more than four weeks out of the school year and bus capacities will be reduced to 50 per cent of their total

In both of the above scenarios, RVS says if any cases of COVID-19 are confirmed in school settings, health authorities will work directly with the school to provide recommendations and messaging for staff, parents and students.

No matter what scenario is chosen by provincial authorities, RVS says the board may be required to change their strategy at a moment's notice if the COVID-19 situation changes.

The board says its decisions on each of the scenarios was based on surveys sent out to parents earlier this year.

""Much of the information outlined in each scenario was guided by provincial direction and more than 17,000 responses we received from parents, student and staff. Through RVS’ School Re-Entry Survey Results, we learned that the majority of stakeholders prefer to resume classes with health measure under near-normal operations,"" it said in release.

Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom are reopening Saturday, while Epcot and Disney's Hollywood Studios will follow four days later.

“It's the chance to come back and be in the magic,” said Diane Watkins, a preschool teacher from Helena, Alabama, who visits the park about eight times a year. “Hot or not, mask or not, we're just happy to be here. I feel like everybody here is in the same frame of mind. Everybody is just so excited to be here.”

Watkins said that when she and her 16-year-old daughter walked into the Magic Kingdom on Saturday morning, then saw all the cast members lined up and clapping on Main Street, she cried.

“It was very emotional,” she said.

The reopening comes as a huge surge of Floridians have tested positive for the new coronavirus in recent weeks. On Saturday, there were about 10,000 new cases reported, according to state statistics. Many cities and counties around the state have recently reinstated restrictions that had been lifted in May, when cases seemed to drop.

All of Disney's Orlando parks closed in mid-March in an effort to stop the virus's spread. Universal Orlando and SeaWorld Orlando closed around the same time but reopened several weeks ago after instituting similar rules to protect employees and customers from the virus.

Lori Lovell of Evansville, Indiana, strolled around Frontierland on Saturday morning with friends.

“I have missed coming here. It just feels really good to be back. This is where I've made so many memories. It's kind of our second home. Not being able to come here was hard.”

Disney's new rules include mandatory masks and social distancing. Visitors will need reservations to enter a park, and they won't be allowed to hop between parks. Both visitors and employees will receive temperature checks when they enter. Fireworks shows and parades have been suspended to prevent drawing too many people together.

Park-goers say that nearly everyone in sight wore masks on Saturday morning. Capacity is nowhere near where it is under normal circumstances, they said.

“I've been here on spring breaks where you can barely walk around. The walkways are very wide open,” said Lovell.

There were lots of hand sanitizer stations around, and people were respecting the physical distancing cues and guidelines. Since the park is at lower capacity, there was only a five-minute wait for the popular Buzz Lightyear ride - normally it's about 90 minutes, Watkins said.

Some attractions and dining areas aren't yet open. Another change: visitors can't hug and greet the costumed Disney characters. Instead, the characters are in “cavalcades,” or motorcades, as they make their way through the park.

Disney has been opening its parks back up around the globe for the past two months. In May, the company opened Disney Springs, a complex of shops, restaurants and entertainment venues in Lake Buena Vista.

267,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/trump-commutes-longtime-friend-roger-stone-s-prison-sentence-1.5019953,Trump commutes longtime friend Roger Stone's prison sentence,"['Jill Colvin', 'Eric Tucker']",2020-07-10 20:29:00-04:00,"WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump has commuted the sentence of his longtime political confidant Roger Stone, intervening in extraordinary fashion in a criminal case that was central to the Russia investigation and that concerned the president's own conduct.

The move came Friday, just days before Stone was to begin serving a 40-month prison sentence for lying to Congress, witness tampering and obstructing the House investigation into whether Trump's campaign colluded with Russia to win the 2016 election.

The action, which Trump had foreshadowed in recent days, underscores the president's lingering rage over special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation and is part of a continuing effort by the president and his administration to rewrite the narrative of a probe that has shadowed the White House from the outset. Democrats, already alarmed by the Justice Department's earlier dismissal of the case against Trump's first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, denounced the president as further undermining the rule of law.

Stone, 67, had been set to report to prison on Tuesday after a federal appeals court rejected his bid to postpone his surrender date. But he told The Associated Press that Trump called him Friday evening to tell him he was off the hook.

""The president told me that he had decided, in an act of clemency, to issue a full commutation of my sentence, and he urged me to vigorously pursue my appeal and my vindication,"" Stone said by phone from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where he was celebrating with friends. He said he had to change rooms because there were ""too many people opening bottles of Champagne here.""

Although a commutation does not nullify Stone's felony convictions, it protects him from serving prison time as a result.

The move is another extraordinary intervention by Trump in the nation's justice system and underscores anew his willingness to flout the norms and standards that have governed presidential conduct for decades. As Trump stares down a coronavirus pandemic that has worsened his chances for reelection, he has been more willing than ever to test the limits of his power.

Democrats denounced Trump's action. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Saturday called it ""an act of staggering corruption,"" saying legislation is needed to prevent a president from pardoning or commuting the sentence of someone who acted to shield that president from prosecution.

House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff called it ""offensive to the rule of law and principles of justice. Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez asked, ""Is there any power Trump won't abuse?""

Sen. Mitt Romney, a Utah Republican, also condemned the move. ""Unprecedented, historic corruption: an American president commutes the sentence of a person convicted by a jury of lying to shield that very president,"" he tweeted Saturday.

White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said in a statement that Stone was a ""victim of the Russia Hoax that the Left and its allies in the media perpetuated for years in an attempt to undermine the Trump presidency.""

Stone had been open about his desire for a pardon or commutation, appealing for the president's help in a monthslong television and social media campaign and seeking to postpone his surrender date by months after getting a brief extension from the judge, in part by citing the coronavirus.

Trump, who had made clear in recent days that he was inching closer to acting, had repeatedly publicly inserted himself into Stone's case, including just before Stone's sentencing.

That earned a public rebuke from his own attorney general, William Barr, who said the president's comments were ""making it impossible"" for him to do his job. Barr was so incensed that he told people he was considering resigning over the matter.

""With this commutation, Trump makes clear that there are two systems of justice in America: one for his criminal friends, and one for everyone else,"" Schiff said. ""Donald Trump, Bill Barr, and all those who enable them pose the gravest of threats to the rule of law.""

Stone, a larger-than-life political character who embraced his reputation as a dirty trickster, was the sixth Trump aide or adviser to have been convicted of charges brought during Mueller's investigation.

A longtime Trump friend and informal adviser, Stone boasted during the campaign that he was in contact with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange through a trusted intermediary and hinted at inside knowledge of WikiLeaks' plans to release more than 19,000 emails hacked from the servers of the Democratic National Committee.

But Stone denied any wrongdoing and consistently criticized the case against him as politically motivated. He did not take the stand during his trial, did not speak at his sentencing. His lawyers did not call any witnesses in his defence.

Prosecutors had originally recommended Stone serve seven to nine years in prison. But in a highly unusual move, Barr reversed that decision after a Trump tweet and recommended a more lenient punishment, prompting a mini-revolt inside the Justice Department, with the entire prosecution team resigning from the case.

Department officials have vehemently denied Barr was responding to Trump's criticism and have insisted there was no contact with the White House over the decision. Barr has also pointed out that the judge, in imposing a 40-month sentence, had agreed with him that the original sentencing recommendation was excessive.

Barr has said the prosecution was justified, and the Justice Department did not support Stone's more recent effort to put off his surrender date. Though the Justice Department raised concerns about the handling of Flynn's case, including what it said were irregularities about his FBI interview, prosecutors did not point to any similar issues or problems with the Stone prosecution.

Even so, the commutation will almost certainly contribute to a portrait of a president determined to erase the impact of the Russia investigation and to intervene on behalf of allies.

The commutation was the latest example of Trump using his unlimited clemency power to pardon powerful men he believes have been mistreated by the justice system.

Trump went on a clemency spree in February, commuting the 14-year prison sentence of former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, a Democrat, and pardoning former New York City police commissioner Bernie Kerik, financier Michael Milken and several others.

Trump has also offered clemency to other political allies, including Joe Arpaio, an Arizona sheriff who was awaiting sentencing at the time, conservative commentator Dinesh D'Souza, who had been convicted on campaign finance violations, and Conrad Black, a newspaper publisher convicted of fraud who had written a flattering book about the president.

Trump, however, has spent much more time trumpeting his decision to commute the sentence of Alice Marie Johnson, who was serving life in prison for nonviolent drug offences and who came to Trump's attention after reality star Kim Kardashian West took up her cause. Her story was featured in a Trump campaign Super Bowl ad.

Stone told the AP he expressed his gratitude to Trump in the phone call.

""You know, he has a great sense of fairness,"" Stone said. ""We've been friends for many, many years, and he understands that I was targeted strictly for political reasons.""",[]
268,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/trump-commutes-longtime-friend-roger-stone-s-prison-sentence-1.5019953?autoPlay=true,Trump commutes longtime friend Roger Stone's prison sentence,"['Jill Colvin', 'Eric Tucker']",2020-07-10 20:29:00-04:00,"WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump has commuted the sentence of his longtime political confidant Roger Stone, intervening in extraordinary fashion in a criminal case that was central to the Russia investigation and that concerned the president's own conduct.

The move came Friday, just days before Stone was to begin serving a 40-month prison sentence for lying to Congress, witness tampering and obstructing the House investigation into whether Trump's campaign colluded with Russia to win the 2016 election.

The action, which Trump had foreshadowed in recent days, underscores the president's lingering rage over special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation and is part of a continuing effort by the president and his administration to rewrite the narrative of a probe that has shadowed the White House from the outset. Democrats, already alarmed by the Justice Department's earlier dismissal of the case against Trump's first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, denounced the president as further undermining the rule of law.

Stone, 67, had been set to report to prison on Tuesday after a federal appeals court rejected his bid to postpone his surrender date. But he told The Associated Press that Trump called him Friday evening to tell him he was off the hook.

""The president told me that he had decided, in an act of clemency, to issue a full commutation of my sentence, and he urged me to vigorously pursue my appeal and my vindication,"" Stone said by phone from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where he was celebrating with friends. He said he had to change rooms because there were ""too many people opening bottles of Champagne here.""

Although a commutation does not nullify Stone's felony convictions, it protects him from serving prison time as a result.

The move is another extraordinary intervention by Trump in the nation's justice system and underscores anew his willingness to flout the norms and standards that have governed presidential conduct for decades. As Trump stares down a coronavirus pandemic that has worsened his chances for reelection, he has been more willing than ever to test the limits of his power.

Democrats denounced Trump's action. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Saturday called it ""an act of staggering corruption,"" saying legislation is needed to prevent a president from pardoning or commuting the sentence of someone who acted to shield that president from prosecution.

House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff called it ""offensive to the rule of law and principles of justice. Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez asked, ""Is there any power Trump won't abuse?""

Sen. Mitt Romney, a Utah Republican, also condemned the move. ""Unprecedented, historic corruption: an American president commutes the sentence of a person convicted by a jury of lying to shield that very president,"" he tweeted Saturday.

White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said in a statement that Stone was a ""victim of the Russia Hoax that the Left and its allies in the media perpetuated for years in an attempt to undermine the Trump presidency.""

Stone had been open about his desire for a pardon or commutation, appealing for the president's help in a monthslong television and social media campaign and seeking to postpone his surrender date by months after getting a brief extension from the judge, in part by citing the coronavirus.

Trump, who had made clear in recent days that he was inching closer to acting, had repeatedly publicly inserted himself into Stone's case, including just before Stone's sentencing.

That earned a public rebuke from his own attorney general, William Barr, who said the president's comments were ""making it impossible"" for him to do his job. Barr was so incensed that he told people he was considering resigning over the matter.

""With this commutation, Trump makes clear that there are two systems of justice in America: one for his criminal friends, and one for everyone else,"" Schiff said. ""Donald Trump, Bill Barr, and all those who enable them pose the gravest of threats to the rule of law.""

269,ctvnews,http://edmonton.ctvnews.ca/infographics-covid-19-in-alberta-by-the-numbers-1.4874153,Infographics: COVID-19 in Alberta by the numbers,['Matthew Black'],2020-03-30 10:55:00-06:00,"EDMONTON -- As the number of COVID-19 cases mounts in both Canada and Alberta, we're slowly getting a clearer picture of how the pandemic is spreading and how the situation here compares to other jurisdictions.

While the daily case count announcements from provincial health authorities are the most eye-catching figures, there's other important numbers beyond newly confirmed cases, including hospitalizations and testing data.

This page will be updated daily as new information on Alberta, Canada and international cases of COVID-19 is made available.

Starting the week of June 29, the province will provide daily data updates Monday through Friday and not on weekends and holidays.

Follow the links below or scroll down to see how the COVID-19 situation is changing in Alberta as the pandemic continues.

HOW IS COVID-19 GROWING IN ALBERTA?

The province's daily case count announcement is among the most prominent COVID-19 statistics.

The number of new cases represents the number of patients who are newly infected with the coronavirus. The number of active cases in the province can go up or down depending on the number of new recoveries on a given day.

The above graph divides active cases into those who are sick, but not in hospital, and those patients requiring hospitalization. Hospitalized patients are further divided by those getting care in and out of intensive care units.

Recoveries are defined by Alberta Health Services as follows:

A return to health after 14 days of isolation for those with COVID-19 but who experienced only mild symptoms.

If hospitalized due to COVID-19, anyone who does not require additional hospitalization or treatment in the 10 days after they left the hospital.

If tested, such as a health care worker, two negative tests at least 24 hours apart.

Daily case counts include both lab-confirmed and probable cases. The case count for a given day is sometimes revised to more accurately reflect probable cases that were either later confirmed or determined not to be related to COVID-19.

WHERE IS COVID-19 HITTING ALBERTA THE HARDEST?

Since early April, the province has provided a geographic breakdown for both its five health zones as well as individual cities and community-level subzones within those cities.

Alberta Health Services divides the province into five health zones: Calgary, Central, Edmonton, North and South.

A map of those zones can be seen here, and it's important to note that the Edmonton and Calgary zones cover an area significantly bigger than the cities they are named after.

Sizable daily jumps in the new number of cases can't necessarily be attributed to the virus growing, as testing volume and reporting time also influence the data.

For more local data, the province's COVID-19 statistics page has an interactive map showing cases by city and community.

HOW MANY COVID-19 PATIENTS ARE IN HOSPITAL?

Tracking hospitalizations is an important indicator of how severely pandemic is affecting Albertans as well as how the coronavirus is taxing the province's health care system.

Alberta has the capacity for 295 intensive care unit beds and nearly 8,500 total beds, according to the province's modelling released in April.

So far, the number of hospitalizations and ICU admissions have both remained well below those maximum capacities.

Hospitalization data is often retroactively updated by the province as individual hospitals report data at varying times and speeds.

HOW IS ALBERTA TESTING FOR COVID-19?

Alberta has been the top province in Canada measured by per capita COVID-19 testing since near the start of the pandemic.

The province has now administered more than 500,000 tests Albertans.

It's important to distinguish between test volume (number of tests completed) and number of people tested as patients can be tested more than once.

The province has made seven notable shifts in testing policy.

March 23: The province announced testing was being focused on at-risk populations and health care workers. At the same time, testing returning travellers was deprioritized to only those showing symptoms.

April 7: Testing is opened to any symptomatic individuals in the Calgary Zone, which had seen significant spikes in cases in March and April.

April 13: Testing was expanded to any Albertan with symptoms consistent with the coronavirus.

April 17: The province announced it would start testing all staff and residents of continuing care facilities for COVID-19 regardless of whether or not they show symptoms.​

May 4: The testing criteria was expanded again to include anyone exeperiencing headache, muscle or joint aches, fatigue or severe exhaustion, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, unexplained loss of appetite, loss of sense of smell or taste, or pink eye.

May 11: The province opened testing to asymptomatic residents of the Calgary zone who work outside their home. Testing is to be done on a first-come, first-serve basis for up to 1,000 asymptomatic residents each day. The policy was in place until May 18.

May 29: The province announces all Albertans, including those who are asymptomatic, were eligible to be tested.

HOW IS COVID-19 BEING SPREAD IN ALBERTA?

The province divides the ways COVID-19 is being spread into three categories: travel-related cases, spread via a known source, and spread via an unknown source, or community transmission.

Initially, travel-related cases were responsible for many of Alberta's new COVID-19 cases. But since travel restrictions came into effect, the number of travel-related cases has largely flattened since early April.

Close contact with individuals known to be carrying the virus remains the most common way of spreading COVID-19 in Alberta.

Suspected community transmitted cases, where the carrier isn't immediately known, are an important indicator of how the coronavirus is spreading in a community as well as how successful measures like physical distancing have been in limiting transmission.

Identified cases are investigated by AHS and classified into one of the three categories. The classification can change pending further investigation.

WHICH AGE GROUPS HAVE BEEN MOST SUSCEPTIBLE TO COVID-19?

Since the onset of the pandemic, COVID-19 has affected the elderly more than other age groups as seen in high death and active case counts.

But, younger age groups are not immune, and by mid-June, cases among Albertans under the age of 40 had risen to form a majority of all active cases in the province.

HOW DOES COVID-19'S GROWTH IN ALBERTA COMPARE TO ELSEWHERE?

Conclusions drawn from comparing provinces are somewhat limited by widely differing testing volumes and practices among provinces, but the raw data does allow from some contrast.

The above graphs rank provinces by the number of tests they administer and how many confirmed cases they have, both adjusted to per 10,000 population of their respective province.

Tests are also not without their own biases. More tests will produce more positives, and it's easier to test everyone in a less populous province.

Rates adjusted for population provide a snapshot of the COVID-19 situation on any given day, but experts say the growth of the virus, which is unrelated to population size, is also an important indicator of future trends.

The below graphs display Alberta's coronavirus curve alongside other provinces and other countries. Both use a logarithmic scale to better depict the exponential growth of COVID-19.",[]
270,ctvnews,http://edmonton.ctvnews.ca/covid-19-in-edmonton-numbers-broken-down-by-neighbourhood-1.4910400,COVID-19 in Edmonton: Numbers broken down by neighbourhood,['Matthew Black'],2020-04-24 17:13:00-06:00,"EDMONTON -- Data on COVID-19 is largely focused on the international, national or provincial level, but statistics compiled by CTV News illustrate how the coronavirus is affecting Edmonton and its individual communities.

Alberta Health Services divides Edmonton up into 15 health subzones named for their home communities.

Since early April, the province has provided daily updates on the number of COVID-19 active cases, recoveries and deaths in each of those subzones as well as totals for the city itself.

This page is divided up into four sections: overall city data, subzone (community) level data, testing data and methodology.

Scroll down or follow the links below to navigate to each section.

CITY OF EDMONTON

The city of Edmonton is distinct from the Edmonton zone, which includes communities far beyond the city itself. You can see a map displaying the boundaries of the five AHS health zones across the province here.

Unless otherwise specifically indicated, numbers on this page are for the city itself and not the zone.

See the methodology section below for how a recovery from COVID-19 is defined by AHS.

COMMUNITIES

The 15 Edmonton AHS subzones cover the vast majority, though not all, of the area inside the city's coroporate boundaries.

You can see a rough map of the subzones below. For a zoomable version, visit the province's interactive data site and click on the geospatial tab.

Scroll down or follow these links to find data on each individual subzone:

Abbottsfield, Bonnie Doon, Castle Downs

Duggan, Eastwood, Jasper Place

Mill Woods South & East, Mill Woods West, Northeast

Northgate, Rutherford, Twin Brooks

West Jasper Place, Woodcroft East, Woodcroft West

Beaumont, Devon & Leduc, Fort Saskatchewan St. Albert, Sherwood Park, Stony Plain & Spruce Grove

TESTING DATA

Testing data for specific cities isn't yet available so these graphs display data from the Edmonton Zone as opposed to the city itself.

The Edmonton Zone had a population of just over 1.4 million people in 2018, according to AHS. The same year, the province estimated the city of Edmonton's population at just over 1 million people.

METHODOLOGY

Boundaries

The graphs above were assembled using two versions of the province's interactive data map, each with different borders.

The city-specific graphs draws data from the city of Edmonton as defined by its geographic corporate boundaries.

The community-level graphs draw data taken from the province's 15 Edmonton-area health subzones.

Their boundaries closely resemble the city's borders but with some exceptions. As a result, some areas within Edmonton's corporate boundaries, largely near the city's southern boundary, are included in suburban health zones.

Cases are attributed to the subzone of a patient’s primary residence. You can see population estimates for each subzone here.

Case Counts

The updated daily case count reflects the number of new, active cases (people who are now newly ill with COVID-19).

The daily change in active cases are determined by subtracting the number of newly recovered cases from the number of new cases. A positive value represents an increase in net active cases, with a negative value indicating the opposite.

The province often revises data, and reclassifies cases to other health zones or subzones which can cause a sudden rise or drop in cases for a given location.​

Reclassifications can occur for a number of reasons, including:

A patient's contact information was updated to reflect his or her proper address.

Further testing revealed a patient did not, in fact, contract COVID-19.

Data entry errors.

The province published new numbers daily March, April, May and June, with subzone data being available since early April. Starting the weekend of July 4, the province will release updated data on weekdays only, with no scheduled updates on holidays and weekends.

Recoveries

Locals wanting to get to know or rediscover their city have plenty of options in and around the river valley and downtown for the whole family.

""It’s one thing to be able to showcase our amazing city to visitors and guests, and it is even more special when we get to rediscover our own backyard again,"" said Explore Edmonton Director of Communications Tammy Forbes. ""And even if we have to adapt to the current health restrictions and remain safe, the tourism industry is going to be vital as Edmontonians look for fun ways to rediscover their own city. Our greatest ambassadors are the people who choose to make this place their home.""

Here are 10 unique spots to check out during your summer staycation.

BOB AND DOUG MCKENZIE SCULPTURE

From your television screen to a bench in Ice District, Bob and Doug McKenzie are now in Edmonton for good.

The sculpture of Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas pays tribute to the sketch comedy duo's Great White North segment that had a memorable run on Second City Television in the 70s and 80s.

Edmonton sculptor Ritchie Velthuis made the piece that appeared in Ice District, in 103 Street and 103 Avenue, in late March.

SPIRIT OF STANLEY

Edmonton has had a lot of Stanley Cups over the year, and while this one wasn't won on the ice, it's by far the biggest and most prominent.

Located in front of the United Cycle on Gateway Boulevard, the Spirit of Stanley is the world's largest Stanley Cup replica at four metres and 850 pounds.

Fun fact: Each team took 45 minutes to engrave, according to its maker, IMARK.

NEON SIGN MUSEUM

An Edmonton classic, the Neon Sign Museum tells parts of the city's history in an artistic and bright way.

The City of Edmonton has collected 20 signs, restored and installed them on the Telus building and Mercer Warehouse on 104 Street.

Neon signs include the Canadian National Railway, the Princess Theatre, and with the goal of collecting 30 signs, there is a petition to save and move the Western Cycle sign there.

HIGH LEVEL BRIDGE AND WALTERDALE BRIDGE

These two are just nice to look at, especially at night. The City of Edmonton often changes the High Level Bridge's lights in the morning and night to celebrate certain occasions, or to send a message of solidarity as it did recently with Nova Scotia.

The Walterdale Bridge has only been around for three years but it's already arguably Edmonton's No. 1 spot for photos, featuring the breathtaking architecture, the river valley, and downtown Edmonton's growing skyline.

Gallery: Walterdale Bridge

KEILLOR POINT

Keillor Point was known as the End of the World before the City of Edmonton overhauled the North Saskatchewan River viewpoint in 2019.

The End of the World, located in the Belgravia neighbourhood, had become a safety hazard due to slumping in the embankment and deterioration of the pillars, the city said.

Still, it was a popular place to hang out and take pictures of the river, so the city spent $1.5 million to make it safer and more accessible, with stairs and a pathway.

BELGRAVIA BENCHES

Near Keillor Point, these benches in the Belgravia Dog Park are a cool spot to catch a sunset with views that include Fox Drive, the Whitemud Equine Learning Centre Association, Quesnell Bridge, the river — and your dog.

TALUS DOME

Explore Edmonton calls the Talus Dome Edmonton's ""most provocative piece of public art"" that ""always has people talking.""

You've probably driven by the 1,000 steel balls while crossing the Quesnell Bridge and raised an eyebrow, but the city encourages Edmontonians to take a closer look.

""Think fun house meets the compound eye of a fly,"" Explore Edmonton said. ""You can capture some pretty warped and funny reflections that will have you busting a gut laughing.""

Just don’t throw paint on it.

FORT EDMONTON FOOTBRIDGE

A footbridge on what feels like the middle of nowhere connects neighbourhoods in southwest Edmonton divided by the North Saskatchewan River.

Sit on the benches on and surrounding the bridge for up-close views of the river, or exercise on the trails on either side or the Wolf Willow Stairs just steps away.

""If you choose the latter, be prepared to sweat it out and hike up 200 stairs to get to this vantage point,"" Explore Edmonton said.

RIVER VALLEY SWING

As if it wasn't clear Edmonton's river valley was full of fun and surprises: a wooden swing overlooking downtown Edmonton.

It's been called a hidden gem and picturesque, but not many people know where it is. It's not clear who built it and put it there — the mystery adding to the charm.

It's tucked under somewhere around Dawson Park.

Tell your friends…unless you want it all to yourself.

WHITEMUD CREEK UNDERPASS

This is another gem not a lot of people have known about until now.

Underneath the Whitemud Creek on Anthony Henday Drive is an archway that wraps around a footbridge.

And since it doesn’t get a lot of foot traffic, it's turned into a lot more than that.

The little underpass has turned into a colourful retreat covered in graffiti and photographers admiring the rugged beauty.

It may looked abandoned on the outside, but it's getting a lot of attention on social media.",[]

“I come here a lot,” one passerby told CTV News. “It's pretty nice.”

The Whitemud Creek arch was once a site for coal mining.

In 2005 the province added the pedestrian bridge as a means for people to safely traverse from one side of the freeway to the other. Below the bridge is the creek which allows wildlife to also make the safe trek.

Local blogger Lincoln Ho believes the project is incomplete and unsafe.

""Crumbling infrastructure is always an issue especially underneath one of the busiest roadways in the city,"" said Ho.

He believes that because of very little foot traffic, “urban explorers” are taking part in extensive and often profane graffiti tagging.

“They're climbing on to parts of the bridge that aren't for pedestrians,” says Ho. “Somebody is going to get hurt and it's very hard to access for medical personnel.""

The crossing has also become a popular backdrop for social media posts, increasing its notoriety.

""So anybody who has featured this bridge on a TikTok has gotten very popular with it and so everybody is copying everybody else’s TikTok's and checking out this supposed hidden bridge.""

Neither end of the bridge is connected by trail, making it difficult to access. Still, that isn’t stopping admirers from making the trek to this urban escape.

""I actually have a friend from Toronto coming to visit and I'm going to bring her here,"" said one woman out for a hike.

""It's a beautiful piece of infrastructure,” said Ho. “Beautiful contemporary architecture style in there and it is a shame that it's just left abandoned.”",[]

Kaysen Martin, who is 23 months old, needs a $2.8-million gene-therapy drug called Zolgensma for his Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type 1 that affects the muscles used for lung support, swallowing, crawling, walking and head control.

His family is pleading for Alberta Health to cover the drug, but time is running out, because it can only be administered before a child turns two.

A GoFundMe page to raise the money for the drug has already raised more than $80,000, including a $5,000 donation from Reynolds.

Kaysen’s mother Lana Bernardin said the family was excited to see the donation.

“Definitely surprised that Ryan Reynolds saw us. I’m not sure how, but he saw us. So for sure, it was a really good, big surprise,” she told CTV News Edmonton.

Reynolds, who was born in Vancouver, has made many charitable donations in 2020. He and his wife Blake Lively donated to food banks across Canada, including a $5,000 to the Edmonton Food Bank in April.

The family has until July 17, Kaysen’s second birthday, to raise the money.

According to new Statistics Canada data, unemployment reached 15.5 per cent in June.

It marks an 8.8 per cent difference from the same time last year.

The only province with a higher unemployment rate is Newfoundland and Labrador, at 16.5 per cent.

And unemployment in Alberta’s largest cities is also highest among Canadian major urban centres: about 15.7 per cent of the Edmonton workforce is currently unemployed, and 15.6 per cent of the Calgary workforce.

In May, their unemployment rates were 13.6 per cent and 13.4 per cent, respectively.

The news comes alongside a report that Canada added 953,000 jobs in June as businesses forced to close by the pandemic began to reopen.

“That’s important progress but we have a long way to go,"" Alberta Premier Jason Kenney commented Friday at a news conference in Fort Saskatchewan, where a carbon capture and storage facility recently reached the five-million equivalent tonnes milestone.

Kenney’s government’s economic recovery plan centres on infrastructure projects that create jobs and making Alberta an attractive place for investment – as does the facility at the Shell Scotford complex, Kenney said.

“Projects like this are a key part of Alberta’s recovery plan to build, to diversify, and to create jobs. When the global economy comes back form COVID, when demand returns for oil and gas, we are going to see, I believe, something of a supply shortage because of all the upstream exploration that has been cancelled, and so we’ll see prices go up. And that will be a great opportunity for Alberta, especially as we make progress on pipelines,” he said.

“But there’s one critical factor, we’ve got to bring investment back. And that means we’ve got to demonstrate our progress on environmental responsibility which is why investments like this… are so important to jobs, the economy, and the future prosperity of Alberta.”

The national unemployment rate fell to 12.3 per cent after hitting a record-high of 13.7 per cent in May.

They say the current government has been targeting the Indigineous population of Ethiopia, the Oromo, through arbitrary detention, torture and kidnappings.

The recent killing of beloved Oromo singer and activist, Hachalu Hundessa prompted the Oromo and other Ethiopians to hold a global day of protest to pressure their governments to stop supporting the regime in Ethiopia.

“We are pretty much like the Indigenous people of Canada, stripped of their identity, stripped of their culture and forced to speak a language that was not even our mother tongue, he was trying to get that message out there, he was the voice of the voiceless” said spokesperson Sofia Ibrahim.

Protestors in Edmonton want the Canadian government to put an economic embargo on Abiy Ahmed’s regime and to take a clear stance on what they say are human rights violations in Ethiopia.

“We want the Canadian people to understand that the $200 million Canada gives Ethiopia is not supporting the people, it is supporting the dictator to build the military against the people”, Duressa Hazan, a Canadian of Ethiopian heritage said.

Robert Curtis ""Bob"" Clark, was first elected to represent Didsbury in 1960 at the age of 23, making him the youngest MLA to serve at the time.

According to media reports, Clark passed away in Calgary late this week.

While serving in office, he was named the minister of youth under Premier Ernest Manning and then minister of education under Premier Harry Strom.

When Peter Lougheed defeated the Social Credit Party, Clark served as the leader of the Official Opposition.

He continued to serve the constituents of Olds-Didsbury until 1981.

Clark then went on to serve as Alberta's first ethics commissioner and then the first privacy and information commissioner.

Premier Jason Kenney released a statement Saturday expressing his condolences to Clark's family and gratitude for his years of public service.

Some farmers rejoice after much needed rain falls across Southern Ontario, Friday.

Agriculture in Chatham-Kent is a $3-billion dollar industry that provides over 16,000 jobs.

But the harsh heat felt across Ontario has some farmers concerned for the health of their harvest.

Leon Leclair, former Chatham-Kent councillor and present farmer says he was ""worried"" for his land; all 1000-acres of it.

""Without rain we have nothing...no rain and all that heat, the question was...was I worried? I was definitely worried,"" says Leclair.

""In 40-years of farming for me, the (heat) has never been this bad.""

Environment Canada reports that areas in Chatham-Kent saw just under 75 millimetres of rain overnight, which Leclair says is the perfect amount for his Sugar-Bean-fields.

""Last nights rain was just awesome for me... the sugar-bean-field has seen limited rain. Yesterday I’m walking around the field worried, (then) we got three inches (of rain) and my land took all the water with no damage.""

If farmland receives an overflow of water, there is a draining system nearby that pumps the excess water into Lake Saint Clair.

Leclair says the water designing system is the second-largest in all of Canada.

A large downpour of rain also brings the risk of basement flooding.

Leclair says that the drainage system is built to help with that as well.

""In Chatham-Kent the basement flooding is draining into this drain also so they are benefiting from it. Some of the sub pumps may go into a combined sewer but some water will also drain into this drain,"" says Leclair.",[]

""It's Important to have events like this in small rural towns,"" says Emanuele.

""Often times our youth and LGBTQ community go to bigger cities for events like this. We wanted to have a space like this closer to home where people could meet others in the community and allies and have a good time.""

Businesses around town have started to come on board, including the Rusty Wrench Brewing Co. owned by pride co-organizer Kirby Bennett.

""I work in mental health, so I see firsthand the differences that happen in community,"" says Bennett.

""I really wanted to be part of that change and do some education and have a safe space to come together. The more exposure to celebrating diversity then people can find something in themselves.""

Emanuele says it's important for those who are gay to be visible.

""We don't hide that we are gay family, and we celebrate that every day. I think everybody should.""

Sponsored by the Rainbow Optimist of Southwestern Ontario, the five-hour long event was held. They had drag queen story time, musical entertainment and a speakers panel.

The Near North Palliative Care Network has been providing free compassionate end-of-life care service in Nipissing and Parry Sound for 33 years.

The mission of the network is to go to the patient, whether that's in their home, a hospice or the hospital.

""We want to be present in the lives of our clients and our community,"" said executive director Monica Monni.



""The mission of our visiting hospice is to be with you at your home.""

The money raised from the butterfly release fundraiser will go towards training new palliative care and bereavement volunteers who will serve patients and their families everywhere in the region.

So far, over $10,000 has been donated but officials expect more donations to flow in over the next little while.

""This is something that touches everybody regardless if the patient is there for cancer, heart and stroke or old age,"" said board chair Darren Renaud.



""No one deserves to die alone and our volunteers work tirelessly.""

Palliative care has had to adapt to more virtual conference calls due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But, it can be challenging, the network is finding many seniors struggling to adapt to the technology.

""There might be a need for an increase and demand in service as well because people are becoming infected and unfortunately succumbing to the infection, there's going to be a lot of need,"" said volunteer care co-ordinator Alison Wilkes.

Monni says volunteers are always needed and hopes the community will remember the work they do.

""We are also seeing more people facing isolation, anxiety, depression due to the fact that they can't be with their loved ones,"" said Monni.

This year organizers say it will go ahead but with revised plans to adhere to pandemic physical distancing protocols.

Several murals are part of the Up Here initiative to brighten downtown Sudbury.

Each summer local artists paint walls and power boxes as part of the art festival.

""Up Here Festival is an opportunity for people to come together and celebrate the city through art. So it's about kind of seeing our city differently, brightening up the city and being proud of the city we live in and where we come from,"" said Jen McKerral, the co-founder of the Up Here Festival.

Ashley Guenette,22, was born in Sudbury and now lives in Sturgeon Falls.

She will start her Masters in Fine Art at the University of Waterloo this September and has been selected to paint a large-mural as part of the festival this summer. The subject matter will be a surprise.

""I can tell you that it's gonna be big, beautiful, colourful, fun. Probably may be seeing an animal in there. For those who know my art, like I make big colourful animals,"" said Guenette.

Last year, Up Here took on its biggest project in the festival's five year history-a massive mural painted on the former General Hospital.

""The reactions are mixed and that's what you want from art. You want people to react to it. Whether or not it's positive, it’s forcing people to have a conversation about the role of art in our community, and the role of buildings that aren't being used anymore and walls that aren't being used,"" said McKerral.

Right now festival organizers are looking for walls and other outdoor canvasses for artist to splash their creativity.

""I guess Sudbury is very known to be a mining town and to see these big pieces of art that are very colourful and uplifting and they give out a new energy. I think it's very refreshing to see how lively the art works is becoming here in Northern Ontario,"" said Guenette.

This year, 12 local artists will take part in the festival, painting power boxes and six large murals in the downtown and other neighbourhoods in the city.

Erin Levy was supposed to be on summer vacation in Alberta, but the COVID-19 pandemic forced her to stay in Nova Scotia, where she decided to enjoy a staycation.

Levy went camping at Five Islands Provincial Park and planned a trip to the Joggins Fossil Cliffs on July 3.

The UNESCO World Heritage Site had just reopened on July 1.

“We hadn’t explored that area of the province before, so we went over there and wanted to do a day trip,” says Levy, who lives in Bedford, N.S.

After touring the Joggins Fossil Centre, Levy went for a walk near the beach.

“Up a little ways up to the right were the cliffs, so I got up next to the cliffs thinking maybe there’s cooler things there, and this was honestly just lying in the sand,” says Levy of her find. “So I pulled it out a little bit and saw the two sets of tracks and thought it was really neat.”

Levy soon discovered that “neat” was an understatement for her discovery, which turned out to be a 310-million-year-old fossil.

It dates back to a snapshot in time when Joggins was part of Pangaea, 100 million years before dinosaurs roamed the earth.

“These are fossilized footprints of two different animals,” explains Melissa Grey, curator at the Joggins Fossil Centre.

“One’s an amphibian creature and one’s a millipede, so two very different animals, which is really unusual and, not only that, they are both really beautifully preserved.”

“They were very excited about it,” says Levy. “They identified the tracks in a heartbeat and said it was interesting because the tracks were much smaller than what they were used to seeing for that kind of creature.”

Stunning find by a visitor to @JogginsFossils last week! Two sets of trackways - can you see both of them? One (one right) is from a large millipede and the other (left) is from an amphibian. This will be going into our Collection for future study! pic.twitter.com/NWXEWMjtxD — Dr. Melissa Grey (@CuratorGrey) July 6, 2020

The fossil has captured the attention of experts across the province. It will be researched and may go on display at the Joggins Fossil Centre, but Levy will always be part of its history.

“Erin the fossil finder will go down as the collector, so her name will forever be associated with that find,” says Grey.

Both Levy and Grey say they hope the discovery will encourage more people to explore Joggins and other historic sites in Nova Scotia.

“You do not have to be an expert or a trained paleontologist to find fossils at Joggins,” says Grey. “There’s so many. You actually can’t help but step on them.”

“This was amazing,” says Levy. “We have a ton of history that’s a bit unexplored, so I’m hoping it will just bring more people here to spend a bit more time in Nova Scotia and realize what we have to offer.”",[]

The mussels, which are considered an invasive species, were found in Sipiwesk Lake, located north of Cross Lake, and is part of the Nelson River.

The government said this is the first time the mussels have been found in the lake.

The province said zebra mussels were first found in the South Basin of Lake Winnipeg in 2013. It expected that the mussels would move down the Nelson River naturally, and therefore the province designated the area as an aquatic invasive species (AIS) control zone in 2015.

The province then announced in August 2019 that the mussels were found in the Nelson River for the first time.

At that point, officials with the province notified nearby communities and stakeholders to tell them of the discovery.

Zebra mussels can cause a variety of problems for affected bodies of water as they can impact community drinking water systems.

They can also affect boat motors and shorelines. The mussels can also have negative impacts on water-based industries such as commercial fishing, lodge operators, and local tourism.

The province said the spread of zebra mussels and other invasive species is preventable and anyone who uses the water, whether it be boaters to beachgoers, the province said they can do their part.

There are bait and decontamination requirements that are in place at AIS control zones and people with boats, including canoes and kayaks, must stop at watercraft inspection stations when they are open.

The inspection stations are open until the middle of the fall.",[]

In its annual report released Thursday, the BfV agency noted that Chinese government offices have access to data stored in China by companies such as Tencent, Alibaba ""as well as other apps, web services and mobility providers such as for example (bike sharing) providers"" that operate in Germany.

The head of the BfV, Thomas Haldenwang, said German's data isn't safe with Chinese companies because they are required by law to provide the data to their government.

""Any customer here in Germany who uses such a system shouldn't be surprised if this data is abused in Beijing,"" he told reporters. ""We can only warn against this.""

Germany's top security official also expressed concern about what he called the ""hybrid threat"" from China, which included the purchase of key German companies.

""When it comes to critical infrastructure, in the energy supply or now with 5G lines, we have to consider how we can protect ourselves,"" said Horst Seehofer, Germany's interior minister.

Seehofer added that Germany has yet to reach a ""political decision"" on whether to let Chinese telecoms equipment company Huawei supply infrastructure to German cellphone service providers.",[]

Of the 107 surviving lemur species on the island, some 103 are threatened, including 33 that are critically endangered -- the last stop before ""extinct in the wild"", the International Union for the Conservation of Nature said.

The organization called for a fundamental reimagining of the way humanity interacts with the natural world, in an update to its ""Red List of Threatened Species"".

The list assesses 120,372 species and classifies more than 30,000 species as at risk of disappearing.

The report comes amid growing alarm that the planet may have already entered a period of so-called mass extinction, only the sixth in 500 million years.

The United Nations' biodiversity panel IPBES last year warned that up to one million species faced the risk of extinction as a result of humanity's insatiable desire for land and materials.

Grethel Aguilar, the IUCN's acting director general, said the updated list showed ""Homo sapiens needs to drastically change its relationship to other primates, and to nature as a whole"".

Lemurs, Madagascar's ""treasure"", are among the many precious species unique to the Indian Ocean island.

But the impoverished country is struggling to combat deforestation, poaching for food and the illegal pet trade.

More than 40 percent of Madagascar's original forest cover was lost between the 1950s and 2000.

'SUBSTANTIAL DECLINES'

Among the lemurs newly listed as critically endangered are the Madame Berthe's Mouse Lemur, the smallest primate in the world, and the Verreaux's Sifaka, part of the ""leaping lemur"" family.

Both have seen ""substantial declines"" because their habitats have been destroyed by slash-and-burn agriculture and logging.

Verreaux's Sifaka, which is known in one region as ""sifaka of the cooking pot"", is also threatened by hunting.

""If you destroy or drastically modify their forest habitats, they cannot survive,"" said Russ Mittermeier, of IUCN's Species Survival Commission Primate Specialist Group.

Across other parts of Africa, 53 percent of primate species -- 54 of 103 -- are now threatened with extinction, driven by bushmeat hunting and habitat loss, the IUCN report said.

Remco Van Merm, from its Global Species and Key Biodiversity Areas Programme, said the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic was leaving some poor communities with ""no choice but to resort to using natural resources to meet their daily needs"".

""We are already seeing increasing levels of resource use, and not only in Madagascar,"" he said, calling for communities to be involved in conservation efforts.

Mittermeier said more lemurs may have already gone extinct if it was not for an initiative that helped fund local projects like ecotourism, reforestation and education.

While he expressed concern over the suspension of tourism due to the pandemic, he stressed that it ""remains perhaps the best tool available"" to ensure the survival of wild lemur populations.

HUMAN THREATS

Among the other animals added to the IUCN's critically endangered list was the North Atlantic Right Whale, estimating that there were fewer than 250 adults at the end of 2018 -- some 15 percent lower than 2011.

Climate change appeared to be pushing the whales further north during summer into the Gulf of St Lawrence off Canada, where they are more likely to be struck by boats or become entangled in crab pot ropes.

Their reproductive rates were found to have dropped, which was also a factor in driving the European Hamster on to the critically endangered list.

While a female hamster had an average of over 20 offspring a year during the last century, today they give birth to only five or six.

It has now disappeared from three quarters of its original habitat in the eastern French region of Alsace, and more than 75 percent of its territory in Eastern Europe.

Researchers are not sure what is driving the trend, but studies are focused on monoculture plantations, industrial development and global warming.

In 2017, the Research Centre for Environmental Protection in Alsace warned that with vast swathes of land turned over to maize and corn crops, the hamsters' diets had become so depleted of nutrients that they were eating their offspring.",[]

The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced its forecast for the 2020 harmful algal bloom season on Lake Erie Thursday. The bloom this year is predicted to have a severity level of 4.5 and the potential to reach 5.5 out of 10.

“This year’s forecast shows that we’re not making nearly enough progress on saving Lake Erie,” Kelsey Scarfone, Water Program Manager with Environmental Defence said in a news release. “We need governments to get serious about addressing phosphorus pollution if they want to prevent billions of dollars’ worth of damage caused by Lake Erie’s annual algal blooms.”

Though there has been some progress — last year’s forecast was at a 7.5 severity level — environmental groups: Environmental Defence, Canadian Fresh Water Alliance, and Freshwater Future Canada say it’s not enough. They are calling on the provincial and federal governments to “step up to the plate to protect the lake.”

“Excess phosphorus, mainly from agricultural lands, continues to wreak havoc on the lake and its tributaries on both sides of the border,” the release states.

The MPP for Chatham-Kent Leamington says the province and federal government are working jointly to reduce phosphorus on farmland - and out of waterways by improving wetland conservation - and upgrading wastewater treatment and collection systems.

Rick Nicholls say the Canada-Ontario Lake Erie Action Plan is reviewed and revised as needed over time to ensure continued progress towards achievement of targets.

Still, the three environmental groups say the Canada-Ontario Action Plan for Lake Erie has not seen much progress, with details of the plan — which was finalized in 2018 — still not available to the public.

The Ontario and federal governments along with the U.S. counterparts made a commitment to tackle algal blooms to reduce the amount of run-off entering the lakes. Last June a target of 40 per cent reduction of phosphorous in Lake Erie by 2025, and a target of 20 per cent by 2020 was set. The target has not been achieved the release states.

The blooms in Lake Erie consist of blue-green algae which can produce the liver toxin microcystin which can pose a risk to wildlife and humans. It can also result in higher costs to treat drinking water and prevent people from enjoying the lake which would impact local tourism, the NOAA website states.

“A healthy lake is vital for wildlife, drinking water, and our economy,” said Raj Gill, Great Lakes Program Director at the Canadian Freshwater Alliance. “COVID-19 has hit our recreation, tourism, and service sectors hard. Now is the time to invest in projects that restore natural areas, reduce pollution, and allow people to enjoy all that Lake Erie offers.”",[]

Experts believe the UAE has one of the highest per capita concentrations of surveillance cameras in the world. From the streets of the capital of Abu Dhabi to the tourist attractions of skyscraper-studded Dubai, the cameras keep track of the license plates and faces of those passing by them.

While heralded as a safety measure in a country so far spared from a major militant attack, it also offers its authoritarian government means to track any sign of dissent.

""There is no protection of civil liberties because there are no civil liberties,"" said Jodi Vittori, a nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who studies the UAE.

Dubai and Emirati government officials did not respond to repeated requests for comment in the days prior to publication.

After publication, the Emirati government acknowledged in a statement that ""UAE law enforcement has access to sophisticated technology and systems."" It said access to that material required ""proper legal processes,"" without elaborating on what rules or laws governed their use.

""These are generally reserved for matters of national security, particularly to counter the threat of terrorism and extremism, and have helped the UAE consistently rank as one of the top two or three safest countries in the world, despite being situated in one of its most insecure regions,"" the statement said.

The UAE's surveillance state can offer the parlour trick of finding your car at the massive, multistory parking garage of Mall of the Emirates, home to an indoor ski slope. But multiplied across the cameras watching public spaces, buses, the driverless Metro, roadways, gas stations and even all the emirate's more than 10,000 taxi cabs, authorities in effect can track people in real time across Dubai. Police also easily gain access to surveillance footage from state-linked developers and other buildings.

A decade ago, Dubai proved those cameras could be quickly used. After the Jan. 19, 2010 assassination of Hamas commander Mahmoud al-Mabhouh at a Dubai hotel, police quickly pieced together the some three-dozen suspected Israeli Mossad operatives who carried out the killing. They later showed video beginning from the operatives' arrival at the airport to their trailing of al-Mabhouh while dressed as tennis players.

State-linked media at the time suggested some 25,000 cameras watched Dubai. Today, cameras are far more sophisticated and far more prevalent. Technology as well has made the tracking even easier.

Since late 2016, Dubai police have partnered with an affiliate of the Abu Dhabi-based firm DarkMatter to use its Pegasus ""big data"" application to pool hours of surveillance video to track anyone in the emirate. DarkMatter's hiring of former CIA and National Security Agency analysts has raised concerns, especially as the UAE has harassed and imprisoned human rights activists.

In the run-up to the pandemic, Dubai police launched a new surveillance camera program powered by artificial intelligence called ""Oyoon,"" or ""Eyes"" in Arabic. Police described the project in January 2018 as a means to ""prevent crime, reduce traffic accident related deaths, prevent any negative incidents in residential, commercial and vital areas and to be able to respond immediately to incidents even before they get reported.""

The ""Oyoon"" project included police partnering with government and semi-government businesses that already had a vast network of surveillance cameras.

In May, Dubai police Brig. Khalid al-Razooqi said the ""Oyoon"" system would begin checking temperatures of those passing by, as well as making sure people maintain a social distance of 2 metres (6 feet) from each other.

Outside of ""Oyoon"" cameras, Dubai police also are experimenting with thermal helmet cameras for officers to check passers-by's temperatures. Malls and other business have implemented a variety of thermal image scanners. At Dubai International Airport, for instance, those coming in walk past a thermal scanner that also checks people for masks. Dubai's Silicon Oasis neighbourhood similarly has been tracking passers-by with cameras.

Similar technology has been used at the Mall of the Emirates, run by the private firm Majid Al Futtaim. Companies building so-called ""disinfection gates,"" which fog chemicals on people, similarly use thermal cameras that also can record and upload their data.

Nothing prevents these additional cameras and their data from being fed into wider facial recognition databases in the city-state. The UAE already has such a database from its national ID card system, which residents use for fast immigration clearance at Dubai International Airport.

Meanwhile, the UAE's capital Abu Dhabi is believed to have its own extensive security camera system. Other emirates as well have touted their camera networks, with the emirate of Ras al-Khaimah announcing in February it installed over 140,000 cameras itself.

This comes as the UAE bans political parties, labour unions and strikes by its foreign labourers -- all while commemorating 2019 as its ""Year of Tolerance."" Laws in the Emirates also give authorities broad latitude to punish people's speech, while docile local media remain largely state-owned or government-linked.

""Dozens of activists, civil society leaders, academics and students remained imprisoned during 2019 as part of the broader crackdown,"" the Washington-based advocacy group Freedom House said in its recent annual report on the UAE. ""The political system grants the Emirates' hereditary rulers a monopoly on power and excludes the possibility of a change in government through elections.""

Many of the cameras and thermal scanners used by the UAE come from China. A Chinese firm also announced a deal for coronavirus vaccine trials in Abu Dhabi, a deal it struck that included Group 42, a new Abu Dhabi firm that describes itself as an artificial intelligence and cloud-computing company. Also known as G42, the company's CEO is Peng Xiao, who for years ran Pegasus, the DarkMatter ""big data"" software.

G42 has partnered with Israeli firms over the coronavirus. It also partnered with China in order to handle the UAE's mass coronavirus testing program. U.S. Embassy officials in Abu Dhabi earlier declined an Emirati offer to test all American personnel for free due to Chinese involvement in the program, something first reported by The Financial Times.

China's involvement would raise security concerns for U.S. forces operating in the UAE, said Vittori, a retired lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Air Force. The Emirates, nicknamed ""Little Sparta"" by former U.S. Defence Secretary Jim Mattis, is home to some 5,000 American troops, many at Al Dhafra Air Base. It also hosts the busiest port for the U.S. Navy outside of the United States at Dubai's Jebel Ali port.

""Having `Little Sparta' with the Chinese surveillance network should be a concern to United States,"" Vittori said.",[]

A report from the Cybersecure Policy Exchange at Ryerson University in Toronto found 57 per cent of respondents in an online survey in May had encountered at least one cybercrime.

The Pollara survey results of 2,000 people were released Thursday as part of an effort to stimulate a national debate about cybersecurity and privacy.

""We need urgent national policies that protect our security and digital privacy, while ensuring equal access for all,"" said Charles Finlay, one of the report's authors, said in a statement.

Finlay, who is a former director of policy at Ontario's ministry for economic development, is currently executive director of a Ryerson centre for innovation in cybersecurity.

Of the five forms of cybercrime listed in the Pollara survey, the most commonly reported was harmful software such as a virus (31 per cent) or ransomware (eight per cent).

In addition, 28 per cent said their personal information was exposed through a data breach, 22 per cent had an online account hacked and 13 per cent were tricked by a deceptive email or website.

According to the polling industry's generally accepted standards, online surveys cannot be assigned a margin of error because they do not randomly sample the population.

That is equivalent to the distance between Boston and Washington D.C. in the United States, or between London and Basel, Switzerland, the World Meteorological Organization said in a statement.

WMO's committee of experts on weather and climate extremes also reported a new world record for the duration of a lightning flash, with a single flash that developed continuously over northern Argentina on March 4, 2019 lasting for a full 16.73 seconds.

The new ""megaflash"" records, which were verified with new satellite lightning imagery technology, were more than double the previous known record-holders, WMO said.

The previous record for the longest detected distance for a single lightning flash was 321 kilometres (199 miles), measured on June 20, 2007 in the US state of Oklahoma, WMO said.

The previous duration record was 7.74 seconds, measured on August 30, 2012 in southern France, it said.

'EXTRAORDINARY RECORDS'

The new measurements reveal ""extraordinary records from single lightning flash events,"" Randall Cerveny, the chief rapporteur in the WMO expert committee, said in the statement.

""It is likely that even greater extremes still exist, and that we will be able to observe them as lightning detection technology improves,"" he said.

The previous records were assessed using data collected by ground-based so-called lightning mapping array networks, which many lightning scientists acknowledge face upper limits in the scale of lightning that can be observed, WMO said.

It hailed recent advances in space-based lightning mapping that allow for measuring ""flash extent and duration continuously over broad geo-spatial domains.""

This has allowed for the detection of ""previously unobserved extremes in lightning occurrence, known as 'megaflashes',"" Michael J. Peterson, of the Space and Remote Sensing Group of Los Alamos National Laboratory in the US, said in the statement.

Megaflashes, he said, ""are defined as horizontal mesoscale lightning discharges that reach hundreds of kilometres in length.""

The UN agency occasionally reveals quirky weather-related milestones, like in 2016 revealing a record wave measurement of a behemoth that towered 19 metres (62.3 feet) -- taller than a six-storey building -- above the North Atlantic.

All such records are stored in the WMO Archive of Weather and Climate Extremes.

The archive currently includes two other lightning-related extremes.

One is for the most people killed by a single direct strike of lightning, when 21 people died in Zimbabwe in 1975 as they huddled for safety in a hut that was hit.

The other is for an indirect strike, when 469 people died in Dronka, Egypt when lightning struck a set of oil tanks in 1994, causing burning oil to flood the town.",[]

Archeologists have long believed the two regions made early contact, pointing to the early, widespread cultivation of a South American plant in Polynesia, a collection of more than 1,000 islands scattered over the Pacific Ocean.

The results of a genomic study now confirmed they did.

According to a paper published Wednesday in the journal Nature, researchers found ""conclusive evidence"" for the early encounter between the two groups, after analyzing the DNA of more than 800 individuals from 17 Polynesian islands and 15 indigenous American groups on the Pacific coast.

The researchers were looking for signs that prehistoric Polynesians and Indigenous Americans had children together, which would leave a clear genetic signature in their offspring -- called an admixture.

What they found was that people from several eastern Polynesian islands, including Rapa Nui -- also known as Easter Island -- have genetic traces in their DNA linked to indigenous South Americans. The genetic signatures showed a strong connection to the Zenu, an Indigenous group from Colombia.

Researchers then traced the timing of their encounter by analyzing the length of the Indigenous American genomic segments, and decided the initial admixture took place in the eastern islands of Polynesia around 1150-1230 A.D.

But in Rapa Nui, that admixture was dated much later to around 1380 A.D., despite the island being the closest to South America.

""Our analyses suggest strongly that a single contact event occurred in eastern Polynesia, before the settlement of Rapa Nui, between Polynesian individuals and a Native American group most closely related to the indigenous inhabitants of present-day Colombia,"" the study said.

HOW DID THEY GET THERE?

But what the study couldn't confirm is how exactly that encounter unfolded: Did the Polynesians voyage to South America and mix with the local people there, or did South Americans drift thousands of miles to the Pacific?

The Polynesians are known as masters of oceanic exploration for their long voyages across the Pacific Ocean. Traveling in double-hulled canoes and guided by the stars, they have sailed as far as the Hawaiian Islands and Easter Island in the east, and New Zealand in the south, for settlement.

But some have also argued that Indigenous Americans were also able to make the journey to Polynesia, with favorable weather conditions and currents. In 1947, Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl famously sailed on a simple wooden raft from the coast of Peru to Polynesia, in order to prove his theory that people from South America could have colonized Polynesia.

The study is the latest evidence of prehistoric contact between Indigenous Americans and Polynesians. Previously, scientists have found clues to their early convergence in the sweet potato, a plant that originated in South America but was grown and eaten thousands of miles away all over Polynesia, centuries before Europeans arrived in the Pacific.

Research published in 2013 suggested that the sweet potato was first introduced to Polynesia between 1000 and 1100 A.D., most likely by Polynesian voyagers who reached the western coast of South America and brought back the crop, before spreading it to other Pacific islands.",[]

""I like to believe that he did hear me,"" she said in an interview this week.

""I said something to him before he passed, which made him know that it was OK to leave us, and I had never said those words before, so shortly thereafter he did pass. I do believe he could hear.""

Ian Jordan suffered a head injury when he and another officer were on their way to a call in Victoria in September 1987. He died in April 2018.

Now, research from the University of British Columbia suggests people who are unresponsive can hear, even hours before they die.

Lead author Elizabeth Blundon, who recently graduated from the university with a PhD in psychology, said the findings may bear out a persistent belief among health-care workers that hearing is the last sense to go in the dying process.

The study, published recently in Scientific Reports, was the first to investigate hearing when people are close to death, in one case six hours beforehand, Blundon said.

The research involved eight patients at a hospice doing a hearing task when they were still responsive. Five of them repeated the task when they became unconscious.

A control group of 17 young, healthy participants also took part in the study, which was completed between 2013 and 2017.

Participants wore a cap with 64 electrodes that measured brain waves as they listened to a series of tones grouped in five patterns that would occasionally change.

Those in the control group pressed a button when they heard the pattern change while the responsive patients at the hospice were asked to count the number of times the pattern changed.

The brain activity of the control group and the responsive hospice patients was very similar to that of the unresponsive patients, Blundon said.

""It's an encouraging sign that at the very least the brain is reacting and processing at some capacity the auditory information that it's receiving,"" she said of the glimpse into brain activity that persists in the transition between life and death.

""But I can't tell anybody if their loved one understands them or knows who's talking to them,"" Blundon said, adding further research is needed to delve deeper into the mysteries of end-of-life hearing.

Previous research into hearing of unresponsive patients has been done in Europe on patients with traumatic brain injury and showed they also respond to sound, said Blundon, who hopes to continue her work at the University of Miami, where she may also look into the effects of music on those near death.

Dr. Romayne Gallagher, who recently retired as a palliative care physician at St. John Hospice where part of the study was completed, said she noticed during 30 years in her job that patients would react positively when they heard the voice of a loved one, even on the phone.

Families can take some measure of comfort from spending time talking to their loved ones, even when they don't respond, she added.

""A lot of people are scared of this time and they don't quite know what to do and we often say to them, 'Talk to them, play their favourite music.' Things like that.""

Jordan said she spent thousands of hours ""chit-chatting"" with her husband and playing his favourite music from the 1970s and '80s on a boom box she brought to hospital.

""It just seemed natural, speaking to him,"" she said, adding he seemed to respond most favourably every time she mentioned their son Mark, who was 16 months old when the crash happened.

Backstopped by more than $500 million in new funding over the next five years, Ottawa's newly released cybersecurity strategy lays out a range of initiatives to help Canadians, business and the government better protect against cyberthreats.

The strategy was the result of nearly two years of consultations with industry, academics and other experts, and updates the first such plan released by the Harper Conservatives in 2010.

It comes as the internet and digital technology play an increasingly important role in every aspect of life, making many functions easier and leading to new economic opportunities -- but also opening the country and Canadians up to new risks.

And those risks appear to be increasing: The RCMP says that police services across the country received 24,000 reports of cybercrimes in 2016, which represented a 58 per cent increase over the previous two years.

There are also growing concerns about the threat posed by foreign states, terrorist groups and others who may try to target the country's electricity grids, banking services, hospitals and election systems.

The new cybersecurity strategy does three things, starting with an increased emphasis on detecting, deterring and prosecuting cybercrime, Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale told a news conference on Parliament Hill.

""We must substantially strengthen Canada's cybersecurity capabilities to better protect ourselves and our systems against evolving cyberthreats,"" he said, ""while also enlarging our capacity to combat cybercrime and prosecute offenders.""

To that end, the RCMP will add new cyber-investigators and become the main focal point for police across the country to report illegal activity online. It will also liaise with foreign partners to identify potential threats and crack down on criminal networks.

The strategy also brings the various cybersecurity efforts underway in different federal departments under a new Canadian Centre for Cyber Security, Goodale said, which will be housed at the Communications Security Establishment and open in the fall.

And it will attempt to help the private sector, especially small businesses, which officials say were the victims of 71 per cent of data breaches, better protect themselves, including through a voluntary certification program.

""They comprise a huge chunk of the Canadian economy,"" Goodale said of small businesses.

""And they are as interconnected as the rest of us to their suppliers upstream and to their customers downstream, so if they have a cyber problem, that whole network could be infected.""

Yet it wasn't immediately clear how the government intended to address what will be one of the biggest hurdles to successfully implementing the plan's ambitious goals: a shortage of cybersecurity specialists, both in Canada and around the world.

""A shortage of cybersecurity talent makes it difficult for organization -- including the federal government -- to attract and retain the people they need to improve their cybersecurity or to disrupt cyberthreats,"" the new strategy reads.

Goodale described the shortage as ""a huge challenge and a huge opportunity,"" noting that the cybersecurity industry in Canada already supports an estimated 11,000 jobs and generates $1.6 billion in economic activity -- numbers the government hopes to grow.

""The world will be demanding people with these talents and skills who understand cybersecurity and can deliver the goods for their employers,"" Goodale said, ""whether they are in the private sector or the public sector.""

But while the most recent federal budget set aside $8 million for up to 1,000 student work placements in cybersecurity, the strategy doesn't include a dedicated focus on skills training or set aside funding to help grow the industry.

""It's disappointing to see a lack of commitment to build Canada's cyber sector,"" said Benjamin Bergen, executive director of the Council of Canadian Innovators, which represents many of Canada's tech companies.

""Cyber is the fastest growing ICT sector in the world and domestic innovators present an opportunity for our government to grow our economy and deploy world-class technology solutions for protecting Canada's digital borders.""

The plan was also largely silent about foreign-owned telecommunications companies such as Huawei, which intelligence chiefs in the U.S. have identified as a national security risk, and made no mention of encrypting personal communications.

The latter has been a contentious issue between privacy advocates and law enforcement, who have argued that such encryption poses a barrier to investigations.

Goodale acknowledged the debate, saying that while it is obviously important for online banking and other commercial activities, ""there are important questions about law enforcement and national security being able to properly conduct investigations.""

304,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/rights-groups-to-google-no-censored-search-in-china-1.4072154,Rights groups urge no censored Google search app for China,['Christohper Bodeen'],2018-08-29 00:22:00-04:00,"BEIJING -- More than a dozen human rights groups are urging Google not to offer censored internet search in China, amid reports it is planning to again provide the service in the giant market.

A joint letter Tuesday calls on CEO Sundar Pichai to explain what Google is doing to safeguard users from the Chinese government's censorship and surveillance.

It describes the company's secretive plan to build a search engine that would comply with Chinese censorship as representing ""an alarming capitulation by Google on human rights.""

""The Chinese government extensively violates the rights to freedom of expression and privacy; by accommodating the Chinese authorities' repression of dissent, Google would be actively participating in those violations for millions of internet users in China,"" the letter says.

In a statement, Google said it has ""been investing for many years to help Chinese users, from developing Android, through mobile apps such as Google Translate and Files Go, and our developer tools. But our work on search has been exploratory, and we are not close to launching a search product in China.""

In the U.S., President Donald Trump and other conservatives have lobbed charges of censorship at Google and other U.S. tech companies, though they haven't provided evidence. On Tuesday, Trump claimed that Google had rigged search results about him ""so that almost all stories & news is BAD."" A top adviser said the White House is ""taking a look"" at whether Google should face federal regulation. The companies deny the accusations.

The rights groups' expression of concern over a Chinese search engine follows a letter earlier this month from more than a thousand Google employees protesting the China plans. The letter called on executives to review ethics and transparency at the company.

Google had previously complied with censorship controls starting in 2006 as it sought a toehold in the booming Chinese economy. But it exited the Chinese search market in 2010 under unrelenting pressure from human rights groups and some shareholders.

Tuesday's letter, signed by groups including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and Reporters Without Borders, said China's controls over the internet have only strengthened since then amid an overall crackdown on civil liberties and freedom of expression. The letter said it would be difficult for Google to relaunch a search engine ""in a way that would be compatible with the company's human rights responsibilities under international standards, or its own commitments.""

According to online news site The Intercept, Google created a custom Android app that will automatically filter out sites blocked by China's so-called ""Great Firewall.""

Google co-founder Sergey Brin was born in the Soviet Union in 1973 and lived there until age 6 when his family fled. He has said his experience with a repressive regime shaped his and the company's views.

However, Pichai, who became CEO in 2015, has said he wants Google to be in China serving Chinese users.

In December, Google announced it was opening an artificial intelligence lab in Beijing, and in June, Google invested $550 million in JD.com, a Chinese e-commerce platform that is second only to Alibaba in the country. The companies said they would collaborate on retail solutions around the world without mentioning China, where Google services including Gmail and YouTube are blocked.",[]

The move was announced by Chief Frank Roberts in a Facebook video posted Wednesday night.

""We've had one (COVID-19) test that's come back that's positive,"" Roberts said.

Anyone who had been in contact with the person who tested positive was instructed to self-isolate.

""Others are encouraged to remain within or around their households to prevent cross-contamination.""

Roberts said the lockdown would fully come into effect Friday evening, providing a window for community members who were not required to self-isolate to leave to purchase essential goods or check on their traplines.

However, Roberts said after Friday's deadline no one would be allowed to return to the community, located roughly 100 kilometres north of Prince Albert.

In the video, Roberts said access would be limited to public buildings but essential services would continue.

The community's grocery store would continue operating with social distancing measures in place.

""We've done pretty good at the store, but now it's going to be a little bit stricter there,"" Roberts said.

Amanda Nelson, the nurse manager at the community's health centre, also appeared in the video.

""If you are sick, stay home,"" Nelson said.

She said the Medical Health Officer was aware of the case and that sanitizer, masks and COVID-19-related information would be dropped off at homes in the community.

COVID-19 put a stop to those plans and with free time to fill, Hocknes is learning COVID-19 isn’t the first virus to force school closures and claim lives in Saskatoon.

“We had the Spanish flu in 1918 where millions of people died, so history does repeat itself and you start to see that more and more,” Hocknes said.

Over the past two-and-a-half years, Hocknes has devoted time to read through old editions of the Saskatoon StarPhoenix spanning the 20th Century, in an effort to collect and achieve Saskatoon’s history.

“I embarked on this project to look at the history of Saskatoon and learn all the stories that have been forgotten,” Hocknes said, adding he’s also working on the history of Saskatoon’s music scene.

Hocknes has read through 600,000 newspapers, compiling 49,000 articles he felt should be remembered now and by future generations.

Those stories include Saskatoon residents just getting the first numbers volunteering for the Second World War; an old high school near the riverbank training soldiers how to operate machine guns; and Saskatoon getting hooked up to natural gas energy.

“That was a big deal and it came at a big cost,” he said.

Everything Hocknes clips, he scans, saves and post to his Facebook page Saskatoon History Photos StarPhoenix Memories Vintage Discussions.

“Every day I learn 100 new things I’ve never heard of before and hopefully everyone else does too,” he said.

He said his page has 2,700 followers, many of which no longer reside in Saskatchewan but grew up in the prairies.

Hocknes said once he’s captured the stories of Saskatoon from 1902 to 1999 his goal is to publish a series of books to preserve these stories for generations to come.

If given the choice, would Hocknes go back in time?

“As much as we might like living in the past, I don’t think we could get along with people because our morals and vibe has changed so much I don’t think I could have a conversation with a relative 100 years ago, they wouldn’t know what to make of me.”",[]

Morin was reported missing on July 10, 2018 from North Battleford. Since then the RCMP said it believes Morin was the victim of a homicide.

A small crowd gathered in front of the Saskatoon Police Service headquarters and began walking to North Battleford, a trek expected to take three days.

“We keep pushing ourselves saying ‘Ashley is out there somewhere,’” said Krista Fox, a friend and spokesperson for the family.

“We gotta keep going, we can’t give up, we give up now then we’ve given up and we won’t do that. We will go to the ends of earth to bring our girl home.”

Fox said following the walk from Saskatoon to North Battleford last year, tips concerning Morin's disappearance came in, and Fox is hopeful for more information to come forward after this year’s march.

Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations Chief Bobby Cameron spoke to the group before they set out, expressing his sympathy to the family for what they’re going through.

“The hopelessness that the family feels … we pray with the family and we stand with the family that one day we hope for the best outcome that she comes home alive to be with you guys,” he said.

During the investigation into Morin’s disappearance RCMP said they haven’t found any cell phone, social media or banking activity since she was reported missing.

Last year investigators released a blurry image of a two-toned windowless van believed to be connected to Morin’s disappearance.

Mounties said it was on the corner of 96th Street and 16th Avenue in North Battleford, July 10, 2018, around 9:30 p.m., one one of the locations RCMP say Morin was last seen,",[]

Current leader Andrew Scheer is in his final weeks in the job.

Party members are now voting for his replacement with the winner to be announced in late August.

Meanwhile, the issue is not going away.

The ethics commissioner has been called in to see if Trudeau broke conflict-of-interest law in awarding a multimillion-dollar contract to the WE organization, given Trudeau's long-standing family ties to the organization.

The commissioner is also being asked to probe Finance Minister Bill Morneau's ties as well -- one of the minister's daughters works for the organization.

The Liberals, and WE, have said there is no direct link between the awarding of the contract to run the $900 million Canada Student Services Grant program and the organization's connections to the Trudeaus.

The Conservatives also say that revelations Trudeau family members have been paid by WE for speaking engagements in the past elevates the seriousness of the matter. The party says the police should investigate for possible fraud.

Trudeau himself was never paid.

Both ethics and criminal investigations take time.

The investigation by the ethics commissioner into the SNC-Lavalin affair was requested in February 2019 and completed in August of that year.

The Senate expenses scandal first broke in 2012 and it took two years for criminal charges related to fraud to surface in that case. Former Conservative senator Mike Duffy was acquitted on all of them in April 2016.

So, given that the Opposition Conservatives will have a new boss while the WE story likely continues to percolate, how will Scheer's replacement seek to proceed?

The Canadian Press asked all four leadership candidates how they would deal with the scandal.

Leslyn Lewis:

The Toronto lawyer said the ethics commissioner has proven himself capable in the past of getting to the bottom of Trudeau's scandals and she trusts him to do that job here as well.

""The problem is that every time the ethics commissioner proves Trudeau has broken the rules, he just shrugs and moves on,"" Lewis said in a statement.

""The only way to hold Justin Trudeau accountable is for voters to vote him out. I look forward to leading the charge and replacing him with an honest and ethical government.""

Lewis does not have a seat in the House of Commons. If she wins, she would have to appoint someone to be the parliamentary leader until she could get elected.

Peter MacKay:

MacKay's wife, Nazanin Afshin Jam, a human rights activist, has spoken at WE events. His campaign says she has never taken money from the organization.

In an interview, MacKay said the WE controversy raises questions about the need to broaden and strengthen the power of the ethics commissioner, so if there's a finding a politician broke conflict of interest law, they could actually be penalized.

He also suggested that a stronger ethics screen might be required for whomever is prime minister to ensure there can be no blurring of lines between a prime minister's private life and public role.

In the meantime, MacKay, a former justice minister, said he thinks a criminal investigation into the WE contract could be warranted under Section 122 of the Criminal Code, which is breach of trust involving government officials.

The purpose of the section is to ensure government officials do not abuse their authority or their office, MacKay said.

By being in the cabinet room when the decision was made, knowing their family connection to WE, is a very serious thing, MacKay said.

""It's essential we keep confidence in public office holders,"" MacKay said. ""This undermines that.""

While it is the kind of issue that could result in a motion of non-confidence in the Liberal government, it's not that simple, MacKay said.

""We can't lose sight of the bigger picture here which is the economic and health crisis that still rages on as a result of COVID-19,"" he said.

""This is going to undermine severely the prime minister's legitimacy and ability to govern throughout this period.""

MacKay also does not have a seat in the House of Commons. What levers of parliamentary power he might want pulled would have to be done by someone else.

Erin O'Toole:

O'Toole has suggested the scandal brings with it the threat of a fall election.

When his campaign was asked whether he would seek to topple the government over it, a spokesperson did not directly answer the question, repeating only that they think the chances of a fall election are higher.

O'Toole supports his party's call for a criminal investigation. In an email, campaign spokesperson Melanie Paradis said that given O'Toole already has a seat in the House of Commons, he would be ready take on Trudeau on this issue from ""day one.""

""As leader, Erin will stand up for Canadians and get to the bottom of this corruption,"" she said. His campaign did not say how he would do that.

O'Toole's children have also attended WE events and he has spoken at one in his riding. His campaign said his family has never financially benefited from WE.

Derek Sloan:

Sloan is also a sitting MP. His campaign did not return two requests for comment on what he would do to address the issue.

The WSA said it recommends caution as fast-moving water can pose a hazard and that there is a potential for flooding in the area.

""Peak flows are expected in the Beauval area in early July and Lac Ile-a-la-Crosse is expected to peak in mid-July,"" the WSA said in a news release.

The agency said peak flows on the system are exceeding or could exceed 2017 levels and could approach record levels seen in 1974.

The WSA said Lac La Ronge remains at elevated levels and that levels will continue to rise over the next couple weeks, but flooding is not anticipated.

According to the WSA, flows into Reindeer Lake are at a record high and the lake is currently at ""full supply level.""

""Flows out of Reindeer Lake from Whitesand Dam have been increased but are not yet at full capacity,"" the WSA said.

""A combination of high flows from Whitesand Dam combined with flows on the Churchill River will result in the highest flows on record at Island Falls and Sandy Bay.""

That record, set in 2005, was a flow of 2300 metres per second, according to the WSA.

""It is expected that the water levels will rise over the next few days, and flows will cause localized flooding downstream of Island Falls,"" the WSA said.

Flows will stay ""well above normal"" east of Peter Pond Lake into the winter months, according to the WSA.

The WSA said its working with SaskPower on water release plans to minimize damage and is notifying people who could be affected.

""Any landowners near the Beaver River are also advised to be aware of the situation and potential impacts to property,"" the WSA said Thursday.

High levels around Tobin Lake

The WSA also says continued high moisture on the Saskatchewan River system will lead to increased outflows immediately at EB Campbell Power Station below Tobin Lake.

Flows are expected to surpass 2,000 cubic metres per second over the next day, leading to possible localized flooding in the delta area, according to a news release. Elevations are also expected to rise at Tobin Lake.

Residents, communities and First Nations in these areas are advised that high flows pose a safety risk and high water levels could damage property and infrastructure over the coming days.

Users are advised to use caution around the watercourses as swift moving water can pose a hazard and to take steps to protect property where necessary, the WSA says.",[]

Colton Klassen with the Saskatchewan Huskies found out on Twitter that his university football career may be over.

“I think at first glance, I was just in shock really. I thought it would be an easy decision to make.”

That decision was how U Sports would approach the age cap of 25 in football when play is scheduled to resume in 2021.

Despite having one more year of eligibility left with this season being cancelled because of the pandemic, Klassen is now amoung five Saskatchewan Huskies that will turn 25 before the start of the 2021 season, and won’t be allowed to play.

“We don’t have the choice to come back or play that fifth year is what’s heartbreaking, because you can’t do anything right?

“Playing that fifth year, in your final year, and getting that farewell tour kind of feeling, you play for that. You live for that.”

The other Huskies that would have their careers ended early are Yol Piok, Jace Peters, Nick Summach, and Joseph Trumpy.

“I don’t think it’s the right thing to do,” said Saskatchewan Huskies head coach Scott Flory.

“I just don’t feel it’s in the best interest, I don’t feel it’s consistent, and I don’t think it’s right.”

Flory is one of many coaches across the country who are disappointed with the decision, with University of Alberta Golden Bears head coach Chris Morris going so far as to step down from his position with the Canadian University Football Coaches Association.

I spoke to @UACoachMorris who sits on @USPORTSca Football Technical Subcommittee which guides most football decisions. They voted UNANIMOUSLY to extend the age cap for one season.

Nonetheless representatives from all schools (many of which do not offer football) voted against it — Farhan Lalji (@FarhanLaljiTSN) July 9, 2020

“If they’re a student in good standing, and they meet all the eligibility requirements, I don’t understand how and why they can’t play,” said Flory.

“The players that are on our football team that have been the longest serving, aren’t a part of the decision making process. Their best interests aren’t a part of it and that’s a tough one.”

U Sports interim CEO Dick White says the decision was not taken lightly by the Board of Directors, who felt they didn’t want to set a precedent that the age limit, which was put in place to narrow the age discrepancy for the health and safety of younger players, could be manipulated.

“We were very concerned that if we adjusted it, then a challenge could come forward and might eliminate the cap altogether,” he said.

“After having a cap for 10 years, we felt it was a very important component for U Sports football.”

Flory says the decision could affect as many as eight to 10 more of his players in the years to come.

“Maybe because they started late, or maybe because they had injury redshirts for a year or two, maybe because they played junior football.”

The Huskies’ Josh Ewanchyna is one of those players, after lining up for the Hilltops for three years.

“I should probably have three years including this year left of playing football, but now I’ve only got two left,” he said.

Flory believes U Sports should put an exemption on the age limit as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, because “through no fault of their own” players will have had a year of football “ripped away from them.”

“Not extending, and not granting clemency to those guys on every roster. It’s not only my roster, it’s all my opponents’ rosters too. To be honest with you, this affects other teams a lot more than it affects me, but I’m still going to fight for what’s right, and for those guys on that roster.

“It’s not hard either. You just take your existing roster and you just grandfather all those names. I mean, it’s not that hard. We’re not talking about kids coming in, we’re not talking about players that aren’t a part of it.”

White says the board will be taking feedback on the decision seriously and that it will be up for review.

Until that time, should it ever come, Flory says he’ll stand with his players.

“You’re a part of our team,” he said, referring to the five players. “You’re in school, you’re a member in good standing with us, and you are a part of our football team until they say on September 1st 2021 or whatever, that you can’t put on a jersey anymore.”",[]

“The City is interested in engaging a contracted service provider to operate the whistleblower hotline (e.g., report intake, verification and escalation, follow up with employees who have submitted reports); contracted services may also include investigation planning and execution, and suggestions for remedial/corrective action,” the RFI says.

The city does not have a whistleblower program or reporting mechanism for employees, vendors or citizens to report concerns regarding suspected waste or wrongdoing, the RFI says.

The RFI calls for, among other items, the main components of an effective whistleblower program and its estimated annual cost.

A whistleblower policy is under development and will be presented to City Council for approval in the coming months, the RFI says.

The policy would apply to all city employees but not employees of independent boards and corporations such as Saskatoon Police Service, Saskatoon Public Library, Remai Modern, SaskTel Centre and TCU Place.

“We have to separate what we want the police response to be within our community and what may be the norm now,” said Scott Thompson, assistant professor in the Department of Sociology.

Thompson made the comments following the controversial arrest of Evan Penner, who told CTV News he was using a garden hose in front of an apartment building to cool off when police tried to arrest him.

A video of Penner's arrest was released on Monday by the Indigenous Joint Action Coalition and Black Lives Matter Saskatoon, with members of the two groups alleging that excessive force was used. In photos taken on Wednesday, Penner can be seen with a bruised right eye with scrapes and bruises on the right side of his forehead, cheekbone and ear.

Saskatoon Police Services (SPS) has said the initial officer on-scene was responding to a report of a suspicious person. The 27-year-old man reportedly had caused damage to a property and when the officer attempted to take him into custody, he resisted and attempted to disarm the officer, SPS said.

Thompson also said the Saskatoon Police Association (SPA) has been defensive in its response to the public outcry over the video.

The SPA said in a recent Facebook post Canadian police are being scrutinized because of incidents that have occurred in the United States.

“Canadian police officers should not be compared to officers in the US. We are well-trained, we have forged important relationships within the community, and we are well compensated. For these reasons, we attract more qualified officers; oftentimes with college degrees and valuable life experiences.”

Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin has been the subject of national fury in America since footage emerged of him kneeling on Black man George Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes as Floyd begged him to stop.

Floyd’s death sparked national and international protests – with American police sometimes filmed acting violently in response - and debates over the role of police in communities.

In the post, the SPA alleged Penner attempted to flee from the backyard and a confrontation ensued. The SPA says Penner grabbed the officer’s Taser, breaking the officer’s duty belt. After pepper spray was ineffective, Penner struck the officer in the face and attempted to bite him, then ripped both ammunition magazines off the officer's belt and tried to hit the offer with it.

“Possibly one of the most controversial issues in policing today is the proper application of force,” the SPA said in its Facebook post.

“Most people in the public have never been involved in an actual physical confrontation with another person. Society’s perception of police use of force is often tainted through the media, television and movies. Rarely do any of these accurately show reality.”

The SPA said the public will be less safe if officers are hesitant to go to calls and if officers hesitate at calls where they must make quick decisions.

However, Thompson said what’s getting lost is the question of whether a better solution to the problem exists.

“It brings us back to the core question of those pushing for defunding police, of asking the question, are we asking the police to do too much right now? What the police can do is limited - they can arrest someone or move them down the block and none of those solutions solve the problem the person had of needing to have a shower.

“The fact (the police association is) pushing back and saying force was justified in this situation is not addressing the issue that bringing the police officer to the situation is actually escalating or could have led to the result of the need of the use of force. It could be that another person would be better versed in dealing with someone and working to solve the problems that individual has.”

The fact that the SPA claims this was the third time officers dealt with Penner in the same day shows there’s a need that isn’t being met by the community, Thompson said.

Penner told CTV News he “was perfectly normal, positive and calm all the time.""

The arrest is to be investigated by the Saskatchewan Public Complaints Commission.

""Why can't we spend a normal day together?!""

That's the stage of Summer we're at weather wise. Storm season has just begun and it's already been really active, days will feature normal parts but they'll rarely stay that way.

During the course of the storm season in Saskatchewan we get an average of 13 tornados, last weekend we had three in one day! On Saturday, July 4 during the afternoon and evening a cyclical tornadic supercell thunderstorm moved through Southern Saskatchewan. This big baddie of a storm not only produced three separate tornadic events but also threw softball sized hail from the sky. Surprisingly the reported damage from these storms was minimal

The first tornado touched down near Glenbain, Sask. around 4:30 in the afternoon, no damage was reported from this event. Number two happened just 10 minutes later at 4:40 near Kincaid. This time it stayed on the ground for approximately 40 minutes and moved Eastward towards Woodrow. Damage to a home and farm property was reported and investigated from this event. The storm continued on towards Assiniboia and near that community another touchdown occurred, around 6:23. Once again no damage was reported.

DID YOU KNOW

On Sunday, June 30,1912 the deadliest tornado in Canadian history hit the city of Regina. The Regina Cyclone started to develop at about 4:50 p.m., green funnel clouds formed and touched down South of the city. It tore through the residential area between Wascana Lake and Victoria Avenue, continuing through the downtown business district, rail yards, warehouse district and Northern residential area. There were a total of 28 fatalities.

Photos sourced from the Provincial Archives of Saskatchewan.

After things from the weekend settled down they ramped back up on Tuesday, July 7. A large line of storms from around the Swift Current area to Southern Montana moved across Southern Saskatchewan. This line of intense storms brought severe wind gusts, large hail and heavy rain. The Southwestern corner took the brunt of these storms once again.

Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) recorded the top wind gust at 141 km per hour at the Mankota station. Two other stations were in triple digits, Coronach at 139 km per hour and Val Marie at 117 km per hour. Nickel sized hail was reported in the Golden Prairie area and reports of trees being snapped came in from near Hazenmore.

Once this line of storms subsided a large area of low pressure developed and moved slowly through Central Saskatchewan. The Northwest side of this system dropped large amounts of rain and a good portion of that also slide through the Southwestern corner of the Province. The 24 hour accumulated precipitation, as of 11 a.m. Wednesday July 9, for North Battleford was 133.8 mm or around 5 inches. Localized flooding happened in North Battleford and Swift Current as city drains couldn't keep up to the downpours. The average rainfall for the whole month of July in North Battleford is 74 mm or 3 inches, they recieved almost double in 24 hours!

As we continue to move through the month of July we'll stay unsettled for the next couple of weeks. Now that moisture has blanketed the Province daytime heating will continue to produce the risk of thunderstorms on an almost daily basis.

Moisture breeds more moisture. If you're looking for a consistent nice day this weekend it will be Saturday. Temperatures will be seasonal and the sun will stick around all day.

Sunday afternoon the trouble starts to bubble up once again and we'll watch for more thunderstorms scattered through the Province.

The WECHU has identified Aedes albopictus during routine surveillance in Windsor.

This species has been identified across the United States, including Michigan, Ohio, New York and has been seen also been captured in the Windsor and Essex County region since 2016.

WECHU says Aedes albopictus mosquitoes are aggressive daytime biters, with peaks in activity in the early morning and late afternoon.

They typically lay eggs in and near standing water in items such as buckets, bowls, animal dishes, flowerpots, clogged gutters and old tires.

Although the species can spread the Zika virus, it remains a very low risk in our community, the health unit says.

“There is currently no change in risk for Zika virus in our community. The Aedes albopictus mosquito that was identified has tested negative for Zika and West Nile virus.

Windsor Mayor Drew Dilkens was joined by Leamington Mayor Hilda MacDonald, Kingsville Mayor Nelson Santos, County Warden Gary McNamara, Windsor Regional Hospital CEO David Musyj and Erie Shore HealthCare chief of staff, Ross Moncur for the panel discussion Friday morning.

The collective call for action was loud and clear: more testing and more provincial and federal leadership is required to gain control of the situation.

“We need proper leadership on the ground that can coordinate a proper response and bring everyone together as quickly as possible,” said Dilkens.

Dilkens says local leaders are doing their best but admits it’s not as coordinated as it should be — and the province has an obligation to take the lead.

“The federal government has the resources, the province has the responsibility and the cities have the problem,” Dilkens says. “At the end of the day, we all have a shared goal. And we want to solve this situation, but we shouldn’t be tripping over each other trying to undertake efforts that would be better delivered if there was one lead organization with ultimate responsibility.”

To date, roughly 800 workers in the agri-food sector have tested positive for COVID-19 since the onset of the pandemic and two have died.

But officials believe the number of positive cases would be a lot higher if the frequency and rate of testing was increased to all farms, with only one-third of workers tested so far, according to Windsor Regional Hospital CEO, David Musyj.

“Once it starts and it gets into a farm, it multiplies in those vulnerable settings,” Musyj notes.

A two-person team from Emergency Management Ontario was called in on July 1 to help provide a level of coordination in the testing and isolation process of agri-food workers, but everyone on the panel discussion agreed that the team needs to take a bigger leadership role.

Leamington Mayor Hilda MacDonald believes incentives need to be put in place to enhance testing efforts.

“I understand their fear, but there needs to be either some kind of carrot, or a stick, to say you have to have your farm tested,” says MacDonald, adding it should be a condition of employment.

“It’s a prickly issue and no one seems to want to take that on. But someone needs to,” MacDonald says. “If we don’t get somebody to do this, we’ll just keep going round in circles, on and on and on, and we’ll never get there.”

MacDonald says the federal government should also have taken a bigger role from the beginning when flags were raised early on in the pandemic. She says farms could ultimately lose some money if workers test positive and there aren’t enough workers to process crops — but says human lives trump profits

“This is now about humanity this isn’t about business,” MacDonald says. “We need to take hold of this, we need to grab this bull by the horns, and we need to get through the testing as soon as we can so that we get our numbers to zero.”

In response, Premier Doug Ford listed off all the federal and provincial agencies assisting in the region, including Ontario Health, the ministry, the Emergency Response Ontario team and federal inspectors. But the premier didn’t comment on who is taking the lead — only that it’s all hands on deck.

“I’ll be visiting some folks, along with workers and farmers and local businesses,” said Ford, hinting at a visit to the region sometime next week. “They’re incredible people. I’m always going to stand behind them. I’ll always have their backs in the Essex area, and I just can’t wait to get down there to say hello to everyone.”

County Warden Gary McNamara, who is also the chair of the Windsor-Essex County Health Unit, says the region is running out of time to get a handle on the crisis.

“On our first agreement the first third shift was an 18-month experiment and today we have people retiring that started with the minivan, ending with the minivan,” says Lewenza.

Windsor Assembly was the first in Canada to implement a third shift, and Lewenza admits it was a tough sell.

Lewenza is encouraging all union members, especially the people impacted by the loss of 1,500 jobs, to stay optimistic.

“If you just give up we would have never had the third shift initially because Lee Iacocca denied the third shift and it wasn’t until Bob Eaton took over where he decided the third shift was possible in Windsor.”

Lewenza says Unifor must continue to press FCA to bring another product into the Windsor Assembly plant.

“It’s the end of an era” exclaimed Teron D. James as he finished off his final Windsor Assembly Plant midnight shift at 7:06 a.m. Friday.

After 25 years working overnight James is switching to days with mixed feelings. He watched some of his co-workers cry last night wondering what their next move will be.

“Not even a town hall meeting to say goodbye,” James said.

Joe DiStefano took a buyout after 38 years with the company and leaves with no regrets “It’s time to give the younger generation a chance to work and move on to the next chapter of my life.”

The shutdown comes at a time when the region and nation are reeling with job losses due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

On Friday Statistics Canada reported that Windsor’s unemployment rate had dropped to 15.2 per cent, but remains historically high.

As the shift nears its end Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) issued the following statement Friday:

“The FCA Windsor Assembly Plant introduced the third shift 27 years ago to satisfy demand for one of the most innovative vehicles on the market. While we were able to maintain that momentum to build the world's most popular people-mover for nearly three decades, the time has come to return the plant to a traditional two shift operation as of July 13 in order to match supply with current demand. FCA will continue to demonstrate its leadership in the segment when production of the new '21 model year Chrysler Pacifica with AWD, all-new FamCAM and next generation Uconnect, as well as the Chrysler Voyager with unsurpassed value, begins in the coming months.”

The Windsor Assembly plant was the first in the automotive industry to introduce a third shift. It was created to meet customer demands for the Chrysler mini-van.

After 36 years of service, Kevin Davies said it’s like saying goodbye to a family.

“Spend more time with these guys than our actual families so it is rough” said Kevin Davies after 36 years of service,” he said.

Kim Bigelow says retiring is bittersweet but emotional as tears rolled from her eyes. She’s content leaving knowing her daughter, who also works at the assembly plant, will be fine.

“There’s a lot of young families with kids and with the housing market as high as it is it’s gonna be rough for them so I’ve been very fortunate, so it’s time to move on,” she said.

“Fitness is essential. It may not be essential to some people but we all know that mind and body act in unison,” says David Schild, owner of Xanadu Health Club in Lakeshore, Ont.

The owners of Xanadu Health Club have pitched in more than $200,000 help keep the business afloat over the last four months. They question why liquor stores were never forced to close during the pandemic.

“Alcohol is a depressant and also reduces your immune system.” Schild asks, “Is this what we should be doing, reducing our immune systems during a pandemic by pushing alcohol over health and fitness?""

The club believes a trip to the gym is safer than many think. “We’ve equipped all of our equipment with spray bottles. The air in our facility is completely replaced every four minutes,” says Chris Hoffman, Xanadu Health Club general manager.

Gyms are currently under stage three of the province’s re-opening plan. However, the Ontario Independent Fitness Studio Association (OIFSA), which represents several F45 gyms in Windsor-Essex say small, independent fitness studios should not have been grouped in with big-box gyms.

“We offer a more controlled environment. They are small classes where the instructor watches everyone,” says Alex Kucharski, OISFA director.

The F45 fitness studio in Tecumseh is overhauling their traditional training methods in order to meet health and safety guidelines once they are given the green to re-open.

“Every single person will have their own work space. They’ll have their own equipment, we’re not sharing equipment,” says Samantha Piercell, F45 Tecumseh owner.

With no chance of re-opening in stage two, gyms are now asking the government to enter stage three as soon as possible and to consider more flexible restrictions. “I’ve put everything into this place and the in-studio experience. The longer we stayed closed, the harder it’s going to re-open. We’re really ready,” Piercell says.",[]

“It took this pandemic to open up some eyes,” said La Guardia Pizzeria owner Michael Ciliberto.

Ciliberto has owned his pizzeria downtown for more than 40 years.

In all that time he said he’s tried to get a patio, Friday it became a reality with a new downtown parklet.

Crews were able to build the new patio spaces in three days. It will allow the three restaurants at 54 Pitt Street who pitched the idea 15 days ago the chance to serve customers throughout the summer.

""After the success of our first weekend street closure after Canada Day, we're thrilled to continue to support our small businesses and restaurants in downtown Windsor,” Brian Yeomans Downtown Business Improvement Association chair said in a news release. “Clearing years of red tape with city administration demonstrates their commitment to showing up for small businesses and allowing these establishments to recover from the economic shutdown of the COVID-19 pandemic.”

The City of Windsor has opted to fast track patios and parklets as a way to help struggling businesses recover.

“From our Pilot Project in Walkerville to introduce parklets and curbside cafes, to today's unveiling of Downtown Windsor's first parklet on Pitt Street East and the announcement of the upcoming Pelissier Street parklet, this innovative program is about finding inviting new ways to expand customer capacity while observing pandemic measures,” Windsor Mayor Drew Dilkens said.

Panache Restaurant and Lounge, La Guardia Italian Cuisine and On A Roll Sushi will operate from the same walled-off patio-style seating area, starting Friday, a welcome boost to their business.

“I don't even know if you can recover from what we've lost but it’s a start and hopefully this will lead to stage three and we can do the reopening, indoors and try to build back what we've lost,” said Cilliberto.",[]

More than 1,000 hand-made masks were donated to the Downtown Mission Friday.

Volunteers with the Iraqi Canadian Group Organization (ICGO) have been sewing the masks for weeks.

“This will ensure that many of our community members who might not be able to afford a mask and therefore might be limited to where they can go for support and supplies, will now be able to do so with this very kind donation by the ICGO,” a news release from the Downtown Mission stated.

The Mission says this kind of PPE is needed in Windsor’s homeless community and the Iraqi organization felt compelled to help.

“When somebody does something good, we have to show the appreciation and we have to unite so we can become stronger, and face crisis like this,” said ICGO’s executive director Khassan Saka.

Along with the mask donation, the ICGO presented a “Plaque of Friendship and Distinguished Service” to Laurie Musson, director of food services for the Downtown Mission.

Mission executive director Ron Dunn over the years the ICGO has provided donations and hours volunteering in many of the mission’s departments.

“We are so thankful for their generosity to serve those who come to the Mission for food, shelter and comfort, especially through the most difficult of times like we’re living through now,” he said.",[]
337,ctvnews,https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/this-map-shows-why-it-would-be-terrifying-to-open-canada-u-s-border-1.5012933,This map shows why it would be 'terrifying' to open Canada-U.S. border,['Sean Davidson'],2020-07-06 16:30:00-04:00,"TORONTO -- A map showing the startling contrast between Canada and the United States in the fight against COVID-19 has an infectious disease expert ""terrified"" at the thought of reopening the border.

As Canadian COVID-19 trends continue to decline, cases in the United States propel upwards. The Canada-U.S. border remains closed until July 21 but reopening it to non-essential travel anytime soon would likely lead to a resurgence in cases, infectious disease specialist Dr. Abdu Sharkawy said.

""It absolutely terrifies me to think of the prospect of any sort of easing of restrictions that could allow greater travel between Canada and the United States,"" he said, adding that the United States could hit 100,000 new infections per day sometime in the next week.

""These numbers are just unfathomable and astronomical when you consider what we have dealt with here in Canada over the course of three or four months.""

He said that maps tracking COVID-19 infections worldwide, like the one pictured above from Johns Hopkins University, paints a picture of how a country can successfully or unsuccessfully manage a pandemic.

While the data on the map above is on a more localized level in the United States, which makes it appear more red, there are still an overwhemling number of cases south of the border compared to Canada.

For example, a single red dot in New York City or Los Angeles accounts for more cases than in all of Canada.

""I don't think we have seen any another part of the world where you have two neighbouring countries in polar opposite situations in terms of pandemic control,"" Sharkawy said. ""This is a very strange phenomena where you are seeing such an extreme range.""

To date, there have been 2,796 COVID-19 cases per million people in Canada, while in the United States that number is much higher at 9,051 per million.

The United States is leading the world in COVID-19 cases as it nears the three million mark, while Canada has just over 106,000.

""I think if you look around the world at other countries that have successfully flattened the curve, a lot of resurgent cases have been a direct result of travel restrictions being eased,"" Sharkawy said.

""Border control and travel restrictions are a very key element in keeping your particular geographical area safe.""

""It's the longest undefended border in the world and the last thing we want to do is turn it into the longest unprotected border when it comes to COVID-19 transmission.""

Please keep the border closed...

Ontario Premier Doug Ford said in June that he believes reopening the borders too early could spark a second wave of COVID-19.

""I know it's inevitable … I just don't think we are ready right now,"" Ford said. ""You see what's happening down in the states; you look at Florida, you look at Texas, Arizona, California. I don't want to be those states. I want to protect the people here in Ontario.""

""Believe me, I love the Americans, make no mistake about it, but not when their COVID cases are just spiking right now and I’m just not in favour.""

Since March, everyone entering Canada for non-essential reasons has been ordered to quarantine for two weeks. The order was extended until the end of August but could be pushed even further.

Travelling within Canada 'reasonable'

While Sharkawy said he wouldn't road trip across Canada right now, he said beginning to plan travel again within the country ""makes sense.""

""I think it's very reasonable to explore interprovincial travel,"" Sharkawy said.

""Again, I wouldn't do it for the sake of doing it but if someone wanted to visit friends or family and its likely to bring them a great deal of comfort and satisfaction then I think the benefit of that outweighs the theoretical risk of acquiring COVID-19.""",[]

To celebrate a decade of operations, the space agency released some incredible time-lapse footage of its solar mission.

Since 2010, the SDO has collected 425 million high-resolution images of the sun, amassing 20 million gigabytes of data. Using a variety of instruments, it was able to capture new images of the sun every 0.75 seconds for 10 years. Those images were spliced together to create the time-lapse video shown below.

A decade of sun activity was condensed into the 61-minute video which features notable events, like transiting planets and solar eruptions. The SDO was launched in February 2010 to help researchers understand the sun’s influence on Earth by studying the solar atmosphere.

While the SDO has been determined to capture every moment of the sun, there were a few instances where that wasn’t possible. The dark frames that appear in the video are caused by the Earth or moon eclipsing as they pass between the spacecraft and the sun. A temporary issue with one of the atmospheric imaging instruments led to a longer blackout in 2016.

The SDO will continue to watch the sun in the years to come and provide more insights about the sun’s effect on life on Earth.",[]

Statistics Canada's labour force survey released Friday showed 953,000 jobs were added last month, including 488,000 full-time and 465,000 part-time positions. The unemployment rate fell to 12.3 per cent after hitting a record-high of 13.7 per cent in May.

As in May, even though more people found jobs, more people also looked for work as the labour force grew by about 786,000 after a gain of 491,000 in May, bringing it to within 443,000 of its pre-pandemic level.

Statistics Canada said the unemployment rate would have been 16.3 per cent had it included in unemployment counts those who wanted to work, but did not look for a job.

Job gains were made in every province, including by 378,000 in Ontario, marking the first increase since the COVID-19 shutdown, Statistics Canada said. It didn't include any gains in Toronto as restrictions in that city loosened after the survey week.

Despite the good news, economist Jim Stanford said there remains a historic crisis in the job market with high unemployment and hundreds of thousands who have left the labour force altogether.

Also, gains nationally were not shared equally among groups, with women, youth and low-wage workers still slower to rebound, which Stanford said could be problematic if those jobs don't ever come back.

""I worry about a coming second round of layoffs motivated not by health restrictions, but by companies deciding their businesses are going to be permanently smaller. So that would be qualitatively different and in a way worse,"" said Stanford, director of the Centre for Future Work in Vancouver.

""We aren't remotely out of the woods yet, but this was a really encouraging step forward.""

Some three million jobs were lost over March and April due to the pandemic, and 2.5 million more had their hours and earnings slashed. By last month, some 3.1 million were affected by the pandemic, including 1.4 million who weren't at work due to COVID-19.

Brendon Bernard, an economist at Indeed Canada, said recapturing jobs at the same pace in the coming months will be tougher.

""A lot of areas of the economy still aren't running at full capacity,"" Bernard said. ""So while doors may be open and customers might be coming in, business hasn't come back to normal.""

Despite the overall improvement, the oil and gas industry continues to struggle.

The PetroLMI Division of Energy Safety Canada says direct oil and gas employment fell by more than 6,700 positions in June compared with May, with about 70 per cent of the net job losses in Alberta.

Compared with a year earlier, employment in the oil and employment sector was down 17 per cent.

The overall job losses were unprecedented in speed and depth compared with previous recessions, Statistics Canada said, and the rebound to date sharper than previous downturns.

Ottawa's response has been equally unprecedented: a deficit of at least $343.2 billion this fiscal year as the Trudeau Liberals dole out some $230 billion in emergency aid.

In June, 28.3 per cent of Canadians aged 15 to 69 reported receiving some form of federal aid since mid-March, Statistics Canada said. Meanwhile, the proportion of households reporting difficulty paying the bills dropped to 20.1 per cent in June from 22.5 per cent in May.

""Without the federal government being there to support Canadian workers, Canadian businesses and the Canadian provinces and territories, we would be in a bigger mess in this country right now,"" Hassan Yussuff, president of the Canadian Labour Congress said in an interview this week.

The Bank of Canada and federal government believe the worst of the economic pain from the pandemic is behind the country, but Canada will face high unemployment and low growth until 2021.

In a statement, federal Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough touted the overall jobs numbers as a sign the government's plan was working, before adding many Canadians still ""face real challenges during this time.""

She and other ministers are now reshaping programs so fewer workers stay on the $80-billion emergency benefit, and more get tied to jobs through the $82-billion wage subsidy program.

""We understand the need for those emergency programs. We also understand as we reopen and recover, we have to move away from emergency programs and into stimulus and recovery,"" said Leah Nord, senior director of workforce strategies for the Canadian Chamber of Commerce.

She said there are other issues to resolve around health and safety in the workplace, transit, and child care to help more Canadians get back to work.

In provinces where daycares reopened for children five and under, employment levels returned to pre-pandemic levels for fathers in June, but not for mothers. Similarly, mothers with children under 18 were more likely than fathers to work less than half their usual hours in June, Statistics Canada said.

Job gains have come at a faster clip for men. Their unemployment rate hit 12.1 per cent in June compared to 12.7 per cent for women. And the underutilization rate -- which counts those who are unemployed, those who want a job but didn't look for one, and those working less than half their usual hours -- was 28.3 for women and 25.5 per cent for men.

Economist Armine Yalnizyan said the numbers underscore the need to provide child care as well as options for schooling in the fall so mothers can work.

The alternative, she said, could pull back any economic gains.

""It means that even if there are jobs, some women won't be able to take them because there's no way they can leave their kids,"" said Yalnizyan, a fellow on the future of workers at the Atkinson Foundation.

""So we are looking at the potential for an economic depression instead of talking about paces of recovery and pivoting to building to better.""

I feel so sad for people who have lost their lives to this horrible disease, people who lost their job, small business owners who have had to close up shop, for those who have had their life savings evaporate and -- when it comes down to it -- anyone who has been impacted in any way.

When the fiscal update highlighted our deficit would run north of $343 billion I didn't panic. I know for now as a country we can afford it. This low interest rate environment helps, the Bank of Canada buying up bonds to provide liquidity helps and Canada continues to fare better than other countries around the globe.

My focus is always on the average Canadian trying to make ends meet and especially those who may have been struggling before the pandemic struck.

Canadians can't take on more debt. They are tapped out. The government can and did and as the PM said, ""we took on debt so Canadians didn't have to"". In my opinion that was a good thing to do. We don't have a playbook when it comes to shutting down the whole economy. In past recessions the money may have stopped but the people didn't.

The challenge is, we aren't through the pandemic and I fear more jobs losses are on the horizon. From a financial perspective, what I worry about most are jobs. As the CERB comes into question come the fall, families will be faced with harsh reality their lives have changed and like any challenging period of time some will be impacted more than others. Some companies will make it and some won't. Some families will rally and others won't.

However, the June jobs report showed a hint of encouragement with almost 1 million jobs created leading me to maybe just maybe believe we could see the ""V"" shaped economy that so many are hoping for. And while the job number surprised to the upside after 3 million jobs were lost in March and April it is still a little too soon to declare a roaring victory. There are 1 3/4 million people still unemployed. Yet, other signs of improvement point to recovery. Areas such as the real estate market in terms of sales and housing starts while vehicle sales exploded higher as well.

The analogy I will use: The patient who has a heart attack, or in this the case the economy that stopped in a heartbeat, is starting to shows signs of stabilizing. But that isn't enough. Like the patient, the economy needs a long-term recovery plan to ensure good health is sustainable.

I'm looking for long-term growth plans to get people back working. Some of the jobs losses will never come back. In my perfect world we would see money going toward new initiatives with new jobs created, supported with training, so families and business can begin to plan again.

In the meantime, I tend to confront the brutal facts while remaining cautiously optimistic we will get through this.

350,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/businesses-including-apple-and-general-motors-ask-trump-to-keep-daca-in-place-1.5020709,Businesses including Apple and General Motors ask Trump to keep DACA in place,['Shannon Liao'],2020-07-11 19:42:00-04:00,"A group of top business leaders asked U.S. President Donald Trump in a letter on Saturday to keep a program that protects nearly 800,000 young immigrants from deportation, stating that the economic recovery from the pandemic could be hurt if it is rescinded.

The letter arguing in support of the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program was sent by the Coalition for the American Dream, and was signed by more than 100 corporations including Apple, Hilton Worldwide, General Motors, Starbucks, Google and Amazon.

""This is no time to disrupt the economic recovery of our companies and communities, nor time to jeopardize the health and safety of these vulnerable individuals,"" the letter says. ""We ask that you leave DACA in place and refrain from taking any additional administrative actions that would negatively impact the DACA program.""

IBM, one of the signatories to the letter, explained to CNN Business in a statement why it signed the letter.

""Dreamers make invaluable contributions to companies and communities across this country,"" said Christopher A. Padilla, IBM's vice president for government and regulatory affairs. ""There is no benefit to subjecting these young men and women to more unilateral action and lengthy court fights.""

The Supreme Court blocked the Trump Administration's attempt to end DACA on June 18, ruling 5-to-4 on procedural grounds that the administration failed to provide an adequate reason for ending the program. Administration officials said they will try to terminate it again.

In his opinion, Roberts didn't question whether the Trump administration had the authority to end the program, only that it had failed to follow proper procedures. ""We do not decide whether DACA or its rescission are sound policies,"" Roberts wrote. ""'The wisdom of those decisions is none of our concern. We address only whether the agency complied with the procedural requirement that it provide a reasoned explanation for its action,"" Roberts wrote.

Trump immediately floated that he would issue a new memo to end DACA, following the court's guidelines, that would once again put the Dreamers in legal limbo.

In an interview with Telemundo Friday, Trump said he still plans to rescind the policy. ""DACA is going to be just fine. We're putting it in,"" Trump told the Spanish-language network. ""I'm gonna do a big executive order, I have the power to do it as president and I'm going to make DACA a part of it.""

He added, ""But we put it in and then we're probably going to be then taking it out. We're working out the legal complexities right now, but I'm going to be signing a very major immigration bill as an executive order, which the Supreme Court now, because of the DACA decision, has given me the power to do that.""

Trump said that one aspect of the executive order would include ""a road to citizenship.""

After Trump's interview, White House Deputy Press Secretary Judd Deere attempted to clarify the President's remarks.

""As the President announced today, he is working on an executive order to establish a merit-based immigration system to further protect US workers,"" Deere said on Friday. ""Furthermore, the President has long said he is willing to work with Congress on a negotiated legislative solution to DACA, one that could include citizenship, along with strong border security and permanent merit-based reforms. This does not include amnesty.""

When reached for comment Saturday, the White House referred CNN Business to Deere's prior statement.

In an interview on ""Fox and Friends"" Saturday morning, Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said the President was talking about two separate things.

The first, he said, is an executive order that would establish a ""merit-based immigration system.""

One of the members of the Coalition for the American Dream, Todd Schulte, president of FWD, a bipartisan advocacy organization founded by business leaders, told CNN Business his view of Trump's remarks.

""Either he's getting rid of DACA, in which case he's doing everything he can to subject dreamers to deportation, or he can keep DACA,"" Schulte added, ""It's very straightforward. There's no 'I'm helping DACA recipients by getting rid of DACA.' That's like Orwellian nonsense.""",[]
351,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/tsx-ends-week-higher-on-positive-sentiment-from-potential-virus-treatment-1.5018595,TSX ends week higher on positive sentiment from potential virus treatment,['Ross Marowits'],2020-07-10 02:25:00-04:00,"TORONTO -- Canada's main stock index ended higher for a second-straight week on positive sentiment from a potential COVID-19 treatment and strong domestic jobs numbers.

The S&P/TSX composite index closed up 145.18 points at 15,713.82 for a gain of 117 points over the week.

Despite surging infections in parts of the U.S., hopeful news came from Gilean Sciences that its treatment remdesivir helped reduce the risk of mortality in patients.

And Canada's unemployment rate fell in June, following a similar move in the U.S., as 952,900 jobs were added amid some economic reopenings.

""It's just a day filled with a little bit of positive news and for now the glass -- at least today, anyway -- is half full,"" said Allan Small, senior investment adviser at HollisWealth.

The market recovery has largely been spurred by the tech sector, which has been helped by people working from home and shopping online. But Friday's boost in sentiment helped the banking and energy, he said.

In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 369.21 points at 25,075.30. The S&P 500 index was up 32.99 points at 3,185.04, while the Nasdaq composite was up 69.69 points to another record close of 10,617.44 and intraday record high of 10,622.35.

Nine of the 11 major sectors on the TSX were up, led by energy, health care and financials.

Energy gained 3.3 per cent on higher crude oil and natural gas prices.

The August crude contract was up 93 cents at US$40.55 per barrel and the August natural gas contract was up 2.6 cents at nearly US$1.81 per mmBTU.

Crude rose after the International Energy Agency boosted its 2020 demand forecast. That helped Canadian energy companies such as Enerplus Corp. and Vermilion Energy Inc. whose shares were up 8.9 and eight per cent respectively.

Canopy Growth Corp. climbed 8.1 per cent to propel the health care sector while shares of several Canadian banks rose in lockstep with gains in the U.S. banking sector. Laurentian Bank gained three per cent, the Bank of Montreal increased 2.7 per cent and the Bank of Nova Scotia rose 2.6 per cent.

Technology fell with Lightspeed POS Inc. and Blackberry Ltd. down three and 1.8 per cent respectively.

Materials dipped despite gains by forestry companies as gold prices slipped, but remained above US$1,800 an ounce and higher for a fifth-straight week.

While some analysts believe gold is appreciating over fears of inflation and as a result of massive monetary and fiscal stimulus, Small is less hopeful about the precious metal.

""When fear is removed or at least when we do get some sort of vaccine in the fall hopefully, I would not be surprised to see gold, that fear premium come out of it.""

The Canadian dollar traded for 73.56 cents US compared with 73.77 cents US on Thursday.

North American stock markets have rallied sharply from March lows but need some sort of catalyst to get to ""the next level"" and regain all-time highs, said Small.

""I actually think we will show positive numbers on the indices by the end of the year. I'm not giving up on this year. I still think investors can make money.""",[]
352,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/amazon-says-email-to-employees-banning-tiktok-was-a-mistake-1.5019320,Amazon says email to employees banning TikTok was a mistake,['Tali Arbel'],2020-07-10 14:11:00-04:00,"Roughly five hours after an internal email went out to employees telling them to delete the popular video app TikTok from their phones, Amazon appeared to backtrack, calling the ban a mistake.

“This morning's email to some of our employees was sent in error. There is no change to our policies right now with regard to TikTok,” Amazon emailed reporters just before 5 p.m. Eastern time. Spokeswoman Jaci Anderson declined to answer questions about what happened.

The initial internal email, which was disseminated widely online, told employees to delete TikTok, a video app increasingly popular with young people but also the focus of intensifying national-security and geopolitical concerns because of its Chinese ownership. The email cited “security risks” of the app.

An Amazon employee who confirmed receipt of the initial email but was not authorized to speak publicly had not seen a retraction at the time of Amazon's backtrack.

Amazon is the second-largest U.S. private employer after Walmart, with with more than 840,000 employees worldwide, and moving against TikTok would have escalated pressure on the app. It is banned on employee phones by the U.S. military and the company is subject to a national-security review of its merger history. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said this week that the government was “certainly looking” at banning the app.

Chinese internet giant ByteDance owns TikTok, which is designed for users outside of China; it also makes a Chinese version called Douyin. Like YouTube, TikTok relies on its users for the videos that populate its app. It has a reputation for fun, goofy videos and is popular with young people, including millions of American users. But it has racked up concerns such as censorship of videos, including those critical of the Chinese government; the threat of sharing user data with Chinese officials; and violating kids' privacy.

TikTok said earlier in the day that Amazon did not notify it before sending the initial email around midday Eastern. That email read, “The TikTok app is no longer permitted on mobile devices that access Amazon email.” To retain mobile access to company email, employees had to delete the TikTok app by the end of the day.

“We still do not understand their concerns,” TikTok said at the time, adding that the company would welcome a dialogue to address Amazon's issues. A spokeswoman did not immediately reply to a request for comment Friday evening.

TikTok has been trying to appease critics in the U.S. and distance itself from its Chinese roots, but finds itself caught in an increasingly sticky geopolitical web.

It recently named a new CEO, former Disney executive Kevin Mayer, which experts said could help it navigate U.S. regulators. And it is stopping operations in Hong Kong because of a new Chinese national security law that led Facebook, Google and Twitter to also stop providing user data to Hong Kong authorities.

Pompeo said the government remained concerned about TikTok and referred to the administration's crackdown on Chinese telecom firms Huawei and ZTE. The government has tried to convince allies to root Huawei out of telecom networks, saying the company is a national-security threat, with mixed success; Trump has also said he was willing to use Huawei as a bargaining chip in trade talks. Huawei has denied that it enables spying for the Chinese government.

“With respect to Chinese apps on people's cellphones, I can assure you the United States will get this one right too,” Pompeo said, and added that if users downloaded the app their private information would be “in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party.”

A U.S. national-security agency has been reviewing ByteDance's purchase of TikTok's precursor, Musical.ly. Meanwhile, privacy groups say TikTok has been violating children's privacy, even after the Federal Trade Commission fined the company in 2019 for collecting personal information from children without their parents' consent.

Amazon may have been concerned about a Chinese-owned app's access to employee data, said Susan Ariel Aaronson, a professor at George Washington University and a data governance and national-security expert. China, according to the U.S. government, regularly steals U.S. intellectual property.

Part of Amazon's motivation with the ban, now apparently reversed, may also have been political, Aaronson said, since Amazon “doesn't want to alienate the Trump administration.”

Amazon and its founder, Jeff Bezos, are frequent targets of President Donald Trump. Bezos personally owns The Washington Post, which Trump has referred to as “fake news” whenever it publishes unfavourable stories about him. Last year, Amazon sued the U.S. government, saying that Trump's “personal vendetta” against Amazon, Bezos and the Post, led it to lose a $10 billion cloud computing contract with the Pentagon to rival Microsoft. Meanwhile, federal regulators as well as Congress are pursuing antitrust investigations at Amazon as well as other tech giants.

TikTok has content-moderation policies, like any social network, but says its moderation team for the U.S. is led out of California and it doesn't censor videos based on topics sensitive to China and would not, even if the Chinese government asked it to. As for sharing U.S. user data with the Chinese government, the company says it stores U.S. user data in the U.S. and Singapore, not China; that its data centres are outside of China; and it would not give the government access to U.S. user data even if asked.

Concerns about China are not limited to the U.S. India this month banned dozens of Chinese apps, including TikTok, because of tensions between the countries. India cited privacy concerns that threatened India's sovereignty and security for the ban. India is one of TikTok's largest markets and had previously briefly banned the app in 2019 because of worries about children and sexual content.

The Chinese retailer released a statement on Friday explaining that the jewelry was designed after the Buddhist swastika, and not the design used in Nazi symbolism.

“We listed a Buddhist swastika necklace for sale. There’s simply no excuse for our lack of sensitivity in doing so,” the statement released on Twitter read in part.

The company says the necklace has since been removed.

“We made a gigantic mistake by selling a product that’s hurtful and offensive to many of you and we’re so, so sorry,” the company said.

“The only thing we can do is profusely apologize and reassure you that we’re making major internal changes so this does not happen again,” Shein said in the statement. “But please believe that we in no way support or condone racial, cultural and religious prejudice or hatred. We love all of you and hope you will stay with us.”

A user on Instagram under the name “hereforthetea2” first pointed out the necklace on social media because of the retailer’s popularity amongst the YouTube community.

“Shein, a company that’s become popular for YouTube ‘try on hauls,’ appears to be selling swastika necklaces?!!! I am disgusted,” the user said in a post.

One fashion influencer on Instagram claims she reached out to the brand after seeing the necklace on their website and says the company has failed to be “sensitive” to other cultures and religions.

“Their lack of clear and concise labeling makes this not only an issue of appropriation, but also highlights their lack of cultural and religious sensitivity,” Nabela Noor said on Instagram.

According to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the swastika is believed to have been first used in Eurasia 7,000 years ago to represent the sun, and symbolized good luck and success. Today, both the left and right-facing swastika is used in Buddhism and Hinduism to represents the same meaning.

The Nazi party appropriated the swastika in 1920 to serve as a symbol of “Aryan identity” and nationalist pride, the museum states.

This isn’t the first time the company has come under fire for its choice in products.

Just a week ago the retailer was under scrutiny for selling “fringe trim carpets,” which one Instagram user said resembled a Muslim prayer mat.

Khadija Rizvi described the item as “highly offensive” to the Muslim community.

“This is highly offensive, not only is it disrespectful but they once again renamed and stole credit from a whole faith this time, by failing to label it as a Muslim prayer mat; which allows people to use it casually as a decorative mat,” the user wrote in an Instagram post.

The same user pointed out on Friday that the company had a necklace set with a pendant that had the Arabic word for “Allah,” meaning God.

“After the Swastika necklace yesterday, there will definitely be more that we find. We initially accepted your apology and looked to the future positively, however the commitment to change has not been upheld. I suggest you pull down your site until you thoroughly check all your items, to avoid mocking cultures and religions further,” Rizvi said in a separate Instagram post.

While the company did not directly acknowledge the “Allah” necklace, in their statement they said they have established a committee to review products before they go on sale and promised to cease the sale of all religious items.",[]

Despite these gains, at least 400,000 people who were previously employed in the foodservice sector are still out of work.

Restaurants Canada, a national non-profit association representing Canada’s diverse foodservice industry is calling on the federal government to make changes to the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy program (CEWS) to aid businesses in their effort to rehire workers as they continue to recover.

The program was implemented at the height of the pandemic to help businesses subsidize their employee’s wages for up to 12 weeks, initially. Restaurants Canada is urging the government to keep the subsidy available for as long as pandemic restrictions are in place and to gradually reduce the subsidy as businesses achieve manageable levels of revenue.

To qualify, businesses must have experienced a 30-per-cent decline in revenue. The association is asking the government to scale the 30-per-cent threshold to support restaurants in their recovery.

“Reforms to the federal wage subsidy are urgently needed to help foodservice businesses bring more Canadians back to work amid ongoing restrictions,” said David Lefebvre, Restaurants Canada Vice President, Federal and Quebec in a press release. “Forty-four per cent of restaurant operators who responded to our latest survey said they did not apply for the subsidy for at least one of their establishments because it would not meet the requirements.”

In May, Finance Minister Bill Morneau announced that the federal government would extend the CEWS by an additional 12 weeks until the end of August.

When asked about any future changes, the minister’s office pointed to the Economic and Fiscal Snapshot released on Wednesday, which states: “As economies reopen and business activity resumes, the government will soon announces changes to the CEWS to stimulate rehiring, provide support to businesses during reopening and help them adapt to the new normal. In anticipation of this forthcoming announcement, the government has set aside additional funding as part of the 2020 Economic and Fiscal Snapshot.”

The complaint filed Wednesday alleges the companies adopted polices that violate a section of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which protects individuals from racial discrimination by recipients of federal financial assistance.

Tyson has received more than US$109 million from USDA programs this year and JBS more than $45 million, the complaint said. As recipients of federal taxpayer dollars they are required to comply with federal laws.

""When they took that money, they knew at that point that they would be held accountable to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, but they continued to violate that act,"" said Joe Henry, director of Forward Latino, one of the groups filing the complaint. Others include the Food Chain Workers Alliance, HEAL Food Alliance, American Friends Service Committee of Iowa and the Idaho Organization of Resource Councils.

Coronavirus infections were first reported in meatpacking plants in March and since then at least 32,151 COVID-19 cases have been confirmed among workers in 291 plants and at least 122 meatpacking workers have died, the complaint said.

A CDC report released Tuesday found 87 per cent of those coronavirus cases occurred among racial and ethnic minorities even though they make up 61 per cent of the worker population.

After the outbreaks were uncovered, meatpacking plants began providing workers with face coverings, installed shields between work stations and implemented new procedures for distancing during breaks, but they declined to adopt other U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations for keeping people at least 6 feet apart. The companies also declined to initiate slower speeds on production lines or add shifts to enable social distancing, the complaint said.

The complaint alleges the operating procedures have a disparate impact on Black, Latino, and Asian workers, who make up a large share of production workers at the companies' plants, representing a pattern or practice of racial discrimination.

Tyson spokesman Worth Sparkman said in an email that the company was still reviewing the complaint and noted that the company's top priority is the health and safety of all workers, their families and the communities where plants are located.

""We've transformed the way our plants operate to protect our team members, implementing measures such as symptom screening before every shift,"" he said.

JBS did not immediately reply to messages and a USDA spokesman declined to comment.

The complaint goes to the USDA through an administrative procedure and it will be up to Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue to decide how it's resolved. The procedure could result in an agreement between the worker groups, the USDA and the companies or it could take years to get to a final resolution if there's no agreement, said Dave O'Brien, a civil rights attorney in Cedar Rapids who handled such complaints in the Obama administration's Labor Department.

The complaint filed on Wednesday asks the Civil Rights Division of the USDA to investigate and remedy the discrimination and for the agency to suspended or terminate funding to the companies if they do not comply with federal laws.",[]

The Calgary brewery released its first sour beer this month as a celebration of 'Karen', the internet-coined name given to the stereotypical entitled, privileged white woman. The brewery's social media promotion of the beer used phrases that included 'Can we speak to a manager?' and the depiction on the label was of a fair-skinned woman with the crown of the Common Crown Brewing logo resting on her head.

The misguided attempt to be humorous drew swift criticism on social media as the name appeared to exonerate the actions of a select group who have stood in opposition to the Black Lives Matter movement.

On Friday, Common Crown announced its decision to remove the beer from store shelves and issued the following apology:

We wish to thank those who reached out and brought to our attention the error we have made in our recent release. We realize that our intent of the Karen label is insignificant at this juncture. Unfortunately, The Karen Cherry Sour missed the mark, and we promise to do better. Being tone deaf to racial developments is not an excuse, and we will work harder to stay informed and up to date on escalating situations. Thank you to those who sought to educate and inform us, and help us to recognize our error. We read through all of your comments and messages as a team. Moving forward, we will be working to do better, educate ourselves and collaborate with communities who support inclusion and diversity.

The Karen Cherry Sour has been pulled from shelves and is no longer available for sale. While this is just a small step in understanding our wrong, we are committed to moving forward and doing better.

Thank you.

CTV News reached out to the owner of Common Crown Brewing Co., Damon Moreau, for comment on the situation and he said the decision on the product name was made as a result of a team effort and the entire team apologizes for the mistake.

""We recognize the issue and the error,"" he said.

A majority of the product line was pre-sold and scheduled for delivery Friday, but Moreau says that's no longer happening. He says he's spoken with the company's licence holders that would have received the shipments and they have expressed their understanding of the situation.",[]

The data is from a team of researchers from McMaster University and the University of Windsor, with the help of the Sudbury Workers Education and Advocacy Centre, United Steel Workers and Unifor. The group have been collecting surveys and conducting interviews in Sudbury and Windsor in the last two years to find out what work looks like if you are queer.

The findings will be shared July 15 at the Data+Queeries Event, part of Fierte Sudbury Pride’s QUEERantine digital Pride Festival celebrations.

""Sudbury and Windsor have proud labour histories and a strong sense of community tied to mining and manufacturing employment,"" said a news release Thursday from the Sudbury Workers Education and Advocacy Centre.

""These stories, however, often leave out the experiences of 2SLGBTQ+ workers. To gain insight into the work experiences of 2SLGBTQ+ people in Sudbury and Windsor, the research team collected 673 survey responses and conducted 50 in-depth interviews.""

Don't feel comfortable at work

The research shows that despite the many advances that have been made in terms of sexual and gender minority rights, most 2SLGBTQ+ workers don’t feel comfortable at work. Just more than half (50.6 per cent) of the 2SLGBTQ+ people surveyed were not fully out at work and two out of three people experienced some type of harassment or discrimination in their current job.

Those surveyed were also less likely to be working in well-paid jobs in mining or manufacturing, and more likely to be working in the low-wage service and/or the public sector.

""2SLGBTQ+ people’s decisions about what job to take or where to work were also shaped by fears about whether workplaces or industries would be accepting,"" the release said.

A substantial number of 2SLGBTQ+ workers also left workplaces that were not supportive. Reports of unsupportive workplaces were common in all sectors, with people working in male-dominated sectors or occupations least likely to feel supported at work.

""When workers did not feel comfortable and supported at work, they were also more likely to have poor mental health,"" the release said. ""Transgender and racialized workers in our sample faced even greater constraints and challenges in the labour market and workplace and transgender and bisexual participants had poorer mental health than lesbian and gay participants.""

The people behind the study hope the report will ""encourage employers and unions to engage in open, honest assessments of their workplace practices and cultures, undergo training and education about sexual and gender diversity, and put in place more diverse and inclusive workplace practices,"" the release said.",[]

The Montreal-based company announced Thursday that it is sending notices to terminate the leases at the 124 stores to take effect in 30 days. The move would affect about half of its workforce of nearly 2,500, including all 366 employees in the United States.

It will also seek more favourable lease terms for the remaining 100 stores in Canada and may permanently shut additional locations if landlords are unwilling to negotiate suitable leases.

It had warned in mid-June that it could begin a formal restructuring depending on the outcome of its talks with landlords.

The company said at the time that it hadn't paid rent on any of its stores for April, May and June.

The store closures are part of its restructuring plan after it obtained court protection from creditors under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act and Chapter 15 in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.

""With the upcoming closure of 124 unprofitable stores across North America, we are certainly making good progress in creating a stronger business model for the future and ensuring the long-term success and sustainability of DavidsTea and our beloved brand,"" company founder and interim CEO Herschel Segal said in a news release.

Chief financial officer Frank Zitella said that with the closure of ""a significant number of money-losing stores"" it will focus exclusively on e-commerce sale which had a penetration rate of close to 43 per cent in the market before COVID-19.

""All 100 remaining DavidsTea stores have been closed since March 17 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and will remain so until further notice,"" he stated.

DavidsTea last month reported that it lost $23.2 million last year on $146.5 million in revenues. That includes a US$4.3 million loss in its fiscal fourth quarter on US$54.8 million of revenues.

The move by DavidsTea comes three years after Starbucks announced the closure of all of its Teavana brand stores. The coffee giant acquired Teavana Holdings in 2012 for US$620 million.

But there was another item that was quietly being stockpiled in Canadian households: $50 bank notes.

Because of this run on $50s, the Bank of Canada confirmed to BNN Bloomberg that there is a shortage of notes in that denomination at some Canadian bank branches.

A recent staff discussion paper examining the impact of COVID-19 on demand for cash describes how in early March the central bank “became concerned that the bank note supply channel could become compromised during the pandemic.” It increased its note reserves across the Bank Note Distribution System (BNDS), which through its 10 regional centres provide cash to financial institutions across the country.

The Bank of Canada dipped into its own reserves to fill BNDS inventory from 60 per cent capacity to 90 per cent at the onset of the pandemic. By late April, that capacity was down to 70 per cent. The central bank's analysis shows that net note withdrawals from financial institutions in March and April were among the largest since 1998, in terms of frequency, absolute amounts and percentage compared with previous years.

There were several drivers of this increased demand for polymer bills and requests from consumers were one of the most significant. Other factors include financial institutions bulking up inventory to guard against cash delivery disruptions, as well as drawing more from the Bank of Canada to make up for a decrease in cash deposits from retailers affected by lockdown restrictions.

The Canadian Bankers Association declined to comment on the rush on $50s, choosing instead to direct BNN Bloomberg to the Bank of Canada. Representatives for Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank and Bank of Nova Scotia also referred BNN Bloomberg to the central bank when asked how the situation is affecting their clients. Spokespeople for Bank of Montreal and CIBC did not comment for the purposes of this story.

According to the Bank of Canada’s data, withdrawals were concentrated in major cities: Toronto, Montreal, Calgary and Vancouver. A relatively small number (seven per cent) of Canadians reported difficulties accessing cash during the pandemic, according to the central bank’s 2020 Cash Alternative Survey. The mean withdrawal value from an automated banking machine in 2020 was $195, compared with $140 in 2017.

The reason for pulling out cash wasn’t necessarily to spend it. Most Canadians reported decreasing their cash use and 12 per cent said that a merchant refused to accept cash in a transaction.

During the lockdown, Metro grocery stores in Ontario and Quebec, Loblaws and Tim Hortons encouraged customers to use contactless payments but stopped short of refusing cash. Meanwhile, cashiers at Longos, Best Buy, Indigo and The Shoe Company refused cash citing safety concerns.

“During the early days of the pandemic, there was so much unknown and an unprecedented amount of fear and uncertainty not just in the economy but the world that people reacted like it was a zombie apocalypse,” said Melissa Leong, author of Happy Go Money. “There was distrust of everything including institutions and that resulted in behaviour such as hoarding cash which is a tangible symbol of safety and security.”

In the U.S., the coronavirus crisis caused a nationwide coin shortage, raising concerns about the availability of pennies, nickels, dimes and quarters. The Federal Reserve issued a statement on June 11 saying that “the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted the supply chain and normal circulation patterns for U.S. coin.” It goes on to say that in the past few months, coin deposits to the Fed have “declined significantly” as the Mint’s production of coin decreased “due to measures put in place to protect its employees.”

In an email to BNN Bloomberg, Bank of Canada spokesperson Amélie Ferron-Craig described the $50 note shortage as “temporary.” She said new notes will be produced as part of “regular stock replenishment” which is expected by the end of the summer.",[]
363,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/pattie-lovett-reid-why-not-all-seniors-are-cheering-government-aid-1.5013719,Pattie Lovett-Reid: Why not all seniors are cheering government aid,[],2020-07-08 08:03:00-04:00,"TORONTO -- Not all seniors are cheering when it comes to government aid.

On the one hand the government is helping high-risk Canadians get through a tough financial situation. Government benefits are seen by many as the financial lifeline they needed as jobs were lost, income reduced and financial futures were put on shaky ground due to the pandemic.

On the other hand the government will be taking back some of the financial lifeline it provided. The government benefits such as the CERB will be taxed and is considered to be income. Some aren't thinking about this today but it will become a issue when 2020 taxes are filed.

Others such as seniors who currently qualify for the Guaranteed Income Supplement are worried government aid might actually compromise their lifestyle. This fear of struggling financially isn't new to seniors who are vulnerable and barely making ends meet. Especially those who collect the Guaranteed Income Supplement and maybe generate a little bit of income from a side hustle yet still manage to come in below threshold limits.

In 2020 seniors are eligible to receive GIS if they are: A single senior with a total annual income of less than $18,600. A couple both receiving Old Age Security and with a combined annual income of less than $24,576.

Fear is mounting among low-income seniors who are receiving government aid and who may also be living in subsidized housing that is income-tested. The government aid they receive via CERB may push them out of the eligibility requirements for relief on rent. If this happens they will be hit twice - potentially higher rent and taxation on the benefit. Add to this the concern the GIS could be clawed, which has some wondering if the government benefit will do more harm than good to their financial situation.

Now to be fair, not all government aid will be taxed. It doesn't apply to the one-time special payment seniors will be receiving this week. To add some context, there are currently 6.7 million seniors who are eligible for the OAS pension and 2.2 million who are eligible for the GIS.

Where it gets sticky is if you are a senior, low income and collecting the GIS, some will still qualify for the government program even if they have a side hustle that brings them in a little extra money. If they are no longer making that little bit of extra money due to COVID-19 they now qualify for the CERB. The problem is that it isn't tax-free money and given the amount it could be more than they were making and push their income higher. This may result in them earning too much to qualify for low-income housing.

As the government views financial aid and those most vulnerable, there is a reasonable expectation and case to be made for exemptions for some low-income seniors collecting GIS and who qualified for CERB So the question is: do they or don't take advantage of the government benefit?",[]

Here's why.,[],2020-06-24 14:03:00-04:00,"TORONTO -- When Erin O’Brien opened up her email last week, she was shocked to find a notice from the federal government informing her that she would not receive her Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) payment the following week.

The Ottawa mother said the email explained that she was receiving the smaller amount in June because she was given a $2,000 advance when she collected her first CERB payment in April.

“I didn’t realize that this was even going to happen,” she told CTVNews.ca during a telephone interview from her home in Ottawa on Wednesday. “I thought it would just be all in the end that they would fix things. Not halfway through.”

O’Brien is far from alone in her surprise at the sudden reduction in CERB payments this month.

Dozens of Canadians have written in to CTVNews.ca to share how they, too, received word from the government last week notifying them that they weren’t eligible for the full $2,000 in June because of the earlier advance.

Kimberly Drew said she will only be receiving $500 this month, instead of the $2,000 she was expecting because of the advance payment she collected in April.

“It was not explained well when the payment came out so it was a bit of a shock,” she said. “I am frustrated.”

WHY ARE THERE REDUCED PAYMENTS NOW?

According to one of the Service Canada emails a CERB claimant received and forwarded to CTVNews.ca, the extra $2,000 that some people collected at the beginning of the program was an “advance of four weeks of the CERB, which was issued in order to get money in your pocket as quickly as possible.”

“Because of this advance, you will not receive a payment when you complete your next report. This is equivalent to the first two-week period of the advance. Please continue completing reports. This shows that you are eligible for all weeks of the CERB, including the four weeks of the benefit covered by the advance payment,” the message continued.

The notice also informed claimants that CERB would be extended by another eight weeks with a maximum payable amount of $12,000 over 24 weeks, which equals $2,000 per month for 6 months.

Ashley Michnowski, the director of communications for Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough, explained that CERB was initially intended to be available for a total of 16 weeks to a maximum of $8,000 before the extension.

Because those Canadians who were eligible for Employment Insurance (EI) received an extra $2,000 when the CERB benefit began, they had reached their maximum payable amount in June.

“As a result, starting the week of June 8th, some people would have received their full $8,000 initial CERB entitlement for the first initial 16 weeks and will therefore not receive a regular CERB payment this month,” Qualtrough’s spokesperson said in a statement to CTVNews.ca on Wednesday.

The minister’s office said eligible CERB claimants will receive money again at the beginning of July at the start of the next pay period now that the benefit has been extended for an additional eight weeks.

“In order to ensure claimants receive the available funding through the extension of CERB, they should continue to complete their biweekly reports,” the statement said.

'CLEAR, CONCISE, AND CONSISTENT DIRECTION'

There was some initial confusion when the CERB benefit was first rolled out in April because some claimants received more money than others.

For example, some people who applied for both employment insurance (EI) and CERB received two payments, even though no one is eligible to receive payments from both programs simultaneously.

As another example, those who were already on EI may have also received more than the initial $2,000 CERB payment when they were switched over to the new program because of residual EI benefits they had already qualified for.

At the time, Qualtrough reassured Canadians the additional deposits were not mistakes and recipients would be contacted about next steps.

“The CRA and Service Canada are working together to ensure that these situations are reconciled and payments do not exceed the maximum amount allowed per individual of $8,000 over a 16-week period,” she said in early April.

“So it won't necessarily be a clawback situation. It might be, but you can’t apply for more than the $8,000.”

However, days earlier Treasury Board President Jean-Yves Duclos created some confusion when he said the double payments were paid retroactively for the four-week period dating back to March 15, the first day people could apply for CERB.

A spokesperson from Qualtrough’s office clarified later that week that individuals who received $4,000 collectively from both the EI and CERB program would be contacted.

Conservative employment critic MP Dan Albas said the confusion and panic some Canadians are experiencing now could have been avoided if they were told what the $2,000 advance was for when they first received it.

“We recognize that during a crisis things happen quickly, but it’s really up to the government to provide clear, concise, and consistent direction,” he told CTVNews.ca during a telephone interview on Wednesday.

Albas said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has had multiple opportunities during his daily press briefings to bring Canadians up to speed on this issue and to let those people who received extra payments know what is expected of them.

“That would have been the responsible thing to do because ultimately, leaders take responsibility for mistakes,” he said. “And unfortunately, people are now at the end of the month just before the rent comes due, are being told that they will have considerably less support than they were planning.”

NDP MP and employment critic Daniel Blaikie echoed those sentiments when he said that it is “inexcusable” the government hasn’t made more of an effort to provide them with proper notice. He said it would have been easy to put up a reminder about the upcoming reduced payments on the Service Canada website a month ago for people to see when they log in to file their biweekly reports to claim their benefits.

Blaikie also said that he doesn’t understand why the government is reclaiming that advance money now when they have extended the program by another eight weeks.

“There is no need to do this right now,” he said during a telephone interview with CTVNews.ca on Wednesday. “They’re [the government] going to collect the money one way or another eventually. Doing it in a way that gives Canadians as much lead time as possible benefits CERB recipients and I don't think it does any harm to the government.”

Seniors have been anxiously awaiting the up to $500 payment. Many have watched their retirement savings take a hit, and have been paying higher fees for grocery deliveries and medical prescriptions.

Any senior who is eligible for the Old Age Security (OAS) pension will receive a $300 payment, and an additional $200 is being sent to seniors eligible for the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS).

The federal government estimates there are currently 6.7 million seniors who are eligible for the OAS pension and 2.2 million who are eligible for the GIS. These payments are set to total $2.5 billion.

The payments are being made directly to anyone who is eligible, with no application needed.

In all, one-third of the labour force didn’t work or had reduced hours last month, according to figures released Friday.

The 16-week Canadian Emergency Relief Benefit has been in effect for two months, paying $2,000 a month to millions of eligible recipients hit by closures and downscaling of workplaces due to the coronavirus.

CTVNews.ca asked Canadians to share how they were using their CERB payments and got a flood of responses. Most said they were covering the basics -- housing, groceries, transportation and medicine.

For some, CERB cash doesn’t cover the rent, and for others, it is more than they made before COVID-19 shut down their workplaces.

Many said they are grateful for the help but want to get back to work.

And that’s what CERB is set up to do -- act as a temporary stop-gap for those immediately affected by pandemic closures and slowdowns, says Audra Bowlus, an economics professor at Western University in London, Ont.

It is a simple program aimed at getting money out quickly to those who need it. It doesn’t account for pre-pandemic incomes or regional cost of living, and isn’t designed to manage a long-term economic recovery.

“The hope is that those still connected to an employer will return to work and that those who were laid off will be rehired,” she said. That would cut the burden on government subsidy programs.

“As economists, the fear is the longer (pandemic closures) go on, the more people become unattached from their employers either because their employers don’t survive or they need a much smaller staff.”

WORRYING ABOUT WHAT’S NEXT

We heard from a restaurant manager in downtown Toronto who is trying to get by on half his previous income under the CERB program. He’s worried his savings will run out before restaurants can re-open.

A number of people who have lost their jobs said they worry that they won’t find another after CERB’s four payments come and go.

“Overall the CERB has been great,” said James Gaughan of Toronto, who was laid off from his job at a financial publication. He said the benefit has replaced his income, but “I do worry about what will happen to people if things aren't opening up to the point where we're able to go apply for jobs and go to interviews and we run out of installments.”

Some viewers said they are putting the money toward credit card debt and many said they were saving a portion for next year’s taxes. CERB income will be taxable for 2020.

We also heard from people who got multiple cheques from both employment insurance and CERB, and who have banked the money in anticipation of having to pay it back.

Jesse Nicholson, of Vernon, B.C., says the CERB doesn’t come close to his income as a car salesperson, but he’s grateful to have it. And deferring car payments for six months and still being covered by employee health benefits have helped, too.

“I have to say that the $2,000 from the government has really helped out,” he wrote. “I know it is obviously not ideal but I know a lot of people who make less than this by working 40 hours a week, so they are actually quite enjoying the time off with family and being able to not worry that their bills are being paid or not.”

Here’s a snapshot of how other Canadians have been using their CERB money.

DIRT BIKES

Melanie Wood’s CERB payments have been going to school supplies, and fun activities, including wooden birdhouses to paint, tie-dye kits and chalk to keep her two young children busy. The 29-year-old Georgetown, Ont. resident says she makes less than $2,000 a month at her job in a cookie factory, so the CERB is allowing her to pay off her credit card, buy groceries without worrying, and even to buy dirt bikes for her kids.

“I ride myself so I’ve known for a while I wanted to buy them their own but the extra money just hasn’t been there. Now they’re both finally learning to ride and I have the CERB benefit program to thank for that,” she wrote. “I am so grateful that I am home enjoying this time with my two children and not having to worry about my bills during this time.”

FLOWERS AND DONATIONS

Norah Gibbons of London, Ont., who was laid off from her job at a not-for-profit theatre, said she put $1,000 into savings after having already set enough aside for bills in March and April because she had been worried about losing her job as the coronavirus threat deepened.

With the rest, she’s ensuring she’s supporting local businesses, including a farmers co-op, restaurants, a flower shop and bookstore, and even paid her dog groomer and hairdresser for future services. Gibbons bought potted pansies and tulips from a local greenhouse for herself and several neighbours. She’s even managed to make small donations to a food bank, the Red Cross, and to a family whose wage earner is hospitalized due to COVID-19.

“In short I’m doing my best to support people who need help and receiving this money means that I can feed my child, pay my bills, stay safe at home, not be awake all night worrying about how to pay the bills at a very scary time,” she wrote.

STAYING OUT OF DEBT

Lindsay Amadori of Vaudreuil-Dorion, Que., says she feels lucky that she doesn’t live paycheque to paycheque, and that she was able to collect CERB almost immediately. She’s used it to pay her regular bills, including rent, car payment, utilities and insurance for life, home, car and critical illness.

“I know for a lot of people it’s not enough, but I live alone and I’ve been able to manage,” wrote Amadori, who is 38. “Because of CERB I haven’t increased my debt, which was my biggest concern going into this crisis. I work in the beauty industry and I know my future is going to be very difficult. Makes it a little easier knowing I don’t have a huge debt when I’m eventually allowed back at work.”

GROCERIES AND MEDICATION

Jacob Normann, who lives in North Vancouver, B.C., says the CERB has allowed him to continue paying rent for his basement apartment and to pay for the medications and groceries he needs to manage his celiac condition.

“I understand not everyone has had an easy time with the money or aren’t able to be qualified, and I truly hope they can receive the support they need to ASAP. I am very grateful to have been provided this benefit,” wrote Norman, who is a 26-year-old hairstylist.

“For some the CERB was a bonus, however, I had no other source of income after being laid off due to COVID-19, so this benefit really helped ease my anxiety and allowed me to look after myself.”

'A ROOF OVER MY CHILDREN’S HEADS'

“My CERB payment has kept a roof over my children’s heads,” wrote Breanna Chadburn of Summerland, B.C. But she fears she and her husband will have to dig into an RESP they have built for their education.

“It breaks my heart that I’m going to have to drain it just to feed us now.”

Chadburn was laid off from a dental clinic when the pandemic hit and she couldn’t continue her second job as a truck driver delivering fuel because she can’t afford the $1,500 a month for daycare for her two young girls. The couple didn’t qualify for a childcare subsidy due to their income, and won’t be “eligible for re-evaluation on my daycare subsidy for a long time.”

Her husband is working but has had his hours cut. Chadburn’s $2,000 CERB benefit just pays the mortgage. They are putting the childcare benefit they receive towards food and other expenses, including a car payment, but have cut discretionary spending where they can, including cellphone and TV packages.

NO CREDIT CARDS

Janice Fisher of Bolton, Ont., is a presenter with Scientists in School, which offers interactive science lessons for kids. She says she had more than 50 workshops scheduled when schools shut down.

“Scientists in School is a charity and as such, all presenters are independent contractors so we are not eligible for unemployment benefits,” Fisher wrote. “The CERB has been instrumental in helping us to pay the bills and provide food for our family of six. Without it we would have been maxing out credit cards by now. I am happy to pay whatever taxes are necessary on this money next year.”

LIVING ON PASTA

A 27-year-old single mother with rheumatoid arthritis, Heather Peden of Tottenham, Ont., says she can’t afford her medication and she feels the pain of not taking it, especially in her knees and hips.

“Pretty much my bones are those of an 80-plus-year-old. I manage because I’m used to it and have fairly high pain tolerance but like I said, some days are just so bad I want to cry every time I have to bend over and pick up my son,” she wrote in an email.

Peden, who is a registered veterinarian technician and also worked part-time at a restaurant, says she’s skipping bills, taking turns between two credit cards, and paying only most of her cellphone bill. She’s also left borrowing money from friends who are still working. After paying rent, utilities and covering what her baby needs, she has only about $200 left to buy gas and food.

“My baby has everything he needs and that’s what you got to do. I’ll live on pasta as long as I have to but hopefully this virus ends soon so daycares can open and I can return to work and get back on track.”

'ETERNALLY GRATEFUL'

Kimberly Drew, 42, is a single mother of two children and has lost her job as a childcare worker.

“The CERB benefit has allowed me to pay my bills and buy food and keep my head above water.

The $2,000 a month is approximately $200/300 less then I would normally make and has really helped alleviate stress for me,” said the resident of North Bay, Ont.

“As a single mom my income is the only income and I don’t want my girls to suffer. I’m keeping me afloat until my work resumes and I am eternally grateful for it.”

A ROOF AND FOOD

Katie Hiebert in Dawson Creek, B.C., says the CERB isn’t enough to cover her monthly rent and truck payment.

“Sadly, I’m not the only one in this situation,” she wrote. She shares custody of two children who are six and nine, so only works every other week when they aren’t with their father. She lives with her boyfriend, who is still working as a heavy-duty mechanic but he’s had his overtime hours cut.

Hiebert’s full-time job as a mutual fund and life insurance representative was permanently terminated in March after seven years. But she’s happy she landed a part-time serving job at a tap house in December to save up for a house and now works there about six days a month doing takeout and delivery.

Under CERB, she is now bringing in anywhere from $1,300 to $2,300 less a month.

“We still consider ourselves very fortunate as both our situations could be a lot worse and we feel for those whose lives and financial situations have been completely turned upside down,” Hiebert wrote in an email to CTVNews.ca.

“We still have a roof over our heads and food in our cupboards. Without my boyfriend, I would have no money for food, no money for my utility bills, etc. It would be a very scary situation.”

PAYS THE RENT

April Jeffrey in Kingston, Ont., says she’s had plenty of hardship in her life, including losing her husband seven years ago and attending to the health of her youngest child, who has Type 1 diabetes. Now she’s lost her income after being laid off from her job at a car company.

She doesn’t qualify for EI because she doesn’t have enough hours worked. CERB covers her rent, she uses her childcare benefit to pay for groceries and health-care expenses, and she’s deferred or lowered the payments on some other bills.

“I will tell you that the day I was laid off, I came home and I cried. I didn’t know what I was going to do.”

Jeffrey is still worried but tries to concentrate on the positive.

“For the government to act as fast as they did and do what they’ve done so quickly, to me, that’s amazing,” she said, praising the response of both the federal and Ontario governments.

'A LIFELINE'

Brandi Wein, who owns a hair salon in Greater Victoria, B.C., says CERB has allowed her household, which includes her husband, children and her mother, to meet its needs. She is avoiding deferring any bill or mortgage payments and is planning for a slow recovery for her business once it’s allowed to reopen.

“The CERB was like a lifeline. I could still maintain a household, home school, keep my business needs met, shop for my family members, and keep it all together,” she wrote. Wein points out that she’s never before qualified for government support programs, including EI and maternity leave. She said she feels fortunate in this time of crisis.

“I thank the government for providing me with the option of even collecting this CERB. It helps a lot. And in turn, I’m okay with putting that money back into the economy by way of groceries, gas, small businesses I frequent because I feel like I can get by.”

'COMFORT IN THE MIDST OF CHAOS'

“CERB has been so helpful to my household,” wrote Jodelle Dixon of Toronto, who said the relief has brought “comfort in the midst of chaos.”

She and her partner, who are expecting their first child in July, are both able to work from home but their incomes have been reduced. Dixon, an education director for a learning institution, has recovered from having COVID-19 and her mother, a frontline worker, also contracted the virus but has recovered.

“In ways where we fell short for our bills and needs, CERB enabled us to stay afloat and offered the much needed support to our family in what may have been our greatest time of need,” Dixon said in an email to CTVNews.ca.

DIGGING INTO SAVINGS

Alessandro Milite of Edmonton says he and his girlfriend have managed to get by thanks to CERB and some savings. Both expect to return to work, he in a family furniture business and she at a nail salon.

“If I didn’t have the savings, CERB wouldn’t be enough for rent, the car, our cellphones and insurance,” Milite said in a phone interview with CTVNews.ca.

“Just to rely on CERB, we wouldn’t make it but it’s better than nothing. So I’m glad the government stepped up with this. Without it, we would be in a very big mess.”

‘$50 A DAY’

For Julia Wolst, CERB is a long way from a “windfall.” She paid hydro and internet so that her kids could do their schoolwork. It went to housing and basic groceries and “the monthly premium on my meagre life insurance policy, in case something happens to me and I am not here to look after my kids.”

It’s less than she makes full-time at her $18-an-hour job, she said.

“I would rather be working and not trying to squeeze our life out of about $50 per day, after tax. I would rather that my kids, who are students and unable to work right now or get CERB and thus unable to contribute to their own expenses, could go back to work,” she wrote.

“How did I spend the CERB? I kept us alive and off the street. Isn’t that the point of it?”",[]

Ritu Tenaja, owner of the Cottage Canoe Restaurant and Bar saw a steady flow of customers all day.

""Rain or shine, you know people are really looking forward to the experience of sitting and being served.""

Flying Monkeys Craft Brewery was busier than they expected to be on a wet day, and over the last month.

""I think people have been cooped up for so long they are just dying to get out, it doesn't matter, so it's been nice. It's been a nice change of pace,"" said manager Ryan Perry.

But Queens Hometown Pub manager Chris Gerrard found rain does put a damper on business.

""Last night when it rained, we had to close two hours earlier than expected, and there is a lot of people running for cover when it rains, but they can't go inside,"" he said.

Cottage Canoe set up a make-shift patio in their parking lot four weeks ago. Without it, Tenaja says the business wouldn't have survived.

""We're still losing money. I don't think there's a lot of restaurants that are making money through this environment...four tables does not account for a full dining room. ""

Tenaja says her staff are on the edge of their seats, waiting for permission to reopen the dining room.

""We go from losing money, to starting to break even as soon as Mr Ford says 'come on in!'. ""

For many Canadians, a cottage by the lake is a dream that more people are trying to make a reality.

""We have had record sales,"" said realtor Catharine Inniss, Johnston and Daniel Rushbrooke Realty.

In June 2019, 161 cottages were sold in the District of Muskoka while last month, 278 were sold, which is an increase of 73 per cent year over year.

Jodi Kovitz lives in a condo in downtown Toronto with her daughter and said she's on the hunt for a Muskoka cottage.

""We're doing great. We're healthy, and we live in 11-hundred square feet, and we haven't really left it for four months,"" Kovitz said she's looking to find her dream cottage.

It's a trend taking shape across the world.

A recent article in the Wall Street Journal reported 39 per cent of urban dwellers in the United States are thinking about moving somewhere more rural because of the pandemic.

But if you are considering a move, Inniss has some tips, including using a local realtor.

""They know whether there's flooding, shore allowances, septics, etc.,"" she explained.

Inniss added that while properties are moving quickly, there are still plenty out there.

The city recently stepped up enforcement after swarms of people packed the beach and lined the residential street with parked cars, the city going so far as to remove the word 'beach' from the sign at Wilkins Beach.

In Ramara Township, council dealt with the issue of overcrowding by closing all public beaches and some water access points.

""This is a temporary closure until we can somehow get control of the numbers, and then we can try and figure out a system that we can reopen the beaches for our locals only,"" said Mayor Basil Clarke.

The township has been overwhelmed with out-of-towners this summer.

""We tried all the tricks to control the numbers,"" said Clarke.

Not with swabs and test tubes, but with road barriers and patios extending beyond the sidewalk's edge.

Every Friday for the rest of the summer stretches of Mississaga and Peter streets will close between 4 p.m. and 8 p.m.

The closures, which began July 10, are meant to be a lifeline for businesses struggling because of the pandemic.

Blocked streets allow restaurants, cafes, and bars to serve more guests outside while maintaining physical distancing.

The Downtown Orillia Management Board says 27 eateries planned to take advantage of the extra space, setting up tables and chairs on the road.

After an 83 per cent plunge in revenue, Samir Hanna has added six tables to the front of Sanafir Mediterranean and Middle Eastern restaurant.

""Just try to make some money. We had a bad time, three months. Hopefully, that will make up for that bad time,"" Hanna said.

Some businesses that don't serve food or drink are extending hours Friday to try and cash in on the potential extra foot traffic.

Others aren't convinced it's worth their financial while to stay open late but want neighbouring patios to thrive.

""We're all in this together,"" said Julia Belleghem at Manticore Books. ""None of us want to see empty storefronts downtown. None of us want to lose businesses because a vibrant downtown helps everybody.""

The chair of Orillia's Economic Recovery Task Force hopes people will take advantage of the extra space, even if they aren't grabbing a bite on a patio.

""Walk out on the street. Get together, for a change,"" said councillor Ted Emond.

An art stroll is part of the late day closure, with talk of maybe adding street performers down the line.

The late afternoon into early evening time frame has been pitched as a compromise that allows restaurants to serve more guests without cutting off access to shops during their peak period.

But the program could be tweaked.

""As we progress through the summer, we will likely expand into other areas as the businesses request it, and then if it's going well, and Saturday evening looks like an option as well, we'll move into that.""

This year, their trip to Kenya was cancelled, but many students still wanted to do something to help a needy cause.

Grade 12 student, now a graduate, Christian Strong, said he understands why the trip was cancelled, but admitted he was still disappointed.

""When we got closer to the date we were supposed to leave it kind of hit, and I was like, 'oh wish I was doing something bigger then what I'm doing now,'"" said Strong.

That's when Strong and his classmates decided to turn their efforts closer to home.

Through tireless fundraising, the students raised $21,000 for their trip, initially going to supplies, materials, and travel costs.

While in Kenya, they planned to help build homes, find sources of water, and give to the communities.

The students decided to take the money raised for the trip and give it to four national charities and five Orillia charities.

""Just because the pandemic happened and shut everything down, doesn't mean these problems aren't shut down as well,"" said Strong.

Brett Carron said the trip is an experience that every student could learn from, and the teacher was pleased with the way the students jumped at the opportunity.

""They quickly realized that this isn't just Patrick Fogarty, or Orillia, this is a global pandemic,"" said Carron.

The Orillia Youth Centre is one of the organizations receiving a portion of the money.

Director Kevin Gangloff said the donation couldn't have come at a better time, and the money would go towards food and groceries for local youths.

Another portion of the donation will benefit the Building Hope campaign for The Lighthouse, helping to bring it one step closer to its fundraising goal of 1.3 million dollars.

The Lighthouse's Lynn Thomas, thankful for the student's generosity, said the gesture speaks to Orillia's kind nature.

Sparks said he plans to increase signage around his store, so customers are fully aware of the requirement.

""If we can do anything to avoid a second wave, let's do it,"" said Mayor Taylor. ""If we can do anything to protect our businesses, elderly and vulnerable, let's do it!""

Like many other municipalities, York Region council prefers to rely on education over enforcement.

Guelph’s Precision Biomonitoring and Biomeme, a Philadelphia company, both usually work in DNA testing. Together, they developed a test for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The mobile testing platform can deliver results for up to nine samples in about an hour, the company said in a news release.

“This approval is the result of the dedication and commitment of our teams at Precision Biomonitoring and Biomeme, as well as ongoing collaboration with our validation partners,” Dr. Mario Thomas, CEO of Precision Biomonitoring, said in a news release. “This rapid test can now be distributed everywhere across Canada, especially in remote areas and workplaces where creating virus-free zones is vital. We can now bring the lab to the sample.”

Currently, people need to visit a testing centre and wait several days for results.

The SARS-CoV-2 Real-Time RT-PCR Test will be deployed across the country now that it's approved.

The approval aligns with the federal government's plan to work with innovative companies to combat the pandemic, according to Precision Biomonitoring.

Lucy Van Doormaal, who is just three months old, has spinal muscular atrophy. Without treatment for the rare neuromuscular disorder, her parents don't think she'll make it to her first birthday.

""She just looks like any normal three-month-old, but she is eating through a feeding tube,"" Heather Kendall, Lucy's aunt, said. ""It's very different and at night she sleeps with a respirator machine.""

An antibody test when Lucy was five weeks old showed she could be a candidate for a ground-breaking gene therapy called Zolgensma. The price tag of that treatment is $3 million.

""They had heard of this treatment and it's availability, but $3 million seemed like an insane amount of money,"" Kendall said.

The single-dose treatment isn't covered under Canadian health care.

""Every day that goes by, that quality or that ability gets lost,"" Lucy's grandfather Brian Van Doormaal said. ""We need to raise that money as soon as possible.""

There are other treatments available, but Brian said they're also expensive and more long term.

The family is raising money through a GoFundMe for the treatment and to keep Lucy from getting worse. It raised $1 million in one week. Donations came in from across the country, even garnering celebrity attention from Ryan Reynolds and Jillian Harris.

""It's been very overwhelming in a very positive way,"" Lucy's mother Laura Van Doormaal said. ""We are uplifted by the community's response to Lucy's story.""

Kitchener's Play-a-Latte Cafe has also launched a fundraising campaign, selling cinnamon buns to raise money for the treatment.

""We heard her story and, just as parents, we felt for the family and wanted to do something, so this was a way for us to give back,"" owner Heather Lynn Patel said.

Kaysen Martin, an Edmonton toddler, has also been diagnosed with the disorder. Her family has also launched an online campaign to raise money for treatment.

Dino Givani Scrementi is the owner of Dino’s Athletic Direct, an athletic apparel shop on Wyndham Street North in downtown Guelph. He sells all the professional brands, like the NHL, NFL and NBA, as well as some local brands including the University of Guelph, OUA Gryphon’s.

Scrementi said the pandemic and the forced closure of his store has impacted him both emotionally and financially.

He’s being selling athletic apparel in the downtown for nearly 40 years.

“I couldn’t see anybody and I am all about love, people, hugging,” he said.

As many retailers shifted to online orders and curbside pick-up, Scrementi admits he’s old school.

“I am not an online presence store I am a people store,"" he said. ""You want something, come meet me, come see me.”

He’s very well known in the downtown neighbourhood.

“They call me Dizzy Dino, they call me Dill Pickle,"" he said.

The Dizzy Dino nickname refers to the clutter in his store. It’s a style that he says has worked for years and he isn’t willing to change.

“It’s like a mystery, people come in, they never know what they’ll find,"" Scrementi said. ""Sometimes they find stuff I didn’t even know I had.”

Scrementi says his landlord did give him a break during the pandemic. During the forced closure, he started working multiple other jobs in order to pay the bills.

The jobs included serving food at Osmow's, a Mediterranean restaurant next door to his shop. He's still working their part time.

“I’ve been working with Dino for the last three months, best guy, hard working guy,” Osmow’s owner Shah Rukh said.

The doors to Dino’s Shop are now open, along with many other retailers in the city. But with professional sports still on hiatus, he says his business continues to struggle.

Typically, the Blue Jays would be playing right now and their gear would be very popular this time of year.

“Football’s coming up. I don’t know if that’s gonna happen, but I hope it does because that’s huge for business,"" he said.

The 70-year-old says he’ll do whatever it takes to keep his doors open, even if that includes continuing his part time work at other businesses. He doesn’t plan on retiring for at least 10 years.

“As long as you make ends meet, that’s what me mother always said,"" he said. I don’t need anything else, I don’t need anything fancy.”

Dino also runs a children’s day camp every summer called ""Dino’s Sneakers 'N Sandwiches Camp.""

Barb Low has known Dino for 25 years. Her now 30-year-old son attending his camp as a child.

“He’s one of the most amazing people I’ve met,” she said.

Representatives for the municipalities, including Waterloo Region, said the municipalities need at least $10 billion to help with COVID-19 pandemic recovery. The money would prevent tax increases and service cuts, according to the municipalities.

Region of Waterloo Chair Karen Redman, Toronto Mayor John Tory and Guelph Mayor Cam Guthrie all expressed frustration on Monday at the lack of action from other levels of government. Guthrie is also chair of the Large Urban Mayors' Caucus of Ontario (LUMCO).

Redman said the region is looking at a year-end deficit of up to $17 million.

""Our choices will be to increase taxes or cut front line services and front line municipality staff,"" Redman said.

Without funding from the upper levels of government, Redman said the region, and other municipalities, will face some tough choices. The LUMCO said municipalities could be forced to cut family supports, reduce transit services and close parks without the funding.

""As the economy recovers, increasing property tax will happen at a time that people are least able to pay,"" she said. ""Strong municipalities will be key to facilitate local economic recovery.""

High school students in Ontario typically have to choose between more practical, hands-on applied courses or more theoretical academic courses in core subjects.

“Students, families and staff deserve an education system that is inclusive, accountable, and transparent, and one that by design, is set up to fully and equally empower all children to achieve their potential,” Ontario Education Minister Stephen Lecce said in a statement on Monday afternoon.

“This government will move quickly and decisively to combat systemic racism so that every child - irrespective of colour of skin, heritage, faith or ability - can have a fighting chance at success.”

The streaming process was developed in the late 1990s as a way to cater to students with different learning styles, but experts say that streaming has disproportionately impacted racialized and low-income students, affecting graduation rates and test scores.

Advocacy group People for Education has long been calling for an end to the streaming process. They argue that it ends up dividing students rather than providing them with more options.

“There as a high disproportionate amount of kids in the applied stream who were Black, who were Indigenous, who came from low-income families,” Annie Kidder from People for Education said. “All of the research, every single year when it was looked at on who goes to applied found a disproportionate portion of kids from certain backgrounds.”

Kidder said that while eliminating the practice is the right thing to do, she wants to know more about how students with different learning styles will be supported during the transition as well as teachers.

“You can’t just flip a switch,” she said. “You have to be willing to do the other part of the work.”

Five years ago People for Education called on the Liberal government to merge the two levels of Grade 9 math classes after a survey found that students in the applied version of the course were less successful on EQAO tests, less likely to graduate and less likely to go on to post-secondary education.

It also found that in schools located in low-income communities, 63 per cent of students took applied courses in 2015 compared to the 26 per cent in higher-income communities.

In that same year, the group also cited a study by the Toronto District School Board that found only 40 per cent of Grade 9 students taking mostly applied courses had graduated in five years.

The province has also confirmed that it will also be introducing a ban on suspending younger students in junior kindergarten to Grade 3, a practice that has also disproportionately affected racialized students.

No timeline for the changes was provided, but a spokesperson for the ministry of education said that “details will be released in short order.”

Speaking to reporters on Monday afternoon, Ontario Premier Doug Ford said that an official announcement is coming “this week.”

“We are the only province in the entire country that does this and it really is not fair to certain groups of students,” Ford said, adding that it doesn’t seem right to ask a 14-year-old to make a decision that could sway their entire career.

“It’s a broken system. We have heard nothing but positive remarks from communities and I’ve heard it from teachers, I’ve heard it from everyone across the board.”

In a post on social media, the education critic for Ontario’s official opposition called the decision to end streaming “an important first step,” but also said they look forward to learning more about the plan.

“An important first step but streaming starts much earlier, from the moment a student enters school,” Marit Stiles said on Twitter. “We’ll be watching closely for details.”

‘Nothing has been communicated directly to us,’ teachers’ union says

The president of the union representing Ontario high school teachers said late Monday morning that he doubts “the sincerity of the education minister who just months ago wanted to increase class sizes” and that he hopes the government talks with teachers before implementing yet another change during a pandemic.

“I feel we have to take a serious look at how we best serve all our students, including Black, Indigenous, racialized students,” Harvey Bischof said. “I want to make sure that however we go forward is the best, possible way.”

“Let’s have a discussion about this … if we are going to de-stream what are the processes and the supports that need to be put in place to make this work?”

Bischof also said that he hasn’t heard directly from the education minister about their plans for streaming courses.

“Nothing has been communicated directly to us, which is how this minister operates,” he said. “It would be a significant change while we are struggling obviously with a very difficult environment.”

In a message posted to social media on Monday afternoon, the TDSB’s director of education said that the board has been “challenging streaming” for a while.

“We keep saying it is not just about Grade 9,” John Malloy said. “What attitudes and practices negatively impact students in kindergarten? Are all of our special education programs assisting students who are placed there in early grades? Who is being suspended and why? Who is excluded from an academic pathway?”

“Black and Indigenous students are over represented in non-academic pathways. We are now confronting the bias, oppression and racism that must be interrupted at the system, school and classroom level.”

Malloy added that while de-streaming is “a great first step” and “necessary and complex,” it will need support so that students can succeed.

In a news release, Haldimand-Norfolk Public Health said the outbreak at Scotlynn Group in Vittoria was officially declared over on Friday.

“I think we’re all happy for Scotlynn, for the migrant workers, and certainly for the community,” said Kristal Chopp, Norfolk County mayor and chair of the Board of Health. “When you look at the totality of this, the program was really an employer-focused program as oppose to an employee-focused program.”

Around 200 workers tested positive for COVID-19 at the peak of the outbreak, and one person died from complications.

Chopp says there are lessons to be learned from what happened.

“We have two workers that have now admitted to concealing symptoms,” she said. “I think one of the biggest things we need to look at is who is taking those wellness checks and really evaluating them.”

Norfolk and Haldimand counties now administer serial sentinel testing on farms as a proactive measure.

Chopp describes this process as taking the highest risk population in a certain bunkhouse and testing around 10 per cent every couple of weeks.

“The idea being here is that it would give some sort of a signal in advance of a large outbreak, like we saw,” she said.

Chopp says she sent letters weeks ago calling on the provincial and federal governments to take control over the screen and quarantine process for migrant workers in a similar way that British Columbia has done.

She adds that they haven’t heard a response yet.

“This is a tragedy and crisis that could have been prevented a long time ago,” said Chris Ramsaroop, an organizer Justice for Migrant Workers. “Permanent status on arrival at the federal level is essential. It’s time.”

On the provincial level, Ramsaroop is calling for the inclusion of minimum wage for all farm workers and ensuring they have equal access to occupational health and safety.

“If people are getting sick here in Canada, or injured here in Canada, it’s our responsibility to take care of them,” he said. “This isn’t about good and bad employers. This is systematic overhaul that needs to happen.”

Ramsaroop adds that municipalities should enact their own Section 22 orders similar to the one by the Haldimand-Norfolk Health Unit.",[]

They say the number of CMV crashes last year is the highest in 20 years, and includes a 67 per cent increase in fatalities from the year before.

“We had 96 people die last year in over 84,000 crashes that we were called to on OPP-patrolled roads,” said Sgt. Kerry Schmidt of the OPP.

With the launch of Operation Safe Drive on Sunday, provincial police hope to focus on speeding and other contributing factors in these collisions.

John Way, the owner of Wayfreight Services in Guelph, says he attributes the close calls that they review on dash cam footage to improper lane changes, driver inattention, and losing control.

“We’ve seen an increase in close calls fortunately, not necessarily collisions,” he said. “You need to be hyper aware in these kinds of times.

“Trucks are in a hurry, they’re under time constraints to deliver freight, and cars don’t give trucks the room to maneuver or stop.”

OPP say the majority of the CMV collisions in 2019 were linked to the factor of speed.

“We want to make sure drivers of all vehicles are sharing the road properly and understanding what vehicles are around them and what their limitations are,” said Schmidt.

The campaign will also focus on unsafe driving behaviours.

“We have heavy loads,” said Manader Kumar, a transport driver for West Coast Commodities. “If someone is going to break in front of us it’s hard for us to break in an instant.”

On Saturday, Kumar had a 24-hour drive in front of him to North Dakota.

He says some of the drivers he is sharing the road make him worried about arriving safely.

“They’re driving like firefighters today,” said Kumar. “Every day there’s too many accidents going on, people are driving crazy.”

Other areas of focus in the OPP campaign include making sure drivers are scheduling maintenance and conducting daily inspections.",[]

Environment Canada says it is possible for 50-100 mm of rain on Saturday in the area.

The heavy rain could produce localized flooding, according to the agency.

On Friday, a summer thunderstorm rolled through Waterloo Region, lighting up the sky and bringing some much-needed rain to the area.

Friday also marked the 10th straight day with temperatures over 30 C.

Environment Canada issued a severe thunderstorm warning around 6:30 p.m., warning of flash flooding, strong winds and possible hail. That warning ended shortly after 8 p.m.

Social media users showed flooding on some Kitchener streets as storm drains worked to keep up with rain. Forsyth Drive in the Westmount neighbourhood turned into a pond during the storm.

An Environment Canada meteorologist said 63 millimetres of rain fell from the thunderstorms over the course of a few hours. The four hours of rain brought 70 per cent of normal monthly levels.

The rain also helped rivers return to normal levels. Conestogo River returned to its normal summer flow level on Friday night.

Here are some photos of the storm as it rolled through southern Ontario and Waterloo Region:

With the five-year milestone marked and no new leads, Robert Krull is offering a cash reward for anyone with information on his wife's case.

""One hundred thousand dollars to anyone that comes forward to the police [with information],"" said Krull. ""For the crime of abduction, murder, and disposing of [Thelma's] body.""

With no arrests made and no new information, Robert Krull is still looking for answers about his wife's death.

He said Thelma was his rock, and he misses her every day.

""I can see people walking down the street, or a couple holding hands, that gets emotional for me,"" said Krull.

Thelma Krull disappeared on July 11, 2015. She left her home in the Grassie Boulevard area and walked to Civic Park near East Kildonan Collegiate around 8 a.m.

Winnipeg Police Service believe it was there where she was involved in some incident and abducted.

Three years later, in October of 2018, a hunter found human remains in the RM of Tache, which were later identified as Thelma.

Krull said he's grateful for the resources WPS put into his wife's case, but he wants answers, and he's hopeful this reward will spark some progress.

Frank Cormier, a criminologist at the University of Manitoba, said clearance rates for homicides in Winnipeg are generally above 90 per cent, and a case like this going unsolved in the city is very unusual.

He said a cash reward could persuade someone to speak out.

""Perhaps they were reluctant to come forward, maybe it was an acquaintance or possibly even a family member,"" said Cormier.

""Perhaps at this point, the money might actually get them to overcome their reluctance.""

Cormier said an unsolved homicide can leave families feeling helpless, and offering a reward can help them stay hopeful.

""It's been five years. I just felt like I had to do something. She deserves something,"" said Krull.

Krull said the reward is available for the next six months.

He's asking people who want to come forward with information to contact the police, not him or his family.",[]

He said the bus was travelling downhill at about 75 miles per hour when the tire blew.

""[The driver] was just fighting to keep control of it,"" said Beauchamp.

The bus careened to the right and hit a wire guard rail.

""It snapped about five of those [poles] like they were toothpicks,"" Beauchamp said.

Hitting the rail also popped the back tires, which helped to slow the bus. Beauchamp estimates it took a quarter of a mile to stop the bus.

After the bus came to a stop, the team exited, and another bus picked them up. No one was injured in the ordeal.

""It very easily could have been a lot worse,"" said Beauchamp, who noted that if the bus had gone off the shoulder, it likely would have flipped.

Danielle Doiron, a spouse of one of the players, also posted a photo with a caption that said in part, ""Beyond grateful for highway guardrails after the [Goldeyes] bus crash earlier today.""

She said her husband, Kevin McGovern, told her the guardrail stopped them from flipping into a ditch. The rail ended about five feet from where the bus made contact, and Doiron said it easily could have been much worse.

The Goldeyes are one of six American Association teams competing in a shortened season. As the league's only Canadian team, it is playing as a ""road-only"" team this season.

The Milwaukee Milkmen, Sioux Falls Canaries, Chicago Dogs, and the Fargo-Moorhead RedHawks are sharing their stadiums with the road-only teams and acting as hub cities.

So far, the Goldeyes are 4 and 3 this season, putting them third among the six teams.",[]

Comet NEOWISE C/2020 F3, named after the satellite that first discovered it, has been travelling towards Earth in recent days, before it returns to the outer edges of the solar system.

Photos submitted from Manitobans show the comet as it appeared in the morning sky on Thursday.

Scott Young, who is the manager of the Planetarium and Science Gallery at the Manitoba Museum, said this comet wasn't expected to be as bright as it is.

""This wasn't predicted to be all that impressive but as it swung around the soon it suddenly burst into brightness,"" said Young.

It’s one of the few “naked-eye comets” of the 21st century, meaning it can be seen without a telescope. The comet was first discovered on March 27, 2020, and NASA was unsure if it would make it to Earth as the comet travelled towards the sun.

Young said over the next several days this will be the only time to see the comet.

""We won't see it again for at least 6,000 years. So it's kind of your only chance.""

Young added the reason why this comet is so unique is because of how bright it is.

""I can count on the fingers of one hand how many comets we've had that have been this impressive. I mean, I have seen a lot of comets, but there's only a couple that have outshone this in my entire lifetime.""

NASA said the comet will likely be visible in the early morning sky until July 11. It will be visible in the early evening sky after July 11.

Young says if people want to see it, it's best to be away from the city and all the lights.

In many cases in Manitoba, reporting a sexual assault needs to be done in person, but soon students attending most post-secondary schools in the province will have more control when reporting sexual violence.

Mary Lobson is the project manager of Rees – short for Respect Educate Empower Survivors – the online reporting tool for sexual violence that will be released to nine post-secondary campuses in Manitoba this fall.

""We don't require any identifying information to actually make an account or use the platform,"" Lobson told CTV News. ""The only time you need to provide information is if you are wanting to reach out and get support.""

The website is designed to put users in touch with supports and information specific to their school, and the option to share their story.

""It's really up to the survivor how much information they want to share, to whom they want to share it and at what time,"" Lobson said.

She said each term, anonymous data sets will be given to schools to provide them with concrete numbers of when and where sexual assaults are occurring.

Allison Kilgour, a law student at the University of Manitoba and the advocacy coordinator for Students for Consent Culture, says this platform is a win-win.

""It's going to provide autonomy and choice and options and support for students, and it's also going to give institutions the ability to receive and track data that they never really had the option to track before,"" Kilgour said.

Lobson said Rees will also create consistency between schools that currently use different tracking methods. She said she hopes the platform will lead to more incidents getting reported and allow survivors to report assaults on their own terms.

""That's what's important, is giving survivors options,"" Lobson said.",[]

As part of the 24-team blueprint to resume the 2019-20 campaign halted March 12 because of COVID-19, Toronto and Edmonton were also officially unveiled as hub cities.

Mayor Don Iveson issued a statement on Friday afternoon about the NHL’s decision to choose Edmonton as a hub city.

“A score for Edmonton! I’m very happy to hear that our city will be one of the NHL hub cities. Bringing hockey here will generate a real boost to Edmonton’s economy. We can’t wait to delight hockey fans and show off everything our beautiful city has to offer.”

“We know that Edmonton’s low COVID-19 cases was one of the reasons our city was a top contender, and our low cases can be directly attributed to Edmontonians who have been working hard to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and who have been, by and large, following the excellent public health guidance Alberta Health Services has given. So keep up the good work Edmonton!”

Training camps will open Monday in each team's home market, with clubs scheduled to head to their respective hubs July 26 before games start to count Aug. 1.

The 12 Eastern Conference teams will start in Toronto, with the 12 Western Conference teams off to Edmonton. The conference finals and Stanley Cup final will be in Edmonton.

Once in Toronto and Edmonton, players will be kept in so-called bubbles - tightly-controlled circles with stringent health protocols and daily testing - separate from the general public in hopes of keeping the novel coronavirus at bay.

The extension of the CBA, which had been set to expire in September 2022, was viewed as a crucial aspect of the return-to-play plan because of the dire economic realities brought on by COVID-19. The new deal runs through at least the 2025-26 season.

“Today, the NHL and the NHLPA announced a significant agreement that addresses the uncertainty everyone is dealing with, the framework for the completion of the 2019-20 season and the foundation for the continued long-term growth of our league,” NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said in a statement.

NHL executive director Don Fehr said the agreement was “a meaningful step forward for the players and owners, and for our game, in a difficult and uncertain time.”

The second phase of the NHL draft lottery will be Aug. 10, with the eight losing teams in the play-in round entered to determine who gets the first pick in the NHL draft, tentatively scheduled for Oct. 9-10.

The last possible day of the Stanley Cup final is Oct. 4.

Each team will be permitted to bring a maximum of 52 people into the secure zones in the hub cities, including a maximum of 31 players.

On Friday afternoon, Coun. Sherri Rollins, along with Michael Jack, the city's Chief Corporate Services Officer, presented a motion calling for the city to use recently gifted money to build one or more public washrooms and handwashing stations.

""I also have really been struck during the pandemic on access to washroom issues,"" Rollins said. ""I know that public washrooms are absolutely something that as Winnipeggers – as Winnipeg city council – we should be able to meet the needs of life, security, and dignity.""

In early June, the city was told it had been gifted $670,000 through the COVID-19 Community Response Fund for Vulnerable Populations (CRFVP). The money came with a catch, specifying a project that would use the funding had to be selected by mid-August and completed by February 2021.

""During an emergency, during a crisis like a pandemic, a lot of things happen out of order or in a way that isn't typical and these funding opportunities certainly came to our attention in a very atypical way,"" Jack told the city's protection, community services and parks committee.

Rollins and Jack are proposing the city use $620,000 of the funding to build one or more public washrooms that would be accessible 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. The location of these washrooms would be determined through consultation with End Homelessness Winnipeg and the public service.

The plan, if approved, says construction on the washrooms would be completed by February 2021.

The remaining $50,000 would be used to immediately rent temporary portable washrooms and hand washing stations in areas of the city that would best serve the homeless.

""Throughout this motion, you hear the echoed priorities of the homeless population – Winnipeg's most vulnerable – to access basic toileting facilities,"" Rollins told the committee on Friday.

""It is reflective of the point of time that we just went through, that we are likely going into again during the pandemic, on how key toilets are for residents, including those with disabilities, the necessity of toileting facilities especially in or in the vicinity of homeless encampments, and how important hand washing stations, toilets, showers, hygiene, and dignity is for residents.""

Jack told the committee there are a lot of unknown factors – including how much each unit would cost to build, but said he believes the funding would cover one to three public washrooms.

Jack said the Downtown Winnipeg BIZ estimates it would cost $12,500 annually to operate a public washroom, and said the city would look for ways to recoup that cost – suggesting sponsorships or advertising revenue.

He said as a last resort, they would need to look for funding in the city's operating budget.

""We would need to select a model that made the most sense and was hopefully the most cost-effective in terms of operating maintenance,"" he said. ""We would have to explore every single option.""

Rollins said the cost is worth it.

""There are costly consequences for public works when there are no hygiene and sanitation facilities,"" she said.

""Where homeless encampments are present, all along the riverbank, along Balmoral, has been replete with feces, urine, and rats in some cases, and that comes at a cost to not only the buildings – to schools sometimes – surrounding the riverbank, but to public works.""

The committee voted to pass the motion on Friday. It will now go to the executive policy committee for a vote before going to city council.",[]

As a partnership with the United States, somewhere between 10 and 100 American troops help out at the Canadian base in Winnipeg.

""There is a nice size American contingent here that are here for between 2-4 years,"" said Lt.-Col. Brian Hardeman of the U.S. Air Force. ""We are embedded in the community, and we are happy to be here.""

Hardeman said American troops go to school and play organized sports alongside Canadians.

As part of a bilateral agreement, the U.S. troops get to keep their licence plates, but that's been causing problems recently.

""Some of the dependent spouses and things of that nature have gotten some profanity at local business establishments, and some have been told to go back home,"" said Hardeman.

The Lieutenant-Colonel said there have been three ""outbursts.""

There was also an incident where two cars were keyed because of their American plates.

According to the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), the Americans are essential to the base and pose no risk of bringing COVID-19 into the community.

""Our American colleagues are very aware of this, and they certainly don't want to be a factor of the COVID-19 or a threat or a danger to us,"" said RCAF Col. Eric Charron, ""They wouldn't be serving in this capacity if they didn't believe that.""

Charron said he knows what being stationed in another country feels like firsthand, having lived in Germany and the Netherlands.

""Being accepted when you're in another country - a foreign country, it means the world,"" he said. ""The impression we make is going to last, and there are no second chances for a first impression.""

Charron said he has a reminder for Manitobans.

""We pride ourselves on being 'Friendly Manitoba,'"" said Charron. ""We pride ourselves that we are welcoming and accepting.""

Cars from the airbase can be identified by a window sticker of the Canadian Forces Base Winnipeg logo.

At a news conference Tuesday afternoon, Mayor Brian Bowman along with Jay Shaw, who is with the city's emergency operations centre, announced the city will begin recalling approximately 195 Community Services Department employees to help bring the services back. The city previously recalled 400 employees in June.

Shaw said so far the city has recalled almost 700 workers and the remaining jobs are transit and community service staff.

The city said in late July and early August, all library branches will partially reopen, except for the Cornish Library, which is currently closed for renovations. The libraries will be open for holds pick-up service, phone reference service and to return borrowed library materials. The city will announce reopening dates and hours of operation in the coming weeks.

For those who are wondering when full services will resume, Shaw said there is no confirmed date for that yet.

""What we're trying to do is balance out the needs for safety of our staff and the public,"" said Shaw. ""I will strongly encourage you to continue to think about the new normal. Based on public health orders and where we are going, we need to be able to monitor as we get passed the Summer and into the Fall.""

He added that with the new normal, some of the changes might be more permanent as the city moves forward.

The city will also reopen the Pan Am Pool and the Cindy Klassen Recreation Complex on July 20. The two facilities will operate with limited access to the pools, walking tracks, and fitness equipment.

For those who are concerned about how people will social distance at these areas, Shaw said staff will be there to help enforce the rules.

""On occasion, someone forgets or maybe doesn't understand the rules, the staff are trained on how to approach those situations and generally what we find is when we tell someone 'hey we want you to stand here or there is a lineup' people are more than willing to comply. Everyone's chipping in,"" said Shaw.

He added that, for the most part, Winnipeggers have been very good at following the health guidelines.

Residents will have to register for swimming and fitness blocks, similar to current rules regarding outdoor pools. Details on registration will be released closer to reopening the city said.

Shaw said it is important that people book these swim and fitness blocks.

""I continue to encourage you to pre-register to avoid disappointment at the gates if the pools are full.""",[]

The work, conducted by researchers at the Rady Faculty of Health Sciences and a virology lab at Universidad de Concepción in Chile, also found that if scientists don’t monitor how the virus is changing in different parts of the world, the testing could produce false negative results. Dr. Carlos Farkas, a postdoctoral researcher in pharmacology and therapeutics for the Max Rady College of Medicine and the Research Institute in Oncology and Hematology, was the study’s lead author.

To conduct the study, the research team used datasets to look at whole genome sequencing samples from people infected before March 27 with the virus that causes COVID-19.

According to a news release from the university, this team “was the first to combine genomic sequencing data from two worldwide sources in order to detect variants by geographic region.” The group found 146 different variants.

Dr. Jody Haigh, co-author and associate professor of pharmacology and therapeutics and a senior scientist at the Research Institute in Oncology and Hematology, said one of the major findings was that samples from Washington had a distinctive footprint of viral sequence changes.

“About 39 per cent of Washington State samples had this footprint. Asian and European samples were more diverse in terms of changes in viral sequence, but their footprints were clearly different from those in the U.S. samples,” Haigh said in the release.

The researchers noted when labs test for SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), they use small pieces of DNA that bind to the viral sequence and amplify viral RNA/DNA.

Farkas said in order for a robust positive test result, the DNA needs to exactly match the viral sequence.

“If researchers design these primers to bind to regions of the virus that they don’t realize have changed in a particular population, there may be poor amplification and the result can be false negatives,” Farkas said.

The study did find some changes in viral sequence in regions of the virus where the DNA was supposed to bind, which could explain why there have been some false negative testing results.

“Because SARS-CoV-2 is changing rapidly, researchers should be aware of its current local viral footprints in order to design DNA primers that don’t bind to regions of the virus that have changed. Other regions of the virus that don’t show these changes should be used for designing primers,” Haigh said.

The research team hopes its work will impact COVID-19 testing and vaccine development.",[]

The WRHA said clients will be prioritized based on those who voluntarily chose to cancel health services and instead receive support from family members.

The health authority added extra precautions will be in place to protect both clients and staff, and all clients will be screened for COVID-19 before each home visit.

“This has been a challenging time for all Winnipeggers and we are happy to have had the support of families and friends of our clients during this time to provide much needed support effectively combatting isolation while simultaneously providing for their health needs,” said Jennifer Spencer, acting director of palliative and home care services for the WRHA, in a news release.

The WRHA said not all clients will get services resumed, and that is based upon health risks and preference.

“We are resuming services on a graduated basis to ensure those with the highest health needs are supported first. It is imperative that our resumption of services continue in a safe and cautious manner as we continue to follow evolving direction from Shared Health and Public Health officials,” said Spencer.

During a news conference Monday afternoon, Lanette Siragusa, chief nursing officer with shared Health, said all regions in Manitoba will begin resuming home care services gradually.

“Throughout the spring, when we were at high active levels of COVID, home care case coordinators were in regular contact with clients and families to make sure they checked in and followed up on any emerging concerns, and now that the curve has been flattened, home care coordinators continue to contact clients and families to discuss resuming these services, and whether they’re still required,” she said.

Siragusa said the services being restored are priority one and two services, which includes meal preparation and helping clients get dressed.

Wab Kinew, leader of the NDP Official Opposition, said home care has been an area of the COVID-19 pandemic where the province has fallen short.

“This is an essential service that seniors in our community need, and the government didn’t get it right when they had to cut people off, and now that they’re going to open it back up just a trickle, to a very small number of people, I’m concerned that it’s going to really negatively impact a lot of seniors,"" said Kinew

“When a senior can live in the community, with home care, it allows them to reduce the risk of exposing themselves to the pandemic, and it allows them to stay healthier. When the government artificially limits the amount of home care out there, it can either increase risk for seniors, or it means those sort of care functions are going to have to be done by that elders’ friends, family, or even neighbours.”

Kinew added he is also concerned about only a small number of home care services being offered at the moment, and wants to see access to home care expanded, and delivered through the public system, not by private providers.

“This is part of fighting the pandemic,” he said. “If you have a strong, public home care system, you could make sure every senior could stay home as much as possible, and not have to go out as often, just to take care of their basic needs for health care issues.”",[]

The research, conducted in partnership with the University of British Columbia, was published on Friday in the academic journal Cell Host & Microbe. It said breastfeeding directly at the breast best supports the process.

“In this study, we looked at the breast milk and the stool of mothers and babies from a large national study called the Child Study,” said Dr. Meghan Azad, an associate professor at the University of Manitoba, who is involved with the study. “We did that because we’re interested in their microbiomes, so, the bacteria that live in and on our body that do so many important things.

“We think it’s really important to understand how that gets established very early in life.”

The research found some of the bacteria present in the mother’s breast milk are also present in the child’s stool.

“It tells us that maybe those particular bacteria are especially important,” Azad said. “Maybe they would be good candidates to be probiotics, outside of this spear of mothers and babies.

“It’s interesting because we know the microbiome is really important throughout our lives, so understanding how breast milk affects this early in life is important new information.”

Azad said the early development of the bacteria could help with a child’s health as they get older.

“We’ve shown that the bacteria in the infant's gut very early on, seems to be correlated with the risk of developing allergies and asthma very early in life,” she said. “In that early window of development, babies are still developing their immune system, and we know the gut bacteria is important for training their immune system to understand what is a harmful bacteria or pathogen, and what is a helpful one.”

Azad said there are 3,500 families participating in the study, with 1,200 samples used for this section of the study. They sampled the breast milk at three months of age, and sampled the stool at the same age, and then again at one-year-old. The babies are now eight-years-old, Azad said.

“There is lots more research to do to see how what we’ve found in this first study may be impacting the health of these children as they grow up,” she said.",[]

Wayne Constant said he went to Walmart in the evening on Monday, June 29, to pick up a few things, and when he entered the store he was stopped by security.

Constant thought at first he was being stopped to use hand sanitizer.

""He said 'Stop. You look like a person that drinks, and you cannot shop at Walmart,'"" said Constant.

He added that the security guard said he had a right to stop him, and he wasn't allowed to shop there.

Constant said there was a cashier nearby and he asked her to speak to a manager. The cashier told him to go shopping, and they would deal with it.

Constant said the manager found him while he was shopping and the security guard was with him.

""I thought, maybe he would let me tell the situation or maybe he came to apologize, but no. He pretty much was saying 'Oh, you're the one who is making all the ruckus at the front entrance.'""

Constant added that instead of an apology, the manager just wanted him to ""get his things and get out of the store.""

He said he has never experienced any sort of racial profiling before and was shocked by the incident.

""It was an embarrassing, humiliating experience for anybody to go through. It took me a couple (of) days to calm down,"" Constant said.

""I was so hurt and saddened by this entire process.""

CTV News reached out to Walmart Canada, which said it is aware of the incident and is currently investigating.

""Respect is a core value at Walmart Canada and we do not condone any behavior which contradicts this value, including racism and discrimination. Walmart is committed to providing a safe and inclusive environment for our associates and our customers. Celebrating diversity and fostering inclusivity is an integral part of the Walmart culture and we are proud to reflect the diverse communities we serve through our associates,"" said a spokesperson for Walmart in an email.

Constant said because of the ordeal he would be filing a human rights complaint with the help of Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak (MKO).

Grand Chief Garrison Settee said MKO has received several complaints about the mistreatment of First Nations citizens at the Walmart.

""In recent days I have heard from customers that they have been racially profiled. In one instance, a First Nations man, who never uses alcohol, was told he cannot come into the store because he looks like someone who has been drinking. Imagine being told you look as though you are intoxicated when, in fact, you do not use alcohol! It is understandable that one would find this completely inappropriate and offensive,” he said in an emailed release.

""Indigenous peoples should not have to worry about being accused of being intoxicated when they are simply at the store to carry out their shopping.”

Settee said MKO has sent a letter to Walmart to request a meeting with the company to discuss ""solutions-based dialogue"" about how Walmart can improve service for First Nations citizens.

“We’re certainly pleased to see the Assiniboine River at Brandon continues to recede,” said Brandon Mayor Rick Chrest on Tuesday. “We’re well below flood stage within the bank.""

“Our bigger threat, of course, was the possibility of a dam failure at Rivers, Manitoba, just upstream from us there, and again, happily for everyone involved, everyone in between, the water up there is receding, not as fast as the Assiniboine River, but it is certainly heading in the right direction.”

Brandon received over 155 millimetres of precipitation following thunderstorms that tore through southern Manitoba. The dam near the community of Rivers was facing a one-in-1,000-year flooding event, the province said, and there were concerns the increased flows through the 60-year-old structure could cause the dam to fail.

The dam is still operating, but waters at the spillway remain at historically high levels.

As of Wednesday morning, the Assiniboine River was measured at First Street in Brandon at 1,169.22 feet above sea level, which is below flood levels. Chrest said on Tuesday the emergency operation centre remains active in the city, as flash flooding is still a concern.

“We want people that live near the Assiniboine River in Brandon to stay on alert so that in the event of failure, they may have to evacuate,” he said. “We think the threat is now certainly much lower, but we’re waiting on provincial engineers and provincial authorities to give us the all-clear before we stand down those conditions.”

Chrest said businesses and homes impacted by flooding last week are working to clean up, and praised the efforts of residents not only in the city but in surrounding areas, to assist those who were hit by the flooding.

“The community spirit is just outstanding in the face of any adversity, and this is certainly no exception,” he said.

The City of Brandon reminds residents to stay away from the Assiniboine River and stay off all dike infrastructure at this time.",[]

“It’s probably been about a good month and half, two months now that we’ve noticed various flavors not available,” said Munther Zeid, general manager at Food Fare.

But, it’s not just pop cans.

Luke Chapman, the interim president for Beer Canada, said the COVID-19 pandemic is changing the way Canadians consume beer.

He noted bars and tap rooms normally represent 20 to 25 per cent of total Canadian beer sales, but with the pandemic those sales are down, which has increased the demand for packaging materials such as cans and bottles.

“Based on what we have heard from both brewers and manufacturers, we are not at the crisis level yet but we have heard from some brewers that they are facing challenges sourcing aluminum cans,” Chapman said.

David Kaisaris, who owns the Riverside Beer Store, said the supply of canned beverages has been impacted by more than just the pandemic.

“It’s been a particularly difficult spring and summer because first we had COVID, then we had where our major supplier had a malware problem where they had to build, rebuild their whole SAP system over again,” he said.

Moosehead Breweries is also feeling the impact -- sending CTV News this statement: “We can confirm that we are seeing pressure on our can supply due to supplier production limitations, as well as increased demand from consumers for cans, both of which are adding to existing supply chain challenges resulting from COVID-19. We are actively working with all of our suppliers to minimize stock issues and impacts on our production.”

Chapman said the United States is experiencing the same market changes as Canada.

“So there’s been an increase in the demand for aluminum cans down there as well,” he said.

“It has resulted in certain brewers having to explore some further international markets to make up for the loss of supply.”

Zeid said he hopes there will be more product soon.

“We were told that there was a shortage at the beginning and that the U.S. was not allowing the export of aluminum tins and there’s a bit of shortage here and they’re trying to find another source,” he said.

The spokesman added the CFL also hasn't reached a decision whether or not a season will even be held this year.

The '20 regular season was scheduled to kick off June 11 but was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

CFL commissioner Randy Ambrosie has stated the earliest a shortened 2020 season would begin is September but that a cancelled campaign is also possible.

Currently, the CFL and CFLPA are discussing amendments to the collective bargaining agreement that would allow for an abbreviated season to be played.

However, with eased restrictions the team, minus a few players caught abroad, is back on the pitch for restricted practices.

“Without contact, it's unrealistic in terms of decision making for the players, and pressure, but we are doing what we can,"" said Valour FC head coach and general manager, Robert Gale.

With only a third of the roster from the inaugural season returning for a second year with the club, the limitations have made it difficult for players to build chemistry, other than some video conference socials held during the lockdown.

""You're not obviously going to get the ball skills not playing with your teammates as much,” recently acquired midfielder, Fraser Aird said.

“But keeping yourself physically fit during the whole thing out running and stuff like that is key because we never know what's going to happen so we need to be prepared for that.""

Further to the challenge of running practices while maintaining physical distancing, is the fact that no one knows exactly what the league will decide when it comes to when, where and how it plans to forego a season, if it even does.

“What's it going to look like? Is it a tournament? Will we get any games in? All of those factors are still unknown, so I think it's been a challenge,” Gale said.

The uncertainty has challenged some players’ ability to keep focused, with no season opener in sight.

“It's probably most mental (the effects), the whole pandemic thing and getting used to it and coming back to training not knowing what the outcome is going to be or when we are going to get the call,"" Aird said about the challenges of training during the pandemic.

With no firm start date, Gale says his staff has been taking a “scientific approach” in preparing for a potential season, using a “sliding scale” to gauge how hard to push his players.

""We had one for a potential June first start, a potential July first start, and a potential August first start,” Said Gale.

“Obviously as more information becomes available then we kind of ramp it up towards competition.""

After a successful first phase in its plan to return, the organization is now moving ahead with its second phase ahead of its July 1 start date.

Health and safety checklists related to COVID-19 for players, coaches, umpires, ballpark maintenance staff, as well as parents and spectators, are available on the Baseball Manitoba website. It has also created the new volunteer role of Health and Safety Coordinator which every team must have and who will attend every game to answer any questions and monitor the new regulations.

Among the new rules:

Players and coaches will need to maintain 2 meters of physical distance, including in the dugout;

Signage for physical distancing must be present at all fields;

Sanitizing areas will be established for spectators;

No chewing gum or sunflower seeds will be allowed on the premises in 2020;

Balls and equipment must be sanitized after every game; and

Facilities can operate at 50% capacity with people expected to remain two meters apart except for brief exchanges.

There are no rule changes to the game itself. Umpires can assume the traditional position behind the catcher, though, they have the option to stand 6 feet behind the catcher or behind the pitcher’s mound.

Players are encouraged to bring their own equipment, though it can be shared if it is sanitized between users.

If there happens to be an outbreak during the season, Baseball Manitoba executive director, Jason Miller, says it will be up to Manitoba Health to decide whether local leagues can move forward.

“If you’ve tested positive or have any symptoms you’re not to be at any baseball events. That’s clearly stated in our plan and on our signage,” said Miller.

“So, if that happens we will assess and we will take orders from the province as to how to proceed.”

The Winnipeg AAA league will kick off the season on July 1, with grassroots play expected to start later in July.

Miller says teams will only be playing games within Manitoba against other Manitoba teams, and while all national tournaments and championships have been cancelled, provincials may still be a possibility later in the season.",[]

“They say (it’s) going from zero to sixty,” said Basketball Manitoba Executive Director, Adam Wedlake. “We’re maybe going from zero to six - it’s pretty slow.”

Last week, Canada Basketball released its latest guidelines for Canadians to return to the sport, and it most notably excludes any kind of game scenario, whether competitive or in practice.

“It’s a return to the sport, basically in a training component.” Wedlake said. “The best way to describe it is social distanced practicing.”

Players will be expected to regularly monitor themselves for any symptoms of COVID-19 and will follow several strict guidelines upon return.

Players will be expected to:

practice with no more than two people at one basket

bring their own basketball and water bottles

refrain from passing their ball to other players

maintain physical distancing between other players and coaches.

“It will basically be shooting and ball-handling, dribbling drills and skills at least for the first few months.”

Wedlake believes these measures will remain in place until at least this fall, though the plan still needs to be approved by Manitoba health officials and Sport Manitoba.

The next challenge will be securing facilities for practices. Wedlake says Basketball Manitoba is keeping an eye on what the Manitoba High School Sports Association will decide when it comes to high school basketball in the fall, as gymnasiums used for practices are in schools.

“We’re a pretty heavy school-based sport,” Wedlake said. “What’s going to happen in the school system? Will there be school teams? Will the school system allow us to rent and get into their facilities on evenings and weekends?”

Manitoba Basketball isn’t the only entity with questions. The Manitoba Association of Basketball Officials has little information on how their jobs will change when play resumes. Supervisor of operations Mike Maryk says while local referees don’t have any major concerns to this point, there is speculation among officials as to what can be expected.

“You can look at potentially wearing gloves to avoid contact and stuff like that, but of course, how we communicate is with hand signals so it would certainly bring an interesting dynamic to it,” Maryk said.

While he contends having officials wearing masks during play would be near impossible based on the fact they obligated to have a whistle in their mouth throughout the game, he also wonders how sanitizing balls will come in to play.

“Depending on the level (you officiate) you let the captains check out the ball to see what it’s like, see if they like it,"" said Maryk.

“You would hate to be like ‘ok this stoppage we are going to switch and use this ball now while the other one gets taken out’ that would be a huge determent to the game, yet I say that and it could be the rule for all I know. Who knows what the foreseeable future brings?”

Basketball Manitoba is aiming to get players back on the court under these guidelines early next month, it does not expect games to be introduced into the return plan until much further down the road. Although Wedlake says the three-on-three game, or 3x3, may return sooner as it is mostly played outdoors. However, there is no timeline for when that may happen.",[]

The Ontario-born athlete was drafted by the Buffalo Sabres in the second round of the 2001 NHL Draft, launching a 16-year career in the league, which included six seasons with the Winnipeg Jets from 2011 to 2017 – a total of 709 regular-season games with the team.

The Winnipeg Jets congratulated their former teammate on Twitter, wishing him and his family the best in the future.

""Chris was an outstanding leader and teammate both on and off the ice who brought levity and direction to the locker room each and every day,"" the Jets tweeted.

Congratulations to #JetsAlumni Chris Thorburn who announced his retirement today!

Ottawa Public Health says the large one day increase in new cases is due to a lag in reporting, following a ""slight delay"" with the data extraction of COVID-19 cases on Friday.

The health unit reported the new cases in its daily update on Saturday afternoon. After reporting two new cases on Friday, there were 16 new cases on Saturday.

Since the first case of COVID-19 on March 11, there have been 2,146 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Ottawa, including 263 deaths.

In a statement to CTV News Ottawa, Ottawa Public Health explained the reason for the large one-day spike in new cases.

""As you are aware, the daily figures are extracted from our database at 2 p.m. the day before. Please note there was a slight delay in the data extraction yesterday, and the increase in cases in (Saturday's) report reflect more than a 24-hour period.""

The proposed new bylaw gives Ottawa Bylaw officers the power to issue fines ranging from $200 to $400 to people caught not wearing face masks in indoor public places during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Council will vote Wednesday on a proposed mandatory face mask bylaw, that will remain in effect until at least August 26. Medical Officer of Health Dr. Vera Etches announced last Monday that face masks will be mandatory in all indoor public places starting Tuesday, July 7.

While the bylaw includes a fine for non-compliance of wearing a face mask in indoor places, Ottawa's general manager of emergency services says Ottawa Bylaw officers will focus on education and not enforcement.

""Our objective here, should Council approve the report, is to supplement what Dr. Etches has been telling us. This is an individual responsibility and we all have to as a community step up,"" said Anthony Di Monte.

""Yes, we're putting a bylaw in that's giving us new tools; our focus is definitely education and communication with people to try to attempt them to ensure that they wear a mask.""

Di Monte said the Bylaw Services officers would ""not"" be patrolling for people not wearing masks to issue fines, adding the bylaw is a ""tool within our toolkit"" for people who ""continuingly"" refuse to wear a face mask.

In a report for Council, city staff said the proposed bylaw for mandatory face masks will focus on indoor locations where the public has access as they re-open. Visitors must wear a face mask at: restaurants and other eating and drinking establishments; retail locations; places of worship; sports facilities; museums, theatres and other entertainment venues; public areas in hotels and other short-term rental premises; and public areas in hospitals and other health facilities. The mandatory face mask bylaw will also apply to City of Ottawa buildings and facilities, including libraries.

On June 15, face masks became mandatory on all OC Transpo buses, the O-Train, in stations and on Para Transpo Vehicles. The new City of Ottawa face mask policy would cover violations on OC Transpo property.

Staff say, ""As with any bylaw, or with any new public health measure, the primary objective is to educate and inform, and gain voluntary compliance.""

""However a bylaw does provide a means to impose penalties through tickets should such action be deemed necessary, such as in the case where a warning is insufficient or with repeat offenders.""

The proposed fine ranges between $200 and $400 for not wearing a face mask.

The report for Council says the ""requested fines will be a reasonable amount, in keeping with the set fines of most other City bylaws, in the range of $200-400, based on the individuals or Corporations, subject to the approval of the Ontario Court of Justice.""

""The bylaw will have a fine component to it, but frankly I hope we never have to use that,"" said Keith Egli, Chair of Ottawa's Board of Health.

""What we've seen in the last couple of days with our businesses and with the customers is heartening, and shows we're on the right track.""

If approved by Council, the bylaw will take effect immediately and remain in effect until the next regularly scheduled Council meeting on August 26. Staff says Council may extend the bylaw for an additional period of time.",[]

Multiple allegations of sexual assault against an employee of Carne tattoo came to light through social media and news media earlier this week. One employee was subsequently fired, according to the company.

Another artist at Painted Lotus Studios was also dismissed after similar allegations were made.

VicPD says the department's Special Victims Unit will investigate any such reports.

The department on Friday issued a statement saying its officers are aware of ""reports of sexualized violence during tattoo appointments here in Victoria,"" and said to anyone who comes forward with such complaints to Special Victims Unit detectives, ""you will be listened to, treated with respect, and you will be believed.""

Police added that victims do not have to file a police report to access community supports, adding that locations such as the Victoria Sexual Assault Centre, the Men’s Trauma Centre, emergency rooms, family doctors' offices, counsellors and other supports are in place.

The department has compiled a list of such community resources under its ""We Believe You"" banner.

The Victoria police said, however, that providing a statement to police before speaking to media or posting details of sexual violence online is beneficial if the matter is to proceed to court in the future.

Anyone wishing to speak with a VicPD detective can call the non-emergency line at 250-995-7654 and select extension 1 for the report desk. Police said an officer will take a complainant's contact information and arrange for a detective follow up within a week or two.",[]

The bat was found inside a Nanoose Bay home last week and may have come in contact with the homeowner's dog.

“Whenever you have a bat in someone’s house, then we always have to question, is that normal behaviour of a bat?"" says Dr. Erin Langwith, veterinarian at Harbour City Animal Hospital.

""So if there’s a contact like that, we submit it for testing.”

It's the second bat in the last month the Nanaimo animal hospital submitted for testing. The first bat came back negative.

The dog was given a rabies vaccine booster and will be in self-isolation inside its Nanoose Bay home for three months.

The vaccine is very effective in preventing the disease if pets are vaccinated within seven days of potentially being exposed, the vet said.

If your pet potentially comes in contact with a bat, Langwith says collect the bat safely and bring it in to be tested.

Less than one per cent of bats in B.C. have rabies, however, eight per cent of bats that are submitted for testing come back positive.",[]

On Monday, July 13, a 16-day shoot for a Hallmark Christmas film will begin in Oak Bay.

Called “Delivered for Christmas,” the Hallmark film is, not surprisingly, a romantic comedy.

What is surprising, however, is that the film will star an entirely Canadian cast.

Usually, Hallmark films cast U.S. based actors who then travel to B.C. for filming.

The production is working hard to staff the crew with people from Vancouver Island. Front Street says between 80 and 90 per cent of the crew will be local workers.

In another debut, the set will have four new crew members.

A COVID-19 team has been hired to ensure everyone working on the film is safe.

The four-member crew will include two paramedics who will conduct daily temperature and health checks on everyone involved in the production.

Front Street says the entire film will be shot in locations around Greater Victoria.

The city filed an application in B.C. Supreme Court on Friday seeking an order to remove people sheltering in the park's Garry oak groves and allow them to camp instead in ""less vulnerable locations within the park,"" the city said in a statement Friday.

""The Garry oak ecosystems in Beacon Hill Park are part of a protected and endangered natural system, which less than five per cent remains in B.C.,"" the city said.

“This is a challenging time for everyone, especially for people in our city who don’t have a home,” said Victoria Mayor Lisa Helps in the statement.

“While we acknowledge previous court decisions that recognized the rights of people experiencing homelessness to shelter in municipal parks, we all have a responsibility to protect sensitive ecosystems and the natural environment,"" Helps said.

“No one is being forced to leave Beacon Hill Park, but we do expect people to relocate to one of the many less vulnerable areas.”

The number of homeless people in Beacon Hill Park and other city parks has grown significantly since the COVID-19 pandemic began. The municipality has worked with provincial and regional housing organizations to move homeless people out of parks and into shelters, including motels around the city.

Victoria staff and outreach workers estimate that 180 people are currently sheltering in city parks, with approximately 100 of them in Beacon Hill Park.

The city said it anticipates it will be able to move homeless people willingly from the Garry oak areas of the park.

""No one should have to live outside in a tent because they don’t have a place to stay,” Helps said. “Getting everyone housed indoors will take continued leadership and investment from the provincial and federal governments, as well as cooperation and coordination throughout the region.”

The city says it expects the court to hear its application to move homeless people within Beacon Hill Park during the week of July 27.",[]

In a statement, the matriarchs known as “daughters of the rivers” say the Queen Charlotte Lodge is reopening as a local state of emergency remains in effect over the COVID-19 pandemic.

They say they're concerned that non-residents will expose local people to the novel coronavirus and with only two ventilators on Haida Gwaii, an outbreak would be devastating.

The matriarchs say they made the decision to peacefully occupy the lands with children, elders and other island residents following several community meetings.

Brian Clive, vice-president of sales and corporate development for the lodge, says it is fully complying with the orders and guidelines issued by the B.C. government, health authorities and WorkSafeBC.

Earlier this week, Clive said the lodge plans to use a helicopter to bring guests directly to the lodge from the mainland.

The coroner’s report says that the driver of a minivan, who was allegedly impaired, was travelling northbound on the Malahat at approximately 101 km/h when she crossed the centre line and collided with an SUV that was travelling southbound.

The driver of the SUV, 46-year-old David Tilley of Vancouver, died shortly after the crash occurred. A passenger in the SUV was also sent to hospital for treatment of serious injuries.

Meanwhile, the driver of the minivan, 31-year-old Sara Thomas, was also taken to hospital for treatment.

Thomas was later charged with six offences related to the crash, including impaired driving.

The coroner’s report says that the crash occurred in a construction zone on the Malahat highway, located roughly 500 metres north of Aspen Road.

Normally, the speed limit in the area is 80 km/h. At the time, the speed limit had been lowered to 60 km/h due to construction in the area. Tilley was travelling between 28 to 40 km/h when the crash occurred, say coroners.

While Thomas travelling more than 100 km/h at the time, coroners say that there is “no physical evidence to indicate that the (minivan) was out of control and witness statements confirm this.”

The coroners report adds that evidence from the vehicle suggests that the driver of the minivan only reacted 0.5 seconds before the collision occurred, “when the accelerator pedal was released and there was a slight steering input to the right.”

“This all indicates that the Dodge Caravan’s entry into the southbound lane was as a result of non-cognitive driving actions such as medical distress, fatigue, distracted driving or impairment,” say coroners.

The coroner’s report adds that a mechanical inspection of both vehicles indicates that mechanical factors did not contribute to the crash.

Since the fatal crash occurred, the section of highway where the collision took place has since been expanded from three lanes to four, and three kilometres of concrete median have been installed. In fact, the installation of the medians was part of the construction that was taking place in the area when the crash occurred.

Coroners believe that the new medians will prevent any similar crashes from occurring in the future.

Thomas, was originally scheduled to appear in court on May 19 for six charges related to the crash, including impaired driving and dangerous driving.

Her court date has since been postponed to July 21 in Duncan.",[]

If you look at the pictures accompanying the post, it seems like there are more than five.

“They can turn into seven or eight,” Tossa laughs. “Depending on what you like to wear.”

Tossa shows me the first dress she bought, featuring fabric cascading to the floor: “My mom didn’t like it,” she explains. “So it’s never been worn.”

The second one is a little simpler. Her mom did like it, so Tossa wore it during the ceremony in Sooke. She shows me a picture of her wearing it while walking between her parents.

“Then — to spice it up — I put a tutu underneath,” Tossa smiles, pointing to the official wedding photos which show the rainbow-coloured tutu emerging from the white dress.

Later that evening at the reception, Tossa wore the tutu under a shorter third dress with lights attached to it.

“I like colour!” she smiles. “So I had to add a lot of colour to my dresses.""

Her life had been just as dynamic as her wedding wear. Tossa says she’s clinically died 13 times because of complications due to Type 1 diabetes.

“It made me go blind,” she explains. “It gave me Charcot-Marie joint syndrome in my one foot, and kidney failure.”

Tossa was adopted (and never knew her birth family) but credits the people who raised her with supporting her through decades of health problems.

“My parents were just amazing,” she says. “And my brother.”

Tossa ended up enduring six surgeries to correct her vision, while 27 pins and plates were used to fix her foot. “The doctor said there wasn’t any room fit more,” she laughs.

Tossa’s diabetes was also cured after a pancreas-kidney transplant. The donor was a crash victim from a different city — a stranger with an unexpected connection to her birth family.

“My surgeon said she was 99.9% probably my [biological] sister,” Tossa says. “I didn’t even know about her.”

Tossa says her feelings about the origins of her organs are complicated, but is ultimately grateful for the chance to keep living and eventually meet the love of her life.

All the wedding dresses were worn to marry the same man, Jody.

Tossa shows me pictures of her wearing the fourth dress at their ceremony on a beach in Mexico. It was for the friends who couldn’t make it to Sooke. She wore the fifth and final dress at that reception.

‘I’m going to live my life to the best that I possibly can,” Tossa says of her celebrations, now that her health problems are behind her.

Now she’s hoping that by selling her dresses another bride — or five — will be able to celebrate living and loving life to the fullest too.

“I hope they have the best days of their lives,” Tossa smiles. ""Like I did.”",[]

Since the 2020 Mackenzie Tour – PGA Tour Canada tournament was cancelled due to COVID-19, four smaller tournaments have been scheduled across the country as part of a “Canada Life Series.”

Two tournaments are taking place at the Bear Mountain Golf & Tennis Resort Community in Langford, and two will be held at TPC Toronto at Osprey Valley.

The first Bear Mountain tournament will take place on Aug. 10 to 12 on the resort’s Mountain Course.

The second tournament will take place on Aug. 17 to 19 on the resort’s Valley Course.

“Bear Mountain’s two courses are quite diverse, and (Jack Nicklaus and his son Steve) designed them in such a way that we think the tournaments will certainly have different feels to them while at the same time providing excellent tests of golf,” said Rob Larocque, Bear Mountain director of golf in a release Friday.

The two tournaments in Toronto will take place on Sept. 2 to 4, and Sept. 9 to 11.

Contestants in the tournaments will include professional Canadian golfers, “elite amateurs,” and Mackenzie Tour members who are currently living in the country, regardless of their citizenship.

Golf Canada estimates that tournaments will range between 90 to 120 players, with prizes set at $50,000 per tournament.

Once the tournament concludes, top ranking golfers will receive conditional Mackenzie Tour status for the 2021 Mackenzie Tour, as well as guaranteed tournament starts.

“It was certainly disappointing when circumstances surrounding COVID-19 required us to cancel the 2020 Mackenzie Tour season,” said Scott Pritchard, Mackenzie Tour executive director.

“We were poised for a great summer of golf, but we never lost sight of the purpose for this Tour, which is to give players opportunities to play tournaments on quality golf courses.”",[]

The B.C. Ministry of Agriculture announced Friday that wine produced in the Cowichan Valley would now come with a new “sub-geographical indication”, or sub-GI.

A sub-GI means that at least 95 per cent of the grapes used in one bottle of wine were all grown within the same region.

The sub-GI designation is protected under B.C. law and helps consumers understand where their local wines are made. The designation also provides wine-makers and their local communities with greater exposure to the tourism industry, according to the B.C. government.

The Cowichan Valley joins the ranks of B.C.’s nine official geographical indications, and four other sub-GI’s in the province.

It is the first sub-GI to be located on Vancouver Island, with the other four being located in the Okanagan Valley, in Golden Mile Bench, Naramata Bench, Okanagan Falls and Skaha Bench.

“Officially recognizing the Cowichan Valley as a distinct and unique wine grape-growing region in B.C. is a testament to the hard work, passion and dedication of the many local entrepreneurs and staff in the wine industry,” said Sonia Furstenau, MLA for Cowichan Valley in a release Friday.

“This is a well-deserved accomplishment for all those involved in producing exceptional wines and memorable winery experiences.”",[]

The company, which sails between Victoria and Seattle, WA, says that the ongoing pandemic and border restrictions between Canada and the United States makes restarting operations impossible for the remainder of 2020.

While the ferry service says that it “wholeheartedly” agrees with all health measures put in place by both Canada and the U.S., it notes that summers are an essential travel season for the company.

The Clipper says that its Canadian union employees will continue to be temporarily laid off until operations restart in April.

Canadian employees will then be brought back to work as the ferry service resumes, based off of agreements made between the company and the Unifor Local 114 union.

Meanwhile, employees in Seattle are currently furloughed, save for a small crew of staff that are focusing on essential operations.

“We wholeheartedly agree with the steps and health precautions taken by Canadian and U.S. government officials to date to reduce the risk of coronavirus transmission through non-essential travel,” said David Gudgel, CEO of Clipper in a release Friday.

“Our intent in suspending operations is to hopefully allow ample time to pass so that we may return to service next spring when travel across the border is safe and welcomed once again.”

Finance Minister Carol James said Friday the latest numbers paint a picture of cautious optimism with a long road ahead on B.C.'s path to recovery during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Gains in May and June bring back about 40 per cent of the total number of jobs lost since the start of the pandemic in February, when B.C.'s jobless rate was five per cent, she told a news conference.

The greatest losses have been in the service sector, but James said that's also where jobs are being added as accommodation and food services accounted for half of last month's gains.

Despite positive signs, James said thousands of people and businesses are still struggling, and net job losses stand at 235,000.

She said youth unemployment in particular stands out at 29.1 per cent, up slightly since May, while 45,000 young people did find jobs last month.

Women in B.C. are also more likely to have lost their job due to COVID-19 than men, James said.

She said the high jobless rate in June reflects increased demand for jobs and confidence that people will have the opportunity to return to work once they start looking again.

James also mentioned the loss of international visitors in the tourism sector, particularly in Metro Vancouver and Victoria, as a factor.

Mounties say that an initial single-vehicle collision led to the next two crashes, which reportedly occurred due to drivers looking at previous crash scenes instead of the road.

The first crash occurred Tuesday morning on a southbound stretch of the highway.

Police say that a Sidney/North Saanich RCMP officer attended to the crash and blocked off a section of the highway with their police vehicle, which had its emergency lights on, to secure the scene.

Mounties say that traffic was flowing around the police vehicle without issue until a black SUV collided with the stationary police vehicle.

“The flashing emergency lights, and a large silver police SUV parked in the road was obviously not enough of a deterrent for a driver who wanted to see what the police officers and emergency crews were doing,” said the Sidney/North Saanich RCMP in a release Friday.

The driver of the black SUV was then taken to hospital for treatment of injuries. The police vehicle was unoccupied at the time and no other injuries were reported.

Following this second crash, traffic in both directions of the Pat Bay highway slowed significantly.

Police say that at this time, a third crash occurred because a driver was allegedly looking at the previous crash scenes and was not watching the road.

Mounties say that a vehicle in a northbound lane crashed with another car that was travelling in the same direction. The collision was described as “minor” and both vehicles were fit to drive away from the scene.

“These collisions show how dangerous collision scenes are to first responders, not only from the smoke, debris, fluids and car parts, but other drivers on the road too,” said Cpl Chris Manseau, B.C. RCMP media relations officer.

“Fortunately, these after collisions did not hurt any first responders on the scene.”",[]

Residents of the Oak Bay Lodge are moving out of the long-term care home in the coming days and are moving into a new facility in Victoria called the Summit.

So, with the Oak Bay building soon to be empty, consideration is being given to turning it into a temporary homeless shelter.

Victoria Mayor Lisa Helps introduced a motion Wednesday to the CRD Board of Directors to have its staff look into having the space used as a shelter for the region’s homeless and as a potential COVID-19 hospital should a second wave of the pandemic strike the island.

“There is a vacant building with 238 spaces,” Helps noted Thursday. “And there’s approximately 200 homeless people in the region so we all need to do our part.”

Helps’ motion passed unanimously, including with a vote of support from Oak Bay Mayor Kevin Murdoch.

On Thursday, Murdoch noted that the vote was simply to have staff explore the idea, and is very preliminary in the process.

He said he welcomes having discussions on the topic of using the building as a shelter, but adds that he thinks it’s not an ideal location. Murdoch says there are concerns over the building’s location, which is close to Willows Elementary School and even closer in proximity to Oak Bay High School, which also houses a daycare.

“That site presents a number of issues, frankly,” said Murdoch. “Not least is the state of the building and the fact that there’s a daycare and high school immediately adjacent.”

He also said that since the news of the care-home potentially becoming a shelter was publicized, he has heard from many folks in the community that they are concerned about the potential plan.

""The lion’s share of the response has been, 'Tread very carefully if you’re going to put it there,'"" he said.

Island Health has already indicated that the building isn’t a fit for a COVID-19 hospital.

In the long term, the building will be torn down and the site will be redeveloped

In the short term, CRD staff will consult with BC Housing to see whether it wants to lease the space and what its views are on its viability as a shelter.

Staff are then expected to come back — likely in August — with recommendations on the feasibility of the idea.",[]

Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said collecting the data has been a challenge because the rate of false-positive and false-negative results in current antibody tests can be ""very high,"" but that she hopes to share some details with the public next Thursday.

""The bottom line, from what I've seen so far, is that (the data) reflects what we have seen here in British Columbia – that few people have become infected at a population level,"" Henry said.

Researchers have been trying to weed out false-positives by performing a second test to validate every positive test, something officials said has added ""considerable extra time"" to their efforts.

Their understanding of antibodies has also lagged behind other aspects of the virus because it takes people several weeks to develop antibodies after they've been infected, Henry added.

The first antibody test approved for use by Health Canada was only given the green light in mid-May.

Since then, B.C. researchers have been collecting data on antibodies two ways, one of which has involved comparing blood samples donated in February with others donated in June.

The identities of those donors are kept anonymous, Henry said.

Researchers have also been testing antibodies through community-based sampling, comparing 1,000 samples taken in March and another 1,000 taken at the end of May.

At this point, it's unclear how long COVID-19 antibodies remain in the system, and what level is required to provide immunity from the virus.

One limited study of 74 patients that was published last month in China suggested antibodies do not last as long as similar viruses, particularly among asymptomatic carriers. Researchers found that antibody levels began to decline in as little as eight weeks after patients left hospital.

The news brings B.C.'s total count to 3,028 cases of COVID-19 since the pandemic began.

For the first time, health officials are starting to specify between cases involving Canadian residents and non-Canadian residents in British Columbia.

Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said Thursday that non-resident cases number 51 in B.C., primarily among visitors and temporary foreign workers.

The death toll from the virus in B.C. remains at 186 people.

The province reported no new outbreaks of the virus at health-care centres Thursday, though outbreaks continue at two long-term care homes and one acute-care home.

When asked about B.C.’s newly announced regulations for care home visits, Henry said that the current measures may be expanded in the future.

“This is a start for the visits,” she said.

Some of the visitation rules include limiting each resident to just one dedicated visitor, who must schedule a limited visitation time.

Henry says that health officials are monitoring how this initial visitation reopening goes before it considers expanding the rules.

""British Columbia exists in a world where COVID-19 is more active than ever,"" warned B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix.

""Jurisdictions that we all are conscious of, in the United States, have had their worst days in terms of deaths from COVID-19 today, right now.""

Most of British Columbia's coronavirus cases have been discovered in the Lower Mainland, including 982 cases in the Vancouver Coastal Health region and 1,596 in the Fraser Health region, with adjustments made for non-resident cases.

In the Vancouver Island region, 133 cases have been found, while 201 cases have been diagnosed in the Interior and 65 cases in the province's north, since the pandemic began.

There remain 175 active cases of the virus Thursday, with 17 people in hospital, four of them in critical or acute care.

A Victoria tattoo parlour says it has fired one of its artists after allegations of sexual assault came to light this week, but the business knew about at least one other alleged assault for over a year.

Carne Tattoo in Victoria posted on its Instagram account, saying the company had terminated one of its artists for his ""betrayal of young women"" and of their space.

The post was made on Monday, July 6, after another Instagram user posted a detailed account of an alleged sexual assault by Carne Tattoo artist Dave Hadden, though Carne does not say the posts are connected.

The user claims the incident happened two years ago, when she was 18 years old. She says Hadden slowly moved his fingers between her legs through the course of the tattoo until he eventually had nonconsensual ""digital sex"" with her. She claims he had his fingers inside of her for over half of the four-hour appointment.

The accusations were made on Victims Voices Canada, a page which posts anonymous allegations of abuse, assault, and violence by those in the tattoo and piercing industry.

Hadden, known as TygrDave on Instagram, admitted to the allegations on the social media platform on Tuesday.

""The accusations of me sexually assaulting a client at my former place of employment are true and disgusting, it was a line I should have never crossed,"" Hadded said. ""I am deeply sorry, I do not condone this behavior in anyway shape of form. Theres nothing I can say right now other than that i am so unbelievably sorry. I will be taking a step back from tattooing and seeking professional help.""

One of Hadden's other alleged victims, called 'Sarah' in this article to protect her identity, says she brought a complaint about him to the owners of Carne in March 2019, after first going to the police.

Sarah emailed Carne's co-owner, Kailey Van Der Eyden on March 27, 2019, saying that Hadden had ""put his finger inside"" her, more than once, while she was getting a tattoo.

Van Der Eyden replied saying they would take the issue seriously and with great care, and asked Sarah to speak over the phone.

After that conversation, Sarah says Hadden sent her an apology email, which she said at the time seemed sincere.

""I would like to begin by saying I am truly sorry,"" said Hadden in an email on April 2, 2019. ""I broke a sacred trust that you had instilled to me and I am so ashamed. Ashamed in myself for letting anything like that get to close to even happening. I can't really explain myself, other than I feel so embarrassed.""

In a second email, Hadden said ""I PROMISE nothing will ever come close... ever again.""

Sarah told the Victoria police that she did not want to pursure charges against the artist because she had accepted his apology. The investigating Victoria Police Officer sent her an email dated April 4, 2019.

""I spoke to Dave just now and he told me his side - which I understand he has spoken to you about a couple of times now,"" the VicPD officer wrote. ""I am going to conclude this file as is. I gave him a warning about behaviour, talked about having conversations regarding consent in the future, and how this file could be opened again if you decide so. I agree with you, he does seem sincere and that was a huge mistake of mis-reading the situation.""

Sarah says now that she has seen the post from Carne about Hadden's termination, she wishes she had followed through with her complaint.

""In the post, they're talking about a victim like I don't exist, like just basically erased me is how I felt. There was me who had already reported it 15 months before.""

Sarah says she was insecure about her own appearance and age, thinking that if she came forward no one would believe her.

""I feel like that's what Kailey was looking at me like, like she didn't believe me. I tried to figure out how to reach women... but I had a lot of things in my mind, everyone was praising how wonderful he was and I just thought, approaching people on something like Instagram would open me up for attack from the entire tattoo community. It was so great when this young woman finally posted, now we know it was lots of women.""

Sarah says there is a support group for women who were allegedly assaulted by Hadden, and many have posted comments online detailing inappropriate touching, though she believes that none have filed complaints with the police.

VicPD spokesperson Bowen Osoko says as a department, they believe victims, and explained how it can happen that a complaint could be made and no charges laid.

""A person who has experienced sexual assault has already been in a situation where their power has been taken away and that's not okay, and we as a police department don't want to participate in furthering that, in doing that to them again. So that's why we really let the person who is making that report guide us and partner with us and set the stage for what they want to do. So someone may want to make a report but may not want to proceed with charges and that's okay, and that's someone's right and ability.""

Osoko says in that situation, they will identity the suspect, possibly speak with them and gather evidence in case the victim does want to pursue something in the future.

In a statement from Carne Tattoo released Wednesday afternoon, the business acknowledged that allegations of sexual assault had been brought to their attention over a year ago:

""In March of 2019, we received an email from a customer alleging that the now terminated member of our staff had sexually assaulted her while working on her tattoo,"" the statement said.

""At the time, we worked closely with the survivor to determine a path forward. It was our understanding that the situation had been resolved to the satisfaction of the survivor.

In retrospect, we should have terminated this employee immediately as this disgusting behaviour has no home in our industry or our shop and our failure to immediately act upheld a system that protects aggressors and continues the cycle of victimization. This situation and the decisions that followed were made by the shop’s management. Our other artists were not aware of the situation that occurred.

Up until this past weekend, we were not aware of any similar incidents perpetrated by this member of our staff; however, it is now clear that this employee’s actions were not a one-off, but rather a piece of a disturbing pattern. When we were made aware of other alleged assaults on social media, we moved quickly to terminate the employment of the artist.

We have always put the safety of our clients first and we are extremely troubled that these actions could have taken place at our shop. In response, we have begun to implement new hiring policies, changed our internal practices, and scheduled our staff to participate in Safer Spaces Training, which will be mandatory going forward. These new measures will help us work to ensure that this does not happen in our shop again.""

At the time of this publication, Hadden did not respond to CFAX 1070's request for comment.

Hadden has not been charged and none of the alegations have been tested in court.",[]

Abby Morris is the owner of Crabby Bob's Seafood at the marina where the garbage bags were found floating in the water.

""It just doesn't make sense to me why you would dump your actual garbage bags into the harbour,"" Morris said. ""It would be one thing if you just showed up and dumped a bunch of food in the water because, of course, the creatures would take care of that, but they don't take care of plastic.""

A surveillance camera captured the man backing his pickup onto the dock and then dumping a plastic barrel full of trash off the edge of the dock, followed by several tied garbage bags.

Phyllis Titus is the marina's manager and reviewed video of the incident, which occurred at 5:27 a.m. on July 7.

""He dumped what looked to us, (to be) frozen food that thawed from a freezer. There was fish, there was bread, apples, all in plastic zip-lock bags and then also inside plastic garbage bags,"" Titus said.

The incident happened right next to an open dumpster, which Titus found puzzling. She posted an image from a surveillance camera on Facebook and tips from the public started coming in immediately.

""Even though it's a large town, it's a small town at the same time and everyone wants to protect the ocean,"" she said.

Dock attendant Rylan Fisher was tasked with helping retrieve the bags from the water and the rocks under the pier.

""It was brutal,"" Fisher said. ""It was the worst smell I have ever encountered. There was a few full fish in them, there was sausages, dry freezer bags and random food items.""

The dumping left Morris disappointed.

""It actually made me embarrassed to be a human being yesterday,"" she said.

Titus reported the incident to various agencies which she said are looking into the matter. She said she'd also like to have a talk with the person involved and hopes he'll come and make his amends to staff that had to clean up the mess he left behind.",[]

Premier John Horgan says he supports police chiefs from across Canada who are calling for the decriminalization of illicit drugs for personal use.

The Canadian Association of Police Chiefs announced Thursday that it endorses the decriminalization of drug possession and is calling for a national task force to research drug policy reforms.

""If not now, when?"" the premier responded Thursday to a question about decriminalizing drugs amid B.C.'s ongoing opioid crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic.

""We're in the midst of a global pandemic when it comes to COVID-19. In British Columbia that is further complicated by an overdose crisis which saw last month the highest monthly number of deaths that we've seen in a good long time,"" Horgan said.

In a statement Thursday, the head of the Canadian Association of Police Chiefs (CAPC) said the role of frontline officers has already shifted away from traditional enforcement toward harm reduction.

“Canada continues to grapple with the fentanyl crisis and a poisoned drug supply that has devastated our communities and taken thousands of lives,” said CAPC president and Vancouver police Chief Adam Palmer.

""We recommend that enforcement for possession give way to an integrated health-focused approach that requires partnerships between police, healthcare and all levels of government.""

The BC Coroners service announced last month that more drug users died in May in British Columbia than in any other month in the province's history.

""Anything we can do to reduce the deaths and to reduce the dependence and to, quite frankly, free up law enforcement to do other things, I support,"" Horgan said.

The premier said his government is limited in what it can do as drug policy and enforcement is a federal issue, but said he has ""made it clear to the prime minister where British Columbia stands.""

Horgan said the years-long opioid epidemic in B.C. is proof that a change to drug policy is required.

""I don’t have experience – serious experience – with addictions, other than being a smoker in my past,"" Horgan said.

""But we need as a society to come together and say, 'We cannot allow our brothers and sisters, our mothers and fathers, our neighbours to continue to succumb to overdose deaths because we're not prepared to do everything we can to reduce that likelihood.""",[]

“When I was about four years old, my father gave me my first camera,” Colin says.

His dad was a photographer while serving with Princess Patricia’s Canadian Light Infantry in Korea and taught his son the potential power of pictures.

""'You know you’ll forget things over time,'"" Colin recalls his dad saying. ""'But if you take pictures, you’ll never forget.'""

A couple years later, Colin’s mom offered him a different perspective.

“‘Taking pictures is great,’” his mom said. “‘But you really should write everything down.’”

So Colin decided to do both.

His daily journals — which he continued for decades — began in 1973, chronicling the mundane (""I talked on the phone to D. for 20 minutes"") to the momentous (""John Lennon is dead"").

Colin’s collection of more than 10,000 photographs documents the people, places, and paraphernalia that create a community.

“The theme that runs through my photo collection is change and development,” Colin says.

He has observed how fashions have evolved, buildings were demolished and rebuilt, and the cost of gas has risen from 39 cents.

“Victoria in the '80s was a different place,” Colin says. “We were like a small town and now we’re a wonderful big city.”

Colin says the Victoria Archives has agreed to take his entire collection so future generations can take a deep look at the world around them, as Colin’s parents inspired him to do.

“That’s what’s stuck with me my entire life,” Colin says. “When you take a picture or make an observation, look at it from a variety of different perspectives, get the whole picture.”

That picture — Colin wrote in a recent post to the Old Victoria Facebook group — just might show you that Victoria “despite its flaws features inexhaustible beauty that permeates time and place, tireless beauty that will astound you, if you let it.”",[]

Police say the incident occurred Tuesday at 4:15 p.m. at Brydon Park when the victim of the alleged attack was walking in the area.

Ted Penston tells CTV News that he and his wife, as well as many other people in the park, witnessed a man repeatedly striking his dog.

“A fella was walking through the park with his pit bull in a chokehold and he threw it on the ground. Then he kicked it and kicked it, picked it up, threw it down, kicked it again and picked it up by the throat and kicked it again,” said Penston.

“Finally, my wife said, ‘You have to do something.’”

That’s when Penston says he confronted the man. The pair exchanged heated words before the man allegedly tried to strike Penston.

“He came up to me and threw a punch at me, it just missed my head,” said the Saanich resident.

“I moved out of the way, then I lost my balance and I hit the ground. And then he (hit) me in the guts.”

Police say the man then fled the park and placed his dog inside of a car before driving away.

Penston says the man threw the dog “like a sack of tomatoes” into the trunk of the car and other witnesses of the incident told police that they also saw the man drive away.

Witnesses added that the man returned to the park shortly after to retrieve another one of his dogs, say police.

On social media, witnesses say that multiple families, including children, were in the park at the time.

One child wrote a note to Penston after the attack, saying, “Thank you for standing up for that dog and risking your own safety to help. I hope that the police catch that evil man before he can hurt more dogs. P.S. Great reflexes.”

Penston, who has lived in the area for roughly 30 years, says his family has never seen anything like this before.

""All the people and the ladies here and everybody couldn’t believe how he was treating the dog. He was just kicking it and kicking it and throwing it. It was the worst we’d ever seen,"" he said.

""I just couldn’t watch it anymore.""

Penston says that the punch only ""grazed"" him and that besides some slight soreness on his side, he is otherwise uninjured.

He says he hopes police will confiscate the man’s dog and arrest him for assault, as well as barring him from owning any animals in the future.

Police say that the man is described as a white male who stands roughly 5’ 10” with a heavy build. He has dark short hair and was wearing a grey T-shirt, blue jeans and black shoes at the time. He also has a tattoo on his right bicep.

His vehicle is described as a dark blue Volkswagen Golf four-door car.

The man’s dog is described as a medium-sized animal with a black spot over one eye.

“We are hoping that this person comes forward and identifies himself to police. However, at this point he has not,” said Saanich Police Const. Markus Anastasiades in a release Wednesday.

“As a result, we are looking for the public’s help in identifying him as well as to check the welfare of both of his dogs.”

Given the gravity of the new coronavirus pandemic and the abrupt decision to place the NHL season on pause in March, it didn't take commissioner Gary Bettman and union chief Don Fehr long to realize they were going to have to work together if play was to resume any time soon.

Nearly four months to the day since the last puck dropped, the two sides put aside past differences to have a return-to-play plan in place, and the assurance of labour peace through September 2026 to go with it.

“When we got to March 12 and decided to take the pause, that began a period of perhaps unprecedented collaboration and problem solving,” Bettman said during a Zoom conference call with reporters Saturday, a day after the league and players ratified a 24-team expanded playoff, set to begin Aug. 1, and a four-year extension of the collective bargaining agreement.

“It was a recognition by both sides that we were being confronted with an incredibly difficult, a novel, unprecedented situation. I believed we would get to this point because it was the right thing to do for the game and for everybody involved in the game.”

Fehr, the NHL Players' Association executive director, not only agreed with Bettman, but went out of his way to credit the owners for the approach

“I was persuaded well before the end of March that not only was this different, but it was being approached in a fundamentally different way. I always thought we would find a way to reach an agreement,” Fehr said.

The bond established between the two was apparent during the 55-minute session, with Fehr agreeing with Bettman and then acknowledging how unusual that was by by saying: “I think that indicates something about the approach that was taken in these talks.”

Training camps are set to open Monday, which also represents the deadline for players to determine whether to opt out without penalty. If all goes as planned, teams will depart for their two respective hub cities, Toronto and Edmonton, Alberta, on July 26 to open a two-month playoff leading to the awarding of the Stanley Cup.

Many uncertainties remain, with Bettman and Fehr unable to provide definitive answers.

While acknowledging the likelihood of players testing positive for COVID-19, deputy commissioner Bill Daly was unable to say how many players would have to do so for the league to postpone or cancel the playoffs altogether.

Though conference playoffs and Stanley Cup Final are scheduled to be held in Edmonton, a person with direct knowledge of the plans told The Associated Press the site might change if the pandemic spikes in Alberta's capital. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because it is an alternate plan that's not been discussed publicly.

Bettman and Daly, who are based in New York, weren't even sure if or when they could cross the border to personally attend games because those entering Canada are required to self-isolate for a 14-day period.

The only certainty is the NHL became North America's latest professional sport to forge a path back to playing, but minus the public hiccups experienced by its counterparts.

Major League Baseball's season was nearly scuttled before the two sides agreed to a 60-game format. Less than three weeks before NFL training camps are set to open, the league is experiencing push-back from its players on whether to play preseason games next month. Major League Soccer has had two teams already withdrawing from competition because of the number of players testing positive for the coronavirus.

And not only is hockey on the verge of returning, the CBA extension assures 12 straight years of labour peace, the NHL's longest stretch since Bettman took over in 1993. During that time, play has been halted three times by lockouts, the last in 2012-13, when the season was shortened to 48 games.

“I think Don and I both recognize labour peace was something we couldn't even quantify how important it was,” Bettman said. “But we both knew that for the business of the game to come back strong, there was enough disruption going on in the world that we didn't have to add to it.”

Fehr said the months-long talks to reach a solution were a matter of perseverance.

“This is a very bad analogy, but you have to sort of navigate the kayak in a storm until the storm's over, and then make sure the kayak isn't full of holes so that you can go on and sail it in calmer seas,” Fehr said in a separate interview with The AP. “Or to put it another way there was never any pretense that this was business as usual.”

Owners benefit because they can generate much-needed revenue through sponsorships and advertising, even though games will be played in empty arenas.

Though players will likely lose a portion of their salaries for seasons to come to make up for 50-50 split of revenue, they benefit from a CBA that includes the possibility of returning to the Olympics, after the NHL opted out from the 2018 Winter Games in South Korea. The new labour agreement also addressed players' demands to gain a post-career subsidy for health care.

The league and NHL Players' Association announced Friday the return-to-play protocols - featuring Toronto and Edmonton as hub cities - and a four-year extension to the current collective bargaining agreement have been ratified.

The NHL board of governors and the union's full membership gave the documents, which were tied together in an all-or-nothing bundle, the thumbs up in separate votes.

“It was pretty civil,” Vancouver Canucks captain Bo Horvat said of negotiations on the deal that was tentatively agreed to Monday. “We're happy to get things going.”

Bringing the hubs to Canada, where coronavirus infection rates are largely under control, proved to be the logical choice after a significant spike in cases across the United States in recent weeks.

“While we have all worked very hard to try to address the risks of COVID-19, we know that health and safety are and will continue to be our priorities,” NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said in a statement. “We know that all of our fans are excited about our return to the ice.”

Training camps for the 24 teams primed to compete in the league's restart to a 2019-20 campaign that was suspended March 12 are scheduled to begin Monday - also the deadline for players to opt out of participating with no penalty - in each franchise's home market.

The plan will then see Eastern Conference clubs report to Toronto on July 26, while those from the Western Conference head to Edmonton before the games resume Aug. 1. The conference finals and Stanley Cup will be held in Edmonton as part of a first-of-its-kind NHL Final Four that could stretch all the way to Oct. 4 and result in next season being pushed into December or early January.

Once in Canada's largest city and Alberta's capital, players are set to be kept away from the general public in so-called “bubbles” that include strict health measures, daily testing, and mostly confine teams to hotels and empty arenas.

The extension of the current CBA, which was slated to expire in September 2022 and now runs through at least the 2025-26 season, provides both players and owners clarity on a number of challenging financial realities caused by COVID-19.

It also give the green light for negotiations with the International Olympic Committee and the International Ice Hockey Federation on participation at the 2022 and 2026 Winter Games. The NHL skipped the 2018 Olympics after taking part in five straight between 1998 and 2014.

The salary cap's upper limit will remain at US$81.5 million in 2020-21 and stay there until hockey-related revenue returns to $4.8 billion - this season's projected total prior to the pandemic. Players have agreed to defer 10 per cent of next year's salaries, and have owners pay that back over three consecutive seasons starting in 2022-23.

“This agreement is a meaningful step forward for the players and owners, and for our game, in a difficult and uncertain time,” NHLPA executive director Don Fehr said. “We are pleased to be able to bring NHL hockey back.”

Escrow payments, a consistent thorn in the side of players that guarantees a 50/50 split of HRR with owners, will be capped at 20 per cent in 2020-21, and decrease throughout the deal. If teams are still owed money following the 2025-26 campaign, the CBA will be extended another season.

The agreement marks the first time in Bettman's 27-year tenure as commissioner the NHL has bridged two CBAs without a work stoppage. Both the 1994-95 and 2012-13 seasons were cut to 48 games because of lockouts, while the 2004-05 campaign was cancelled.

Alberta Premier Jason Kenney was the most outspoken politician with regards to having his province host one of the hubs, pointing to a low infection rate and Edmonton's facilities.

He also penned a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in hopes of securing a waiver for the NHL when it came to Canada's mandatory 14-day quarantine for anyone arriving in the country. The federal government approved the league's proposal of a cohort quarantine last month, granting an exception that paved the way for Toronto and Edmonton to get the nod as hubs.

Speaking outside Rogers Place, Kenney said Friday's news will create jobs and millions of dollars in economic activity.

“The Stanley Cup is coming back to Edmonton, to Alberta,” Kenney said in a video posted to Twitter as he stood next to a statue of Wayne Gretzky. “We are going to get an unbelievable amount of free advertising across North America and around the world that will set us up well for the future relaunch of our tourism industry when travel comes back post-COVID.”

The Cup was last awarded in Edmonton when Gretzky hoisted it over his head for a fourth and final time on May 26, 1988.

Each team will be permitted to bring a maximum of 52 people into the bubbles, including a maximum of 31 players.

Meanwhile, it was also announced the NHL draft lottery's second phase has been tabbed for Aug. 10. The eight losing teams from the qualifying round will have an equal shot at the first pick in the draft, which is tentatively scheduled for Oct. 9-10.

Much like Kenney, Ontario Premier Doug Ford and Toronto Mayor John Tory supported their city's hub potential.

“There is no better place for the NHL season to continue,” Tory said. “We will make sure we put on a great show for the game of hockey ... while following all proper health and safety protocols.”

Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist at Toronto General Hospital, said choosing to hold the NHL's restart in Canada reduces the overall risk, but it's far from a fool-proof endeavour.

“We'd be blind to think that there isn't COVID-19 in Canada, there's just significantly less of it here compared to parts of the U.S.,” he said. “Everyone has to pay close attention to COVID-19 because even with the best laid plans, there still can be small weaknesses that might be exploited by this virus.”

Vancouver was the other Canadian city originally in the running to host, along with seven American markets, before the provincial government expressed concerns about the NHL's health and safety protocols.

Ford was asked prior to Friday's announcement why the plan worked for his province when it didn't for British Columbia.

“They have very stringent rules and regulations for their players,” Ford said of the NHL. “When they told me (players are) getting tested every single day, I'm no medical professional, but I don't think they need testing every day.”

The 24-team format - which includes every Canadian franchise, save for Ottawa - will see the top-4 clubs from both the East and West play mini-tournaments to determine playoff seeding, while the other 16 will battle in a never-before-seen qualifying round.

Boston, Tampa Bay, Washington and Philadelphia are set to compete for the No. 1 slot in the East, while defending champions St. Louis, Colorado, Vegas and Dallas will do the same out West.

The East's best-of-five qualifying series include Pittsburgh vs. Montreal, Carolina vs. New York Rangers, New York Islanders vs. Florida and Toronto vs. Columbus. In the West, the matchups are Edmonton vs. Chicago, Nashville vs. Arizona, Vancouver vs. Minnesota and Calgary vs. Winnipeg.

In all, there will be as many as 52 games played over the first nine days before the teams get a break on Aug. 10.

The four winners of the best-of-five series in each conference will then be pitted against the top-4 seeds to fill out the usual 16-team playoff bracket.

There could, however, still be choppy waters before the 2019-20 season can actually resume.

Players won't be quarantined during training camp, but instead asked to practise physical distancing when not at the rink in hopes isolation and testing will be enough to avoid any outbreaks.

Of the 396 NHLers tested at team facilities between June 8 and Monday during voluntary workouts, 23 results came back positive. The league said it's also aware of 12 other positive tests for players not taking part in those optional sessions.

The Stanley Cup has been awarded every year since 1893, except for 1919 because of the Spanish flu outbreak and in 2005 when the lockout scratched the entire season.

There's now a firm plan in place to - hopefully - see it handed out this fall.

Graves'],2020-07-10 03:51:00-04:00,"SPARTA, KY. -- Austin Cindric answered the nagging question of when he'll finally conquer an oval.

In fact, he did it so well at Kentucky Speedway the issue now is whether an encore is possible.

Cindric won the first of two NASCAR Xfinity Series races at Kentucky, charging past Chase Briscoe on an overtime restart Thursday night for his first victory of the season and first of his career on an oval.

""I don't care what shape the track is -- if it's dirt, oval, I don't care I'm just so happy this Ford Mustang is in Victory Lane,"" Cindric said.

Cindric spent most of the first two stages chasing Noah Gragson, the pole-sitter who seemed poised to dominate all three segments. Cindric then took charge on a series of restarts in Team Penske's No. 22 Ford. On the last one, he went around Briscoe on the outside and pulled away before a scary last-lap wreck ended the race.

The accident involved Justin Allgaier, who was transported to a hospital for further evaluation.

The 21-year-old Cindric, son of Team Penske president Tim Cindric, had eight top-10s with six top-fives on ovals before breaking through on the 1.5-mile Kentucky layout. His only other series victories came last year on road courses at Watkins Glen and Mid-Ohio.

""We've come so close all year,"" added Cindric, who led twice for 41 laps. ""These guys have given me so many awesome race-winning cars. ... This is awesome. I'd love to be able to come back into another performance like that tomorrow night, but all the credit to my guys for getting me here.""

The race ended up going 204 miles. A 300-miler is set for Friday night in the series' first doubleheader at Kentucky.

Rookie Riley Herbst was second in a Toyota, followed by Ross Chastain in a Chevy, Briscoe in a Ford and Michael Annett in a Chevy.

""We over-adjusted the car there at the end and got too tight,"" Herbst said. ""All in all, we've had speed all year, we just haven't been able to capitalize, mostly on my part, in these final stages of the races. Once we start capitalizing, we'll start getting good finishes like this. This was a good one.""

Gragson dominated the first two 30-lap stages, a first for the driver who turns 22 on Wednesday, but faded to finish 11th.

Briscoe entered the race red hot with consecutive victories at Pocono and Indianapolis and three in his past four starts. He started seventh and eventually drew Gragson in his sights by Lap 50.

He was in the hunt late and appeared in good position for a three-peat before a wiggle allowed Cindric to get the edge.

""I just got loose,"" Briscoe said. ""I thought I was gonna be able to clear him and I just got too loose and about wrecked the thing and then I don't know if I just made the right-rear mad or what, I was literally wrecking both ends after that.""",[]

The Israel Start-Up Nation outfit and the signing of Froome as team leader are the brainchild of Sylvan Adams.

""We are committed to building a supportive Grand Tour team around Chris, such that we can make history together, as we compete to be the best, and achieve our principal goal: winning the Tour de France,"" said Adams.

Cycling's Grand Tour races are the Giro d'Italia, the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España. Froome has won all of them during his carer.

Adams helped establish the first professional cycling team in Israel in 2015, called the Israel Cycling Academy, which included riders from Israel and abroad.

The team made its first major mark on the international scene three years later, when Adams brought the opening stages of the 2018 Giro d'Italia to Jerusalem. It was the first time that any stage of the race had taken place outside of Europe.

This year, the team was granted a WorldTour license, ensuring the riders will compete in the sport's biggest races, chief among them the Tour de France.

'BEST RIDER OF HIS GENERATION'

""Chris is the best rider of his generation and will lead our Tour de France and Grand Tour squad,"" said Adams.

""We hope to make history together as Chris pursues further Tour de France and Grand Tour victories, achievements that would make a serious case for Chris to be considered the greatest cyclist of all time.""

The long-term signing means the 35-year-old British cyclist will likely finish his illustrious career with the upstart team.

""I'm really excited to be joining the ISN family. I look forward to challenging and being challenged by their talent and continuing to strive for the success that I've enjoyed up to now,"" Froome said.

Froome will compete this season with Team Ineos, formerly known as Team Sky, with which he won his four Tour de France titles, as well as wins at the Vuelta a Espana and the Giro d'Italia.

Now aged 35, Froome sustained ""multiple serious injuries,"" including a fractured leg, in a horrific crash during a practice ride in France in June 2019.

This year's Tour de France, originally scheduled to start on June 27, has been pushed back by organizer, the Amaury Sport Organization, to 29 August due to the pandemic.

Froome is one victory away from equaling the record number of Tour wins held by Jacques Anquetil, Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault and Miguel Indurain.",[]

Leonard's absence was excused and he is expected to join the team at the Disney complex near Orlando sometime in the next few days, said the person who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the team did not publicly disclose the matter.

Yahoo Sports first reported that Leonard was not on the flight to the Orlando area.

The Clippers are scheduled to spend Thursday and part of Friday satisfying quarantine requirements, and are expected to practice for the first time at Disney on Friday night. They will resume game play on July 30, matching up with the Los Angeles Lakers in the second game of a re-opening night doubleheader.

Leonard is averaging a team-best 26.9 points this season for the Clippers, who are currently second in the Western Conference behind only the Lakers. He is the reigning NBA Finals MVP, after helping Toronto win the title last season.

456,ctvnews,https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/current-and-former-blue-jays-sound-off-on-twitter-about-stadium-bubble-setup-1.5019768,Current and former Blue Jays sound off on Twitter about stadium bubble setup,['Gregory Strong'],2020-07-10 18:34:00-04:00,"TORONTO -- A packed summer training camp schedule has the Toronto Blue Jays squeezing in workouts, practice sessions and intrasquad games ahead of a fast-approaching regular season.

The team's news cycle followed a similar model Friday.

Infielder Travis Shaw got things rolling with a string of tweets about the team's closed environment at Rogers Centre and adjoining hotel. Manager Charlie Montoyo then dropped news that Vladimir Guerrero Jr., would be moving to first base. And finally there was word that players who spent the week in Florida had arrived in town.

There is no shortage of storylines in this one-of-a-kind summer that's only just beginning. Where things go from here is anyone's guess.

A main issue remains where the Blue Jays will play home games this season. The federal government granted the team approval to modify the 14-day quarantine rule during the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing training camp to begin this week at the domed stadium.

""I'm glad that we're here,"" Montoyo said on a conference call. ""I really am and we're going to follow all the guidelines. I promise you that.""

Earlier in the day, Shaw voiced his concern about the length of time players may need to stay in their current environment. He replied to a tweet from TSN reporter Scott Mitchell, who reported that multiple sources told him players could face a $750,000 fine and potential jail time if seen outside the ballpark -- which also are maximum punishments in the Quarantine Act.

""We were told two weeks... not all summer... all summer is a bit much,"" Shaw tweeted.

We were told two weeks... not all summer... all summer is a bit much https://t.co/6S7euLbHWA — Travis Shaw (@travis_shaw21) July 10, 2020

New York Mets pitcher Marcus Stroman, who spent five seasons with the Blue Jays, added more fuel to the social-media fire when he replied to Mitchell's tweet.

""This is absolutely ridiculous,"" Stroman tweeted, adding in a subsequent post: ""Guys are going to be walking around in full disguises. Lol.""

In an email reply, the club confirmed that before arriving in Toronto, players understood the maximum penalties for leaving the Rogers Centre footprint during camp.

The team has expressed its desire to play home games at the dome during the 60-game regular season. A decision is expected in the coming days.

Players are expected to be advised of specifics on the setup for the upcoming campaign once a finalized plan is in place.

Toronto will travel to Boston for pre-season games July 21 and 22 before the season opener July 24 at Tampa Bay. The Blue Jays' first home game is set for July 29 against Washington.

If Rogers Centre is ruled out for the season, the Blue Jays would likely play at TD Ballpark at their spring-training facility in Dunedin, Fla., but that backup plan has not been finalized.

Florida has been dealing with a spike in COVID-19 cases of late. The state reported 11,385 new cases on Friday while Ontario reported just 116 new cases.

Shaw, who signed with the Blue Jays last December, posted two additional tweets after his original reply but they were later deleted.

""1) Let me be clear. We are on board with the TWO week quarantine. I currently have a PAID for condo a block away from the stadium that I can't use. At no point would I risk public safety or not follow rules. Is it wrong to want to live in a place that I've already paid for...""

He added: ""2) to be able to go on a walk (WITH A MASK) to be able to get fresh air, walk to go get takeout food (not eat inside). We aren't looking to party, hit the patios, go out at night, anything like that. Public safety is priority number 1....""

As Major League Baseball's lone Canadian team, the Blue Jays face an additional hurdle because of the border and quarantine rules during the pandemic. Players and team staff have been isolating from the general public in the so-called 'bubble' of the stadium and hotel at the north end of the building.

""I wanna make it clear, we're not asking for special treatment,"" Blue Jays outfielder Randal Grichuk tweeted Friday. ""We understand that we need to stay in a ""quarantine bubble"". We wanna make sure everyone is safe.

""The toughest part is them not allowing our family to come with us. That's what makes it tough for a lot of guys.""

The Blue Jays have not commented on reports that a single player recently tested positive for COVID-19 in Florida. The positive result forced 12 players to remain in Dunedin, according to USA Today.

Most players -- about 46 in total, Montoyo said earlier in the week -- flew to Toronto on a charter last Sunday.

Without providing specifics, Montoyo said other players arrived in town Thursday and planned to work out before the team's intrasquad game Friday evening.

During his 15-minute video call with reporters, Montoyo confirmed that Guerrero would cross the diamond and focus on first base.

""It's all about a player having the best chance to compete,"" Montoyo said. ""It's going to be a short season. So for me, the best (plan) for Vlad is to play first, DH and also play third.""

Guerrero, who hit 15 homers and drove in 69 runs in his rookie season, said he was on board.

""Wherever the team needs me, I'm going to be ready,"" he said via translator Hector Lebron. ""So I'm OK with that.""

While he was expecting to step outside to play hockey with his big brother, a few other players wanted to join in. Among them was NHL star and Sudbury's own Tyler Bertuzzi.

""What I heard is we're just going to take a couple (of) shots, (then) go swimming,"" Lukah said. ""So my big brother mentioned something about the news and stuff … so I walked out the door and I just see a bunch of people there!""

Accompanying Bertuzzi was Sudbury Wolves winger Gio Biondi, who has stopped by a few times before to play with Lukah, a goalie in the Sudbury Minor Hockey Association.

""Just the fact that I thought it would be a normal day and then all of this happened,"" said Lukah, moments after playing with the NHL star.

Nine-year-old Lukah was diagnosed with a brain tumour in November 2019. The devastating diagnosis came just a few months after his aunt faced a similar situation.

""Hearing the news is surreal, it's shocking,"" said Lisa Labrecque, Lukah's mother. ""But we're working with doctors in Toronto and (getting) scans every five months.""

After noticing Lukah was often fatigued and suffering from headaches, the family doctor suggested an MRI, given the recent family history.

""We try not to talk about it,"" said Lisa. ""I don't want to bring him down or get him frustrated or scared, so we treat him like a nine-year-old boy.""

Following his most recent scans earlier this month, that is exactly the advice given to the family by physicians.

With no growth in the tumour, Lukah was told to continue to live life as he normally would.

Despite the recent positive outlook, the last year has not been an easy time for the Labrecque family. That's when friend and community activist Kim Brouzes decided that a morale boost was in order.

""So I contacted Tyler Bertuzzi and said ‘this kid could use a good day, a good memory, certainly a good experience,’"" said Brouzes. ""So Tyler jumped on board … Luca got to deflect or play goalie against a Sudbury Wolves player and an NHL player and it worked beautifully!""

Brouzes and Bertuzzi are now spearheading the annual NHL Charity Golf Tournament, which had to be cancelled this year due to concerns surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic.

With funding needed for local agencies, such as the Northern Ontario Families of Children with Cancer (NOFCC), Brouzes realized Bertuzzi's smile provided a unique opportunity to sell face-masks showing off his infamous toothless grin.

""What we did was we recreated Tyler Bertuzzi's smile, missing the one tooth, so it is a smile that you can't miss and can't replace,"" laughed Brouzes, while wearing one herself.

Knowing the cause was important and was helping families such as the Labrecques, Bertuzzi was on board.

""It's funny,"" said Bertuzzi. ""It's a little bit of both, obviously the safety part of it, but the funny part of it (too). It's going to be good and I'm excited to get these sold and get the money to charity.""

The masks are being sold for $70, with all funds going directly to the NOFCC, which works to provide financial relief for families of children fighting cancer. The organization helps those families cover costs such as travel expenses and medications not covered by OHIP and tutoring costs.

""This is a wonderful replacement for (the charity golf tournament),"" said Dayna Caruso, executive director of the NOFCC. ""We're definitely always looking for fundraisers that we can accomplish from a distance throughout this time because NOFCC doesn't have a lot of funding coming in, but obviously over the last couple of days we've seen some very great initiatives come out of the community.""

For families like the Labrecques, relying on support like that and from the community is priceless.

Not only did the two hockey players show up for Lukah, so did nearly two dozen neighbours and friends, who were all gathered in social bubbles to show their support.

""I can't even say enough for this community,"" said Brouzes. ""So within a few minutes and with a few phone calls…we had half the community here cheering on Lukah. But more importantly, showing him for a brief moment the heat doesn't matter, the brain tumour doesn't matter and he got an experience of a lifetime that he will remember for a lifetime.""

In addition to the priceless memories, Lukah left with some tangible gifts, including a signed hockey stick and one of the new Bertuzzi face masks.

Missing from the action was Sudbury's other major NHL star, Nick Foligno, captain of the Columbus Blue Jackets. But he made sure to send Lukah a video greeting to show his support.

That message, along with nearly a few dozen neighbours, was enough to overwhelm the family with gratitude.

""What do you say to that? There (are) no words,"" said Lisa. ""Holding his hand in the MRI machine versus this, you can't compare. This is amazing.""

Those sentiments echoed by her son.

""It means everybody is here to look out for me,"" said Lukah.

If you would like more information on purchasing a Tyler Bertuzzi face mask, you can email kim@atrcc.ca, follow the social media channels of Active Therapy+ or contact the NOFCC.",[]

With funding needed for local agencies, such as the Northern Ontario Families of Children with Cancer (NOFCC), Brouzes realized Bertuzzi's smile provided a unique opportunity to sell face-masks showing off his infamous toothless grin.

""What we did was we recreated Tyler Bertuzzi's smile, missing the one tooth, so it is a smile that you can't miss and can't replace,"" laughed Brouzes, while wearing one herself.

Knowing the cause was important and was helping families such as the Labrecques, Bertuzzi was on board.

""It's funny,"" said Bertuzzi. ""It's a little bit of both, obviously the safety part of it, but the funny part of it (too). It's going to be good and I'm excited to get these sold and get the money to charity.""

The masks are being sold for $70, with all funds going directly to the NOFCC, which works to provide financial relief for families of children fighting cancer. The organization helps those families cover costs such as travel expenses and medications not covered by OHIP and tutoring costs.

""This is a wonderful replacement for (the charity golf tournament),"" said Dayna Caruso, executive director of the NOFCC. ""We're definitely always looking for fundraisers that we can accomplish from a distance throughout this time because NOFCC doesn't have a lot of funding coming in, but obviously over the last couple of days we've seen some very great initiatives come out of the community.""

For families like the Labrecques, relying on support like that and from the community is priceless.

Not only did the two hockey players show up for Lukah, so did nearly two dozen neighbours and friends, who were all gathered in social bubbles to show their support.

""I can't even say enough for this community,"" said Brouzes. ""So within a few minutes and with a few phone calls…we had half the community here cheering on Lukah. But more importantly, showing him for a brief moment the heat doesn't matter, the brain tumour doesn't matter and he got an experience of a lifetime that he will remember for a lifetime.""

In addition to the priceless memories, Lukah left with some tangible gifts, including a signed hockey stick and one of the new Bertuzzi face masks.

Missing from the action was Sudbury's other major NHL star, Nick Foligno, captain of the Columbus Blue Jackets. But he made sure to send Lukah a video greeting to show his support.

That message, along with nearly a few dozen neighbours, was enough to overwhelm the family with gratitude.

""What do you say to that? There (are) no words,"" said Lisa. ""Holding his hand in the MRI machine versus this, you can't compare. This is amazing.""

Those sentiments echoed by her son.

""It means everybody is here to look out for me,"" said Lukah.

As part of the 24-team blueprint to resume the 2019-20 campaign halted March 12 because of COVID-19, Toronto and Edmonton were also officially unveiled as hub cities.

Mayor Don Iveson issued a statement on Friday afternoon about the NHL’s decision to choose Edmonton as a hub city.

“A score for Edmonton! I’m very happy to hear that our city will be one of the NHL hub cities. Bringing hockey here will generate a real boost to Edmonton’s economy. We can’t wait to delight hockey fans and show off everything our beautiful city has to offer.”

“We know that Edmonton’s low COVID-19 cases was one of the reasons our city was a top contender, and our low cases can be directly attributed to Edmontonians who have been working hard to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and who have been, by and large, following the excellent public health guidance Alberta Health Services has given. So keep up the good work Edmonton!”

Training camps will open Monday in each team's home market, with clubs scheduled to head to their respective hubs July 26 before games start to count Aug. 1.

The 12 Eastern Conference teams will start in Toronto, with the 12 Western Conference teams off to Edmonton. The conference finals and Stanley Cup final will be in Edmonton.

Once in Toronto and Edmonton, players will be kept in so-called bubbles - tightly-controlled circles with stringent health protocols and daily testing - separate from the general public in hopes of keeping the novel coronavirus at bay.

The extension of the CBA, which had been set to expire in September 2022, was viewed as a crucial aspect of the return-to-play plan because of the dire economic realities brought on by COVID-19. The new deal runs through at least the 2025-26 season.

“Today, the NHL and the NHLPA announced a significant agreement that addresses the uncertainty everyone is dealing with, the framework for the completion of the 2019-20 season and the foundation for the continued long-term growth of our league,” NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said in a statement.

NHL executive director Don Fehr said the agreement was “a meaningful step forward for the players and owners, and for our game, in a difficult and uncertain time.”

The second phase of the NHL draft lottery will be Aug. 10, with the eight losing teams in the play-in round entered to determine who gets the first pick in the NHL draft, tentatively scheduled for Oct. 9-10.

The last possible day of the Stanley Cup final is Oct. 4.

Each team will be permitted to bring a maximum of 52 people into the secure zones in the hub cities, including a maximum of 31 players.

461,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/sports/canadian-university-football-players-careers-shortened-by-age-rule-pandemic-1.5018685,"Canadian university football players' careers shortened by age rule, pandemic",['Donna Spencer'],2020-07-10 08:26:00-04:00,"Dozens of Canadian football players dreaming of hoisting the Vanier Cup in their fifth and final year of university eligibility have had those hopes dashed.

The cancellation of the 2020 national football championship game because of COVID-19, and U Sports not altering an age eligibility rule, accelerates the swan song of roughly 300 football players.

U Sports has said student-athletes whose championships are cancelled in 2020-21 because of the pandemic will not lose a year of eligibility.

But football players have seven years after graduating from high school to complete their five-year eligibility. Many play junior football before entering the university ranks.

The only U Sports sport with an age limit is football.

University of Calgary quarterback Josiah Joseph of the defending Vanier Cup champion Dinos is among those caught in a rule designed to limit the age of players in Canadian university football to under 25.

Players who turn 25 before Sept. 1 age out of university football. Joseph turns 25 on July 10, 2021.

Approximately 300 players out of 2,335 will be similarly impacted in 2021, according to U Sports.

Joseph hoped U Sports would make an exception for players like him.

""All they would have to do is amend the rule and push it to maybe January first due to extreme circumstances,"" he told The Canadian Press.

""It's devastating there's that many players in my position.""

U Sports adopted a football age cap to prevent large gaps in physical maturation and experience between players in a collision sport, and also to create room on rosters for younger players, according to U Sports interim CEO Dick White.

""I really understand the disappointment of the players that this affects,"" said White, who took over for departed CEO Graham Brown last month.

""Our legal advice that we received was very firm. If we believe the age cap should be 25 for the health and safety of athletes then we should not under any circumstances alter that.

""The reasons for having that age cap have not changed even though we've had the tragedy of COVID.""

Joseph argues there is no physical or experience difference between a player who turns 25 in March and one who turns 25 in October.

""There's already 25 year olds playing in the league so what's the difference of a couple months?"" he asked. ""There is none.""

U Sport cancelling the 2020 Vanier Cup and the two bowl games -- Mitchell and Uteck -- that serve as semifinals doesn't stop conferences from playing football in the fall.

But Canada West, Ontario University Athletics and Atlantic University Sport have already declared there won't be football in 2020 because of the pandemic.

The Reseau du sport etudiant du Quebec is still working on running football this fall.

University of Bisons head coach Brian Dobie points out fifth-year players aren't the only ones impacted.

Any current university football player whose birthday falls before Sept. 1 will lose a year of football eligibility because of the combination of the pandemic and the current rule.

""What about that kid who had two years left and he just got a starting spot? Now Johnny has one year left. What about Billy who had three years left and now has two years left?"" Dobie asked.

""If you have one kid in your program that is negatively affected by this, as a coach you should be outraged. Every kid should count just the same and you should be outraged.""

Losing a year of football eligibility also means losing a year of athletic scholarship to pay for school, Dobie added.

""The reality is the age cap is 25 and it's not 26 and somewhere you draw the line,"" White said.

""If the football institutions wish to re-address the age cap to 26 or no age cap, that's up to our member institutions. There's a process to do that.

""The big picture here was there was a very good reason we put the age cap in. Our board of directors, supported by the legal opinion, said 'don't move it.""'

Joseph doesn't buy that rationale.

""It doesn't seem like it's reflecting the interests of a lot of coaches and players that make up U Sports football that make it successful, the guys that are going to be there for five years who are going to graduate that are going to be proud alumni,"" he said.

""That's what makes up university football in Canada.""

462,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/sports/baseball-players-get-a-peek-at-playing-without-fans-1.5018239,Baseball players get a peek at playing without fans,['John Marshall'],2020-07-09 19:35:00-04:00,"Baseball players got a sense of what the game will be like without fans in the stands upon returning for workouts last week.

They're getting a more realistic glimpse this week as teams begin holding scrimmages.

Yes, it's very strange.

""It was surreal. ... just sitting behind the dish at a major league stadium with major league players on the field and no one else there and playing in competition,"" Milwaukee Brewers general manager David Stearns said Thursday. ""Occasionally, you'll see that for a small BP when media isn't around or cameras aren't around, but it was really weird to see Christian Yelich in the batter's box in a major league stadium in competition in an empty ballpark.""

Baseball returned for workouts last week after the season was interrupted by the coronavirus pandemic during spring training. Teams have started ramping up their workouts in preparation for a 60-game season set to begin on July 23.

The season will start without fans in the stands and will likely remain that way for a while as coronavirus hotspots continue to pop up across the country.

""We'll remember this season, going through it, for a long time because these are very unusual feelings for all of us to experience when we're watching games like this,"" Stearns said. ""In terms of the actual game and the way that the game played out, I think it looked like normal baseball.""

The Boston Red Sox will try to make the atmosphere a little closer to normal by experimenting with piped-in noise, like leagues in Taiwan and Korea have done.

""So hopefully it won't be quite as quiet. It is quiet today,"" Red Sox manager Ron Roenicke said. ""I think we're just constantly adjusting to things and trying to figure it out.""

UMPIRES RESPOND TO WEST

Umpire Joe West faced backlash earlier this week after he said he doesn't believe all the deaths attributed to COVID-19 were from the virus.

The Major League Baseball Umpires Association stepped back from West's comments with a statement issued on Thursday.

""Recent public comments about the current Coronavirus pandemic do not in any way reflect the position of the Major League Baseball Umpires Association,"" the statement said. ""Our nation, and our world, has suffered greatly from this deadly virus. In the midst of continued suffering umpires are attempting to do our part to bring the great game of baseball back onto the field and into the homes of fans everywhere.""

POSEY STILL OUT

San Francisco catcher Buster Posey was gone from Giants' workouts for a second straight day and third in all while dealing with a personal issue.

Posey said last weekend he still had some reservations about playing this year amid the pandemic. Manager Gabe Kapler wouldn't say whether Posey had indicated that was the reason for his absence.

""Buster is still working through a personal issue. I want to respect his privacy,"" Kapler said.

CESPEDES HOMERS

Yoenis Cespedes launched a two-run homer off Seth Lugo during the Mets' intrasquad game at Citi Field. Rather than trot around the bases after the ball cleared the fence, Cespedes simply walked back to the dugout.

The 34-year-old slugger missed last season and most of 2018 due to a string of injuries. He had surgery on both heels and then broke his ankle in a fall at his Florida ranch. The two-time All-Star said in February he finally expected to be ready to play this year, and he's looked healthy and dangerous in the batter's box since summer camp opened last Friday.

It seems his only remaining hurdle is showing he can sprint full speed without issue.

REYES APOLOGIZES

The Cleveland Indians kept outfielder Franmil Reyes away from camp after he was spotted on social media attending a Fourth of July gathering.

Reyes was allowed to resume on-field activities on Wednesday after being re-tested twice and apologized for putting himself and his teammates at risk.

""I really apologize, because I was not protecting myself and my teammates,"" he said on Thursday. ""I learned from it and it won't happen again. I really don't want to stop practicing. I really apologize and I swear it won't happen again.""

HOPEFUL RANGERS

Texas Rangers general manager Jon Daniels said All-Star slugger Joey Gallo and lefty reliever Brett Martin are both feeling good but still haven't been cleared to start working out with the team.

Both tested positive for the coronavirus during intake testing last week. Daniels said Gallo was still asymptomatic and that Martin, who has Type 1 diabetes, is feeling better every day after initially having mild symptoms, including congestion and fatigue.

""I am hopeful they won't be out much longer,"" Daniels said, without elaborating.

NO SPITTING

One of the new rules during the pandemic is the prohibition of spitting to prevent the virus from spreading.

Following the rule is not as easy as it sounds. Players have actually been practicing not spitting.

""That's a big thing for me. I do dip some tobacco. I'll have to change that up, maybe go to gum more often,"" the Marlins' Garrett Cooper said. ""That's the natural thing for a baseball player to do, spit. That's what they've been doing their whole lives -- gum, sunflower seeds, a lot of guys dip tobacco. It's part of your normal protocol. Maybe it helps people calm down. I've caught myself a few times. I start to spit and go, `Oh man, I can't do this now.' It's something you've got to get used to.""

EXTRA WORK

Altanta starter Mike Foltynewicz looked sharp in three innings of a controlled scrimmage, which he credited to workouts he participated in at nearby Campbell High School with Mike Soroka and Sean Newcomb, during the long break. He's been throwing six times a week and pitching bullpens.

""We got really lucky to be able to go to that school and throw every day,"" Foltynewicz said. ""It was difficult just to get in gyms and get in the parks to throw. It was tough. Me, Newk, Mike. We had a bunch of guys come in, left- and right-(handed hitters), just to stay ready. At any time MLB could've started us back up and we could've had to ship right out to spring training.""

463,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/sports/mls-returns-to-action-after-poignant-moment-of-silence-1.5017423,MLS returns to action after poignant moment of silence,['Mark Long'],2020-07-09 11:45:00-04:00,"KISSIMMEE, FLA. -- Nearly 200 players took the field for an 8-minute, 46-second moment of silence to protest racial injustice before Major League Soccer's return to action Wednesday night.

Players wore black T-shirts, black gloves and black facemasks emblazoned with Black Lives Matter. The shirts had varying slogans that included Black And Proud, Silence Is Violence and Black All The Time.

The players walked toward midfield, raised their right arms one at a time and held the pose so long that some could be seen stretching fatigued muscles afterward.

It was a poignant moment that put two of the nation's most prominent changes over the last four months -- masks and movements -- at the forefront of the sport's return.

The group was formerly called the Black Players Coalition of MLS but changed its name this week to Black Players for Change. Originally announced on Juneteenth, the group started in the wake of George Floyd's death with the hope of combating systemic racism both in soccer and the players' communities. The league and the players' union endorsed the organization.

Several other players from Orlando City and Inter Miami took a knee near midfield during the demonstration. Orlando's Nani scored in the seventh minute of stoppage time and held on for a 2-1 victory over expansion Miami.

The two in-state teams delivered their own moment of silence by taking a knee along with the referee and the line judges just before the opening kick.

The national anthem was not played before or after the demonstration. MLS previously said it would not be played because no fans were in attendance.

Floyd, a Black man, died May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on Floyd's neck for nearly eight minutes. Prosecutors said that a police officer had his knee on the neck of Floyd for 7 minutes, 46 seconds -- not the 8:46 that has become a symbol of police brutality.

MLS players had weeks to decide what to do prior to the MLS is Back tournament at ESPN's Wide World of Sports complex at Disney World.

The league's teams are sequestered in resorts for the duration of the World Cup-style tournament, which began with a Group A match that was the first meeting between the two Sunshine State teams.

FC Dallas withdrew Monday after 10 players and a coach tested positive for COVID-19. A day later, Nashville SC's status was thrust into doubt with five confirmed positive tests.

Nashville was supposed to play Chicago in the second game of a doubleheader Wednesday but it was postponed.

MLS shut down because of the coronavirus pandemic on March 12, after the league's teams had each played two regular-season games.

The reboot had a considerably different feel -- without fans and with plenty of concern even amid a safety bubble. Can 25 teams that include nearly 700 players plus coaches, trainers and other support staff do everything right for a month? And what's the threshold for more positive tests?

The National Football League, the National Basketball Association and Major League Baseball surely have a close eye on what's happening outside Orlando.

The NBA should get an up-close look. The league already has part of its bubble established at the ESPN venue. NBA team flags fly on every flagpole, and some areas have been sanitized and cordoned off for basketball's return later this month.

MLS is using three fields near the back of the complex, two of the ones the NFL used for Pro Bowl practices the last four years. The league mandated masks for everyone other than players. Coaches, support staff and media donned masks during the game. Miami star Rodolfo Pizarro, who wasn't in the starting lineup, also wore one during warmups.

Miami's Andres Reyes left the field on a stretcher early in the second half after a scary collision with Orlando's Dom Dwyer. Replays appeared to show Dwyer hitting Reyes in the throat as they went for a 50-50 ball.

Reyes had trouble breathing as teammates and the referee called for help. Adding to the growing concern on the field, the emergency crew got hung up trying to gain access to him.

Security personnel struggled to open a gate, delaying the medical team's response. It was slow enough that one of Reyes' teammates, Juan Agudelo, ran across the field to help and ended up assisting in pulling the stretcher across the soggy grass.

Chris Mueller scored the equalizer for Orlando, getting a sliding toe on a perfect cross from Nani to the back post in the 70th minute.

Agudelo scored the first goal of MLS' return, drilling a left-footer past Pedro Gallese to cap a play that started with two teammates on top of each other in the box.",[]

Edmonton promised to speed up a review of its name and provide an update at the end of the month after at least one of its sponsors announced it plans to cut ties with the team unless it changes its name.

The team has seen repeated calls for a name change in the past and faces renewed criticism as sports teams in Canada, the United States and elsewhere are urged to remove outdated and sometimes racist names and images.

Tootoo, the first Inuk to play in the NHL, said in a statement released Wednesday that the discussion should be “around how the Inuk people feel” about the term. He said some might feel pride while others might feel hurt.

“We should all understand what the term means to the Inuk people,” he said. “My father's generation connects this term to describe who they are. He would refer to himself as an Eskimo. My generation refers to itself as Inuk. What is important to me is that people understand this. And, when referring to the Inuit people, they respect that we refer to ourselves today as Inuk.

“I understand there are names of sports teams that bring back feelings of oppression for people and I can see why those names should be changed,” Tootoo added. “So, this makes me ask the question, does the term Eskimo for the Edmonton franchise bring back feelings of oppression for Inuk people? For me, it does not. That is not a reason to keep the name. There could be others for whom it does create those feelings.”

Tootoo said the team should explain why it originally chose its name.

“Was it racially charged, or, was it because of admiration for the ability of the Eskimos to thrive in cold climates, for their mental and physical toughness and for their resilience?” he said. “My point is that context really does matter. And, they need to be honest with themselves and with the public. Truth goes a long way.”

Tootoo, from Rankin Inlet, Nunavut, played 13 seasons in the NHL with Nashville, Detroit, New Jersey and Chicago. The 37-year-old retired in 2018.

470,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/tax-season-5-costly-mistakes-to-avoid-this-year-1.4844543,Income tax: Common mistakes made on tax returns,['Nicole Bogart'],2020-03-09 07:27:00-04:00,"TORONTO -- When most people think about making a mistake on their tax return, their fears often revolve around checking the wrong box or missing key facts that might lead the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) to audit them.

But, according to experts, the costliest tax mistakes made by Canadians are usually related to missed deductions and a lack of understanding about whether they need to file.

Here are five costly mistakes to avoid when putting together your return this year:

NOT FILING AT ALL

If you didn’t make a single dime during the tax year, failing to file a tax return will only leadto more money being left on the table.

“One of the most common mistakes is not filing because you don’t think you have enough income, or you didn’t have an income at all,” Lisa Gittens, senior tax professional at H&R Block, told CTVNews.ca by phone earlier this month.

“As long as you are living in Canada you should be filing.”

According to Gittens, students, young adults, stay-at-home parents and the unemployed are the most prone to this mistake, which prevents them from claiming certain tax credits and benefits that all Canadians are entitled to, regardless of their income bracket.

This includes the Canada child benefit, the universal child care benefit, and the GST/HST credit, and provincial credits like the Climate Action Incentive. Keep in mind that both parents must file a tax return in order to receive the Canada child benefit.

You can also claim things like medical expenses, educational expenses, and child care expenses if you didn’t make any income. And, as Gittens notes, the more expenses you can write off, the greater chance you'll get a refund.

Gittens notes that it’s especially important for students to file their returns in order to build credit with the CRA.

“Many students don’t file because they have no income, but once they graduate and start earning income, they have no credit with the CRA,” she explained.

NOT CLAIMING MEDICAL EXPENSES

Medical expenses not covered by provincial health services or benefits plans are another commonly neglected area, especially for low- and middle-income Canadians.

“When your medical expenses are high in comparison to your income you get a medical expense supplement that refunds a portion of the medical expenses you claimed,” said Gittens.

This type of expense can include eye exams, dental expenses not covered by insurance, medical supplies and travel expenses. This year, certain cannabis products are now considered eligible for the medical expense tax credit, if you have a prescription.

You can claim your total eligible medical expenses, minus three per cent of your income or the set maximum for the tax year ($2,352), whichever is less.

For future tax years, Gittens recommends completing all of your miscellaneous medical exams and yearly check-ups towards the end of the year to capitalize on the return and make it easier to organize your receipts.

“When you get all of those eye exams and dental exams taken care of at the end of the year the receipts are all there for you to claim on your taxes,” she said.

MISREPORTING INCOME FROM YOUR SIDE JOB

Whether you are making extra money by driving an Uber, hosting people at your Airbnb, or earning a little side cash online, you want to make sure you are recording those earnings as self-employed income.

“You’ll want to be sure that you’re also contributing to the Canada Pension Plan based on those earnings,” notes Gittens.

If you plan on claiming any expenses related to that income (i.e. expenses related to your vehicle, house, or travel expenses), make sure that you have the receipts to back it up.

MISSING INVESTMENT INCOME

Before filing, make note of your investment streams and make sure you have received a statement for each of them. These annual statements should show the total income you earned during the tax year and the total expenses incurred, such as investment adviser fees (which are deductible).

“Income sometimes gets missed because people don’t understand how much they’ve earned on their investments each year,” Armando Minicucci, tax specialist at Grant Thornton, told CTVNews.ca by phone.

“This is generally the most common area where individual tax payers are reassessed.”

FILING TOO EARLY

The early bird doesn’t always get the worm, especially when it comes to taxes.

“Those early filers who are hoping to get their refunds right away tend to miss certain documents, whether it be T4’s from their employers or investment slips from the bank,” Michael Davis, senior tax specialist at H&R Block, told CTVNews.ca by phone.

Not only could this cause you to make an amendment to your return, it could put you at risk of incurring penalties for misreporting your income if you make a habit of it.

“If you fail to report the same kind of income in back-to-back years it could result in penalties,” said Davis.

April 30 is the last day to file your 2019 income tax return. If you owe the CRA money, it must be paid by this date. Otherwise, you’ll face a late-filing penalty and daily interest chargeson your balance.

If you are self-employed, you have until June 15 to file your return. But keep in mind that if you owe taxes, you’ll still be required to pay your balance by the April 30 deadline.",[]
471,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/the-cra-has-completely-redesigned-the-t1-personal-income-tax-return-form-1.4821920,The CRA has completely redesigned the T1 Personal Income Tax return form,['Nicole Bogart'],2020-03-02 06:00:00-05:00,"TORONTO -- Your income tax package has an entirely new look this year thanks to the Canada Revenue Agency’s decision to revamp the T1 Personal Income Tax return form.

The T1 General Form, also known as the Income Tax and Benefit Return, is the main document used to file your personal income taxes and acts as a summary of all the other forms you complete for your income taxes.

Depending on how you’ve filed your tax return in years past, you might be familiar with the general layout of the form.

But during the 2020 tax season the form will look quite different – most notably, doubling in size.

WHAT IS A T1 GENERAL FORM?

The T1 is used to summarize all of the other forms you complete for your income taxes.

It shows your provincial tax (except in Quebec), total income, net income, tax payable, deductions, and non-refundable credits.

When you file your taxes, this form is used to apply for things such as the Canada Child Benefit, or the GST/HST credit.

If you file your taxes online using tax software, you may not recognize the name of the T1 form because it’s often filled out automatically.

“If you use tax software or go to your tax professional all of the calculations are done in the background,” Lisa Gittens, senior tax professional at H&R Block, told CTVNews.ca by phone.

“The purpose [of the redesign] was to simplify the preparation and that process has already been simplified if you’re using online software.”

In other words, unless you are dedicated to filing your taxes by pen and paper, you won’t even notice the change.

WHAT’S DIFFERENT?

As the CRA puts it, “Your income tax package has a new look.”

The first thing you will likely notice is that the form has doubled in size from four pages to eight. Additionally, some of the line numbers that were previously three or four digits long are now five digits long.

The CRA notes that the form has been updated to include the use of plain language “where possible,” reduce the number of forms, update worksheets to simplify certain calculations, and increase font size and white space.

The form now also includes the calculation of federal tax.

“Most Canadians aren’t going to notice much of a difference, other than the extra pages and new line numbers,” Armando Minicucci, tax specialist at Grant Thornton, told CTVNews.ca.

“Two of the new pages are from adding the non-refundable tax schedule to the form.”

Page one of the form still asks for your basic personal information, such as your name, address, e-mail address, province of residency, marital status and information about your spouse or partner.

The second page now asks whether you have any income that is exempt under the Indian Act. If you do, you will not be required to complete the T90 form, “Income Exempt under the Indian Act.”

The rest of the T1 form requires the same information as previous years, including various deductions such as RRSP contributions and child-care expenses, the calculation of your net income and your taxable income.

Gittens notes that the calculation of these reductions is the most important part of the T1 form and remains completely unchanged from previous years.

The remainder of the form is dedicated to calculating your federal tax.

April 30 is the last day to file your 2019 income tax return. If you owe the Canada Revenue Agency money, it must be paid by this date. Otherwise, you’ll face a late-filing penalty and daily interest charges on your balance.

Other changes to CRA services this tax year include a new online tool that allows you to check the estimated processing time for your tax return and other tax-related requests, and the ability to pay your balance via PayPal.

CTVNews.ca will have stories on tax season every Money Monday. Look for it in our 5 Things to Know.

Whether you are working with a tax specialist or using software to file your taxes, it’s important to be aware of any changes that could affect your refund.

But first, let’s start with the basics.

IMPORTANT DATES AND DEADLINES

As usual, April 30 is the last day to file your 2019 income tax return. If you owe the Canada Revenue Agency money, it must be paid by this date. Otherwise, you’ll face a late-filing penalty and daily interest charges on your balance.

The CRA notes that even if you can’t pay your full balance owing on or before April 30, you can avoid the late-filing penalty by filing your return on time.

If you are self-employed, you have until June 15 to file your return. But keep in mind that if you owe taxes, you’ll still be required to pay your balance by the April 30 deadline.

The deadline to contribute to your registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) is March 2.

CHANGES TO CRA SERVICES

Right off the bat, you might notice a few changes to the T1 Personal Income Tax return form. Most notably, it’s doubled in size from four pages to eight.

But this doesn’t mean you’ll be required to put in extra work. The length accounts for increased font size and new formatting, as well as the CRA’s decision to include the calculation of federal tax. There is also a new numbering system.

“Most Canadians aren’t going to notice much of a difference, other than the extra pages and new line numbers” Armando Minicucci, tax specialist at Grant Thornton, told CTVNews.ca.

The CRA has also released a new online tool that allows you to check the estimated processing time for your tax return and other tax-related requests.

You now also have the option of setting a personal identification number through the My Account portal to quickly identify yourself when calling the CRA.

GETTING ORGANIZED

If you haven’t done so already, experts suggest signing up for the CRA’s My Account portal to ensure that all of your personal information is up to date and accurate. This portal not only stores important tax income documents, it allows you to check the status of your refunds, outstanding balances, and RRSP or TFSA contribution limits.

More importantly, if you have misplaced any of your documents or T-slips, you should be able to access them in My Account.

Next, organize your paperwork.

· Employment and income slips (T4s, T4As, T5s, T3s, etc.)

· Receipts to back up claims for things like medical or childcare costs, charitable donations, or moving expenses

· Disability certificates, mortgage and property tax statements

· Self-employed or rental income and expense information

· Student tuition and interest documents

Reporting investment income tends to be the trickiest area for taxpayers, according to Minicucci.

“Income sometimes gets missed because people don’t understand how much they’ve earned on their investments each year,” he said. “This is generally the most common area where individual taxpayers are reassessed.”

You should have received an annual statement from any investments you held in 2019 showing the total income you earned during the year and the total expenses incurred, such as investment adviser fees (which are deductible).

NEW AND IMPROVED TAX BREAKS

Enhanced CPP Contributions: You can now claim a deduction for any enhanced contributions to the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) or the Quebec Pension Plan (QPP).

“Employees were required to contribute 0.15 per cent of pensionable earnings commencing last January to a maximum annual contribution of $80.85,” explained Minicucci.

“Regular contributions to CPP result in a non-refundable tax credit. The deduction for enhanced contributions is a tax deduction, not a tax credit.”

Canada Workers Benefit: Formerly known as the Working Income Tax Benefit, this benefit provides a refundable tax credit for individuals and families that are in the workforce but have income below certain thresholds.

The maximum benefit is $1,335 for individuals with earned income of $12,820 or less. For families, the maximum refund is $2,335 with an income threshold of no more than $17,025. However, if you are enrolled in a full-time education program, you’re not eligible.

Home Buyers’ Plan: In 2019 the Home Buyers’ Plan RRSP withdrawal limit increased from $25,000 to $35,000 for withdrawals made after March 19.

New homeowners also qualify for the $5,000 first-time Home Buyers’ Tax Credit if they have purchased a home in the tax year—a tax credit Minicucci warns could be overlooked by many first-time buyers.

Cannabis as a Medical Expense: Certain cannabis products are now considered eligible for the medical expense tax credit, providing you have an authorization.

Climate Action Incentive: The perks of this incentive program range depending on which province you live in. Albertans are now eligible to claim this incentive, whereas residents in New Brunswick will not. Residents in Ontario, Saskatchewan and Manitoba will receive a large amount this year compared to the previous tax season.",[]
473,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/how-to-protect-your-personal-information-online-during-tax-season-1.4804898,How to protect your personal information online during tax season,['Nicole Bogart'],2020-02-17 06:00:00-05:00,"TORONTO -- Tax season can be a particularly precarious time for Canadians.

Not only is there pressure to file your tax return accurately and on-time, you’re doling out vast amounts of sensitive personal information online while doing so.

Practising good personal data protection etiquette online should be top of mind for consumers year-round. But it becomes increasingly important during tax season, when cybercriminals tend to prey on consumers who are more likely to fall for scams that ask for their personal information.

Here are some important security measures to keep in mind while handling your personal information online this tax season:

BE WARY OF SCAMS

Canadians have faced an influx of online scams and robocalls purporting to be from federal organizations including the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) over the last few years.

These scams often threaten consumers with the imminent threat of arrest or lawsuit before asking for a litany of personal information, such as social insurance numbers.

In 2019, Canadians lost more than $1.4 million to CRA scams, according to numbers provided to CTVNews.ca by the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre (CAFC). In fact, as of Feb. 2, the CAFC had confirmed 34 successful instances of CRA fraud in 2020, costing consumers over $10,000 total.

“A lot of the scams take place over email and SMS,” Christine Beauchamp, director of the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security, told CTVNews.ca in a telephone interview.

“They have a variety of messages that make them seem very legitimate and professional. You might not be able to tell right away whether or not they’re legitimate.”

When it comes to online scams in particular, the CRA says it will never:

Ask for prepaid credit cards or gift cards.

Collect or distribute payment via e-transfer or bitcoin.

Send an email with a link that asks you to divulge personal or financial information, unless you have called the CRA to ask for a form or a link for information. In this case, a CRA agent would send you an email during the call with that information.

Beauchamp adds that users should never click on links included in suspicious emails, especially if it’s not a secure link.

Sites with a secure connection will display a lock symbol in the left hand side of the URL bar in your web browser. Secure sites will also start with “https” (the “s” stands for secure).

USE SECURE PASSWORDS

Your income tax return contains a wealth of incredibly sensitive personal information -- perfect for anyone who wants to steal your identity.

“If there is one password you want to keep incredibly strong and unique, I would say it’s definitely the one that’s associated with your tax return file,” Beauchamp said.

Whether you are filing online through the CRA’s website, or using a third-party program to help you with your return, make sure that you use a password that is eight to 10 upper- and lower-case letters mixed with numbers. That’s the formula experts say is most secure.

When choosing numbers to add to your password, be sure not to use anything that is easily identifiable, such as your address or date of birth.

If you have a hard time remembering your passwords, Beauchamp suggests stringing together three or four random words you’ll remember, which is often as strong as an alphanumerical password.

SAVE YOUR FILES SECURELY

When filing your taxes online, be mindful of where you save the PDF copy of your return and any supporting documents.

If possible, Beauchamp recommends storing these files on an encrypted external hard drive or a secure drive in the documents section of your computer. Files that are saved on your computer’s desktop are not as protected as those stored in the documents folders.

Experts don’t recommend storing these kinds of personal documents in the cloud.

Keep in mind that you should be filing your return from a secure internet connection and not from a public Wi-Fi connection.

Public Wi-Fi networks are highly susceptible to Man-in-the-Middle-style attacks, which allow eavesdroppers to intercept data transmissions and read them.

EDUCATE YOURSELF

The CRA has an entire website dedicated to helping Canadians protect themselves against fraud, including information about the most common scams.

Tax season is prime time for scammers,['Nicole Bogart'],2020-02-10 06:00:00-05:00,"TORONTO -- Canadians who have grown tired of unsolicited emails and phone calls from scammers claiming they owe money to federal agencies will have their patience tested this tax season.

The Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre (CAFC) is expecting to see a surge in these scams between March and April, when cybercriminals tend to prey on consumers who are more likely to fall for scams that ask for their personal informationduring tax season.

According to numbers provided to CTVNews.ca, 470 Canadians lost more than $1.4 million to these scams last year alone.

Another 3,210 complaints of scammers posing as the tax agency were reported to the CAFC in 2019, but the CAFC notes that thousands more go unreported.

Jeff Thompson, a senior RCMP intelligence agent working for the CAFC, says that scams that mention the CRA are just the tip of the iceberg.

“There’s the telephone CRA scam that we continue to get reports about, but we’ve seen a huge shift with [scammers] claiming to be Service Canada reporting fraud on your SIN number,” Thompson told CTVNews.ca in a telephone interview.

Thompson said CRA-related scams often involve phishing campaigns sent by email or text message, many with the promise of a tax return in the form of an e-transfer -- something the CRA says it will never do.

But despite increased effort by Canadians authorities and government officials to crack down on these types of scams, including a large scale bust involving more than 40 illegal call centres in India last March, experts fear the market for fraud outpaces authoritative efforts.

“It is a little bit like a drop of a bucket -- a game of whack-a-mole. You take out one group and another pops up,” Avner Levin, director of Ryerson University’s Privacy and Cybercrime Institute, told CTVNews.ca in a telephone interview.

“All they need is a handful of successful scams to make money. And if you’re talking about sending out an email or a text message the costs are negligible.”

Avner says some relief may come from more stringent requirements placed on telecom providers by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), including call-blocking technology that prevents some “spoofed” numbers from reaching Canadians customers.

“This isn’t an issue you can solve on your own by blocking calls on your own device. You need the telecom companies to get involved and do their part,” Avner said.

Meanwhile, as scammers ramp up for busy season, Avner’s best piece of advice is simple: don’t answer your phoneif you don’t recognize the number.

“The scam is in the social context… the person gets on the phone and intimidates you, stresses you out, convinces you to do things you wouldn’t do,” he said.

“You’ve got to find ways to disengage and disconnect. The more you stay on the line and have a conversation with them, even if you think you’re impervious to this, they will chip away at it.”

In a statement to CTVNews.ca, a CRA spokesperson said education is key when it comes to protecting Canadians from these types of scams.

The CRA says it will never:

Use aggressive language or threaten to arrest or deport you .

Ask for prepaid credit cards or gift cards.

Collect or distribute payment through e-transfers or bitcoins.

Send an email with a link that asks you to divulge personal or financial information, unless you have called the CRA to ask for a form or a link for information. In this case, a CRA agent would send you an email during the call with that information.

The CAFC notes that users should never click on links included in suspicious emails, especially if it’s not a secure link.Sites with a secure connection will display a lock symbol in the left hand side of the URL bar in your web browser. Secure sites will also start with “https” (the “s” stands for secure).

But Levin notes that consumers should continue to be vigilant after filing their taxes, noting that cybercriminals are ready to strike at any time.

“There is some risk when you’re filing your taxes, but afterwards, when you’re awaiting a return, we also see a huge spike in these types of scams,” he said.

475,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/in-a-rush-here-are-some-quick-tips-to-charge-your-phone-faster-1.4123222,In a rush? Here are some quick tips to charge your phone faster,"[""Cillian O'Brien""]",2018-10-09 06:10:00-04:00,"Smartphone batteries often seem to run low when we need them most – so we’ve gathered some tips on charging them up pronto.

If you need a fast charge there are ways to get that battery closer to 100 per cent.

For iPhone and Android users alike, the less your phone processor is doing, the faster it will charge. So putting it into airplane mode can help, but will mean no internet or cellular connectivity.

Aside from turning your phone into a virtual paper weight, there are more shortcuts to a faster charge.

The phone screen is the biggest battery drain, so resist the urge to keep looking at it, if you can.

But if the temptation is too much, and you can’t do without the web while it’s charging, just turn off the battery-draining Bluetooth, wifi, GPS and NFC features instead.

Older phones charge faster when they’re powered down completely, but this is no longer true on new phones.

Tech reporter Amber Mac told CTVNews.ca that phone manufacturers have made fast charging a priority in recent years.

“While many smartphone buyers look for the best camera or screen, I am always interested in the device with the best battery life,” Mac told CTVNews.ca, praising the all-day battery life of her own smartphone.

“If I do need a boost, it has fast charging so that in 30 minutes or so I can get up to 50 per cent of my battery life back again.”

While Apple’s smartphones don’t have a fast-charge feature built in, iPhone users can charge their devices quicker by using a different wall plug.

IPhones are sold with Apple’s small five-volt/one-amp power bricks, but iPads come with larger five-volt/2.4-amp bricks that actually charge the company’s phones faster.

Electricity is measured in watts, which is a product of voltage (in number of volts) and current (in number of amps).

Some chargers supply more voltage or amperage than others, meaning they will charge your phone faster.

That means, if you want to charge up your Apple device as fast as possible, you’ll need a Lightning-to-USB-C cable and a 12 watt USB-C power adapter.

Other phone brands offer special fast chargers, but they are typically incompatible between different manufacturers.

Newer Android devices also have a battery saving mode that users can activate to shut off background apps and conserve power while the phone recharges.

Anyone who’s tried to charge their phone in a hot car knows that the handsets run the risk of overheating and some models will stop charging. So keep it cool for a speedier charge.

Similarly, if your battery is in a cold environment, you may notice the charge start to decrease.

For a fast charge it’s best to plug into a wall socket, but if that’s not an option, an active laptop is the next best thing.

And if all else fails, leave the house with a portable charger. It won’t charge any faster, but it will charge your phone on the go.",[]
476,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/5-things/tech-tuesday-5-things-cybersecurity-experts-would-never-do-1.3126790,"5 things cybersecurity experts avoid doing on their smartphone, computer",['Nick Wells'],2016-10-25 06:43:00-04:00,"You already know you shouldn’t share your password with a stranger, but cybersecurity experts say there are other routine tasks you may be carrying out -- including using your debit card online or downloading free apps to your phone – that could seriously jeopardize your online security.

""I already assume my smartphone is infected,"" Gary Miliefsky, the CEO of SnoopWall, a cybersecurity company based in New Hampshire told CTVNews.ca.

And if a cybersecurity expert’s phone is infected, yours may be too.

From avoiding downloading email attachments to disabling geo-tagging, you may be leaving yourself wide open to hackers. So what simple steps can you take to protect yourself online?

CTVNews.ca spoke to two cybersecurity experts, Miliefsky and technology analyst Carmi Levy, to find out the top 5 things they would never think of doing on their smartphone or computer:

1. Never use your debit card for online shopping

Online retailers are increasingly offering customers a chance to use their debit card to pay for transactions, making life easier for those who don’t have credit cards or for those who don't want to add to their credit debt.

Even PayPal now has an option for users to add their debit cards to their accounts.

This tops Miliefsky’s list of things he would never do on his computer or smartphone.

""If you use a credit card, you're much safer because of the fraud and identity theft investigations and protections designed around credit cards,"" he said.

Miliefsky says he understands people wanting to only use the cash they have readily available, but a hacked debit card is a much more time consuming process to get fixed.

Longer fraud investigations and future identity theft concerns are the major reason to avoid using them online, he says.

2. Never download an app before reading the privacy permissions

When downloading an app, many will skim through the permissions it asks to be granted – such as accessing your contacts or your location.

Both experts suggest reading the privacy permissions and doing some research on the apps' creator before you download it.

Miliefsky lists a keyboard emoji app found on the Google Play store that has hundreds of thousands of downloads as an example. This simple emoji app asks to read all your text messages, listen in on ingoing and outgoing calls and track your movement.

Both Miliefsky and Levy say free apps are particularly troublesome for wanting to control your phone's contents. Many apps also don't list where all the information they gather from your devices is stored.

""We’re essentially giving up all of our rights to in order to play these games,"" said Levy. ""We're allowing companies carte blanche to have our information.""

Instead, research the apps you download and avoid those that wants to oversee a large amount of your phone's content.

3. Never download email attachments

It may sound like a hassle, but Miliefsky suggests never downloading an email attachment.

""If there were no hyperlinks or attachments in an email, how could you get infected in emails?"" he said.

He says people have become used to downloading attachments from people they recognize recognizable, and hackers can exploit that.

Instead, consider using a third party program such as Dropbox – a secure file hosting service – allows you to scan all incoming attachments and ensure you’re not downloading something potentially harmful.

For an extra layer of protection, Miliefsky recommends getting rid of email signatures that feature hyperlinks. Those links can be corrupted and instead of directing the recipient to its intended target, can instead direct them to a site a hacker controls.

4. Never share a password

A fairly straightforward piece of advice, but both Miliefsky and Levy suggest never sharing important passwords online or using the same password twice.

Miliefsky recommends never entering any of your passwords on sites you don't recognize or sharing it with others, while Levy suggests avoid having them stored on your computer.

""Breaking in to your computer, eavesdropping on your computer, getting passwords is just too easy,"" Miliefsky said. ""Just don’t share your password.""

Levy agrees, adding that many users use the same password multiple times, making you an easier target to hack.

""You’re willingly trading off security for convenience when you do this,"" he said.

5. Never enable geo-tagging, GPS and Wi-Fi

A geotag is an electronic tag that lists the geographical location a photo, video or device is located. You may already have enabled your location on your phone and not know it. To disable the feature, simple check your camera settings and disable ""geotags"" or ""location tag.""

But it’s important to be aware if you’ve enabled geo-tagging because you could be giving outsiders a virtual map to your whereabouts if they get their hands on your device, Miliefksy says.

He gives an example of children taking photos on their phones or iPods without realizing the photo is storing their location. If the phone or computer taking that photo has already been hacked or gets hacked, then whoever has control of it can easily discover where you live or where your kids are, he says.

Beyond geotags, using free Wi-Fi is another no-no.

Smartphone users tend to leave their Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connection on when it’s not needed, Levy says, which can allow hackers easily taking control devices when you’re out in public.

Hackers can set up fake internet connections in coffee shops to use on unsuspecting customers and easily access that data once the device is connected.

""Even if you’re logging in to a sanctioned network like a one at a coffee shop,"" said Levy referring to Wi-Fi logins at coffee shops like Starbucks. ""The sad truth is these are places that sell coffee, not specialize in Wi-Fi security.""

Both suggest using those, and similar functions on your phone – such as enabling Bluetooth or Near Field Communication, which can pair your device with another -- only when it’s necessary or when it’s on a secure connection.

The only safe connections are those where you know who is in charge of the connection such as your employer or your home router.

While the expert advice may seem ominous, Levy says the idea is to reinforce how important security for our digital devices is, and how it tends to get overlooked.

""I don't want to freak people out, but at the same time I want to frighten people into treating security with a little more seriousness than they already do,"" he said. ""Sometimes you need a bit of a poke to wake up and smell the coffee.""",[]

Right now, the California-based business only has a handful of vehicles on the road compared to the likes of Ford, General Motors and the other industry giants. But if Musk has his way, Tesla’s recently announced Model 3 will drastically change that.

Here are five things to know about the affordable car that you can plug into your wall.

“It’s going to be awesome”

…At least according to the FAQ page. Details on the vehicle are a bit sparse at the moment, but the company promises to share more as they get closer to production, which is supposed to begin at the end of 2017.

Right now, here’s what we know:

The base model of the car is supposed to cost $35,000 (USD)

It will have seating for five adults

It will accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in under six seconds

It has two trunks (front and back)

It will come equipped with Autopilot capabilities (that will likely cost a few thousand extra)

It will travel approximately 345 kilometres per charge (more on that below)

We also know what the car will look like, barring any redesigns before its actual release:

You can take it on a road trip – depending on where you want to go

Tesla says the Model 3 will be able to cruise approximately 345 kilometres on a full battery. At that sort of range, you can safely drive to work, run some errands and drive back home before needing to charge your car (which you can do by basically just plugging it into the wall).

Will the car cut it on a road trip? Here’s an idea of where 345 kilometres will take you in Canada.

The car can handle a decent day’s drive, but if you plan on taking a long trip, you’re likely going to need to stop overnight to let your Model 3 charge – unless your route is lined with Tesla’s “Superchargers.”

These free-to-use power stations are scattered throughout the world and can charge vehicles in “minutes instead of hours,” according to Tesla’s website. They estimate it takes about 40 minutes for an 80 per cent charge and 75 minutes for 100 per cent charge.

There are 17 Tesla Supercharger stations in Canada right now – eight in B.C. and Alberta and nine in Ontario and Quebec – with more Supercharger stations planned for 2016. This would make trips from Vancouver to Calgary or Toronto to Montreal doable in a single (albeit fairly long) day. And with hundreds of chargers across the U.S., cruising from coast to coast would be simple if you’re heading south of the border.

Tesla vehicles have some ridiculous-sounding features

Scenario: It’s 2022 and you’re navigating the ragged roads of the dystopian future nightmare our world has become. The gas-mask-clad bandits who haunt the highways hop out from behind the bramble, clouding the air with a poison blast.

“Nice try,” you think to yourself as you engage the vehicle’s Bioweapon Defense Mode.

Reality: Who knows what situation Musk had in mind when he developed the feature, but Teslas actually do have a “Bioweapon Defense Mode.” The cars come equipped with an air filtration system that can scrub the air of pollutants, which the company demoed by placing one of its cars in a bubble filled with extreme concentrations of airborne particulate matter.

According to the Telsa blog post, about two minutes after engaging the system, the air quality inside the vehicle dropped from beyond hazardous to good and breathable. The system even seemed to scrub about 40 per cent of the pollution outside of the car.

“In other words, Bioweapon Defense Mode is not a marketing statement, it is real,” states the Tesla marketing team. “You can literally survive a military grade bio attack by sitting in your car.”

The Model 3 will also have an optional feature available called “Ludicrous Mode” – something that lets the machine accelerate even faster. It’s currently available for Tesla’s other models (for a not-small chunk of change), and decreases the 0-to-60 time by about 10 per cent (or the time to 155 mph by 20 per cent, if you ever happen to reach those speeds).

Tesla will also make ludicrous amounts of revenue from the Model 3

After one week, 325,000 people had pre-ordered the Model 3 – and at $1,000 a pop for a reservation, that’s already more than $300 million in cash. And if every one of those people follows through with their order, selecting only the base model (Tesla estimates with add-ons, orders will average closer to $42,000 USD), that would already be more than $11 billion in sales.

But profit isn’t exactly a familiar concept to the automaker – it took 10 years for Tesla to turn its first quarterly profit, and it’s been reported that the company actually loses more than $4,000 on every car it sells.

That’s not to say the business model is unsustainable, however. A lot of the money Tesla has made so far selling its Model S and Model X vehicles has been reinvested into projects like its Gigafactory in Nevada, which will “produce more lithium ion batteries annually than were produced worldwide in 2013.”

Tesla has grandiose dreams of cranking its car production up fivefold, which will be necessary to satisfy the unprecedented demand for the Model 3.

But you won’t be getting a Model 3 any time soon

One thing is for sure, this is the car of the future – in the sense that most people won’t be seeing one for at least a few years. While early orders might be fulfilled by late 2017, those ordering now might not get behind the wheel by the end of this decade.

Musk himself recommended “ordering a Model 3 soon if you want 2018 delivery,” though even that looks like a best-case scenario. While the company is ramping up production, cranking out half a million cars per year by 2018 is a lofty goal for a car company that only delivered about 50,000 vehicles 2015.

So if you’re itching for an affordable electric vehicle that actually exists in the present, here are some other options to check out (prices in USD):

Mitsubishi i-MiEV: $23,845 MRSP, 100 km/charge

Chevrolet Spark: $25,995 MRSP, 132 km/charge

Nissan Leaf: $29,860 MRSP, 135 km/charge

Ford Focus Electric: $30,045 MRSP, 122 km/charge

Chevrolet Volt: $33,995 MRSP, 85 km/charge

BMW i3: MRSP $43,395 MRSP, 130 km/charge

478,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/5-things/5-ways-to-boost-security-when-using-your-fitness-tracker-1.2754367,5 ways to boost security when using your fitness tracker,[],2016-02-02 06:00:00-05:00,"Wearable fitness trackers are becoming increasingly popular, as users turn to these devices to help them monitor indicators of their health and physical activity. But as you strap on your device and head out for the day, one security experts suggests taking a few extra steps to increase the security of your personal data.

Fitness trackers including Fitbit and the Apple Watch are surging in popularity, and are proving to be popular gifts.

On Christmas Day, Fitbit's app was the most downloaded on Apple's app store, suggesting that the fitness trackers were a hot seller during the holiday season.

For those who aren't familiar with them, wearable fitness trackers are devices that can be attached to an individual, and will collect information about the user's physical activity levels.

Commonly collected data include total steps taken, total stairs climbed, total hours of sleep and total calories burned in a day.

This data is often uploaded to a user's personal account, typically registered with their personal email, where they can check their progress over time. Many wearables also allow users to connect with others, to compare and share their progress.

While these devices can help individuals keep track of their activity levels and stay motivated to reach their fitness goals, people should take steps to make sure this information is secure, says ESET Senior Security Researcher Stephen Cobb.

Cobb says that people who use fitness trackers should remember the kinds of often very personal information they're uploading to their accounts.

He pointed to a major security breach last year, when toy-maker VTech, which makes smart watches for children, discovered that the personal information from approximately five million customer accounts related to kids' profiles had been compromised.

""You might say, 'What does it matter if somebody gets my personal information?'"" Cobb told CTVNews.ca. ""There are two things to worry about, really: One, it's just not really nice if a stranger, potentially a criminal stranger, gets your personal information, and two, there may be attempts to use that information in some sort of scam or scheme.""

He suggests people who wear fitness trackers consider taking the following steps to increase the security of their personal information they're uploading to their registered accounts:

1. Give your device a name that is not recognizable, or easily traceable to you. So, for example, don't call your fitness tracker ""John Clark's Fitness Tracker."" Instead, create a user name for your device which is hard for somebody to track back to you, Cobb said.

2. When creating an online account to store your personal data, use a unique, strong password that is difficult for anyone to guess. Cobb said this is especially important for people who have accounts with multiple services online, and who use the same email and password for each one. People who do this face extra security risks, because if there is a security breach at one company, hackers potentially have access to all of your other accounts, he said.

3. When accepting friends to follow through your fitness tracker, be aware of exactly what information you're sharing and with whom you are sharing it. ""The social aspect of fitness trackers is very interesting, and has the potential to improve the value you get from the tracker,"" Cobb said. ""But just like social networking, you want to be very careful who you accept as friends… don't accept people unless you're absolutely sure who they are, and you're clear on what you're sharing.""

4. Read the privacy policy that accompanies your fitness tracker, so that you are clear and comfortable with how your information may be used by the company, and how you can limit it, if at all.

5. Keep an eye on the news about these devices. This is especially important, as fitness trackers are relatively new, Cobb said. As they increase in popularity, the risk associated with them may change, he said.

In an email to CTVNews.ca, Fitbit said it has always been committed to protecting consumer privacy and keeping data safe.

""Fitbit has committed to never share users' personal information with others unless the user directs us to,"" the email said.

The company says it uses ""privacy by design"" principles, to ensure that transparency, consumer choice and security are prioritized in the design of all Fitbit products. It notes that Fitbit users are in full control of when, or if, they share any of their data, and that these sharing settings are set to private as a default.

""It is the user's choice to share their data,"" the company said.

In addition to using a unique password for every online account, Fitbit also recommends users take steps to keep their computers free from malware. More information on Fitbit security can be found on its website.

In an email to CTVNews.ca, an Apple spokesperson highlighted some of the security features that come with the Apple Watch, including ""Activation Lock,"" which requires the user to enter their iCloud Apple ID and password when activating the device. Doing so can help protect the wearer in the event their Apple Watch is stolen, by securing their personal information, the spokesperson said.

""When your phone is locked with a passcode or Touch ID, all of your health and fitness data in the health app is encrypted,"" the spokesperson said. ""Any health data backed up to iCloud is encrypted both in transit and on our servers.""

More information about Apple's privacy policy and encryption policies can be found on its website.",[]
479,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/5-things/tech-tuesday-the-best-home-security-cameras-1.2709732,Tech Tuesday: The best home-security cameras,['Simon Cohen'],2015-12-22 06:00:00-05:00,"Going away for the holidays? Or maybe there’s someone on your list who’s away on business a lot? Then it’s time to think about the biggest trend in smart home devices: remote monitoring video cameras.

Unlike the more commercially oriented multi-camera systems that require complicated wiring and set-ups, these products are designed to use your home WiFi network in combination with a cloud-based storage system and can usually be set up in minutes. While some require subscriptions to enjoy all of their features, some do not. And though they may offer peace of mind, they are not a substitute for a professionally monitored home security system.

Here are some of the leading players in the space and what you need to know before investing in them.

Nest Cam ($219, plus optional Nest Aware subscription starting at $10/month)

The Nest Cam (formerly Drop Cam) is a versatile home monitoring camera that can capture 1080p video, with a wide 130-degree field of view and the ability to see clearly even in low-light situations. These specs aren’t uncommon -- many of its competitors can make the same claims -- but its software and optional cloud-based recording features make the Nest Cam the most popular device of its kind. Once set up, you can view real-time footage from the Nest Cam, use its digital zoom to get closer to the action, or communicate through the camera’s built-in speaker and microphone. You can make your Nest Cam’s feed public and share it with friends and family, making it a clever alternative to FaceTime or Skype for family events.

But if what you really want is to record what’s going while you’re not there, you’ll need the Nest Aware subscription plan, which will run you $10/month for 10 days’ worth of recording, or $30 for 30 days. $120 a year certainly isn’t chump change -- especially if it’s on top of an existing security system monitoring plan -- but it does enable Nest Cam’s best features, such as personal alerts based on criteria like movement (the company claims its software can tell the difference between irrelevant movement like trees moving in the wind and important movement like a person walking through the room). It also gives you impressive extras like the ability to isolate a particular area of the image for alerts, e.g. a precious work of art, or your child’s crib; and time-lapse recordings which let you select any chunk of previously recorded footage and condense it into a 6, 15, 30, 60 or 120-second video. The other thing to keep in mind is that, with Nest Aware, your camera can record continuously for the entire 10-or-30 day stretch if you choose -- no SD card in the world is big enough to store all of that. It also means that your footage is more secure (assuming you trust that hackers won’t make their way into Nest’s cloud servers) and not vulnerable to fire, theft or other mishaps.

It’s not a perfect solution. You still need to connect the Nest Cam to a power outlet via its 10-foot micro USB cable, which may limit where you can place it, and once placed, its angle or tilt can’t be changed remotely. If your power goes out, so does your recording because of Nest Cam’s reliance on the cloud and its lack of a battery backup.

Samsung SmartCam HD Pro ($219)

Let’s say you love everything about the Nest Cam but that Nest Aware subscription is a deal-breaker. Samsung feels your pain and is hoping to woo would-be Nest Cam buyers with its identically priced (and similar looking) SmartCam HD Pro. The camera offers an almost identical list of features to the Nest Cam, including two-way voice, low-light video, 1080p resolution, a wide field of view and real-time streaming, but it eschews cloud-based recording and alerts in favour of micro-SD-based on-board recording. Naturally this limits the sheer amount of video you can save depending on the card you buy (the camera does not come with one) but it also means a one-time cost instead of a monthly fee. You even get Samsung’s version of the Nest Cam’s Activity Zones, which lets you trace out an area of interest in the camera’s field of view. Unlike the Nest Cam, the SmartCam HD Pro comes with a series of built-in sound effects that can be triggered from your smartphone or tablet, which play back through the camera’s built in speaker -- very handy if you need to interact with your home without using your own voice: a simple siren sound might be all you need to scare away an intruder.

On the downside, cloud recording isn’t offered at all, which limits how you can use the SmartCam, and it suffers from the same limitation of placement as the Nest Cam thanks to its power cord, though just like the Nest Cam, it can be wall-mounted if you wish.

Ezviz Mini ($84.99)

Spending over $200 on a security camera might be affordable if you only need one or maybe two in your home. But what if you need a lot more, or your budget simply can’t stretch that far? Thankfully there are cheaper options like the Ezviz Mini. It can’t match the more expensive cameras feature-for-feature (it lacks face detection and alerts can only be triggered by movement, not sound) but it can easily provide you with basic functionality. You get 720p streaming and recording which won’t be as sharp as 1080p, and its lens has a narrower field of view (115 degrees), but it can handle low-light situations and it comes with a 16GB micro SD card (and supports up to 64GB). Most importantly, the Ezviz doesn’t make you choose between local storage and cloud support. You can have both and in fact, the camera comes with a free one year subscription so you can really get the feel for it. If you continue after the trial period, it’s only $5/month or $50/year.

Some reviewers have suggested that the Ezviz’s app for iOS or Android lacks polish and the learning curve may be steeper than its pricier competitors, but that might be easily overlooked considering this product is less than half the price of the other cameras.

Canary All-In-One Camera ($249)

Going to the other extreme is the Canary All-in-One Camera. It’s more expensive than many of the others, but arguably the most capable too. If you’re looking for a single device that could theoretically replace an entire home security system, the Canary comes closest. By this point, you know the drill: 1080p video with low-light capability, that streams directly to your phone or tablet. The Canary uses the cloud-only model of the Nest Cam, but gives 12 hours of recording away for free, on an ongoing basis. Subscription plans that start at $4.99/month can increase this to 30 days. Unlike the other cameras, the Canary must sit on a flat, centrally located surface because its attractive cylindrical shape doesn’t allow for wall mounting. What the Canary does have that the others do not is an ear-splitting 90 decibel alarm that can be activated remotely, and a suite of extra sensors such as an air-quality sampler, a motion detector, a humidity sensor, a temperature gauge and a 3-axis accelerometer. This might seem extreme, but if you’re trying to keep tabs on a secondary property like a cottage, they could provide critical information in the event of a fire, flood or other disaster. It also boasts the widest field of view at 143 degrees -- which means the Canary can see more, and doesn’t need to be shoved in a corner to give you a clear view of what’s going on.

The Canary is also equipped with a handy geofencing system which lets you assign multiple devices to the system’s “awareness” of who’s home, automatically arming or disarming the system depending on whether these devices are in the house or not -- perfect for smartphones that tend to go where we go, not so great for tablets that often get left at home.

Netatmo Welcome ($219)

Like a cross between the Canary and the Samsung SmartCam, Netatmo Welcome is a home security camera with another cylindrical, non-wall-mountable design, and uses micro SD cards exclusively for recording footage from its 1080p-capable, 130-degree field of view camera. It comes with an 8GB card, but you’ll need to buy more as this will fill up quickly. The Welcome’s claim to fame is that it’s the only camera on the market (currently) that does facial recognition. When you set it up (using your WiFi or wired network) you create profiles for each person in your house and then “train” the camera to recognize these people. It’s a process that takes some time, but works well in the end. The Welcome can then be set to send you alerts based on the faces it sees. Want to know when your youngest child comes home? Or perhaps you simply want to know when an unrecognized person is in your house… either way, Welcome will tell you. It can also be triggered by movement of any kind, something which reviewers have suggested creates a bit of a problem for users: the Welcome can detect even the slightest of movements and unlike the Nest Cam, it doesn’t seem to distinguish between noteworthy ones and non-relevant ones. This can mean a lot of false-alarms if you place Welcome in a high-traffic area. Of course, if you place it elsewhere, it may not see much.

The question is, as cool and unique as face detection is, is it worth $219, especially considering what the Welcome lacks: no cloud storage option, no two-way communication, no audible alarm and no way to adjust the sensitivity of its movement-based alerts?

Netgear Arlo ($199)

Of all the security cameras we’ve covered so far, all of them have one thing in common: They need to be wired to a power outlet, even if they communicate over WiFi. That creates some limitations on placement, and can mean some pretty unsightly wires. So the Netgear Arlo, despite its limited feature set, is very attractive to buyers looking for a wireless option. On the downside, you need a separate base station to connect Arlo cameras to the Internet, but it’s included at this price point. The video quality, at 720p, is poor by comparison to the 1080p that is the norm for most other cameras. It does not have a mic or built-in speakers so nevermind two-way communication -- you simply don’t get sound of any kind. As for advanced features like face detection or burglar alarms? Fuggedaboudit. With only 110 degrees of field of view, it can’t capture as much of the action as the others mentioned here.

But what the Arlo does offer is unlimited placement flexibility thanks to its use of C123A batteries instead of AC power -- these last for about 3-4 months depending on usage. It’s also completely weather-proof, which means it can be used outdoors too -- even during a cold, Canadian winter. The included magnetic wall mount is very clever: Its semi-spherical shape means you can easily adjust where the Arlo is pointed throughout a wide range of angles (though any small bump could easily move it).

Moreover, Netgear gives you 7 days of cloud video recording for free (which is good, because there’s no on-board storage) and you can add up to 15 cameras to a single base station. Additional cameras cost $179 each, though you may get a better price if you buy more than one.

There’s only one type of alert: Movement -- it’s adjustable, so this will help with false alarms, and you can create rules for each camera that dictate what they should do when they detect movement (e.g.: Nothing, record a 20-second clip, send an email alert etc.). The one thing to keep in mind with the Netgear Arlo is that, because it is battery powered, you can’t use it to record continuously 24/7. It’s designed to only record short clips when it sense movement, or stream live video for short durations to your phone or tablet. This may limit its value for people who want to constantly check-in on kids or pets.

Homeboy ($189 USD – no Canadian pricing option)

If you like the idea of the Netgear Arlo’s wire-free installation option, Homeboy’s family of WiFi security cameras can go one step better: Not only are they wire-free, with the ability to mount almost anywhere indoors, they don’t require a separate base-station because they connect directly to your WiFi router. This simplifies the setup and the amount of gear you need. Homeboy’s cameras eschew the Arlo’s disposable lithium batteries for internal, rechargeable ones that last about 90 days between charges with typical usage. Just like the Arlo, Homeboy captures video clips, which it stores in the cloud, and does not offer live streaming. The company’s free plan offers 12 hours of video storage, with unlimited downloads, but you can increase this to 30 days of storage for $4.99 US a month.

There are two major drawbacks to the Homeboy at this time: First, its camera sensor only delivers a low-res 640x480 video image with only 52 degrees of horizontal view. You’ll still see what’s going on, but you’ll have to be very strategic with where you place it, as it won’t be able to show you a whole room at once and you won’t be able to make out any fine details. Second, it isn’t weatherproof, so consider the Homeboy indoor-only.

On the plus side, the Homeboy has a built-in mic, which means its recordings include audio—something the Arlo notably lacks. Homeboy also offers an intriguing way to increase its recording smarts: It’s compatible with the web-based IFTTT service (If This Then That), which gives users the ability to create smart-home “recipes” for their connected gadgets. For example, you could simply let Homeboy send you alerts based on its built-in motion detection, or, you could trigger it to record whenever your Nest Protect thermostat smells smoke. Conversely, the Homeboy can be used to trigger your other smarthome devices, perhaps by turning on your WeMo lightbulbs when it detects motion (not only to give an intruder a scare, but also to throw some more light on what Homeboy is recording).

The company is promising to enhance its security options in 2016 by giving users the ability to have their cameras professionally monitored by a security company.

Finally…

No matter which home security camera you buy, we urge you to think carefully about security. There have been several articles published recently about the risks that web-connected camera pose to possible intrusion and the advice they offer is worth repeating here:

Make sure your home network is secured using a unique password (not the default one that comes with your router) and is based on a strong scheme like WPA2

Do not use the default password on the camera system you buy--create a new one and don’t share it

Consider the vulnerability of the video footage you are recording. The Nest Cam records only to the cloud or your phone, which means that if stolen, thieves do not get your footage. The Samsung SmartCam however, records unencrypted video to its SD card, which anyone could view if they stole it. Make sure the product you buy has sufficient protections in place for your needs

JASPER NATIONAL PARK, ALBERTA

The stargazing in Jasper National Park is so inspiring they put a soundtrack to it. During the park’s Dark Sky Festival every October, the outdoor Edmonton Symphony Orchestra Strings perform during the “Symphony Under the Stars” show. Jasper was designated a “Dark-Sky Preserve” by the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada in 2011 due to optimal dark sky viewing amid very little light pollution.

GARIBALDI PROVINCIAL PARK, BRITISH COLUMBIA

This park is conveniently located a short drive from the resort town of Whistler, B.C., and is a popular hiking and camping site. “Its high altitude and low light pollution make it an excellent stargazing spot for adventurers, nature lovers and amateur astronomers alike,” said the Space Agency on its website.

GRASSLANDS NATIONAL PARK, SASKATCHEWAN

Located near the border of Montana and Saskatchewan, Grasslands National Park was designated a “Dark-Sky Preserve” in 2009. In fact, it’s the darkest of the dark-sky preserves in the whole country, the Space Agency says. “Visitors can marvel at the Milky Way, constellations and other astronomical phenomena that are very difficult to see near urban areas,” the website reads.

WHITESHELL PROVINCIAL PARK, MANITOBA

Whiteshell might not be a designated “Dark-Sky Preserve,” but it still offers an awe-inspiring experience, says the Space Agency, thanks in part to the “astronomy-related wonder” that is West Hawk Lake. The lake is situated in a meteorite crater several million years old. “Catch a delightful sunset on the lakeshore before looking up at night for a sight of the Milky Way,” the Agency says.

CHARLESTON LAKE PROVINCIAL PARK, ONTARIO

Each year from July to mid-August, stargazers in the northern hemisphere can catch a glimpse of the Perseid meteor shower, and Charleston Lake is a hot spot for viewing, the Space Agency says. They even have astronomers present during viewing parties that can help provide amateur viewers with an optimal experience.

MONT-MÉGANTIC INTERNATIONAL DARK-SKY RESERVE, QUEBEC

Located about 40 km from the town of Lac-Megantic, Mont-Megantic National Park is the site of the International Dark-Sky Association’s first International Dark Sky Reserve, a separate designation from the Canadian Space Agency’s dark-sky preserves. The scientific observatory is located at the summit of Mont Megantic.

TORNGAT MOUNTAINS NATIONAL PARK, NEWFOUNDLAND

Amateurs be warned: Torngat Mountains National Park might be too challenging for the casual outdoor lover. Located in a remote location near the tip of the province, the park is only accessible by boat or charter plane. “The scenery is worth the extra effort, as northern lights are very bright and frequent,” the Space Agency says. “Inuit culture, astronomy and captivating landscapes collide for an unforgettable excursion.”

HOPEWELL ROCKS PROVINCIAL PARK, NEW BRUNSWICK

The stunning New Brunswick tourist spot is typically visited for its beaches and the fascination with the high- and low-tide viewing of the Hopewell Rocks, also known as the Flower Pot Rocks, a wonder of millions of years of tidal erosion. It’s “the perfect spot for those who are interested in both geology and astronomy,” says the Space Agency.

PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND NATIONAL PARK, P.E.I.

This small, 27 square km national park features low light pollution and is a pleasant seaside escape, whether you’re stargazing or not. The Canadian Space Agency says the nearby Cavendish Beach is also a good option for nighttime stargazing.

KEJIMKUJIK NATIONAL PARK, NOVA SCOTIA

Designated a Dark-Sky Preserve in 2010, Kejimkujik National Park -- also known as “Keji” -- offers public stargazing events twice a year called the “Dark Sky Weekend.” The park also has a close relationship with First Nations traditions, so visitors can learn about the importance of astronomy in Mi’kmaq culture while they stargaze.

WATSON LAKE, YUKON

Home to the Northern Lights Space and Science Centre, Watson Lake provides an educational experience with its stargazing. Lucky visitors might catch a glimpse of the aurora too.

IQALUIT, NUNAVUT

With short daylight hours in the winter, Iqaluit is a prime location for stargazing and viewing the northern lights. “You can enjoy a colourful night sky from October to April,” says the Space Agency, “but be sure to bundle up: it can get extremely cold during those months.”

WOOD BUFFALO NATIONAL PARK, NORTHWEST TERRITORIES

The largest Dark-Sky Preserve in the whole world at nearly 45,000 square km, Wood Buffalo National Park sits mostly in Alberta, but crosses into the southern edge of the Northwest Territories. The park is also home to the largest herd of free-roaming wood bison. In other words, you can see more than stars at Wood Buffalo National Park.",[]

“I never dreamed I’d get to do my bucket list,” the octogenarian told CTVNews.ca via telephone from Las Vegas after completing a helicopter tour of the Grand Canyon, which even included a picnic with champagne. “I never dreamed even that I would be on Instagram. I mean, that’s still a dream to me -- which I love.”

With more than three million followers on Instagram, and counting, the 89-year-old has taken the internet by storm with her colourful -- and often racy -- outfits and crass commentary.

“I’ve always been a baddie,” the native Kentuckian said with a drawl.

Baddie’s already been to Niagara Falls, Ont. (“I love Canada!” she exclaimed), mixed drinks in New York City and hung out with the NFL’s Dallas Cowboys. Also on the cards for her ten-stop bucket list adventure, which is being sponsored by Hotels.com and ends on Nov. 12, is shimmying to samba in Rio de Janeiro, drinking the night away in Dublin, taking in the Moulin Rouge in Paris, and (hopefully) nabbing herself a perfect prince in London’s Buckingham Palace -- and Baddie said he doesn’t even have to be a top tier royal like Harry or William.

“Any old prince will do,” she laughed.

Baddie’s wild saga from a quiet, pastoral life in America’s heartland to the heights of social media stardom began less than four years ago, when she was still commonly known as Helen Van Winkle. Her great-granddaughter Kennedy Lewis, now 21, had snapped a photo of Baddie jokingly modelling her tie-dye shirt and cut-off denim shorts. When Lewis posted the photo of her great-grandmother wearing her clothes online, the likes and follows just started pouring in.

“It blew up,” Lewis said. “It’s been crazy!”

Winkle now counts celebrities such as Miley Cyrus and Rihanna amongst her fans and followers, and she’s even inked lucrative deals to appear in ads and showcase products on her social media accounts.

“I’ve been very fortunate,” she said.

Lewis, who acts as Baddie’s manager and millennial whisperer is joining her great-grandmother on her globe-trotting bucket list adventure.

“She’s a wonderful traveller -- she takes good care of me,” Baddie said. But she added that Lewis can’t always keep up with her “more adventurous” great-grandmother.

“She likes to lay by the pool and I like to do other things,” Baddie said. “I want to get up and go!”

According to a study released by Hotels.com, a fifth of people under the age of 30 are inspired to travel based on their parents’ and grandparents’ past adventures. Forty per cent of millennials, moreover, would prefer to complete their bucket lists with their parents or grandparents over celebrities (11 per cent), siblings (28 per cent) or travelling solo (25 per cent). One in eight even confessed that that their grandmother is cooler and more well-travelled than they are.

On Instagram, Baddie makes no secret of her love for playing the field. Her Instagram tagline -- “stealing your man since 1928” -- even announces it to the world.

“I’ve been single for 30 years and I have dated a lot,” she said. “I love men, but they do take up a lot of your time.”

Lewis says that she’s grown “pretty used to” Baddie’s man-eating ways.

“She flirts a lot,” Lewis said with a laugh. “She encourages me to go out with lots of men.""

Often seen wearing cannabis leaf prints and accessories, Baddie is also vocal proponent for the nationwide legalization of medical marijuana, saying that she uses cannabis pills and oils to manager her arthritis.

“I’m very much for medicinal marijuana,” she said. “It’s great -- it really is.”

Now that Canadians have fully embraced the “glamping” or glamourous camping trend, countless businesses offering luxurious accommodations have popped up to give visitors the nature experience without the inconvenience.

One such opportunity involves cuddling up in a snug, wooden pod with modern amenities in the charming countryside of southwestern Ontario. Long Point Eco-Adventure, located in picturesque Norfolk County, approximately a two-hour drive from Toronto, offers three different types of comfortable lodging to satisfy every budget.

The cozy pods and spacious suites allow visitors to rest their weary heads in peace after an action-packed day of kayaking, mountain biking, axe-throwing, zip-lining or stargazing at the adventure resort’s observatory.

Camping pods

For anyone looking to save a buck or two and can handle a little less space, Long Point Eco-Adventure’s camping pods may be the perfect tent alternative. The adorable dome-shaped wooden pods include a queen sized bed or two twin beds and include hardwood floors, stylish bedding, a sliding glass door and a private deck.

Travellers will have to use the resort’s communal washroom and shower facilities if they opt to book this simple but charming accommodation. There is also no electricity in the camping pods, so don’t expect to charge an iPhone while residing in this rustic pod.

Cost:

$89/night for low season weekdays

$109/night for low season weekends and high season weekdays

$129/night for high season weekends

Wilderness pods

For nature-enthusiasts who appreciate space and privacy, the camping pods’ upgraded relative, the wilderness pod, may be just the thing. For a little more money, visitors will sleep on a queen-sized bed and relax in a homey living room complete with a table for dining.

The wilderness pods’ most attractive feature, perhaps, is the private flush toilet and sink; although, patrons will still have to use the shared shower facilities. On top of running water, guests will enjoy all of the same features as the camping pods along with electrical outlets for any of their charging needs.

Cost:

$179/night for low season weekdays

Wilderness Suites

For the ultimate lap of camping luxury, guests can book one of the resort’s spacious wilderness suites for a true glamping experience. The tent-like structure could be considered more of a hotel room substitute than a tent alternative. With a choice of a king-sized bed or the family-friendly two queen-sized beds option, visitors will have more than enough room to spread out and relax.

The well-equipped suite includes all of the same features as the other two cheaper accommodations, but with the added bonus of a mini fridge and a private outdoor shower.

We’ve had enough. We’ve seen a lot of beautiful sights and I know there are so many more out there to see, but the key to any great adventure is knowing when to wrap it up.

Our plan had always been to travel for six months and I feel a little disappointed we’re stopping at five. But there would have been no prize for making it to the six-month mark (at least I think there wasn’t) and there’s no shame in heading home early.

We know we’ve been lucky to take this trip at all, even if it involved selling our house and putting our lives on hold.

But the problem with long-term family travel that no one tells you about is the “family” part. Also, the “long-term” part. So really the “long-term family” part; the “travel” part has been fine.

We love our children, really we do. They are smart and funny and they’re useful for carrying stuff. We’re pretty sure they love us too. But no matter how much your family means to you, it’s really, really hard to spend every minute of every day with them. You get on each other’s nerves and I’m here to confess it doesn’t get any easier as the weeks tick on.

There have been some exhausting moments with these kids. Like the time our boy threw his stuffed animal in the air while waiting for the train outside Disneyland Paris and it landed on the tracks and his daddy angrily jumped down to retrieve it only to be greeted by an even angrier French soldier with a very large gun. He yelled in words that Daddy couldn’t interpret but understood just fine.

Or the time this same boy lost his e-reader in the back seat of a Spanish taxi, then lost his sister’s e-reader hours later by “hiding” it under a suitcase where it wasn’t found until two weeks later. (The e-reader left in the taxi was retrieved as well after Mommy engaged in some high-level negotiating in some low-level Spanish.)

Or the myriad number of times our two kids descended into fisticuffs while in public -- almost invariably in a fancy restaurant with white tablecloths -- with the short, sharp battles ending in howls and tears and vows of revenge. From us parents, mostly.

Of course, there have also been plenty of spectacular moments too. Like hiking the cliffs of Ireland and the moors of England, and seeing the boiling hot geysers of Iceland. The kids have touched fish in the Mediterranean, ridden camels in Morocco and ponies in Paris, and stayed in a cave home dug into a cliff. They’ve climbed up castle walls, ridden to the top of the London Eye and seen the Eiffel Tower from down below.

And though they may not realize it, they’ve learned a ton about European history too, about medieval warfare, the Titanic disaster, the Irish famine, and the Moorish invasion of Spain. They’ve even learned a bit about European hygiene. (“Tell me again, Momma, about how the bod..., the bahdet.. the buttwasher works, please?”)

But in between all that wonder, there have been some pretty trying parenting moments and plenty of frustration. When you’re at the point of thinking the primary goal of your trip is no longer enjoyment but endurance, that’s a pretty good sign it’s time to pack it in.

I’m well aware there are lots of families who travel the world for much longer, because I met and spoke with many before we left. They talked about how travel helped mature their children, teaching them independence, and to see that there are other ways of life that are so much different from their own.

And I know there are some families who go through even bigger changes and make being global nomads a permanent way of life. I tip my hat to these families; they’re braver than we are. Maybe it’s different when you’ve committed to a full year of handling travel logistics, cranky kids, fussy eaters and homeschooling stress. Maybe they’re just better travellers than we are. Maybe they’re better parents.

Or maybe our kids might not be cut out for this. Our boy has always just gone along with whatever we have planned -- mostly because he often has no idea what’s going on at all. He usually has his nose in a book and I’m not even sure how much of this trip he’s absorbed at all, since most days he can’t even keep track of which country he’s in.

But our daughter is a quieter girl who has never really liked change. From the start, she told us she wasn’t eager to go. We knew that when we left. But isn’t our job as parents to encourage our kids to try new things, to push themselves beyond what they think they are capable of, to broaden their worlds? If we only ever keep things comfortable for them, how can they grow?

We hoped that once the kids saw a few of the great cities of Europe and landscapes they’d never seen before, they’d begin to see why we were so excited to show them this stuff.

But even after all the fun moments we’ve had, my daughter would still tell you she’d rather be home. She recently admitted she has decided she doesn’t like to travel. (Except airplane liftoffs. Those will always be fun, she says.) It kind of breaks my heart to hear that, that my daughter doesn’t love travel the way I do, especially since I’ve always sought out adventure and learning anything new.

But one of the hardest lessons one has to accept as a parent is that your kids aren’t you. They aren’t always going to love the same things you love, no matter how badly you want them to. My daughter is naturally a bit of a homebody, and this trip hasn’t changed that about her, even if I hoped it might.

So for the sake of family harmony, we’re heading home. It’s been a terrific journey and one we’re proud to say we got through without any disasters, injuries, or arrests. We’ve lost some socks and some hair along the way but we’re coming back with a ton of great photos and memories, two kids and each other, which is all we really need.",[]
484,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/5-things/why-trying-to-find-your-passion-might-be-the-wrong-approach-1.3999643,Why trying to 'find your passion' might be the wrong approach,[],2018-07-05 06:01:00-04:00,"Telling young people to “find their passion” in life in order to find happiness might not be the best advice after all.

New research has found that the way one views “life passions” can in fact prevent them from developing other, potentially rewarding interests.

The researchers from Yale-NUS College (a collaboration between Yale University and the National University of Singapore) wanted to examine theories on where a person’s “passions” came from.

“Are interests there all along, waiting to be revealed? Or must a spark of interest be cultivated through investment and persistence?” they wondered in a paper set to be published in the journal Psychological Science.

There appear to be two schools of thought on interests, they write. The first, called the ""fixed theory,"" holds that people are born with inclinations toward certain interests, such as math or music, and that passion simply needs to be discovered and then cultivated.

Others take a ""growth theory"" approach and tend to believe that interests can be developed slowly and that it’s possible to find many areas of interests, not just one “life passion.”

The authors say that the “fixed theory” approach may eventually be limiting and stifle a person’s curiosity about other interests.

For their research, the authors performed five studies to measure how the two different mindsets influenced learning.

For example, in one study, researchers broke Singapore college students into two groups: those with interests in “techy” topics, such as engineering or technology, or arts topics. Both groups were asked to do two readings: one about their field of interest and one outside that field.

They were then asked how likely they were to want to learn more about the topics in each article, and whether they could see themselves pursuing a career in the topics.

They were also asked how much they agreed with statements such as “Your core interests remain your core interests and don’t really change,” and “Even if you have very strong interests, they can change dramatically” to see whether they subscribed to the fixed theory or growth theory on interests.

The results showed that those students who had a fixed mindset were less likely to find the articles outside their usual scope interesting compared to those who had a growth mindset.

The authors say the danger of encouraging passions is that it can limit learning.

“The message to find your passion is generally offered with good intentions, to convey: Do not worry so much about talent, do not bow to pressure for status or money; just find what is meaningful and interesting to you,” they write.

“Unfortunately, the belief system this message may engender can undermine the very development of people’s interests.”

The authors say their research is particularly relevant in countries such as Singapore, where students begin to specialize in their education early in life.

There can be certain advantages to a “fixed theory” mindset, since it can allow a person to pursue an interest intensely without distraction, the authors say.

But the danger is that many presume that pursuing a passion should be relatively easy and provide constant inspiration. That thinking can lead people to abandon their passion if they ever face difficulty or setbacks.

“Urging people to find their passion may lead them to put all their eggs in one basket but then to drop that basket when it becomes difficult to carry,” they write.",[]

It seems a spoonful of sugar can do more than help the medicine go down. It can also help keep bee populations up, which is vital for humanity’s survival.

If you don’t bee-lieve me, just ask the fans of Sir David Attenborough.

A Facebook community page dedicated to the famous English naturalist and narrator of renowned nature documentaries such as, ‘The Blue Planet’ and ‘Planet Earth,’ sought to raise awareness about the plight of the bee.

“In the last 5 years the bee population has dropped by 1/3. If bees were to disappear from the face of the earth, humans would have just 4 years left to live,” the group wrote in a Facebook post earlier this month.

The fan group shared a simple tip that anyone can use at home. The post said that bees can often look like they’re dead or dying, particularly at this time of year, when in reality, they’re just tired.

“They simply don't have enough energy to return to the hive which can often result in being swept away,” the group wrote.

For anyone who comes across an exhausted bee, the Facebook group recommends mixing a simple solution of two tablespoons of white, granulated sugar with one tablespoon of water. Bees require carbohydrates from sugars in nectar or honey to convert into much-needed energy.

They also suggest placing the mixture on a spoon within reach of the tired bee. Additionally, they asked readers to share the Facebook post to increase awareness. The post has been shared more than 455,000 times as of Friday morning.

Pollinators like honey bees play a critical role in maintaining healthy ecosystems by pollinating flowering plants, fruits and vegetables. According to the World Wildlife Foundation, more than three-quarters of the world’s food crops are dependent on pollination.

A single bee colony can pollinate approximately 300 million flowers each day, according to Green Peace.

In Canada, pollinators are responsible for one in every three bites of food Canadians eat and $2 billion worth of crops, according to the partnership of agricultural organizations known as Bees Matter.

Although Statistics Canada says the number of honey bee colonies has actually increased 3.6 per cent from 2017 to a record high of 721,106, populations have been in decline in other parts of the world due to the destruction of natural habitats, diseases, and pesticides.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species shows that nearly 24 per cent of Europe’s bumble species are threatened with extinction. In the U.S., honey bee hives have decreased from 6 million in the 1940s to approximately 2.5 million, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Other ways to help:

In addition to feeding bees sugar, the WWF recommends planting pollinator-friendly plants such as, primrose, buddleia, and marigolds. The organization also suggests leaving an area of the garden untended to allow bees to buzz around in the long grass or make nests in compost heaps or hedgerows.

Certain pesticides and chemicals can pose a risk to pollinators, particularly when plants are in bloom. The federal government recommends limiting pesticide use and following pollinator-friendly best practices. These include avoiding crops or weeds where bees may be present and limiting “drift” exposure caused by spraying chemicals.",[]

Skotnicki believes that advertising from the multi-billion dollar personal hygiene industry has encouraged daily cleansing routines that have resulted in 40 per cent of people worldwide finding they have sensitive skin.

A practicing dermatologist for 20 years and the co-author of Beyond Soap, Skotnicki told CTV’s Your Morning that body washes, facial cleansers, and even water can all contribute to skin irritation and aging.

“Our skin is like a brick wall, and the mortar, or our wall, is fats or lipids,” says Skotnicki. “Soap and water, even just water, remove the mortar.”

In order to soothe sensitive skin, stave off signs of aging, or just to get a healthy glow, Skotnicki has some tips for re-thinking personal hygiene.

1. Throw out your products: The average woman applies 16 products to her face before leaving her house in the morning. Many of these products contain irritants, like fragrance and detergents, and they end up doing more harm than good. “Think about ‘less is more,” Skotnicki recommends. Her daily skincare regimen consists solely of SPF and cleansing with micellar water, a mild cleanser diluted with water.

2. Cut down on bathing: Sitting in a bath allows water to erode the skin’s natural protection. Skotnicki recommends limiting baths to under ten minutes and opting for showers whenever possible. She also recommends showering once a day at the most.

3. Focus on the ‘bits’: Getting in the shower and lathering your entire body in soap is completely unnecessary. “Washing your whole body because you think it’s healthy is damaging and it’s probably causing things like allergies and eczema,” Skotnicki says. She says to focus on cleaning parts that are actually dirty or smell, such as armpits and groin. Stick to mild, fragrance-free body washes over bar soap.

4. Skip your morning skincare regimen: Unless you’ve been out all night, Dr. Skotnicki says cleansing your skin in the morning is overkill. A splash of water is sufficient to clean your skin off, and a bit of SPF is the only anti-aging product you need.

5. Let kids be (dirty) kids: Young children are often the most dramatically affected by over-washing. Twenty-five per cent of young people suffer from eczema, a once-rare skin condition that can be caused by washing away the skin’s natural defences. Skotnicki recommends only bathing children several times a week and to avoid sitting them in baths for long periods of time.",[]
487,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/why-you-should-never-wash-your-chicken-1.3952379,"Why chicken should never be rinsed, but rice probably should be",[],2018-05-31 06:00:00-04:00,"If you rinse your raw chicken before you cook it just to be safe, please stop. You’re just making things worse.

Though there are plenty of families and home cooks who insist that step No. 1 when preparing any kind of chicken is to wash it and pat it dry, public health officials say that’s a really bad idea.

Health Canada advises against rinsing meat. The FDA advises against it. U.K.’s Food Standards Agency advises against it. And yet, the message still doesn’t seem to be getting through.

Even years after public messaging campaigns began advising against bringing raw poultry anywhere near a kitchen sink, judging by a recent episode of CTV’s The Social, there are still plenty of home cooks who insist on rinsing off meat before cooking it

Keith Warriner, a food science professor at the University of Guelph, says the problem is that for years, home cooks were told to do just that.

The 1951 edition of the Joy of Cooking advised rinsing out a chicken before roasting it. So did Julia Child on her legendary TV show. Martha Stewart recipes call for it -- in fact many recipes still suggest it. So it’s no wonder home cooks are having a hard time breaking the habit, says Warriner.

“It’s really only been since the ‘90s or the 2000s that public health officials started saying, ‘Oh wait, this is actually more dangerous than we thought.’ So now you just have to de-program people,” he told CTVNews.ca in a phone interview.

Rinsing off meat or poultry is actually pointless, Warriner says, since any bacteria that might be on the meat surface are going to be burned off during cooking anyway. Meanwhile the washing process runs the very real risk of spreading bacteria.

Spray from the tap can “aerosolize” bacteria, and tiny droplets can find their way onto the sink, work surfaces and utensils as far as 50 cm away.

The pathogen that’s of most concern when it comes to chicken is called campylobacter.

“Just 500 cells of campylobacter will give you profuse diarrhea for a week,” he said, adding that not much more is needed for E. coli or salmonella infection either.

To put that into perspective: about 1 billion bacteria can fit onto a single pinhead.

When such a small amount of bacteria is needed for infection, cleaning a sink after rinsing a chicken might not be enough.

“The sink is the hotspot for bacteria in the kitchen,” Warriner said. “Sponges, particularly, harbour huge numbers of bacteria and are magnets for contamination. So when we clean surfaces with these sponges, we just spread them around.”

Rinsing meat isn’t worth the risk, he says, particularly since cooking kills bacteria anyway.

“That’s why we always go back to the point that you don’t need to rinse meat; there’s no benefit,” he says.

FRUITS & VEGETABLES

Okay, well if we shouldn’t rinse meat, what about fruits and veggies? Most of us are told to wash produce under running water before eating or preparing them, but Warriner isn’t convinced it does much good.

If it’s pesticides that worry you, he says there are only trace amounts on most produce anyway and what’s there isn’t likely to come off with a simple rinse. Pesticides sprays are actually designed not to wash off easily.

Yes, there are produce washes and soaps on the market that promise to do better, but Health Canada doesn’t recommend them. It says produce soaps are simply “not necessary.” The U.S. FDA goes even further and advises against such soaps, saying the products are not approved for food use.

Warriner advises rinsing off visible soil on your vegetables, but says you shouldn’twaste your time with packaged salad mixes.

“With bagged lettuce there’s no point in washing it; they’ve already washed it several times during processing and you’re not going to do any better with a little rinse in your kitchen,” Warriner says.

If you are going to rinse fruits and veggies, it should always be done under running water – not by soaking them in a sink, which tends to expose them to even more bacteria.

Fruit should also never be washed before being stored in a refrigerator, say Warriner. Not only will the water speed up decomposition, it could collect in skins and rinds, like those on melons or citrus fruits.

“When you get moisture on it, you’re basically giving microbes like listeria somewhere to grow,” he said.

RICE

What about rinsing rice? Most chefs agree rice should be rinsed before cooking to clear off dust. (The one exception is parboiled rice --also called converted rice – which has already been cleaned.) But another reason chefs advise it? Better rice; rinsing removes surface starch that causes rice to clump together or get gummy.

Others like to soak their rice in clean water for a couple of hours. But the U.S. FDA thinks we should go even further. It says instead of letting rice absorb all the water in a pot, home cooks should use 6 to 10 parts of water for every part of rice, and then drain off the excess after cooking, just like pasta.

That’s because the FDA says it’s concerned about arsenic. Rice absorbs higher levels of arsenic than other foods during growing. Arsenic can build up in our bodies and long-term exposure has been linked to higher rates of bladder, lung and skin cancers, as well as heart disease.

“Published studies, including research by the FDA, indicate that cooking rice in excess water (from six to 10 parts water to one part rice), and draining the excess water, can reduce 40 to 60 percent of the inorganic arsenic content, depending on the type of rice,” it says.

Warriner says he’s not too worried about rice. He says he pre-soaks his rice, which also reduces arsenic, but he isn’t too worried.

“It’s not like you’re going to drop dead because you had a bowl of rice,” he said. “It’s a slow accumulation. That’s why they recommend not having too much rice each week… You need quite a lot of organic arsenic before it does anything.”

The FDA says it recognizes that consumers do not typically prepare rice like pasta and notes that draining off cooking water will reduce vitamin content. It says choosing a diet with many kinds of grains and starches is the best way to reduce arsenic risks.",[]

Hydro companies are reminding homeowners to review the Electrical Safety Authority’s guidelines to avoid electrocution or fires.

CTVNews.ca has rounded up a number of those tips, with help from professional light installer Paul Baluch, of the B.C.-based company Shack Shine.

Check your wires

Experts say you should never take for granted that your lights from last year will be in good enough condition to go up this year. Broken bulbs can be a fire hazard, as can frayed or exposed wires.

“You want to check the wire before you put it up,” Baluch told CTV Vancouver.

The ESA says you should also never run more than three strings of lights off a power cord, and never let connectors rest in puddles, on the ground or in gutters. They also advise against using staples or nails to secure wires in place, because it can damage the wire and create a fire hazard.

“Never remove the third prong on plugs,” the ESA adds. “This ‘grounding pin’ prevents shock in the event of electrical equipment failure.”

Indoor or outdoor

Authorities say it’s important to make sure lights are approved by the Canadian Safety Association, and that they are rated for the appropriate environment. Indoor lights should never be used outside, and outside lights should never be used indoors.

Baluch adds that anyone using laser lights should take care to point them at something, rather than allowing them to shine into the sky.

“Lasers aren’t safe for you to look into, especially when you have kids around,” he added.

Power lines

Avoiding power lines might sound like a no-brainer, but it’s easy to forget they’re there when you see them outside your home every day. The ESA advises people to take a moment to specifically look for power lines before setting up a ladder or arranging lights, so as to avoid any potentially deadly issues.

Ladders

When it comes to using a ladder, Baluch recommends adhering to the simple 4-1 rule: for every four feet you go up, add one foot of distance between the ladder and the wall.

“Never install lights on your own,” Baluch added. “You always want two people on site at all times when you’re installing lights.”

The tiny pests are experts at hunting for fermenting produce, and find their way into fruit-filled homes through window screens or cracks in doors.

Also known as drosophila flies and vinegar flies, the bugs can hitch rides on fruits and vegetables from the grocery store.

According to researchers at the University of Guelph, the flies have an average life span of approximately 40 to 50 days. Female flies can lay up to 500 eggs during their short life.

Kendra Mangione has rounded up some advice from experts and amateurs, including her grandmother, on what to do if you have an infestation in your home:

Entomologist's advice

""Don't leave ripe fruit on the counter. If you plan to keep fruit on the counter, wash it as soon as you bring it home,"" Royal Ontario Museum Entomologist Antonia Guidotti told CTVNews.ca.

""This may get rid of any eggs that are already present on the fruit.""

Pest control expert's solution

""Remove garbage as soon as humanly possible, especially in areas like the kitchen,"" pest control specialist Natasha Anderson said.

""If you feel unable to remove the garbage bags on a regular basis, I highly recommend putting offcuts from fresh foods (vegetables, fruits and meat) into a smaller plastic shopping bag. Once you are done preparing the meal, tie up the bag and put that inside your main garbage bin.""

Gardener's tip

""There are herbs that you can bring into your home that will repel them,"" Canada AM's gardening expert Mark Cullen said.

""Take some basil, cut it and put leaves on your bananas (or whatever fruit they're attracted to). The less popular herb tansy has insecticidal properties, and lemon, lemon verbena and citrosa geraniums also work. They don't kill the bugs but repel them.""

Home blogger's recommendation

""Keeping your kitchen clean definitely helps to keep fruit flies away,"" MrsJanuary.com blogger Ashley LeBlanc advised. ""If you do get stuck with them, I've found a red wine trap works best: a little bit of red wine in the bottom of a cup, a piece of Saran wrap over top and holes poked through with a toothpick so they can get in but not out. Works every time!""

Grandma's take

""I think they come from the drain, that's what they tell me anyway. I try to make sure all my drains are closed if I notice any in the house, to keep them from laying eggs,"" CTVNews.ca writer Kendra Mangione's always-right grandmother Ella Morton suggested.",[]

No problem: 5 low-maintenance lawn alternatives,[],2015-06-18 06:30:00-04:00,"The summer has only just begun, but already communities in Saskatchewan and Alberta are in the midst of drought and appealing to homeowners not to waste water maintaining their lawns.

In the American West, many homeowners are simply giving up on their yards. With stringent water bans in place, it’s all but impossible to keep grass green. The state of California, in its fourth year of drought, is even going so far as to offer homeowners rebates if they rip out their lawns.

There are now even landscaping companies in the state that will pull up homeowners’ lawns and install alternative materials, in exchange for cashing in the rebate money and handling all the paperwork.

It’s no surprise that so many municipalities has declared war on lawns. You would be hard pressed to find a thirstier water guzzler than a patch of grass. According to Environment Canada, more than half of residential water use in the summer goes to lawn watering or “landscape irrigation,” and much of that water gets lost to evaporation or run-off.

While there will always be those who enjoy lovingly tending to their lawns, many Canadians are likely wondering why they bother devoting their weekends to the whims of their yards. If you’re thinking about ditching your lawn, here are a few options to consider, from most drastic to least.

Artificial turf

Why slave away at real grass when the fake stuff looks almost as good?

Artificial grass has come a long way since the AstroTurf days of the 1960s. With a softer feel and a more realistic look, artificial lawns can easily be mistaken for the real thing, which may be why they’re popping up in residential yards, commercial green spaces and even municipal areas such as boulevards.

An artificial lawn is more expensive to install than natural grass, but the annual savings from never having to water and fertilize often takes care of the upfront costs. Artificial grass never requires mowing or weeding, lasts 15 years or longer, and can be kept clean with a garden hose or even a vacuum.

Detractors point out that fake turf doesn’t offer the cooling effects of grass, nor a place for insects to thrive. Others have raised concerns about the safety of the turf material and the black “crumbs” sometimes used to hold the lawn down, though no studies have proven the turf present a health hazard. But for the look of a lawn with none of the expense and headache, artificial grass is proving to be a popular alternative.

Paint it green

When a lawn turns brown in the hottest, driest days of summer, it can mean one of two things: either the grass has gone dormant to protect itself, or it’s just plain dead. Either way, the result is a sad landscape that many homeowners can’t stand to look at.

The solution could lie in a simple bottle of paint. Lawn paint is fairly new but already proving popular. The paint is made of a non-toxic, vegetable-based dye that is water-resistant and binds to the grass for 12 weeks or more. It doesn’t hurt the grass, and can be mowed away once the lawn starts growing again.

Companies that will do the lawn spraying for you are sprouting up across the country, but do-it-yourselfers can also buy the paint concentrate, mix it with water and spray it themselves. LawnLift, the biggest lawn paint distributor in Canada says its product dries quickly, is safe for pets, and will not rub off on shoes, clothes or paws.

Rock gardening

Many a frustrated homeowner has thrown up their hands at a dying lawn and declared: “I’m just going to pave over the whole thing.” True, paving is an option, but there are more visually appealing hardscaping options as well.

Dry gardens made of any combination of stone chips, pea gravel, ornamental grasses or succulents can make for a unique and attractive alternative to grass or tarmac. A well-designed rock garden will still absorb rain and provide colour, while requiring much less weeding and maintenance than a lawn.

The downside is that it can be labour-intensive to establish a hardscape garden, as the rocks and gravel need to be hauled in and landscape fabric needs to be laid down to stop the growth of weeds. The stones can also get hot under the mid-day sun and are likely not a practical option for families with small kids.

But there are landscaping companies happy to help and the costs of switching over to a dry garden quickly pays for itself from the money saved by never needing to water or mow again.

Native plants and meadows

Imagine ditching a monochrome green lawn for a field of flowers that attracts bumblebees and butterflies and is sustained only by the sun and the rain.

More and more homeowners are ripping up turf in favour of plants and wildflowers that grow with almost no help at all. While each region of Canada has its own native species, some plants that grow well in most parts of the country include wild strawberry, yarrow, coneflowers and asters.

Establishing a prairie garden can take a bit of work, as invasive weed species will try to move in. But once established over a couple of years, native flower gardens becomes virtually maintenance-free, requiring only an occasional mow-down.

The downside of “natural gardens” is that many cities simply don’t allow them. They have bylaws in place restricting plant height, usually to avoid seed spread, and deter vermin. But many cities are now relaxing these laws to grant certain yards “natural garden” status

Low-maintenance lawn

Finally, for those who are not quite ready to get rid of their lawns but still want to cut back on their water use, there are lots of options to mimic the look of soft grass but with a fraction of the maintenance.

Drought-tolerant grass alternatives include microclover, white clover, creeping red fescue, ryegrasses and sedges. These varieties can either replace a typical lawn completely, or be sown in with regular grass to reduce the water needs of a lawn. Some choices, such as clover, actually add nitrogen to the soil, thereby eliminating the need to fertilize the grass around it.

The downsides of these grass alternatives is the seeds are often hard to find in stores, but can be ordered online. Fescues and ryegrasses are not as soft as turf grass, and while clover is soft, it can also flower and attract bees. But many of these problems can be managed with regular mowings.",[]

CTV News has looked at the fine print, so you don't have to.

Perhaps you've seen one of the ads in your Facebook news feed. They might have headlines pronouncing a ""shocking deal… you won't believe,"" for example, that tempt you with a chance to have the latest model for just $1. When you click through, you might even have seen the Apple logo associated with the offer. But you'd have to carefully read beyond the headlines about a $1 giveaway, to notice that it's not being sold at that price. Instead, if you want to snag a new phone for cheap, you'll have to become trial members of Funkyclock.com, at a cost of $1.

And when you sign up, and don't scrutinize the fine print, you could unwittingly end up on the hook for a lot more money.

Here are a few key points gleaned from the website's terms and conditions that you'd have to agree to, in order to sign up:

The $1 is not a fee to receive a new phone, but rather the price of a trial membership to Funkyclock.com that entitles you to a chance at winning prizes

Trial memberships are automatically renewed as ongoing subscriptions when the initial trial period ends, unless you go through the process of cancelling before then, by following the correct procedure in accordance with the site's conditions.

Those who do sign up can immediately start to play games on the Funkyclock.com website that give winners the chance to get an iPhone or other device. But if you win a prize, you can only collect it if you continue your membership for at least one month beyond the trial period.

Members are charged an ongoing monthly fee of $129 a month once the trial period expires and the ongoing membership begins.

Of course, the company reserves the right to change its conditions at any time.

Daniel Williams, an expert with the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre, told CTVNews.ca that the agency has received several reports from consumers concerning Funkyclock.com.

He said that, generally, consumers should be on alert whenever they're asked to provide a credit card to enter a contest or receive a promotional offer.

Typically, he explained, the initial nominal fee you're asked to pay is ""just the tip of the iceberg.""

""If you don't look carefully, there's usually terms and conditions tucked away somewhere that state that, by entering your credit card number, you're agreeing to some membership plan or some type of service, which will result in ongoing charges.""

Williams said most consumers who sign up for these types of deals ultimately feel that they've been cheated.

""They feel defrauded, they feel deceived. They demand their money back, and they want nothing to do with companies that do business like this,"" he said.

He suggests that consumers who believe they've been defrauded by a company online file a report with the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre.

They should also promptly dispute the charges with their credit card company, as many card issuers offer support for consumers in these types of situations, Williams said.

And if the consumer believes that the fraud was a criminal act, they should file a report with the police, he said.

To avoid falling victim to these kinds of monthly-payment schemes, Williams said consumers should avoid offers that only accept credit card payments.

""If the company is insisting on a credit card, what they're telling you, without saying out in the open, is 'We plan on charging you more,'"" he said.

Funkyclock.com did not respond to CTVNews.ca's requests for comment. An Apple spokesperson told CTVNews.ca that the company is not associated with Funkyclock.com.",[]

JASPER NATIONAL PARK, ALBERTA

The stargazing in Jasper National Park is so inspiring they put a soundtrack to it. During the park’s Dark Sky Festival every October, the outdoor Edmonton Symphony Orchestra Strings perform during the “Symphony Under the Stars” show. Jasper was designated a “Dark-Sky Preserve” by the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada in 2011 due to optimal dark sky viewing amid very little light pollution.

GARIBALDI PROVINCIAL PARK, BRITISH COLUMBIA

This park is conveniently located a short drive from the resort town of Whistler, B.C., and is a popular hiking and camping site. “Its high altitude and low light pollution make it an excellent stargazing spot for adventurers, nature lovers and amateur astronomers alike,” said the Space Agency on its website.

GRASSLANDS NATIONAL PARK, SASKATCHEWAN

Located near the border of Montana and Saskatchewan, Grasslands National Park was designated a “Dark-Sky Preserve” in 2009. In fact, it’s the darkest of the dark-sky preserves in the whole country, the Space Agency says. “Visitors can marvel at the Milky Way, constellations and other astronomical phenomena that are very difficult to see near urban areas,” the website reads.

WHITESHELL PROVINCIAL PARK, MANITOBA

Whiteshell might not be a designated “Dark-Sky Preserve,” but it still offers an awe-inspiring experience, says the Space Agency, thanks in part to the “astronomy-related wonder” that is West Hawk Lake. The lake is situated in a meteorite crater several million years old. “Catch a delightful sunset on the lakeshore before looking up at night for a sight of the Milky Way,” the Agency says.

CHARLESTON LAKE PROVINCIAL PARK, ONTARIO

Each year from July to mid-August, stargazers in the northern hemisphere can catch a glimpse of the Perseid meteor shower, and Charleston Lake is a hot spot for viewing, the Space Agency says. They even have astronomers present during viewing parties that can help provide amateur viewers with an optimal experience.

MONT-MÉGANTIC INTERNATIONAL DARK-SKY RESERVE, QUEBEC

Located about 40 km from the town of Lac-Megantic, Mont-Megantic National Park is the site of the International Dark-Sky Association’s first International Dark Sky Reserve, a separate designation from the Canadian Space Agency’s dark-sky preserves. The scientific observatory is located at the summit of Mont Megantic.

TORNGAT MOUNTAINS NATIONAL PARK, NEWFOUNDLAND

Amateurs be warned: Torngat Mountains National Park might be too challenging for the casual outdoor lover. Located in a remote location near the tip of the province, the park is only accessible by boat or charter plane. “The scenery is worth the extra effort, as northern lights are very bright and frequent,” the Space Agency says. “Inuit culture, astronomy and captivating landscapes collide for an unforgettable excursion.”

HOPEWELL ROCKS PROVINCIAL PARK, NEW BRUNSWICK

The stunning New Brunswick tourist spot is typically visited for its beaches and the fascination with the high- and low-tide viewing of the Hopewell Rocks, also known as the Flower Pot Rocks, a wonder of millions of years of tidal erosion. It’s “the perfect spot for those who are interested in both geology and astronomy,” says the Space Agency.

PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND NATIONAL PARK, P.E.I.

This small, 27 square km national park features low light pollution and is a pleasant seaside escape, whether you’re stargazing or not. The Canadian Space Agency says the nearby Cavendish Beach is also a good option for nighttime stargazing.

KEJIMKUJIK NATIONAL PARK, NOVA SCOTIA

Designated a Dark-Sky Preserve in 2010, Kejimkujik National Park -- also known as “Keji” -- offers public stargazing events twice a year called the “Dark Sky Weekend.” The park also has a close relationship with First Nations traditions, so visitors can learn about the importance of astronomy in Mi’kmaq culture while they stargaze.

WATSON LAKE, YUKON

Home to the Northern Lights Space and Science Centre, Watson Lake provides an educational experience with its stargazing. Lucky visitors might catch a glimpse of the aurora too.

IQALUIT, NUNAVUT

With short daylight hours in the winter, Iqaluit is a prime location for stargazing and viewing the northern lights. “You can enjoy a colourful night sky from October to April,” says the Space Agency, “but be sure to bundle up: it can get extremely cold during those months.”

WOOD BUFFALO NATIONAL PARK, NORTHWEST TERRITORIES

The largest Dark-Sky Preserve in the whole world at nearly 45,000 square km, Wood Buffalo National Park sits mostly in Alberta, but crosses into the southern edge of the Northwest Territories. The park is also home to the largest herd of free-roaming wood bison. In other words, you can see more than stars at Wood Buffalo National Park.",[]

The move was announced by Chief Frank Roberts in a Facebook video posted Wednesday night.

""We've had one (COVID-19) test that's come back that's positive,"" Roberts said.

Anyone who had been in contact with the person who tested positive was instructed to self-isolate.

""Others are encouraged to remain within or around their households to prevent cross-contamination.""

Roberts said the lockdown would fully come into effect Friday evening, providing a window for community members who were not required to self-isolate to leave to purchase essential goods or check on their traplines.

However, Roberts said after Friday's deadline no one would be allowed to return to the community, located roughly 100 kilometres north of Prince Albert.

In the video, Roberts said access would be limited to public buildings but essential services would continue.

The community's grocery store would continue operating with social distancing measures in place.

""We've done pretty good at the store, but now it's going to be a little bit stricter there,"" Roberts said.

Amanda Nelson, the nurse manager at the community's health centre, also appeared in the video.

""If you are sick, stay home,"" Nelson said.

She said the Medical Health Officer was aware of the case and that sanitizer, masks and COVID-19-related information would be dropped off at homes in the community.

""We've been preparing for this the last couple months,"" Nelson said.

""Hopefully we can nip this in the bud.""

COVID-19 put a stop to those plans and with free time to fill, Hocknes is learning COVID-19 isn’t the first virus to force school closures and claim lives in Saskatoon.

“We had the Spanish flu in 1918 where millions of people died, so history does repeat itself and you start to see that more and more,” Hocknes said.

Over the past two-and-a-half years, Hocknes has devoted time to read through old editions of the Saskatoon StarPhoenix spanning the 20th Century, in an effort to collect and achieve Saskatoon’s history.

“I embarked on this project to look at the history of Saskatoon and learn all the stories that have been forgotten,” Hocknes said, adding he’s also working on the history of Saskatoon’s music scene.

Hocknes has read through 600,000 newspapers, compiling 49,000 articles he felt should be remembered now and by future generations.

Those stories include Saskatoon residents just getting the first numbers volunteering for the Second World War; an old high school near the riverbank training soldiers how to operate machine guns; and Saskatoon getting hooked up to natural gas energy.

“That was a big deal and it came at a big cost,” he said.

Everything Hocknes clips, he scans, saves and post to his Facebook page Saskatoon History Photos StarPhoenix Memories Vintage Discussions.

“Every day I learn 100 new things I’ve never heard of before and hopefully everyone else does too,” he said.

He said his page has 2,700 followers, many of which no longer reside in Saskatchewan but grew up in the prairies.

Hocknes said once he’s captured the stories of Saskatoon from 1902 to 1999 his goal is to publish a series of books to preserve these stories for generations to come.

If given the choice, would Hocknes go back in time?

“As much as we might like living in the past, I don’t think we could get along with people because our morals and vibe has changed so much I don’t think I could have a conversation with a relative 100 years ago, they wouldn’t know what to make of me.”",[]

Morin was reported missing on July 10, 2018 from North Battleford. Since then the RCMP said it believes Morin was the victim of a homicide.

A small crowd gathered in front of the Saskatoon Police Service headquarters and began walking to North Battleford, a trek expected to take three days.

“We keep pushing ourselves saying ‘Ashley is out there somewhere,’” said Krista Fox, a friend and spokesperson for the family.

“We gotta keep going, we can’t give up, we give up now then we’ve given up and we won’t do that. We will go to the ends of earth to bring our girl home.”

Fox said following the walk from Saskatoon to North Battleford last year, tips concerning Morin's disappearance came in, and Fox is hopeful for more information to come forward after this year’s march.

Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations Chief Bobby Cameron spoke to the group before they set out, expressing his sympathy to the family for what they’re going through.

“The hopelessness that the family feels … we pray with the family and we stand with the family that one day we hope for the best outcome that she comes home alive to be with you guys,” he said.

During the investigation into Morin’s disappearance RCMP said they haven’t found any cell phone, social media or banking activity since she was reported missing.

Last year investigators released a blurry image of a two-toned windowless van believed to be connected to Morin’s disappearance.

Mounties said it was on the corner of 96th Street and 16th Avenue in North Battleford, July 10, 2018, around 9:30 p.m., one one of the locations RCMP say Morin was last seen,",[]

The WSA said it recommends caution as fast-moving water can pose a hazard and that there is a potential for flooding in the area.

""Peak flows are expected in the Beauval area in early July and Lac Ile-a-la-Crosse is expected to peak in mid-July,"" the WSA said in a news release.

The agency said peak flows on the system are exceeding or could exceed 2017 levels and could approach record levels seen in 1974.

The WSA said Lac La Ronge remains at elevated levels and that levels will continue to rise over the next couple weeks, but flooding is not anticipated.

According to the WSA, flows into Reindeer Lake are at a record high and the lake is currently at ""full supply level.""

""Flows out of Reindeer Lake from Whitesand Dam have been increased but are not yet at full capacity,"" the WSA said.

""A combination of high flows from Whitesand Dam combined with flows on the Churchill River will result in the highest flows on record at Island Falls and Sandy Bay.""

That record, set in 2005, was a flow of 2300 metres per second, according to the WSA.

""It is expected that the water levels will rise over the next few days, and flows will cause localized flooding downstream of Island Falls,"" the WSA said.

Flows will stay ""well above normal"" east of Peter Pond Lake into the winter months, according to the WSA.

The WSA said its working with SaskPower on water release plans to minimize damage and is notifying people who could be affected.

""Any landowners near the Beaver River are also advised to be aware of the situation and potential impacts to property,"" the WSA said Thursday.

High levels around Tobin Lake

The WSA also says continued high moisture on the Saskatchewan River system will lead to increased outflows immediately at EB Campbell Power Station below Tobin Lake.

Flows are expected to surpass 2,000 cubic metres per second over the next day, leading to possible localized flooding in the delta area, according to a news release. Elevations are also expected to rise at Tobin Lake.

Residents, communities and First Nations in these areas are advised that high flows pose a safety risk and high water levels could damage property and infrastructure over the coming days.

Users are advised to use caution around the watercourses as swift moving water can pose a hazard and to take steps to protect property where necessary, the WSA says.",[]

The store was started by the great-granddaughter of Métis trapper Louis LaVallee.

Linda Lavallee returned to area once lived in by her ancestors and is part of land claim filed against the federal government.

She said Louis LaVallee and his sons were displaced from their cabin on the shore of LaVallee Lake in order to make way for the formation on Prince Albert National Park.

“That was the year he got kicked out. It’s the year we lost everything,” said LaVallee. She said the store puts her family back on their ancestral territory. Louis Lavallee’s cabin was in what is now the park’s north west corner, she said.

The store sells Creenisgaa leather boots designed by LaVallee. They have been featured on the runway in New York’s Fashion Week and have been sold to customers around the world. The boots are known for their lace-up design and Indigenous-themed prints.

This is Creenisgaa’s first brick and mortar store.

LaVallee lives in British Columbia but said Waskesui is the right place to set up shop.

“I had told my husband when we started that we are doing this for the First Nations around here, not for the tourists. It’s just to bring our culture back home.”

LaVallee’s husband and son also have art work and clothing for sale in Creenisgaa. Around 17 Indigenous people from British Columbia to Manitoba have art, tea and other goods for sale in the store. LaVallee said she’s looking to add more products.

“We are still needing more artwork and beadwork from local people. And we are willing to trade materials for goods with artisans,” said LaVallee.

All five of the store’s employees are LaVallee family members from Timber Bay and area.

Ribbon skirts, art, tea and jewelry are some of the items carried in store. The store also carries supplies for local designers like cloth and beads.

LaVallee wants to promote the speaking of Cree and write Cree words outside the store. She also donated to the Cree language education programs in her home community and paid each student a dollar for every Cree word they learned.

Colton Klassen with the Saskatchewan Huskies found out on Twitter that his university football career may be over.

“I think at first glance, I was just in shock really. I thought it would be an easy decision to make.”

That decision was how U Sports would approach the age cap of 25 in football when play is scheduled to resume in 2021.

Despite having one more year of eligibility left with this season being cancelled because of the pandemic, Klassen is now amoung five Saskatchewan Huskies that will turn 25 before the start of the 2021 season, and won’t be allowed to play.

“We don’t have the choice to come back or play that fifth year is what’s heartbreaking, because you can’t do anything right?

“Playing that fifth year, in your final year, and getting that farewell tour kind of feeling, you play for that. You live for that.”

The other Huskies that would have their careers ended early are Yol Piok, Jace Peters, Nick Summach, and Joseph Trumpy.

“I don’t think it’s the right thing to do,” said Saskatchewan Huskies head coach Scott Flory.

“I just don’t feel it’s in the best interest, I don’t feel it’s consistent, and I don’t think it’s right.”

Flory is one of many coaches across the country who are disappointed with the decision, with University of Alberta Golden Bears head coach Chris Morris going so far as to step down from his position with the Canadian University Football Coaches Association.

I spoke to @UACoachMorris who sits on @USPORTSca Football Technical Subcommittee which guides most football decisions. They voted UNANIMOUSLY to extend the age cap for one season.

Nonetheless representatives from all schools (many of which do not offer football) voted against it — Farhan Lalji (@FarhanLaljiTSN) July 9, 2020

“If they’re a student in good standing, and they meet all the eligibility requirements, I don’t understand how and why they can’t play,” said Flory.

“The players that are on our football team that have been the longest serving, aren’t a part of the decision making process. Their best interests aren’t a part of it and that’s a tough one.”

U Sports interim CEO Dick White says the decision was not taken lightly by the Board of Directors, who felt they didn’t want to set a precedent that the age limit, which was put in place to narrow the age discrepancy for the health and safety of younger players, could be manipulated.

“We were very concerned that if we adjusted it, then a challenge could come forward and might eliminate the cap altogether,” he said.

“After having a cap for 10 years, we felt it was a very important component for U Sports football.”

Flory says the decision could affect as many as eight to 10 more of his players in the years to come.

“Maybe because they started late, or maybe because they had injury redshirts for a year or two, maybe because they played junior football.”

The Huskies’ Josh Ewanchyna is one of those players, after lining up for the Hilltops for three years.

“I should probably have three years including this year left of playing football, but now I’ve only got two left,” he said.

Flory believes U Sports should put an exemption on the age limit as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, because “through no fault of their own” players will have had a year of football “ripped away from them.”

“Not extending, and not granting clemency to those guys on every roster. It’s not only my roster, it’s all my opponents’ rosters too. To be honest with you, this affects other teams a lot more than it affects me, but I’m still going to fight for what’s right, and for those guys on that roster.

“It’s not hard either. You just take your existing roster and you just grandfather all those names. I mean, it’s not that hard. We’re not talking about kids coming in, we’re not talking about players that aren’t a part of it.”

White says the board will be taking feedback on the decision seriously and that it will be up for review.

Until that time, should it ever come, Flory says he’ll stand with his players.

“You’re a part of our team,” he said, referring to the five players. “You’re in school, you’re a member in good standing with us, and you are a part of our football team until they say on September 1st 2021 or whatever, that you can’t put on a jersey anymore.”",[]

The city does not have a whistleblower program or reporting mechanism for employees, vendors or citizens to report concerns regarding suspected waste or wrongdoing, the RFI says.

The RFI calls for, among other items, the main components of an effective whistleblower program and its estimated annual cost.

A whistleblower policy is under development and will be presented to City Council for approval in the coming months, the RFI says.

The policy would apply to all city employees but not employees of independent boards and corporations such as Saskatoon Police Service, Saskatoon Public Library, Remai Modern, SaskTel Centre and TCU Place.

“We have to separate what we want the police response to be within our community and what may be the norm now,” said Scott Thompson, assistant professor in the Department of Sociology.

Thompson made the comments following the controversial arrest of Evan Penner, who told CTV News he was using a garden hose in front of an apartment building to cool off when police tried to arrest him.

A video of Penner's arrest was released on Monday by the Indigenous Joint Action Coalition and Black Lives Matter Saskatoon, with members of the two groups alleging that excessive force was used. In photos taken on Wednesday, Penner can be seen with a bruised right eye with scrapes and bruises on the right side of his forehead, cheekbone and ear.

Saskatoon Police Services (SPS) has said the initial officer on-scene was responding to a report of a suspicious person. The 27-year-old man reportedly had caused damage to a property and when the officer attempted to take him into custody, he resisted and attempted to disarm the officer, SPS said.

Thompson also said the Saskatoon Police Association (SPA) has been defensive in its response to the public outcry over the video.

The SPA said in a recent Facebook post Canadian police are being scrutinized because of incidents that have occurred in the United States.

“Canadian police officers should not be compared to officers in the US. We are well-trained, we have forged important relationships within the community, and we are well compensated. For these reasons, we attract more qualified officers; oftentimes with college degrees and valuable life experiences.”

Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin has been the subject of national fury in America since footage emerged of him kneeling on Black man George Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes as Floyd begged him to stop.

Floyd’s death sparked national and international protests – with American police sometimes filmed acting violently in response - and debates over the role of police in communities.

In the post, the SPA alleged Penner attempted to flee from the backyard and a confrontation ensued. The SPA says Penner grabbed the officer’s Taser, breaking the officer’s duty belt. After pepper spray was ineffective, Penner struck the officer in the face and attempted to bite him, then ripped both ammunition magazines off the officer's belt and tried to hit the offer with it.

“Possibly one of the most controversial issues in policing today is the proper application of force,” the SPA said in its Facebook post.

“Most people in the public have never been involved in an actual physical confrontation with another person. Society’s perception of police use of force is often tainted through the media, television and movies. Rarely do any of these accurately show reality.”

The SPA said the public will be less safe if officers are hesitant to go to calls and if officers hesitate at calls where they must make quick decisions.

However, Thompson said what’s getting lost is the question of whether a better solution to the problem exists.

“It brings us back to the core question of those pushing for defunding police, of asking the question, are we asking the police to do too much right now? What the police can do is limited - they can arrest someone or move them down the block and none of those solutions solve the problem the person had of needing to have a shower.

“The fact (the police association is) pushing back and saying force was justified in this situation is not addressing the issue that bringing the police officer to the situation is actually escalating or could have led to the result of the need of the use of force. It could be that another person would be better versed in dealing with someone and working to solve the problems that individual has.”

The fact that the SPA claims this was the third time officers dealt with Penner in the same day shows there’s a need that isn’t being met by the community, Thompson said.

Penner told CTV News he “was perfectly normal, positive and calm all the time.""

The arrest is to be investigated by the Saskatchewan Public Complaints Commission.

Calgarians gathered at Southcentre Mall early Saturday to participate in a traditional pancake breakfast served up by volunteers with the Calgary Stampede. The event was part of the traditional breakfasts put on by the official Calgary Stampede committee for what would have been the 2020 edition of the Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth.

The only difference this year was all the guests were served inside their vehicles, safely physically distanced from one another as well as the workers at the griddles.

The changes were put in place because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the same situation that cancelled the entire Calgary Stampede.

Organizers weren't going to let that stop them from serving up some western spirit and hospitality.

""This idea came up in about mid-April. I had done the YYC Food Truck drive-thru at this exact mall and I said, 'I don't think there's a reason we can't do this via pancake-style,"" said caravan committee chairman Chris Heywood.

The idea was also extremely popular among Calgarians. Originally, they started at 5,000 slots for people to sign up for and those were snapped up in about a day and a half. Another 2,500 spots were added and those quickly went too.

""Yesterday, at our breakfast at Brookfield Residential YMCA Seton, I just thought, 'Let's make tomorrow wide open and finish with a bang. You don't have to sign up, just come on down and we're going to serve pancakes until we have run out of product, really.""

The committee is made up of 195 volunteers who all work together to put on pancake breakfasts for the Calgary Stampede.

Breakfast served at Calgary malls too

Other organizations are serving up pancakes as well during what would have been Stampede week. Cadillac Fairview has two events scheduled Saturday at Chinook Centre and Market Mall.

While the pancakes won't be hot and ready for guests, officials say they'll be handing out DIY pancake kits so you can bring Stampede home with you.

""As a dedicated community member, Cadillac Fairview (CF) is helping Calgarians celebrate The Calgary Stampede and everything it encompasses - community spirit, togetherness (while apart), excitement and family fun - in a reimagined, safe and enjoyable way,"" the company says in a release.

Despite the lack of a live event, CF says it will still be presenting a donation to the Alberta Children's Hospital Foundation as it has done for all 59 previous years it has held the breakfast.

The major retailer, which is headquartered in Vancouver, said the move was a ""last resort"" made necessary by the various pandemic-related challenges businesses are facing across the country.

""The declaration of a public health emergency, the various public health recommendations, federal and provincial government mandated restrictions on gatherings, the need for social distancing, the considerable economic impact, and the impact of COVID-19 generally has had a significant impact on the retail industry, MEC and our teams,"" the company said in an email statement.

""We are committed to moving forward in the best interest of our organization, employees, and members during this global crisis.""

MEC did not confirm exactly how many employees were let go, but said it totalled ""less than 200 front-line staff"" across Canada. CTV News has asked for more information on the impacts in British Columbia, which is home to five of the company's 21 stores.

On the MEC website, seven locations have been listed as ""closed until further notice,"" while the other 14 remain open for business.

The retailer told CTV News the stores that are currently shut down are ""temporarily closed, not permanently closed.""

""After experiencing the effects of COVID-19 for approximately four months, we have a better understanding of MEC member needs during this global crisis at our open stores and therefore have had to adjust staffing levels accordingly,"" the company said.",[]

Arnold Teixeira, owner of The Starving Artist in Ocean Grove, told CNN the customer has been a regular since 2001. He did not want to reveal the identity.

""The customer and his family ate their meal and left without saying a word,"" Teixeira said. ""When the waiter serving them saw the tip, she just started crying. Then another one of my staff members saw it and started crying, too. And then I see it, and I couldn't help but cry. It was just extremely emotional because it's been a really difficult time for us.""

The customer was having breakfast last week at The Starving Artist, which just celebrated its 21st anniversary, when he left the massive tip along with a heartwarming note.

""Thank you so much for working through this tough time,"" the note read.

""We are grateful for your delicious food, warm smiles, and great atmosphere... Please know we appreciate you all very much. It wouldn't be a good summer without the Starving Artist,"" the tipper added.

At the end of the note, the customer asked that the $1,000 tip be divided amongst the entire staff. Teixeira split it between his seven staff members -- not including himself.

The longtime owner of the restaurant, a beloved favorite of the Ocean Grove local and summer crowds, said he wasn't even sure he would be able to keep the business open after the pandemic forced him to close its door in March.

""Things just kept getting worse. It got to the point where I was preparing for the possibility that we might not be able to reopen again. And now we aren't even making 50% of what we usually bring in the middle of the summer season,"" Teixeira said.

""But this tip restored our hope in humanity. It made us feel so good about what we're doing. We go through a lot of steps to protect our customers, and it gets exhausting after a while, but now we know our efforts have actually been noticed.""",[]

Paige Fogen and other family members travelled to the site north of Pemberton B.C. July 3, and returned to Lethbridge Monday.

“We are just getting more information to say he wasn’t there by himself, or probably wasn’t there by choice, or he might not have been there ever,” said Fogen.

Iwaasa was 26 years old when he was last seen in Lethbridge November 17, 2019. His burned-out truck was found about a week later, at the end of a rugged trail surrounded by forest.

Fogen said the location is so remote, and the trail so rough, she simply can’t believe Iwaasa would end up there on his own.

“It made me feel like he never drove his truck there at all or he didn't drive there by choice,” said Fogen, who said there were lots of spots where she thought they were going to get stuck or bottom out.

“Marshal wasn't the kind of person to take his vehicle and just destroy it to get to this point of essentially no return.”

Paige said the family was driven to the site by members of an off-road group called 4LOW BC. She said they pointed out some odd circumstances, including extra vehicle parts found in the area, and signs that some pieces of Iwaasa's truck were missing. Based on the wreckage, it appeared the parts may have been removed before the vehicle was burned.

Fogen said there were other troubling signs, including a PlayStation and Xbox previously thought to be Iwaasa’s that were found near the truck. “I went to clean out his apartment and his things were there. His PlayStation and Xbox systems were there. So I am not sure whose those were at the scene.”

A week before Fogen’s trip Lethbridge Police and RCMP conducted an exhaustive search of the area. Paige said Iwaasa’s family is still waiting for information on their findings, including a report from a fire investigator who examined the vehicle.

The search, that included dogs, drones, and a helicopter, did not locate Iwaasa’s body. Fogen said she is anxious to know what police plan to do next. “Because for me, just saying that he chose to do this, or went up for a hike, none of those make sense at this point, and that’s not an okay answer for us.”

Lethbridge Police have not yet provided an update on the search. The case was originally handled by Pemberton RCMP but turned over to the Lethbridge Police Service last December.",[]
515,ctvnews,https://calgary.ctvnews.ca/ama-survey-42-per-cent-of-doctors-say-they-re-considering-leaving-alberta-1.5018537,AMA survey: 42 per cent of doctors say they're considering leaving Alberta,[],2020-07-09 21:59:00-06:00,"CALGARY -- Contentious changes to the way they are paid are driving a sizable portion of Alberta physicians to consider practising elsewhere, according to a survey conducted by the Alberta Medical Association (AMA), but Health Minister Tyler Shandro is questioning whether the grass will be greener outside the province.

Of the respondents, 87 per cent of physicians said they will make changes to their medical practices as a result of the new billing framework announced by Health Minister Tyler Shandro.

Among those, almost one half (49 per cent) said they have made plans or are considering leaving the province to work elsewhere.

Of the physicians surveyed:

34 per cent said they may leave the profession or retire early

48 per cent said they’re considering changes to how they offer services

43 per cent said they would reduce office hours

34 per cent said they would lay off staff

The survey comes after months of confrontation with Shandro, who the AMA criticized Friday, describing his behavior as an ""extremely aggressive and inconsistent approach"" to implementing the changes.

Those negotiations included the passage of Bill 21, which gives the province the right to break existing contracts with Alberta doctors and pre-approves the province to not honour the terms of any future agreements.

Shandro was criticized for events in February, when he terminated the province’s existing contract with doctors and announced a new funding framework — until public backlash resulted in the province temporarily backtracking on many of its new policies.

In March, the AMA filed a Charter challenge against the government for bad faith bargaining and unilaterally terminating the right to arbitration for physicians, despite their designation as an essential service.

On Monday, Shandro introduced Bill 30, which physicians view as another provocation and attack by the province on Alberta’s healthcare system.

""Physicians have reached a breaking point,"" said AMA president Dr. Christine Molnar. ""I’m deeply troubled by where this is going and what it’s going to mean for medical practices and patients in the coming months.""

Province responds

The Alberta government filed a statement of defence Thursday in response to the AMA’s statement of claim that they negotiated in bad faith.

""Alberta’s economy has been devastated over the past five years and our budget has faced shortfalls as a result,” it said, in a statement issued by Shandro. “Our goal throughout negotiations was to simply hold the line on cost overruns while maintaining spending at the highest level ever. Alberta’s negotiators worked hard and in good faith to arrive at an acceptable agreement.""

Shandro released a second statement Friday morning, following the release of the survey results, where he said it was ""questionable"" whether doctors would leave for other provinces where ""they'd earn far less than in Alberta under our current funding arrangement,"" as the province is ""committed to maintaing spending on physicians at $5.4 billion a year.""

""The AMA needs to stop playing games, and start taking the economic crisis facing this province and this country seriously,"" Shandro said in Friday's statement. ""We’re still offering to hold our spending at the highest level in Canada, and frankly that commitment is looking more generous by the day, considering the fiscal situation in this province and this country. But we stand by it. Now it’s up to the AMA to decide what part they want to play in decision-making as we go forward.

""Since Albertans should know the facts, the government is also exploring introducing physician compensation transparency, as exists for public servants in Alberta and physicians in a number of other provinces.""

The survey was conducted between June 24 and Juy 3, with a sample of 1,470 physicians from across the province. The results are considered accurate within 2.4 percentage points on either side.

All Albertans are suffering during the pandemic crisis and physicians expect to experience challenges. But unlike other businesses where govts are taking extraordinary measures to assist, AB govt has gone out of its way to undermine medical practices across the province.

In a statement to CTV News, Parks Canada says the wolf was spotted by staff near the Sunshine Village Ski resort displaying problem behaviour three weeks ago.

Within the past week it was being closely monitored by officials, who say the animal appeared very thin while displaying ""human food conditioning"" behaviour so it was euthanized for public safety on Tuesday.

The same wolf could be behind another incident of ""bold wolf behaviour"" also under investigation.

A warning posted near the the Healy Creek, Egypt Lake and Pharaoh Creek areas says the backcountry campgrounds are closed after a wolf removed items from a tent and scoured for food at another campsite.

A warning is also in place for areas in and around the town of Banff, which includes Tunnel Mountain, the Fairmont Banff Springs Golf Course, Minnewanka Loop, Cascade Ponds and Johnson Lake Reservoir.

""We put our food right away in our camper, and don’t throw anything outside and don’t feed any wildlife,"" said Maryam Javed while camping with her family near Tunnel Mountain on Thursday.

The third reported encounter also happened on the weekend.

The wolf was spotted on Highway One just east of the Town of Banff - and later spotted near Banff Avenue.

It was described as showing bold behaviour - approaching vehicles with dogs.

There's a wolf warning in effect for the town and nearby Tunnel Mountain camping and resort areas.

Public safety

Upon learning of the death of the problem wolf, one visitor said he supported the decision for public safety.

""There are lots of areas that the wildlife are able to go and there are areas that people like to go and I think people have the right of way,"" said Gord Graves.

One conservation expert working on contract for the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society said she was saddened to learn a Banff wolf had been put down — saying it's a difficult decision for officers.

""The less human activity you have, the greater the chance carnivores have to live a happy full life without risk of conflict with people,"" said Sarah Elmeligi, wildlife biologist.

She also emphasizes that people have the responsibility to enjoy the mountains without bringing harm to the wildlife.

""I’d like to live in a world were especially in national parks and provincial parks we put wildlife ahead of our own recreational needs,"" she said.

Parks Canada also says people should never approach, entice or feed wildlife and all food, garbage, and pet food should be stored inside a building or vehicle.

Children should be supervised and pets kept on a leash at all times.

Bear spray is also recommended and wolf sightings reported immediately to Banff Dispatch at 403-762-1470.",[]

Honourable Jason Nixon, Minister of Environment and Parks

RE: Open Letter: Rehabilitated grizzly cubs can boost Alberta grizzly bear recovery

We, the 73 (104) signatories of this letter, are deeply concerned about the three orphaned grizzly cubs in the Calgary Zoo, as well as Alberta’s grizzly bear population.

We would like to thank Alberta Fish and Wildlife for rescuing the three cubs and for the care that the Calgary Zoo has provided them.

Our group respectfully requests that Alberta Fish and Wildlife consider rehabilitating and releasing these cubs into the Alberta wilderness to boost the province’s grizzly bear population rather than condemning these bears to long-term captive care.

Many Albertans fully support this approach, given that grizzly bears are a threatened species in Alberta and rehabilitation and release into the wild is the most humane solution. Science shows that wild animals suffer immeasurably in captivity. The Calgary Zoo was one of the first zoos to treat polar bears with Prozac to mitigate the psychological trauma of captivity and the development of disorders.

The age and health of these three cubs make them ideal candidates for the only grizzly cub rehabilitation program in North America, namely the Northern Lights Wildlife Shelter in Smithers, B.C. Since its inception in 2007, this shelter has raised and released twenty-five grizzly cubs without serious incident.

Once successfully reared and capable of surviving in the wild on their own, the cubs would be released back into an appropriate area with as little human development as possible.

Our group believes that rehabilitating these three orphaned cubs is a critical first step to revamping Alberta’s commitment to grizzly bear conservation and recovery. Since 2013, when the last recovery plan expired, Alberta has been without a recovery plan to guide these efforts. It is time to revisit the 2016 draft plan and update it with the best-available science to improve habitat security and reduce human-caused mortality. This recent incident is a stark reminder of how quickly and tragically healthy grizzlies can disappear from the landscape.

While some grizzly bear populations in the lower 48 American states have increased dramatically, Alberta’s population has seen no significant increase since the species was designated as threatened in 2010.

As part of the grizzly bear recovery plan update, we urge the Alberta government to consider licensing one or more of the Alberta bear rehabilitation facilities for grizzly bear rehabilitation.

Thank you for putting the welfare of the cubs and Alberta’s grizzly bear population first. We look forward to a timely response to our requests.

Respectfully,

AHS’ Environmental Public Health (EPH) department is heading up the inspection about concerns raised at the bar this past weekend.

“The public complaints related to a lack of social distancing precautions and providing a shisha service,” reads a statement from AHS.

A video taken from what appears to be inside of Fire N Ice on Saturday and shared publicly on Snapchat shows a bar busy with patrons who are dancing close together with few people wearing face masks.

“The video is very concerning to EPH as the activities taking place in this establishment are not aligned with requirements within the order of the Chief Medical Officer of Health,” the AHS statement says.

Fire N Ice has not yet responded to emails, phone calls and a Facebook message from CTV News requesting a comment. Its doors have been locked when CTV visited repeatedly during normal business hours.

AHS says its inspectors have visited Fire N Ice previously and noted minor infractions.

“A follow-up inspection will soon take place to emphasize the importance of adhering to requirements set out in the order.”

Evan Woolley is the councillor for the Beltline area where Fire N Ice is located. He says he’s seen some concerning behaviour at businesses in his ward, particularly along 17th Avenue, but he believes most are doing a good job following the rules.

However, Woolley says, all establishments and people have to be diligent in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

“We have to be accountable collectively within our community, and individuals have to be accountable. And if they are not going to take those precautions and put those protocols in place, we absolutely need and do have the tools to enforce those safety measures,” the Ward 8 councillor says.

While bars are allowed to be open under Alberta’s phased relaunch, nightclubs and hookah lounges are not yet permitted and there’s no timeline for when they will be allowed.",[]

All eligible members of the largest federal public service union who have been directly or indirectly impacted by the problem-plagued federal payroll system, are set to receive a $2,500 one-time payment.

The compensation includes money for the late implementation of collective agreements over the years when the government was trying to get the program under control. The payments are broken down by year, with $1,000 for fiscal year 2016-17 and $500 for each of the three years since.

The union says all members paid through the system are eligible to claim each designated amount for each year in which they were employed, including former federal workers or their estates.

The deal was reached on July 9. In a statement, Treasury Board President Jean-Yves Duclos said he is “pleased,” with the “tentative agreement.”

“All employees represented by PSAC will receive compensation for the toll that the Phoenix pay system has had on their lives. This is a testament to our commitment to reaching fair and equitable agreements, mindful of today’s economic and fiscal context,” Duclos said.

Over the course of the implementation of the now years-old payroll system, thousands of employees experienced being underpaid, overpaid, or not paid at all as the government tried to triage what quickly became a massive backlog in cases of pay issues that left many workers in financial hardship for months.

The agreement also includes changes to the current claims process for out-of-pocket expenses and other financial losses related to the faulty payroll program, as well as additional compensation for “severe impacts and other demonstrable cases.”

These severe cases included workers who accumulated outstanding debts due to missing payments, or who lost their cars, homes, or other major financial assets as a result of not being paid properly.

“This new agreement is a substantial improvement from the one negotiated by other federal bargaining agents,” said PSAC in a statement. Other federal unions have already agreed to offering impacted members an additional five days of paid sick leave, but PSAC calls that offering “meagre,” and not equitable as it “rewarded the highest earners and punished those with lower wages when cashed out.”

A YEARS-LONG HEADACHE

The Phoenix system, initiated by the previous Conservative government in 2009, was meant to streamline the payroll of public servants and save more than $70-million annually. But after problems with the system emerged, the previous public services and procurement minister told CTV News back in 2017 that it was possible the cost to get things under control could hit $1 billion.

After it went live in April 2016, the government had to hire more staff and set up satellite pay centres in Gatineau, Montreal, Winnipeg, and Shawinigan, Que., to try to chip away at the pile of problem cases.

As of June 24, according to the public service pay centre dashboard that’s been reporting the status of resolving cases, there were still 125,000 financial transactions to be made beyond the normal workload, and the percentage of cases being processed within the service standards was at 71 per cent, with a target of 95 per cent.

The initial promise from the department was to have the backlog of problematic pay cases resolved by the end of October 2016.",[]

The charity group is at the centre of an ethics investigation into Trudeau.

Trudeau's mother, Margaret Trudeau, spoke at approximately 28 events and was paid $250,000 in speaking honorariums between 2016 and 2020. His brother, Alexandre Trudeau, also spoke at eight events from 2017 to 2018 and was paid a total of approximately $32,000.

Over $60,000 of that money, which is typically doled out by corporate sponsors, was paid directly to Margaret Trudeau by the charity as the result of what WE Charity referred to as an ""error"" in billing and payment.

In addition to this, Trudeau's wife, Sophie Gregoire Trudeau, received a ""one-time speaking honorarium"" of $1,400 for participating in a youth event in 2012 before Trudeau became leader of the Liberal Party. The organization said all her other time spent participating in WE events and hosting a podcast series for the charity was ""donated."" This was confirmed to CTV News by Martin Perlmuter, president and CEO of Speakers' Spotlight.

WE Charity also confirmed the payments made to Trudeau's mother and brother in statements sent to CTV News, shortly after Canadaland, which has reported extensively on WE, first broke the story on Twitter.

WE Day is an event that WE Charity organizes alongside corporate partners who sponsor speakers to participate. One of those corporate sponsors is ME to WE Social Enterprise, which was the organization that paid Margaret Trudeau's speaking fees through the Speakers’ Spotlight Speakers' Bureau. Alexandre Trudeau was also paid through Speakers' Spotlight.

However, while the two were paid a total of over $300,000 to speak at the events, over $60,000 of Margaret Trudeau’s speaking fees were paid directly by the charity.

The charity called this an ""error in billing/payment"" that was discovered through an ""internal review.""

""For these speeches the charity paid the speakers' bureau directly, and the charity was reimbursed by ME to WE Social Enterprise for their sponsorship of the speeches,"" WE Charity said in a statement sent to CTV News.

WE Charity said neither they nor ME to WE Social Enterprise have ever paid Justin Trudeau for any speeches or other matters. He has also spoken at a number of WE events globally.

Sophie Gregoire Trudeau is an ambassador with the organization and hosts a mental health podcast under its name.

In an emailed statement sent to CTVNews.ca, Chantal Gagnon, a spokesperson for the Prime Minister's Office, said Trudeau's relatives ""engage with a variety of organizations and support many personal causes on their own accord.""

""What is important to remember here is that this is about a charity supporting students. The Canada Student Service Grant program is about giving young people opportunities to contribute to their communities, not about benefits to anyone else,"" she said in the statement.

However, the charity is already at the centre of an ethics investigation into Trudeau over his potential conflict of interest with the organization.

The federal ethics commissioner launched an investigation into Trudeau last Friday over his government's now-cancelled decision to have WE Charity manage a $900-million federal program, which is slated to pay students and new graduates for their volunteer work this summer.

While the charity has backed out of the management of the program following days of controversy, Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion said in a letter addressed to Conservative MP Michael Barrett that the Tory MP’s request for an investigation ""satisfies the requirements"" laid out in the Conflict of Interest Act.

Specifically, Barrett alleges that Trudeau violated a provision in the Act that ""prohibits public office holders from making any decision or participating in the making of a decision that furthers their private interests or improperly furthers the private interests of another person.""

He claims that Trudeau had a duty to recuse himself from any discussion or decision relating to WE Charity, given the prime minister's close ties to the organization and his wife’s involvement, and that Trudeau violated the Act when he announced that WE Charity would administer the Canada Student Service Grant.

Barrett also alleges Trudeau violated another section of the Act that deals with affording preferential treatment when he said WE Charity was the ""only organization"" qualified to run the program -- given the existence of other national volunteer organizations.

The ethics watchdog found that Barrett's allegations satisfied the requirements of the Act and has launched an investigation into both possible contraventions. Dion notes in his letter that Trudeau has been informed of the investigation.

Gagnon said in a statement sent to CTVNews.ca on Friday that the prime minister plans to ""collaborate"" with the commissioner and will ""answer any questions he may have.""

'JUSTIN TRUDEAU MUST STEP ASIDE'

Bloc Quebecois Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet has called on the prime minister to ""step aside"" while the commissioner investigates.

""In light of new revelations, Justin Trudeau must step aside as Prime minister until the ethics commissioner's investigation is completed,"" he told CTV News in a statement on Thursday.

Blanchet wasn’t the only political voice calling for action after the latest news. Barrett, the Conservative MP who was one of those who initially requested the ethics commissioner investigation, released a statement calling on Parliament to be recalled ""immediately"" to ""get to the bottom of this.""

""All of the documents related to the contract must be made public. Every single Cabinet Minister needs to come clean about whether or not they knew that the Prime Minister's family had a financial relationship with WE Charity when they approved this massive contract,"" Barrett said in the statement.

""Canadians deserve answers and the Prime Minister and his government must be held accountable.""

NDP MP Charlie Angus also weighed in on the latest revelation during a Thursday interview with CTV News Channel. He called the development ""disturbing.""

""Now we learn that throughout his time as prime minister, his family members were receiving enormous amounts of money. How is he not aware of that? I find that hard to believe,"" said Angus.

MPs have taken steps to dig into the issue using the parliamentary tools available to them. The House standing committee on government operations and estimates voted on Thursday night to undertake a study into the government's now-cancelled decision to grant WE Charity the sole-sourced contract, which comes in addition to the recently agreed upon House finance committee study into the same issue.

The document’s gender-based analysis – a breakdown of how COVID-19 has affected men and women differently – shows women have severely felt the weight of COVID-19 both from a health and socio-economic perspective.

This supports the mounting call by advocates for governments at all levels to approach their relief strategies through a gendered lens.

SNAPSHOT CONCLUSIONS

Beyond the sheer fact that more women than men are loosing their lives to the disease, they’re also experiencing deep socio-economic hurt.

Women faced a much steeper decline in job loss between March and April with 1.5 million out of work. This was attributed to the fact that women hold more precarious, part-time jobs.

When looking at the uptake of the essential workers’ wage top-up – a deal struck between the prime minister and the premiers in early May to support workers on the front lines making minimum wage— the majority of beneficiaries were women.

""At the national level, Statistics Canada data indicates that women represent 80 per cent of health-care workers (including employment in long-term care facilities) and more than half of retail, and accommodation and food services workers,"" the snapshot states.

While employment numbers evened out in April, the transition back to work has once again exposed inequities. In May, men rebounded at a rate twice as fast as women, with child care being a major factor.

""Going forward, employment might be expected to increase somewhat faster among men than women in the coming months given the more rapid increase in goods-producing industries in May and the fact that women are more likely to continue with caregiving responsibilities while child-care facilities remain closed and while school is disrupted.""

CHILD-CARE NEEDS

Kate Bezanson, the associate dean of social sciences at Brock University in Ontario, told CTVNews.ca on Thursday that in order for the country to find some economic relief in the months ahead – women and child-care needs must be at the forefront of decision-making.

""Staying out of this recession requires us to invest in social infrastructure, not built infrastructure, social infrastructure, that will create jobs for women and allow women to return to the labour market,"" she said. ""We’ll have all those great ripple effects like decreased childhood poverty, decreased women’s poverty, more taxation revenue.""

Bezanson said the unequal division of labour in the home has meant women have experienced a loss in productivity and now face job insecurity given the lack of available childcare options and uncertainty around sending kids back to school in the fall.

""I think all of us know families that are sitting down and saying well if schools don’t go back full time, which one of us is going to leave our jobs or reduce our hours, and we know usually its women,"" she said.

""There is a palpable level of anger and frustration among parents and I think also among employers that we said let’s open the economy but we haven’t figured out how we care for our kids and it’s not sustainable.""

A new Statistics Canada survey released Thursday echoes this sentiment. Respondents said their top concern related to family and the pandemic was around balancing their personal and professional life.

Around 80 per cent of those with children aged 11 and younger who rely on schooling as a primary source of childcare, report being ""very or extremely concerned.""

PATH TO RECOVERY

Like the myriad of once relatively unseen social inequities uncovered throughout the pandemic, Canada’s fractured child-care system is also exposing itself.

""Those kinds of demands of parenting and homeschooling and care up until now hasn’t been visible in the same way, so I think we have a moment now where we have a consensus understanding that childcare really is at the centre of what permits us all to undertake all of the other things that we do,"" said Bezanson.

Even with a common understanding of the problem after four-months of pandemic adapting, she notes that the need for a more unified, national approach to tackling this issue remains pressing.

In early June, the Trudeau Liberals offered provinces and territories up to $14 billion to cover the mandatory 10 days of paid sick leave provision for workers, to help acquire and stockpile personal protective equipment, and to help child-care facilities reopen safely.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau touted this initiative on Thursday during is speech in the House of Commons.

""We are proposing to invest in a safe, sufficient and adequate supply of childcare, so that parents, especially mothers, don’t have to choose between going to work and ensuring their children are taken care of.""

But ultimately it’s been up to the provinces and territories to dictate the trajectory of childcare delivery in their jurisdictions.

""We end up with really significant variation in access to certain supports depending on where you live,"" said Bezanson. ""So it becomes evermore important to have a coordinating mechanism if we want to equalize that kind of access to services.""

Three national early childhood education and child-care organizations have created a petition to lobby the federal government for action. The Canadian Child Care Federation, Child Care Now, and Childcare Resource and Research Unit want to see Ottawa adopt a plan to sustain the child-care sector through the pandemic.

""If it collapses, the federal government’s promise to turn the fragile patchwork of services into a robust, fully effective comprehensive high-quality system will be that much more difficult,"" reads their website.

Bezanson and her colleagues have also pressed the Liberals to quickly adopt a national ""Childcare Secretariat"" to ensure childcare is a core component of any economic recovery strategy and recognized as a priority at the highest levels of government.

""I’m hopeful we can all get on the same page and do the right thing and not stunt, stall, make impossible, or least make slower, the kind of economic recovery we need,"" she said.",[]

Lewis, Erin O'Toole and Derek Sloan were debating B.C.-related issues when for nearly a minute, slurs started filling the chat box of the video conference program.

Lewis, who is the first Black candidate to run for the Conservative party leadership, said she saw them and then closed the chat screen so she could focus on the event.

""The racist comments during last night's debate which were directed at me, Black people and Jewish people were sadly not surprising,"" she said in a statement Thursday.

""This past week we saw much more blatant displays of antisemitism in Toronto, and it has not been an irregular occurrence for me to encounter racist individuals during this campaign.""

A transcript of the debate chat provided to The Canadian Press by organizers suggests the racist slurs were one of several attempts by to hijack the discussion, with the other interjections seemingly nonsensical.

Debate organizer Angelo Isidorou called the incident ""mortifying.""

He said as the comments were noticed, moderators booted the user from the chat, but then a new one would pop up. Eventually, they disabled the chat function altogether.

""We are thankful to the hundreds of members in the chat who alerted us to these terrible comments and demanded swift action, which we took,"" he said.

Isidorou said some cursory research by the organizing team suggested there had been a plan prior to the event to disrupt it.

The link to join the online debate was widely circulated as the event was backed by all 42 riding associations in the province.

The racist comments weren't mentioned by the candidates or moderator during the event, but screenshots of them circulated online after they were removed.

Peter MacKay, who skipped the debate, later condemned the incident on social media, calling it ""disgusting and totally unacceptable.""

Hackers disrupting video conference calls have been a hazard as the software has exploded in use during the COVID-19 pandemic.

But Lewis' campaign said though the team has held hundreds of online sessions, they've only experienced a single other instance of someone attempting to disrupt the event, and in that one, the commentator was attacking Lewis for her gender.

Her campaign said her previous encounters with racism on the campaign trail have come in the form of social-media messages and direct correspondence.

In her statement, Lewis said the response from fellow Conservatives to the events of Wednesday night prove to her that racist behaviour is not acceptable in the party.

""I truly believe that together we will continue to make Canada a welcoming and safe place for all.""

Voting is now underway in the race and the mail-in ballots are due back by Aug. 21, with a winner expected to be announced the week after.

The debate Wednesday night covered a range of regional topics, including a rise in crimes against Chinese-Canadians since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is believed to have originated in China.

Candidates were asked to address how they'd balance effective criticism of China while maintaining strong and positive outreach to the Chinese-Canadian community.

All three said they knew they had to be careful and watch their words, ensuring their concerns with China don't get translated to racism in Canada.

525,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/the-challenge-of-our-lifetime-federal-deficit-to-hit-343-billion-this-year-1.5015467,'The challenge of our lifetime': Federal deficit to hit $343 billion this year,['Rachel Aiello'],2020-07-08 10:05:00-04:00,"OTTAWA -- The federal deficit is projected to hit $343.2 billion this fiscal year, due in large part to massive economic aid and stimulus plans—that are on-par with Second World War level spending— that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government has rolled out in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

The deficit projection released Wednesday is up dramatically from the latest pre-pandemic economic update in December 2019, which pegged the deficit at $28.1 billion in 2020-21.

In addition to direct government spending, the new figures in the government’s fiscal snapshot show the negative impact the global pandemic has had on the economy.

Citing the “extraordinary borrowing” the federal government is currently engaged in, the government says the federal debt will exceed $1.2 trillion by the end of the fiscal year, up from $765 billion in the previous fiscal year.

With unemployment rates set to remain high into next year, the government is also projecting a $71.1-billion decline in tax revenue, including a $40.8-billion loss in income taxes.

“This spending level is on par with, but lower than the peak deficit (as a per cent of GDP) experienced by Canada during the Second World War. This is truly the challenge of our lifetime. As temporary investment measures come to an end and GDP recovers over time, deficits are expected to retreat,” reads the snapshot, in part.

In total, the federal government has spent more than $231 billion in health and safety measures as well as on direct aid to Canadians and businesses over the course of the pandemic so far.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau unveiled the revised economic picture inside the House of Commons, which is gathered for a special sitting. He spoke about how this current fiscal situation is an opportunity for Canada to rebuild and reshape the economy.

“We need to invest in an economy that is greener and more diverse,” Morneau said. “This pandemic has identified clear gaps and it’s giving us a chance to reset. We witnessed the ways in which people were falling through the cracks… In the coming months, we will need to come to these problems with dedication, compassion, and ingenuity.”

During a press conference with reporters during a largely virtual “lockup,” ahead of tabling the 168-page snapshot, Morneau called the pandemic “an enormous shock to our system.”

“We faced an enormous shock to our system,” Morneau told reporters. “It’s hard to know where we will be in a month, two months, or six months. What we know for sure, is that if Canadians work together, we can continue on what we've seen as a month-by-month improvement of our situation, and our economic outcomes will be related to our success working together on our on our health challenges.”

He also suggested a silver lining in regards to Canada’s increased debt-to-GDP ratio. With current public debt charges at around one per cent of GDP, the cost to service the now ballooning debt is actually $4 billion lower this year than expected, given the historically low borrowing rates.

Due to the COVID-19 spending, the federal government now projects its debt-to-GDP ratio will rise to 49.1 per cent in 2020-21. In the pre-pandemic December economic update, Canada’s debt-to-GDP ratio was at 30.9 per cent and was projected to remain on track to reduce incrementally over the next few years.

“Even after our historic investments, Canada will continue to hold its low-debt advantage. This, combined with historically low interest rates, gave us the balance sheet to deploy our fiscal firepower to support Canadians through this,” Morneau said, though noted that his and likely future governments will have to face up to the deficit.

SHARPEST DROP SINCE GREAT DEPRESSION

The government is emphasizing the “challenge of a generation” that the COVID-19 pandemic is posing, and noted the serious and ongoing impacts. Over the last few months, federal job numbers have already showed 5.5 million Canadians are either out of work, or have lost wages; and a growing list of businesses are set to shutter their doors permanently.

Citing economists, in the snapshot the government says the overall economy is expected to contract by 6.8 per cent in 2020, which is its sharpest drop since the Great Depression, before rebounding by 5.5 per cent in 2021.

Based on forecasts by more than a dozen private sector economists, the government is projecting an unemployment rate of 9.8 per cent in 2020 and 7.8 per cent in 2021.

All of this is contingent on how the ongoing health crisis is managed, the government notes throughout the snapshot, emphasizing the economy’s health is largely in the hands of Canadians’ efforts to stave off a second wave of the novel coronavirus.

The snapshot also includes several scenarios for future economic outlooks, depending on what happens with the pandemic, from a gradual but uneven recovery to a virus resurgence scenario which would result in a “deeper and longer-lasting negative impact on the economy.”

While the government optimistically believes the worst of the economic impact is behind us, it will be a long time before a rebound, even under the most positive pandemic scenario that would see a vaccine discovered within the year.

Speaking to reporters in advance of the revised economic picture being made public, Trudeau said that the situation would have been much worse had the federal government not brought in massive aid measures.

“When the pandemic first hit, a lot of people lost their jobs overnight. They didn't know how they were going to feed their families, or pay their bills. Faced with this unprecedented challenge our government had two options: We could sit back and let Canadians fend for themselves... or we could swiftly and substantially choose to support Canadians. We chose to support Canadians,” Trudeau said.

MORE THAN $230 BILLION SPENT

The report — which is not a federal budget or a fiscal update — shows that, since March, the federal government has spent more than $231 billion on health and safety measures as well as direct aid to Canadians and businesses.

Though, the government cautioned in the document that the cost estimates for many of the aid programs have been “difficult to establish, given that they are brand new programs, launched in a highly volatile economic environment,” and said further updates will come as the data comes in.

Of that figure, $19.8 billion is considered spending for health and safety measures, and includes the $14 billion earmarked to go to the provinces and territories for their “safe restart” plans. The direct support totals $212.2 billion and includes the suite of emergency response aid programs, as well as the support for local community organizations on the front lines of delivering key services to Canadians.

It also details the cost of a range of non-COVID-19 policy actions taken by the federal government since the 2019 economic update, which in total for the 2020-21 fiscal year amounts to just over $9 billion.

The government says the pandemic aid spending — on everything from support for seniors and farmers, to stocking up on personal protective equipment and vaccine development — is “the most comprehensive and substantial peacetime investment in Canada’s history.”

The biggest-ticket items to date, which the government said could still evolve over time, include:

The $2,000-a-month Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), which nearly 8.2 million Canadians have applied for, totalling $53.5 in aid payments but an overall estimated budget of $80 billion;

The 75-per-cent emergency wage subsidy, which has seen 252,370 unique applicants and $18.1 billion spent. Though, the program is expected to be reworked in some way soon, as the CERB nears end of its course, and as a result the government is projecting in the end it will end up costing $82.3 billion to pay employers to keep staff on;

The Canada Emergency Student Benefit, which provides $1,250 a month to most eligible students, more to those with dependents. To date $1.4 billion has been paid out to more than 600,000 applicants; and

The Canada Emergency Business Account, which offers businesses loans of up to $40,000. According to the new figures, 688,000 applicants have received these loans, totaling $27.4 billion.

As well, in an effort to buoy businesses big and small, in addition to the direct spending offered, the federal government has made available $600 billion in liquidity and government-guaranteed loans which Morneau has said he hopes will bridge key job creators in this country to better times. This included $85 billion in tax and customs duty payment deferrals, to help companies free up some of their funding for other expenses.

In his Commons remarks, he notes that nearly nine out of every 10 dollars in COVID-19 aid delivered to Canadians and businesses is financed by the federal government.

The snapshot also looks at how Canada’s economic response compares to that of other countries, and outlines the plummet that consumer confidence and mobility trends have taken over the last four months.

PBO 'SCARED AND DISAPPOINTED'

In an interview on CTV News Channel reacting to the news, Parliamentary Budget Officer Yves Giroux said he was “scared and disappointed,” after seeing the snapshot.

The deficit is almost $100 billion larger than his office estimated the deficit was on track to hit $256 billion this fiscal year.

“We still don't have any sense of what is the government's game plan to get the Canadian economy back on track again,” Giroux said. “It's a much bigger deficit than even I expected, and that's why it's really scary to see these big numbers.”

He is calling on the federal government to look at ways to rework the Employment Insurance program to help those who have maxed out their benefits but remain out of work due to no fault of their own, as several industries are set to take months longer than others to rebound.

The snapshot includes information from the Canadian Federation of Independent Business that shows that while the construction, agriculture, manufacturing and personal services sectors are closer to being considered fully open, large portions of the hospitality, arts and recreation, social services, retail, and real estate sectors will take a lot longer before the majority of businesses are fully open for business.

Today’s snapshot comes after opposition parties and economists called for a look at the federal books, and after resisting a more robust update, the government now says it is planning to release a larger fiscal outlook in the fall.

The overall economic numbers are the first offered by the federal government since the December 2019 update, which was the only one since the Liberal formed a minority government in the last election.

They are limited to the current picture within this fiscal year, ending March 31, 2021, given further predictions could be inaccurate given the ongoing volatility, according to the government.

The 2020 federal budget date was scheduled to be March 30, but that was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic surging at the time.

OPPOSITION REACT TO 'DIRE' PICTURE

Reacting to the figures in the House of Commons, outgoing Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer called the snapshot “an extremely dire picture,” and criticized the government for lacking a plan to get Canada’s economy back on stable footing.

“Coming out of the pandemic, every single country on the planet will be desperately competing for the same opportunities and the same investments, so where is the prime minister’s plan to set us apart?” Scheer said.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is now calling on the federal government to look to offshore tax havens to drum up revenue to try to offset the ballooning debt and deficit, as well as imposing a “wealth tax” to raise revenue.

“Let’s ask the wealthiest to bear the brunt of the pandemic, not the families and the working people who are struggling to get by,” Singh said.

Green Party Parliamentary Leader Elizabeth May called on the government to move on the promised aid for people with disabilities that has been caught up in procedural limbo and has yet to be implemented, despite being promised several weeks ago.

It’s likely to now be a years-long endeavour to navigate Canada out of the red. While the fiscal snapshot includes a chapter on the government’s debt-management strategy, given the limited time frame the document covers, there is no plan to return to balance included.",[]
526,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/it-s-extremely-dire-legions-at-risk-of-closing-forever-1.4995224,"Legions across Canada could close permanently, asking feds to help",[],2020-06-22 22:00:00-04:00,"OTTAWA -- Royal Canadian Legion halls across the country have been shuttered for months due to COVID-19, and now a number of them are facing the prospect of never being able to reopen.

With most ineligible for the host of federal aid programs being offered to help keep other businesses and charitable organizations afloat, hundreds of these facilities could be forced to shut their doors forever without federal intervention.

Legions are often seen as the heart of many communities -- where Remembrance Day celebrations are held and meals are made and delivered to those in need -- but because the pandemic has put a pause on events, it’s cut off crucial income streams like facility rentals that allow legions to keep their doors open to veterans and others.

It’s estimated that about 124 of the 1,381 Royal Canadian Legion branches across Canada are likely to close permanently, and another 357 are facing financial hardship.

“We're a 95-year-old organization. And in that 95 years, we have prided ourselves on being self-sufficient, we have not reached out for funding. But these are unprecedented times,” National Executive Director Steven Clark said.

The Royal Canadian Legion has written to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s office twice, informing him of the gaps in the current federal aid offerings, and says they have yet to receive a response. The Prime Minister’s Office disputes that claim, confirming at least one response has been sent.

A government source told CTV News a reason the legions can’t get funding is because their programs are not directly related to the fight against COVID-19, though thousands of businesses have been able to access billions of federal aid dollars to make ends meet amid the pandemic.

In an email to CTV News, spokesperson for the Office of the Minister of Families, Children and Social Development Jessica Eritou pointed to the Emergency Community Support Fund as something legions that support veterans “may” qualify for to adapt their programs, and committed to “work with organizations to ensure they have the support they need to support Canadians.”

However, that program is offered to help adapt programming in the era of COVD-19 and the Royal Canadian Legion says that it’s their understanding based on conversations with federal officials that it can’t be used to cover operational costs, which is their biggest need right now.

They are calling on the federal government to expand the program’s parameters or allow them to access some other funding option to help pay for costs like rent and utilities.

While some branches may have employees on their payroll and could be eligible for some assistance, most are volunteer-run.

“We've had, of our 1,381 branches 167 have applied for federal assistance programs, but unfortunately only 55 have received that funding so it's still a very small percentage,” Clark said.

Local branches have been given some emergency reserve funding from the national headquarters, and have turned to crowdfunding initiatives but still the money is running out. While millions of dollars are donated every year through the National Poppy Campaign, this money can’t be used to cover the operational costs associated with keeping these facilities open.

While legions have been struggling for years to attract new members, having to close due to the pandemic could prove to be the final straw for many.

The branch in Kenora says it can only last a few more months before its closure becomes permanent.

“It’s extremely dire. We were good for the short haul, but as this keeps going, and we don’t know really where the light at the tunnel is going to be, we’re just not going to be able to survive,” said President of the Kenora Legion Jerry Lava.

“We’re depleting our savings now to make sure we can maintain our expenses. We’ve mothballed pretty well everything in the branch we could,” Lava said.

In a statement to CTV News, spokesperson for Veterans Affairs Canada John Embury said that the department’s response to the pandemic “is ongoing, and we will continue to explore ways to ensure that we’re providing Canadians and our community partners with the support they need.

Branches like this are the first point of contact for veterans and offer them crucial services and support, and that’s why so many are worried about what the future holds.

“I come to the legion and I meet old friends, and the comradery. It’s a place where you come and tell your story,” said Joel VanSnick, who is the Royal Canadian Legion’s district commander for the Ottawa-area which includes 62 branches.

“Once our legions are shut down, they’re gone... Where are veterans going to go to meet?” he said.",[]
527,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/inside-the-covid-19-commons-liberals-pass-key-spending-before-summer-sittings-1.4987560,Inside the COVID-19 Commons: Liberals pass key spending before summer sittings,['Rachel Aiello'],2020-06-17 04:36:00-04:00,"OTTAWA -- The federal government has passed billions of dollars in spending measures during a special House of Commons sitting, with the backing of enough opposition MPs to not prompt formal standing votes.

The conclusion of the special sitting marks the end of more routine gatherings of MPs, with the next time the House convenes set for early July.

Through a series of oral approvals, MPs signed off on approximately $87 billion in funds to tie over federal departments and, in this case, COVID-19 aid programs until the fall. The agreement to pass the funding was given “on division,” meaning no recorded vote was required.

The two spending bills were the first chance since the pandemic shut down the regular sittings for MPs to indicate whether or not they still have confidence in the Liberal minority, though the sitting came and went without that opportunity being taken.

The Liberals’ commitment to an extension of a key COVID-19 aid program, the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, was what secured them the support needed to pass the supplementary estimates -- otherwise known as supply or the next cycle of scheduled and new federal spending.

Because of the Liberals’ minority standing, they needed to have the backing of at least one of the other parties in order to pass the spending measures, and the stakes were considerably higher in this instance because any votes that have to do with money, such as the federal budget or the estimates, are traditionally considered confidence votes.

In any parliament, a government lives so long as it maintains the confidence of the House of Commons. This confidence is demonstrated each time a key vote passes.

Approving the funding comes after both the Bloc Quebecois and NDP signalled they were not interested in seeing MPs line up to cast ballots amid a pandemic -- which could have happened if the Liberals lost Wednesday’s confidence votes and a snap election was called.

JUST 40 SITTING DAYS IN LAST YEAR

Wednesday’s sitting marked the 40th day there has been some form of an actual of House of Commons sitting in the last year, which did include the usual suspension over the summer of 2019 and then the fall federal election campaign.

Though after that October vote, the Liberals waited until December to reconvene the House.

CTVNews.ca asked Government House Leader Pablo Rodriguez last week about the limited number of sitting days and, as a result, the limited number of government mandate items that have been able to progress. He said the time taken pre-pandemic to adjust to the minority reality was necessary and no one could have anticipated a global health crisis would hit.

“We suggested a very ambitious agenda, a very complete throne speech, with everything that comes with it, and then we had COVID,” Rodriguez said. “But even with COVID, we adapted.”

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said once again Wednesday that the agreement to sit under the current structure was reached with the backing of the NDP and Greens, and defended the Liberals’ approach to Parliament.

“Three different parties came together to make a determination of what Parliament would do,” Trudeau said.

“Every time something doesn't go their way an opposition party cries, ‘oh no’ and it's a dictatorship all of a sudden. It's sort of irresponsible and it undermines I think the strength of our democracy that we've been able to show through this crisis,” said the prime minister during his Rideau Cottage press conference.

SPECIAL COMMITTEE COMING TO AN END

Before the special sitting got underway, MPs held their second last meeting of the special all-party COVID-19 committee of MPs. The committee is the first real experiment with a hybrid parliamentary sitting in the House chamber, but that experiment is nearly over.

As has been the case in the 23 of these meetings so far, MPs offered up statements and riding-specific petitions, before going through a question period-style session where the Liberals were grilled on the shortcomings in their COVID-19 plans and on other key policy matters.

In the motion passed on May 16, which put in place the structure of the summer sittings, MPs voted to cease the special committee after Thursday’s meeting. Its end will also mark the end of some form of MPs meeting four days a week, with them not all together until the first of four special sitting days in July.

As of June 18, the special committee will cease to exist, leaving just the four gatherings— July 8, July 22, Aug. 12, and Aug. 26— before the prospect of a more ‘normal’ House of Commons could convene come Sept. 21.

And as Trudeau announced on Wednesday morning, the July 8 sitting will also be where Finance Minister Bill Morneau will present “an economic and fiscal snapshot.”

STUDYING REMOTE VOTING, RULE CHANGES

One of the major limitations that has yet to be worked out is how to allow MPs to vote remotely.

This question is one that the Procedure and House Affairs (PROC) committee has been diving deeper into and evaluating how a formal hybrid House of Commons session could occur, the rule changes required to allow that, and what it would take to implement a remote voting system. The committee has been given a June 23 deadline to report back to its colleagues.

The government—with the support of the NDP—has argued that Parliament has continued to function through the pandemic, noting that under the new structure, the government has faced more questions from the opposition than it would have under normal House sitting parameters.

However, the Conservatives, and to a certain degree the Bloc Quebecois, have characterized the special committee as essentially a knock-off of Parliament and called for a more robust resumption of sittings that would have allowed for more accountability on the massive government policies being rolled out, while respecting the health and safety of all on Parliament Hill.

So, it remains to be seen whether the recommendations out of PROC could result in a change of plans when it comes to the summer and fall sitting schedule.",[]
528,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/conservative-leadership-race-enters-final-push-1.4830847,Conservative leadership race enters final push,[],2020-02-27 17:21:00-05:00,"OTTAWA -- The four Conservative leadership candidates are kicking off the final stretch of COVID-19-style campaigning, with just two months to go before all ballots are cast.

After going head-to-head in two debates on June 17 and 18 the leadership hopefuls will continue to try to separate themselves from the rest of the pack.

Erin O’Toole, Peter MacKay, Leslyn Lewis, and Derek Sloan battled it out in French on June 17, doing their best to deliver their platform pitches despite not one being fully bilingual. On June 18, Toronto played host to the first and only English-language debate.

Co-chairs of the Conservative Party leadership election organizing committee Dan Nowlan and Lisa Raitt were chosen to moderate.

Under the original leadership race timeline, the party was set to hold its debates in April, but those were cancelled when the entire race was put on pause due to the pandemic.

Given the public health concerns at play, there was no live audience, and physical distancing measures were in place.

Another pandemic-prompted workaround, the voting process will be conducted through mail-in ballots, which party members need to send back to the party by August 21.

The race resumed on April 29 “with adjustments to accommodate current circumstances,” a month after it was initially suspended, with LEOC saying at the time that it wouldn’t be possible to meet all deadlines necessary in time for the originally-planned June 27 announcement of a winner.

While all ballots need to be submitted by August 21, it’s yet to be determined how quickly they will be scrutinized and a winner declared. The date and format of how the party will announce its new leader once the results are tallied will also depend on the health guidelines and government orders in place at the time.

VERIFIED CANDIDATES

To reach this phase, each contender had to raise $200,000, put forward an additional $100,000 as a compliance fee, and gather 3,000 signatures from members. This secures their name on the ballot.

Erin O’Toole:

A three-time Conservative MP from Ontario and former cabinet minister. Prior to entering politics O'Toole was in the Royal Canadian Air Force for a decade and later worked as a lawyer. O'Toole placed third in the 2017 leadership race, and since re-entering has taken policy positions that appear to be appealing to the base of the party. He's described himself as the ""true blue"" candidate.

O'Toole says he's running because ""the country needs a strong Conservative party."" He's taking the position of uniting Conservatives.

Peter MacKay:

A former federal cabinet minister from Nova Scotia and the last leader of the Progressive Conservatives pre-merger with Stephen Harper’s Canadian Alliance in 2003. After deciding not to run in 2015, MacKay was working at a Toronto law firm and was a frequent political commentator. Since throwing his hat in the ring he's faced questions over some conflicting positions.

MacKay says he is running ""to keep the Conservative movement united and to defeat Justin Trudeau in the next general election.""

Leslyn Lewis:

An Ontario lawyer who was an unsuccessful 2015 federal election candidate. Lewis lost after being put into a race at the last moment when the previous candidate quit once a video of him urinating in a cup while working in someone's home surfaced. She came to Canada as a child from Jamaica and has received the backing of Campaign Life Coalition, as well as the support of a prominent Christian activist, who called her a ""breath of fresh air"" as a woman who is against same-sex marriage and abortion.

Lewis says she is running because ""Canadians can and should expect much more from their leaders,"" and because she is seeing ""opportunities for future generations falling away.""

Derek Sloan:

A rookie Ontario Conservative MP elected for the first time in 2019. Prior to entering politics he worked as a lawyer and small business owner. Since entering the House of Commons he's stated that he believes the ""cause of sexual orientation"" is ""scientifically unclear,"" and has also received the backing of social conservative organization Campaign Life Coalition.

Sloan says he believes the country is ""under siege by a tide of political correctness that seeks to destroy Canada,"" and vows to ""take a stand for Canada against radical progressivism.""

NO LONGER IN THE RUNNING

Marilyn Gladu:

A two-time Conservative MP from Ontario, who was first elected in 2015. Prior to entering politics she worked as a chemical engineer. As a parliamentarian she's advocated for palliative care and, during her time as the health critic, she voiced concerns about the Liberals’ rollout of marijuana legalization.

Gladu said her vision included: ""Canadian policy rooted in a better balance of fiscal common sense and social compassion.""

Rudy Husny:

A longtime Conservative party member and former staffer. Husny worked for PricewaterhouseCoopers in Montreal before trying his luck twice at running as the Conservative candidate in the riding of Outremont in 2011 and 2015. Husny worked as a senior adviser to the Minister of International Trade in between his two unsuccessful bids. After 2015, he spent time both in the private sector in the Gulf region and in outgoing Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer's office. Husny was the only Quebec candidate, and he had already established that he would tell MPs looking to bring forward anti-abortion bills that it's ""not the priority.""

Husny said he was running ""to bring generational change to our party, to our politics, and to our country.""

Rick Peterson:

A businessman from Alberta and past leadership candidate. He came 12th in the 2017 leadership race and touted his bilingualism and openness to diversity as assets. He proposed a 15 per cent flat personal income tax and a roll back of Liberal gun laws.

Peterson said he was running to ""help restore and reinvigorate the investment climate and job creation."" He billed himself as the candidate with a ""bold vision"" that included tax reform and a climate plan.

Jim Karahalios:

An Ontario lawyer who has advocated for the elimination of carbon taxes. He's also married to Ontario Progressive Conservative MPP Belinda Karahalios and is suing the provincial PC party over allegations that the 2018 race for party president was “rigged” to keep him out. He received the backing of social conservative group Campaign Life Coalition.

Karahalios said he was running to fight against what he called a ""top-down coronation"" for ""the well-connected establishment candidates.""

PROMPTED BY SCHEER RESIGNATION

The leadership race got underway on January 13, giving hopefuls 45 days to declare. The hunt for a new head of the party was prompted by Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer announcing on Dec. 12 that he was stepping down as leader but would be staying on until a replacement is named.

Under Scheer, the Conservatives increased their seat count to 121 seats in the 2019 federal election, but in the weeks following the election, Scheer faced a steady stream of criticism for his performance and personal stance on same-sex marriage and other social issues. He was also questioned about his expenses and use of party funds in the lead-up to the federal campaign.",[]
529,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/pm-says-a-national-contact-tracing-app-is-coming-next-month-how-will-it-work-1.4989702,"PM says a national contact tracing app is coming next month, how will it work?",['Rachel Aiello'],2020-06-18 10:57:00-04:00,"OTTAWA -- The federal government will begin testing a “completely voluntary” mobile contact tracing app in Ontario, to eventually be used nationwide, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Thursday. The app will compile confirmed positive COVID-19 cases and notify Canadians when they’ve been in proximity to someone who has the virus.

The government intends to make the free app available for download in early July and said that the program will be compatible with 30 million smartphones in Canada, meaning a significant portion of the population could use the app and be notified directly if they’ve come into contact with anyone who has tested positive for COVID-19 in the last 14 days.

Trudeau described the app as one that people can download and forget about, though it is set to face scrutiny over the fine print of its privacy and permissions settings, as Privacy Commissioner Daniel Therrien says he’s yet to offer his recommendations about the app to the government.

In making the announcement the prime minister said the case monitoring and exposure notification application a “crucial” public health step as more Canadians begin resuming some semblance of normal life, including returning to work.

“I want to stress that this will be completely voluntary. It will be up to individual Canadians to decide whether to download the app or not. But the app will be most effective when as many people as possible have it,” Trudeau said.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford said Thursday afternoon that the app will be part of the province’s overall tracing strategy.

“If we can trace, we can track it,” Ford said, adding that his government will have more to say in the coming days about the “made-in-Ontario” app.

Health authorities in Ontario will be the first to distribute the unique codes to people who test positive for COVID-19.

Trudeau said there are other provinces, including British Columbia, that are working with the federal government on the app, but it will be available to anyone in Canada who wants to use it.

“It'll actually allow us to have a better sense of when there are spikes or resurgences of a virus in a particular area or not because more people will be getting that notification and calling their local public health authorities, so any level of uptake would be useful,” Trudeau said, adding that he hopes Canadians view the app as an easy added layer of protection.

HOW IT WILL WORK

The app was originally developed by the Government of Ontario and the prime minister said that the Canadian Digital Service —a federal body—will work with Shopify and Blackberry on the new software, which Apple and Google have teamed up to offer, using Bluetooth technology to register when devices may come into proximity with one another.

The technology will be owned and operated by the Government of Canada.

The plan with the app is to have a health-care professional help Canadians who test positive upload their status anonymously into the national network.

Then, other users who have the app will be alerted if they have been exposed to someone who has tested positive, encouraging them to reach out to their local public health agency.

The app will also provide users with information on the latest jurisdiction-specific public health information.

“There will be a database of randomized codes associated with each smartphone that has this app that will be divided into two columns: those who may have tested positive, and those who have not tested positive. So if your phone gets in proximity for a certain amount of time, at a certain closeness to another phone, it'll register that it has had contact with that anonymized number,” Trudeau said.

The app will be available for Ontarians to download on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store in the coming weeks.

ONE APP ACROSS CANADA?

As it was first billed, the federal government’s intent was to come out with a single contact tracing app that would be “recommended strongly” to be used across the country, but as Health Minister Patty Hajdu signalled earlier this month, that plan has faced pushback from some provinces that preferred to conduct contact-tracing “the old-fashioned way,” or who had already launched their own digital tracing methods.

The traditional contact tracing currently being done involves people making calls for various public health agencies to help track down anyone who may have come into contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases.

If all provinces don’t sign on or endorse the app, Canada could end up with a patchwork of applications being used across the country and, as a result, limited efficacy when it comes to interprovincial spread.

In an effort to lobby all Canadians to come on side, Trudeau said the app will be customized to each province that signs on.

“It will be one app that whether you download it and live in Ontario and travel to B.C. or travel to the Northwest Territories— if that becomes an option—it will work everywhere across the country. So, it's one app for all Canadians,” he said.

Asked about the role contact tracing can play, infectious disease specialist Dr. Abdu Sharkawy said something more than the old-fashioned approach is needed.

“We look at the contact tracing ability that we have now, and we're using a 1985 form of technology, with phone calls and fax machines, for a 2020 pandemic. We need something that is going to be a bit more sophisticated a bit more efficient,” he told CTV News Channel ahead of Trudeau’s announcement.

“You can do as many tests as you want, but if you don't have the ability to identify who is in contact with a positive case, you don't really have an opportunity to stem the tide and prevent an outbreak from occurring, and community transmission to become something that's much more severe,” Sharkawy said.

PRIVACY CONCERNS

Beyond the hurdles of getting public health agencies in every corner of the country to sign on, the federal government will have to address Canadians’ privacy and security hesitations in order to get the rate of downloads needed to make this effective.

There are also concerns that have been raised around the adequacy of current privacy laws to protect Canadians should a breach occur.

Trudeau said Thursday that “the privacy of Canadians will be fully respected,” and that the government has spoken to the privacy commissioner about the application.

However, in a statement to CTVNews.ca, Therrien’s office said they were “recently contacted by Health Canada” about the app.

“We have requested and are awaiting necessary information and, until such time as we receive that information, we have not provided our recommendations to the government. We are working diligently and responsibly to develop that advice,” said Therrien’s office.

The federal government is also establishing an external advisory council “to provide guidance during the roll-out of the app with a view to ensuring it operates in a transparent way and in the public interest.”

In May, Therrien issued a joint statement with provincial and territorial privacy commissioners, calling for governments to ensure that any applications being developed or recommended respect Canadian privacy laws.

Among the privacy watchdog’s recommendations: ensuring the app was voluntary; its scope and ability to monitor users’ behaviour must be science-based; the data collected is de-identified as much as possible; and that it is subject to independent oversight.

“At no time will personal information be collected or shared, and no location services will be used,” Trudeau said, calling the app “totally secure and completely anonymized.”

Tech analyst Carmy Levy said in an interview on CTV News Channel that while he’ll wait and see how the app functions when it’s downloadable, it is a positive step to see the app won’t use location services. But he said that even with “all reasonable efforts” being taken to strip away identifiable information, to a certain degree nothing is fully anonymous.

“We are opening up a bit of a privacy Pandora's box. Are we taking reasonable precautions? Yes… But kind of have to balance that and gauge, what are we getting back in return for this risk? Are we allowing ourselves to get ahead of the pandemic?”

Ryerson's Cybersecure Policy Exchange released a report on contact tracing earlier this month and it found that based on a survey of 2,000 Canadians in mid-May, a majority of those surveyed were supportive of making some form of anonymized app mandatory.

Thursday marks 100 days since the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and it was on this day that Canada officially recorded more than 100,000 cases of COVID-19, as provinces continue to ramp up testing to understand accurate levels of infection in the country.",[]

If that major and unprecedented moment in Canadian politics occurs, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland would become Canada’s acting prime minister.

That’s according to an official order made on March 13, the day that Trudeau’s office announced that his wife Sophie had tested positive for COVID-19.

The prime minister remains in self-isolation but on Monday Trudeau said he and his children remain symptom-free, while his wife’s symptoms are mild.

Trudeau has been working from home, chairing cabinet meetings, holding regular public addresses, and participating in international calls with world leaders from his home office.

“In the event that the Prime Minister is unable to perform the functions of his office,” a threshold left undefined, Freeland would take charge, reads the order issued by the Privy Council Office.

In line with public health advice, Trudeau has not been tested for COVID-19 as he is not symptomatic, but given the rapid and concerning spread, the federal cabinet has been given instructions on the roles they’d play if the situation evolved.

Following Freeland, the next five ministers in line are based on seniority: Veterans Affairs Minister Lawrence MacAulay; Indigenous Services Minister Carolyn Bennett; President of the Privy Council Dominic LeBlanc; Industry Minister Navdeep Bains; and Finance Minister Bill Morneau.

The order also goes on to outline how ministerial roles would shift to see all portfolios covered should Freeland become Canada’s acting prime minister, or if other ministers are no longer able to do their jobs.

If Freeland takes on Trudeau’s job, LeBlanc would become deputy prime minister, for example. Should federal Health Minister Patty Hajdu be unable to fulfill her duties, Bennett, who is a doctor, would take on that job.",[]

While the daily case count announcements from provincial health authorities are the most eye-catching figures, there's other important numbers beyond newly confirmed cases, including hospitalizations and testing data.

This page will be updated daily as new information on Alberta, Canada and international cases of COVID-19 is made available.

Starting the week of June 29, the province will provide daily data updates Monday through Friday and not on weekends and holidays.

Follow the links below or scroll down to see how the COVID-19 situation is changing in Alberta as the pandemic continues.

HOW IS COVID-19 GROWING IN ALBERTA?

The province's daily case count announcement is among the most prominent COVID-19 statistics.

The number of new cases represents the number of patients who are newly infected with the coronavirus. The number of active cases in the province can go up or down depending on the number of new recoveries on a given day.

The above graph divides active cases into those who are sick, but not in hospital, and those patients requiring hospitalization. Hospitalized patients are further divided by those getting care in and out of intensive care units.

Recoveries are defined by Alberta Health Services as follows:

A return to health after 14 days of isolation for those with COVID-19 but who experienced only mild symptoms.

If hospitalized due to COVID-19, anyone who does not require additional hospitalization or treatment in the 10 days after they left the hospital.

If tested, such as a health care worker, two negative tests at least 24 hours apart.

Daily case counts include both lab-confirmed and probable cases. The case count for a given day is sometimes revised to more accurately reflect probable cases that were either later confirmed or determined not to be related to COVID-19.

WHERE IS COVID-19 HITTING ALBERTA THE HARDEST?

Since early April, the province has provided a geographic breakdown for both its five health zones as well as individual cities and community-level subzones within those cities.

Alberta Health Services divides the province into five health zones: Calgary, Central, Edmonton, North and South.

A map of those zones can be seen here, and it's important to note that the Edmonton and Calgary zones cover an area significantly bigger than the cities they are named after.

Sizable daily jumps in the new number of cases can't necessarily be attributed to the virus growing, as testing volume and reporting time also influence the data.

For more local data, the province's COVID-19 statistics page has an interactive map showing cases by city and community.

HOW MANY COVID-19 PATIENTS ARE IN HOSPITAL?

Tracking hospitalizations is an important indicator of how severely pandemic is affecting Albertans as well as how the coronavirus is taxing the province's health care system.

Alberta has the capacity for 295 intensive care unit beds and nearly 8,500 total beds, according to the province's modelling released in April.

So far, the number of hospitalizations and ICU admissions have both remained well below those maximum capacities.

Hospitalization data is often retroactively updated by the province as individual hospitals report data at varying times and speeds.

HOW IS ALBERTA TESTING FOR COVID-19?

Alberta has been the top province in Canada measured by per capita COVID-19 testing since near the start of the pandemic.

The province has now administered more than 500,000 tests Albertans.

It's important to distinguish between test volume (number of tests completed) and number of people tested as patients can be tested more than once.

The province has made seven notable shifts in testing policy.

March 23: The province announced testing was being focused on at-risk populations and health care workers. At the same time, testing returning travellers was deprioritized to only those showing symptoms.

April 7: Testing is opened to any symptomatic individuals in the Calgary Zone, which had seen significant spikes in cases in March and April.

April 13: Testing was expanded to any Albertan with symptoms consistent with the coronavirus.

April 17: The province announced it would start testing all staff and residents of continuing care facilities for COVID-19 regardless of whether or not they show symptoms.​

May 4: The testing criteria was expanded again to include anyone exeperiencing headache, muscle or joint aches, fatigue or severe exhaustion, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, unexplained loss of appetite, loss of sense of smell or taste, or pink eye.

May 11: The province opened testing to asymptomatic residents of the Calgary zone who work outside their home. Testing is to be done on a first-come, first-serve basis for up to 1,000 asymptomatic residents each day. The policy was in place until May 18.

May 29: The province announces all Albertans, including those who are asymptomatic, were eligible to be tested.

HOW IS COVID-19 BEING SPREAD IN ALBERTA?

The province divides the ways COVID-19 is being spread into three categories: travel-related cases, spread via a known source, and spread via an unknown source, or community transmission.

Initially, travel-related cases were responsible for many of Alberta's new COVID-19 cases. But since travel restrictions came into effect, the number of travel-related cases has largely flattened since early April.

Close contact with individuals known to be carrying the virus remains the most common way of spreading COVID-19 in Alberta.

Suspected community transmitted cases, where the carrier isn't immediately known, are an important indicator of how the coronavirus is spreading in a community as well as how successful measures like physical distancing have been in limiting transmission.

Identified cases are investigated by AHS and classified into one of the three categories. The classification can change pending further investigation.

WHICH AGE GROUPS HAVE BEEN MOST SUSCEPTIBLE TO COVID-19?

Since the onset of the pandemic, COVID-19 has affected the elderly more than other age groups as seen in high death and active case counts.

But, younger age groups are not immune, and by mid-June, cases among Albertans under the age of 40 had risen to form a majority of all active cases in the province.

HOW DOES COVID-19'S GROWTH IN ALBERTA COMPARE TO ELSEWHERE?

Conclusions drawn from comparing provinces are somewhat limited by widely differing testing volumes and practices among provinces, but the raw data does allow from some contrast.

The above graphs rank provinces by the number of tests they administer and how many confirmed cases they have, both adjusted to per 10,000 population of their respective province.

Tests are also not without their own biases. More tests will produce more positives, and it's easier to test everyone in a less populous province.

Rates adjusted for population provide a snapshot of the COVID-19 situation on any given day, but experts say the growth of the virus, which is unrelated to population size, is also an important indicator of future trends.

Alberta Health Services divides Edmonton up into 15 health subzones named for their home communities.

Since early April, the province has provided daily updates on the number of COVID-19 active cases, recoveries and deaths in each of those subzones as well as totals for the city itself.

This page is divided up into four sections: overall city data, subzone (community) level data, testing data and methodology.

Scroll down or follow the links below to navigate to each section.

CITY OF EDMONTON

The city of Edmonton is distinct from the Edmonton zone, which includes communities far beyond the city itself. You can see a map displaying the boundaries of the five AHS health zones across the province here.

Unless otherwise specifically indicated, numbers on this page are for the city itself and not the zone.

See the methodology section below for how a recovery from COVID-19 is defined by AHS.

COMMUNITIES

The 15 Edmonton AHS subzones cover the vast majority, though not all, of the area inside the city's coroporate boundaries.

You can see a rough map of the subzones below. For a zoomable version, visit the province's interactive data site and click on the geospatial tab.

Scroll down or follow these links to find data on each individual subzone:

Abbottsfield, Bonnie Doon, Castle Downs

Duggan, Eastwood, Jasper Place

Mill Woods South & East, Mill Woods West, Northeast

Northgate, Rutherford, Twin Brooks

West Jasper Place, Woodcroft East, Woodcroft West

Beaumont, Devon & Leduc, Fort Saskatchewan St. Albert, Sherwood Park, Stony Plain & Spruce Grove

TESTING DATA

Testing data for specific cities isn't yet available so these graphs display data from the Edmonton Zone as opposed to the city itself.

The Edmonton Zone had a population of just over 1.4 million people in 2018, according to AHS. The same year, the province estimated the city of Edmonton's population at just over 1 million people.

METHODOLOGY

Boundaries

The graphs above were assembled using two versions of the province's interactive data map, each with different borders.

The city-specific graphs draws data from the city of Edmonton as defined by its geographic corporate boundaries.

The community-level graphs draw data taken from the province's 15 Edmonton-area health subzones.

Their boundaries closely resemble the city's borders but with some exceptions. As a result, some areas within Edmonton's corporate boundaries, largely near the city's southern boundary, are included in suburban health zones.

Cases are attributed to the subzone of a patient’s primary residence. You can see population estimates for each subzone here.

Case Counts

The updated daily case count reflects the number of new, active cases (people who are now newly ill with COVID-19).

The daily change in active cases are determined by subtracting the number of newly recovered cases from the number of new cases. A positive value represents an increase in net active cases, with a negative value indicating the opposite.

The province often revises data, and reclassifies cases to other health zones or subzones which can cause a sudden rise or drop in cases for a given location.​

Reclassifications can occur for a number of reasons, including:

A patient's contact information was updated to reflect his or her proper address.

Further testing revealed a patient did not, in fact, contract COVID-19.

Data entry errors.

The province published new numbers daily March, April, May and June, with subzone data being available since early April. Starting the weekend of July 4, the province will release updated data on weekdays only, with no scheduled updates on holidays and weekends.

Recoveries

Recoveries are defined by Alberta Health Services as follows:",[]

Locals wanting to get to know or rediscover their city have plenty of options in and around the river valley and downtown for the whole family.

""It’s one thing to be able to showcase our amazing city to visitors and guests, and it is even more special when we get to rediscover our own backyard again,"" said Explore Edmonton Director of Communications Tammy Forbes. ""And even if we have to adapt to the current health restrictions and remain safe, the tourism industry is going to be vital as Edmontonians look for fun ways to rediscover their own city. Our greatest ambassadors are the people who choose to make this place their home.""

Here are 10 unique spots to check out during your summer staycation.

BOB AND DOUG MCKENZIE SCULPTURE

From your television screen to a bench in Ice District, Bob and Doug McKenzie are now in Edmonton for good.

The sculpture of Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas pays tribute to the sketch comedy duo's Great White North segment that had a memorable run on Second City Television in the 70s and 80s.

Edmonton sculptor Ritchie Velthuis made the piece that appeared in Ice District, in 103 Street and 103 Avenue, in late March.

SPIRIT OF STANLEY

Edmonton has had a lot of Stanley Cups over the year, and while this one wasn't won on the ice, it's by far the biggest and most prominent.

Located in front of the United Cycle on Gateway Boulevard, the Spirit of Stanley is the world's largest Stanley Cup replica at four metres and 850 pounds.

Fun fact: Each team took 45 minutes to engrave, according to its maker, IMARK.

NEON SIGN MUSEUM

An Edmonton classic, the Neon Sign Museum tells parts of the city's history in an artistic and bright way.

The City of Edmonton has collected 20 signs, restored and installed them on the Telus building and Mercer Warehouse on 104 Street.

Neon signs include the Canadian National Railway, the Princess Theatre, and with the goal of collecting 30 signs, there is a petition to save and move the Western Cycle sign there.

HIGH LEVEL BRIDGE AND WALTERDALE BRIDGE

These two are just nice to look at, especially at night. The City of Edmonton often changes the High Level Bridge's lights in the morning and night to celebrate certain occasions, or to send a message of solidarity as it did recently with Nova Scotia.

The Walterdale Bridge has only been around for three years but it's already arguably Edmonton's No. 1 spot for photos, featuring the breathtaking architecture, the river valley, and downtown Edmonton's growing skyline.

Gallery: Walterdale Bridge

KEILLOR POINT

Keillor Point was known as the End of the World before the City of Edmonton overhauled the North Saskatchewan River viewpoint in 2019.

The End of the World, located in the Belgravia neighbourhood, had become a safety hazard due to slumping in the embankment and deterioration of the pillars, the city said.

Still, it was a popular place to hang out and take pictures of the river, so the city spent $1.5 million to make it safer and more accessible, with stairs and a pathway.

BELGRAVIA BENCHES

Near Keillor Point, these benches in the Belgravia Dog Park are a cool spot to catch a sunset with views that include Fox Drive, the Whitemud Equine Learning Centre Association, Quesnell Bridge, the river — and your dog.

TALUS DOME

Explore Edmonton calls the Talus Dome Edmonton's ""most provocative piece of public art"" that ""always has people talking.""

You've probably driven by the 1,000 steel balls while crossing the Quesnell Bridge and raised an eyebrow, but the city encourages Edmontonians to take a closer look.

""Think fun house meets the compound eye of a fly,"" Explore Edmonton said. ""You can capture some pretty warped and funny reflections that will have you busting a gut laughing.""

Just don’t throw paint on it.

FORT EDMONTON FOOTBRIDGE

A footbridge on what feels like the middle of nowhere connects neighbourhoods in southwest Edmonton divided by the North Saskatchewan River.

Sit on the benches on and surrounding the bridge for up-close views of the river, or exercise on the trails on either side or the Wolf Willow Stairs just steps away.

""If you choose the latter, be prepared to sweat it out and hike up 200 stairs to get to this vantage point,"" Explore Edmonton said.

RIVER VALLEY SWING

As if it wasn't clear Edmonton's river valley was full of fun and surprises: a wooden swing overlooking downtown Edmonton.

It's been called a hidden gem and picturesque, but not many people know where it is. It's not clear who built it and put it there — the mystery adding to the charm.

It's tucked under somewhere around Dawson Park.

Tell your friends…unless you want it all to yourself.

WHITEMUD CREEK UNDERPASS

This is another gem not a lot of people have known about until now.

Underneath the Whitemud Creek on Anthony Henday Drive is an archway that wraps around a footbridge.

And since it doesn’t get a lot of foot traffic, it's turned into a lot more than that.

The little underpass has turned into a colourful retreat covered in graffiti and photographers admiring the rugged beauty.

It may looked abandoned on the outside, but it's getting a lot of attention on social media.",[]

“I come here a lot,” one passerby told CTV News. “It's pretty nice.”

The Whitemud Creek arch was once a site for coal mining.

In 2005 the province added the pedestrian bridge as a means for people to safely traverse from one side of the freeway to the other. Below the bridge is the creek which allows wildlife to also make the safe trek.

Local blogger Lincoln Ho believes the project is incomplete and unsafe.

""Crumbling infrastructure is always an issue especially underneath one of the busiest roadways in the city,"" said Ho.

He believes that because of very little foot traffic, “urban explorers” are taking part in extensive and often profane graffiti tagging.

“They're climbing on to parts of the bridge that aren't for pedestrians,” says Ho. “Somebody is going to get hurt and it's very hard to access for medical personnel.""

The crossing has also become a popular backdrop for social media posts, increasing its notoriety.

""So anybody who has featured this bridge on a TikTok has gotten very popular with it and so everybody is copying everybody else’s TikTok's and checking out this supposed hidden bridge.""

Neither end of the bridge is connected by trail, making it difficult to access. Still, that isn’t stopping admirers from making the trek to this urban escape.

""I actually have a friend from Toronto coming to visit and I'm going to bring her here,"" said one woman out for a hike.

""It's a beautiful piece of infrastructure,” said Ho. “Beautiful contemporary architecture style in there and it is a shame that it's just left abandoned.”",[]

Kaysen Martin, who is 23 months old, needs a $2.8-million gene-therapy drug called Zolgensma for his Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type 1 that affects the muscles used for lung support, swallowing, crawling, walking and head control.

His family is pleading for Alberta Health to cover the drug, but time is running out, because it can only be administered before a child turns two.

A GoFundMe page to raise the money for the drug has already raised more than $80,000, including a $5,000 donation from Reynolds.

Kaysen’s mother Lana Bernardin said the family was excited to see the donation.

“Definitely surprised that Ryan Reynolds saw us. I’m not sure how, but he saw us. So for sure, it was a really good, big surprise,” she told CTV News Edmonton.

Reynolds, who was born in Vancouver, has made many charitable donations in 2020. He and his wife Blake Lively donated to food banks across Canada, including a $5,000 to the Edmonton Food Bank in April.

The family has until July 17, Kaysen’s second birthday, to raise the money.

According to new Statistics Canada data, unemployment reached 15.5 per cent in June.

It marks an 8.8 per cent difference from the same time last year.

The only province with a higher unemployment rate is Newfoundland and Labrador, at 16.5 per cent.

And unemployment in Alberta’s largest cities is also highest among Canadian major urban centres: about 15.7 per cent of the Edmonton workforce is currently unemployed, and 15.6 per cent of the Calgary workforce.

In May, their unemployment rates were 13.6 per cent and 13.4 per cent, respectively.

The news comes alongside a report that Canada added 953,000 jobs in June as businesses forced to close by the pandemic began to reopen.

“That’s important progress but we have a long way to go,"" Alberta Premier Jason Kenney commented Friday at a news conference in Fort Saskatchewan, where a carbon capture and storage facility recently reached the five-million equivalent tonnes milestone.

Kenney’s government’s economic recovery plan centres on infrastructure projects that create jobs and making Alberta an attractive place for investment – as does the facility at the Shell Scotford complex, Kenney said.

“Projects like this are a key part of Alberta’s recovery plan to build, to diversify, and to create jobs. When the global economy comes back form COVID, when demand returns for oil and gas, we are going to see, I believe, something of a supply shortage because of all the upstream exploration that has been cancelled, and so we’ll see prices go up. And that will be a great opportunity for Alberta, especially as we make progress on pipelines,” he said.

“But there’s one critical factor, we’ve got to bring investment back. And that means we’ve got to demonstrate our progress on environmental responsibility which is why investments like this… are so important to jobs, the economy, and the future prosperity of Alberta.”

They say the current government has been targeting the Indigineous population of Ethiopia, the Oromo, through arbitrary detention, torture and kidnappings.

The recent killing of beloved Oromo singer and activist, Hachalu Hundessa prompted the Oromo and other Ethiopians to hold a global day of protest to pressure their governments to stop supporting the regime in Ethiopia.

“We are pretty much like the Indigenous people of Canada, stripped of their identity, stripped of their culture and forced to speak a language that was not even our mother tongue, he was trying to get that message out there, he was the voice of the voiceless” said spokesperson Sofia Ibrahim.

Protestors in Edmonton want the Canadian government to put an economic embargo on Abiy Ahmed’s regime and to take a clear stance on what they say are human rights violations in Ethiopia.

“We want the Canadian people to understand that the $200 million Canada gives Ethiopia is not supporting the people, it is supporting the dictator to build the military against the people”, Duressa Hazan, a Canadian of Ethiopian heritage said.

In an open letter published this week in a journal, two scientists from Australia and the U.S. wrote that studies have shown ""beyond any reasonable doubt that viruses are released during exhalation, talking and coughing in microdroplets small enough to remain aloft in the air.""

The researchers, along with more than 200 others, appealed for national and international authorities, including WHO, to adopt more stringent protective measures.

WHO has long dismissed the possibility that the coronavirus is spread in the air except for certain risky medical procedures, such as when patients are first put on breathing machines.

In a change to its previous thinking, WHO noted on Thursday that studies evaluating COVID-19 outbreaks in restaurants, choir practices and fitness classes suggested the virus might have been spread in the air.

Airborne spread ""particularly in specific indoor locations, such as crowded and inadequately ventilated spaces over a prolonged period of time with infected persons cannot be ruled out,"" WHO said.

Still, officials also pointed out that other modes of transmission -- like contaminated surfaces or close contacts between people in such indoor environments -- might also have explained the disease's spread.

WHO's stance also recognized the importance of people spreading COVID-19 without symptoms, a phenomenon the organization has long downplayed.

WHO has repeatedly said such transmission is ""rare"" despite a growing consensus among scientists globally that asymptomatic spread likely accounts for a significant amount of transmission. The agency said that most spread is via droplets from infected people who cough or sneeze, but added that people without symptoms are also capable of transmitting the disease.

""The extent of truly asymptomatic infection in the community remains unknown,"" WHO said.

In an open letter addressed to Public Safety Minister Bill Blair, 29 bipartisan members of Congress called on the Canadian government to plan a phased reopening of the Canada-U.S. border and to consider easing existing measures.

""We are asking that the United States and Canada immediately craft a comprehensive framework for phased reopening of the border based on objective metrics and accounting for the varied circumstances across border regions,"" read the letter, which was published on Western New York Congressman Brian Higgins' website on July 3.

The members of Congress, who represent the northern states along the border, also implored the Canadian government to consider easing restrictions on family members and property owners impeded by the border closure.

""We understand the importance of prioritizing the safety of our communities as we all navigate the complex calculation of minimizing public health risks and resuming economic activity. However, the social and economic partnership between our two nations necessitates a clear pathway forward,"" the letter read.

They crafted the letter following the latest joint Canada-U.S. agreement to extend the current border closure until July 21. This is the third time the agreement to maintain the border closure has been extended.

Despite the United States' plea, a spokesperson for Canada’s Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland told CTVNews.ca in a Friday statement that the health and safety of Canadians is ""absolutely priority.""

""Decisions about Canada's border are made by Canadians, for Canadians,"" said Freeland's spokesperson, Katherine Cuplinskas, in the statement.

""Since the beginning of this global pandemic, we have been having friendly ongoing conversations with our American partners about our shared border. Both sides agree that the current measures in place, which are set to expire on July 21st, have worked well in restricting non-essential travel while allowing essential crossings to continue unimpeded.""

Freeland's office wasn’t alone in pushing back against the call. Higgins posted the open letter in full on his Twitter page and he was swiftly met with backlash on the social media platform.

One comment, which had three times as many likes as Higgins' original post, slammed the call.

""No thank you...clean up your backyard before you attempt to enter ours..sincerely Canada,"" wrote a user who goes by the name @MichelletypoQ.

Another user, @rachelinTO, wrote that ""most of our earliest cases came from the U.S. So...... that's a firm 'no'. Sorry, eh.""

Other users called the request ""disastrous"" and multiple accounts said they’d only be comfortable easing restrictions after seeing improvement in the number of COVID-19 cases in the U.S.

The United States reached a macabre milestone at the end of June when it became home to the world’s highest number of reported infections: more than 2.2 million. It also has the highest death toll in the world, with 120,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.

Shortly after the news broke about the soaring cases in the United States, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the government was considering next steps for the looming deadline of the current border closure.

Speaking in a press conference on June 29, with just over three weeks until the agreement expires, he said the government will continue to assess the situation at our shared border.

""We have extended the border measures with the United States until July 21. We will continue to assess the situation and work with the Americans on what steps need to be taken into the month of August,"" Trudeau said.

And as COVID-19 continues to affect countries around the world, Trudeau said the health of Canadians remains the top priority when considering the loosening of any border restrictions.

An animal health expert and an epidemiologist will meet Chinese counterparts in Beijing to set the ""scope and terms of reference"" for a WHO-led international mission aimed at learning how the virus jumped from animals to humans, a WHO statement said.

Scientists believe the virus may have originated in bats and was transmitted to another mammal such as a civet cat or an armadillo-like pangolin before being passed on to people.

A cluster of infections late last year focused initial attention on a fresh food market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, but the discovery of earlier cases suggests the animal-to-human jump may have happened elsewhere.

In an effort to block future outbreaks, China has cracked down on the trade in wildlife and closed some markets, while enforcing strict containment measures that appear to have virtually stopped new local infections.

The WHO mission is politically sensitive, with the U.S. -- the top funder of the UN body -- moving to cut ties with it over allegations it mishandled the outbreak and is biased toward China.

""China took the lead in inviting WHO experts to investigate and discuss scientific virus tracing,"" Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said Friday.

In contrast, he said, the U.S. ""not only announced its withdrawal from the World Health Organization, but also politicized the anti-epidemic issue and played a buck-passing game to shift responsibilities.""

More than 120 nations called for an investigation into the origins of the virus at the World Health Assembly in May. China has insisted that WHO lead the investigation and for it to wait until the pandemic is brought under control. The U.S., Brazil and India are continuing to see an increasing number of cases.

The last WHO coronavirus-specific mission to China was in February, after which the team's leader, Canadian doctor Bruce Aylward, praised China's containment efforts and information sharing. Canadian and American officials have since criticized him as being too lenient on China.

An Associated Press investigation showed that in January, WHO officials were privately frustrated over the lack of transparency and access in China, according to internal audio recordings. Their complaints included that China delayed releasing the genetic map, or genome, of the virus for more than a week after three different government labs had fully decoded the information.

Privately, top WHO leaders complained in meetings in the week of Jan. 6 that China was not sharing enough data to assess how effectively the virus spread between people or what risk it posed to the rest of the world, costing valuable time.",[]

Here's a look at how much Canadian cities spend on policing,[],2020-07-10 07:30:00-04:00,"TORONTO -- An analysis by CTVNews.ca of 18 of Canada’s largest cities, regions and provincial capitals found more than half allocated 15 per cent or more of their 2020 operating budget to policing, with cities in Western Canada budgeting 20 per cent or more.

Coast-to-coast, from Vancouver to Charlottetown, P.E.I., Canadian cities are spending 15 to 20 per cent or more of their budget on law enforcement, the bulk of it coming from municipal taxes. Cities that do not have a municipal force were excluded from the analysis.

Cries to defund the police have rung out in protests across the United States, sparked by the death of George Floyd, seen in a video pleading and gasping for air as a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee against his neck -- long after he had already gone silent.

Around the world and in Canada, cities are also facing public pressure to reduce their law enforcement budgets to reallocate funds to other areas including mental health and community social support services.

It is a contentious issue, however. Ontario Premier Doug Ford has already dismissed the idea for the Ontario Provincial Police, saying he believes in strengthening policing through better community involvement.

In recent months, several deaths that followed “wellness checks” by Canadian police have sparked further discussion over whether police officers are properly trained or even the appropriate authority to deal with someone having a mental health crisis, in particular those who are Black, Indigenous, or a person of colour.

In June, 62-year-old Ejaz Choudry was killed in his home by police in Mississauga, Ont., after the family said it called a non-emergency helpline because he was having a mental health episode. Paramedics who arrived called the police after Choudry was seen with a knife in his hand. Earlier in the month, Chantel Moore, an Indigenous woman, was shot and killed by police in New Brunswick during another wellness check, while Regis Korchinski-Paquet, a Black, Indigenous woman, fell from her apartment balcony in Toronto last month while police officers were in her home.

BIGGEST POLICE BUDGET IN CANADA

At the end of June, Toronto city council rejected a 10 per cent cut to the police budget, about $107 million, and instead passed a motion on police reform that includes implementing body cameras and overhauling the way Canada’s largest municipal police force responds to people in crisis.

A 10 per cent reduction would have meant cutting about 1,000 police officers, according to the Canadian Press, a move that could take years to implement due to collective bargaining agreements with the union.

The Toronto Police Service operating budget for 2020 is $1.22 billion, about 9 per cent of the city’s $13.53 billion operational budget for 2020. More than $3 billion is distributed for various social support and development programs including employment, social assistance, child-care, long-term care services, helping under-resourced neighbourhoods, housing and shelter support.

In early June, the Vancouver Police Board rejected a motion by city council calling for a 1 per cent cut to the police’s $339 million budget, about 21 per cent of the city’s $1.62 billion operating budget for 2020.

Meanwhile, Edmonton city council approved a motion in early July that included cutting the police service’s budget by $11 million over the next two years amid weeks of debate around police reform.

South of the border, the city of Los Angeles voted on July 1 to cut police department hiring, slashing the LAPD’s budget by US$150 million. The cut brings the department’s staffing down to its lowest level in 12 years, the Los Angeles Times reported. The city said the money would eventually be reallocated into services like hiring programs and summer youth jobs for Black, Latino and other marginalized communities.

BIGGEST LINE ITEM ON THE BUDGET

For cities in Western Canada including Victoria, Vancouver, Saskatoon, Regina, Winnipeg, policing accounts for at least 20 per cent of their 2020 operating budgets. Among them, all but Vancouver have policing as the city’s biggest expenditure. (Utilities is listed as Vancouver’s biggest operating expenditure in its 2020 budget, though annual financial reports show that police is the city’s biggest expense.)

In Victoria, the police force accounts for roughly 23 per cent of the city’s total operating expenses for 2020. For Vancouver, Saskatoon and Regina, it’s just over 20 per cent. Edmonton and Calgary are the exceptions.

The Winnipeg Police Service is getting $304.1 million this year, or 26.6 per cent of the city’s $1.14 billion tax-supported operating expenditures. It is the largest percentage among the cities examined by CTVNews.ca. By comparison, community services in Winnipeg are getting $115 million, or 10 per cent of the budget.

As in many other cities, a petition has been circulating calling for change and defunding the Winnipeg police. Chief Danny Smyth said in June that it was too early to “just say defund the police and forward that all to social services” but added there was room for conversation on what such a move could look like.

Even places with modest budgets, like Charlottetown, P.E.I., which has a budget of $59.7 million, allocates more than 16 per cent to police. In Fredericton, N.B., more than 14 per cent of its $124.4 million budget (including capital expenditures) goes to policing. That portion is more than 18 per cent if capital expenditures are excluded.

In larger southern Ontario, Toronto-area cities and regions including Hamilton, Waterloo, Peel, and York, hundreds of millions of dollars are spent each year on policing. Peel and York, which have similar operating budgets of approximately $2.5 billion, spend about $445.8 million and $384.2 million, respectively, or 17 and 16 per cent. The Waterloo Regional Police, which also serves Kitchener, Ont., accounts for just over 17 per cent of the region’s operating budget. Hamilton’s police budget accounts for nearly 19 per cent of the city’s net operating budget. (That portion is halved however, if calculated based on the tax and rate supported gross operating expenditure).

Nearly all cities that spend roughly 10 per cent or less on policing have operating budgets of at least $1 billion. These include Toronto, Calgary, Ottawa, Quebec City, Montreal and Halifax, which has a budget just shy of a billion.

According to Statistics Canada data, the average salary among municipal police officers was $100,962 for 2017/2018, the latest year in which data is available. And while police spending has increased, the number of police officers per 100,000 people has been shrinking, the data showed.

In the United States, data varies depending on the source, but the percentage allocated to police departments for the 10 largest cities in the country ranged from 6 per cent to 17.4 per cent based on an analysis by U.S. News & World Report. Data compiled by the Center for Popular Democracy, a progressive advocacy group, which includes other cities, showed that percentage ranged as high as 20 to 45 per cent, with such cities as Minneapolis accounting for more than 35 per cent and Milwaukee making up nearly 48 per cent.

One important caveat to note is that cities are all structured differently and may report their finances or categorize their spending differently as well, so a true apples-to-apples comparison is extremely difficult. A few cities include utilities as part of its operating expenses, for example, while many do not.The Canadian police data in this analysis was collected and calculated based on figures presented in 2020 budget proposals and reports released by each city and region. As much as possible, comparable figures were used. In general, total operating budget or expenditure budget excluding capital expenditures as presented in the budget reports were used. In some cases, for example, figures provided may be net of recoveries and/or transfers, terms for certain types of financial transactions in accounting.

Philippe Monguillot, 59, was left brain dead after the attack in the southwestern city of Bayonne on July 5. His family decided to switch off his life support on Friday, news agency Agence France-Presse reported.

""We decided to let him go. The doctors were in favour and we were as well,"" the victim's 18-year-old daughter, Marie Monguillot, told AFP.

Four men were detained and charged following the assault.

The attack occurred on Sunday around 7:15 p.m. on the 810 bus travelling to Biarritz after the bus driver checked the ticket of one of the men and asked all four to wear face masks, which are compulsory in French public transport, according to the public prosecutor's office.

On Wednesday, Monguillot's family organized a march in his honour, with all attendees wearing white.

Prime Minister Castex confirmed Monguillot's death on Twitter late Friday, writing that the case had ""touched our hearts.""

""The Republic recognizes him as an exemplary citizen and won't forget him. The law will punish the perpetrators of this despicable crime,"" he wrote, describing the attack as ""cowardly.""

French Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin also expressed his condolences to Monguillot's frends, family and colleagues.

""This heinous and cowardly act must not go unpunished. I'll be travelling to Bayonne tomorrow to make a point of safety in the city with state officials and meet with public transport drivers and unions,"" he wrote on Twitter.

The company Monguillot worked for, Keoilis, has boosted security for its employees, deploying guards on some of its bus services in the area.

The company held a minute's silence in its offices and on its transport networks on Wednesday in mourning for Monguillot.",[]

Gov. Denny Tamaki said he could say only that a ""few dozen"" cases had been found recently because the U.S. military asked that the exact figure not be released. The outbreaks occurred at Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, which is at the centre of a relocation dispute, and Camp Hansen, Tamaki said.

Local media, citing unnamed sources, said about 60 people had been infected.

""Okinawans are shocked by what we were told (by the U.S. military),"" Tamaki told a news conference. ""We now have strong doubts that the U.S. military has taken adequate disease prevention measures.""

Tamaki demanded transparency in the latest development and said he planned to request talks between the U.S. military and Okinawan officials. He said Okinawan officials also asked the Japanese government to demand that the U.S. provide details including the number of cases, seal off Futenma and Camp Hansen, and step up preventive measures on base.

Okinawan officials made similar requests to the U.S. military on Friday in order to address local residents' concerns, Tamaki said.

The Marines said in a statement Friday that the troops were taking additional protective measures to limit the spread of the coronavirus and were restricting off-base activities. The statement said measures are ""to protect our forces, our families, and the local community,"" without providing details on the infections.

The Marines did not immediately respond Saturday to an Associated Press inquiry about the latest outbreak.

Okinawa is home to more than half of about 50,000 American troops based in Japan under a bilateral security pact, and the residents are sensitive to U.S. base-related problems. Many Okinawans have long complained about pollution, noise and crime related to U.S. bases.

Okinawans also oppose a planned relocation of the Futenma air base from the current site in a densely populated area in the south to a less populated area on the east coast.

Local media reported that the Okinawan assembly adopted a resolution Friday protesting the U.S. military's lack of transparency about its outbreak on base.

Okinawa has about 150 cases of the coronavirus. In all, Japan has about 21,000 cases and 1,000 deaths, with Tokyo reporting more than 200 new cases for a third straight day Saturday.",[]

But it remained to be seen if Trump's most recent defiance of the conventions of his office to commute the sentence of political confidant Roger Stone, just four months before Election Day, would matter to voters grappling with a deadly COVID-19 surge and a national discourse on racial justice.

Shortly before heading out Saturday morning for his Virginia golf club, Trump made unfounded accusations against his political foes while taking another swipe at special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, which led to convictions for six Trump aides or advisers, including Stone, a larger-than-life political character who embraced his reputation as a dirty trickster.

“Roger Stone was targeted by an illegal Witch Hunt that never should have taken place,” Trump tweeted. “It is the other side that are criminals, including Biden and Obama, who spied on my campaign - AND GOT CAUGHT!”

Trump has long sought vengeance against the Russia investigation that helped define his first two years in office. And now that the coronavirus pandemic has imperiled his reelection chances by crushing the economy and sending his poll numbers sliding, he has taken to testing the limits of his power in order to reward loyalty and fire up his conservative base.

The decision to commute the sentence of the 67-year-old Stone, who was convicted of lying to help the president and set to report to prison on Tuesday, was loudly celebrated by some in Trump's orbit as a triumph over deep state prosecutorial overreach.

But the move announced Friday evening came over the advice of a number of the president's senior advisers, who warned him it would be politically self-destructive to reward Stone for his silence. Trump had long floated the idea of clemency for Stone - as well as for other associates in legal trouble, including his former national security adviser Michael Flynn and campaign chairman Paul Manafort - which itself was viewed by some as witness tampering by encouraging them not to co-operate with prosecutors.

The reaction from Democrats was swift and furious.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Saturday called it “an act of staggering corruption,” saying legislation is needed to prevent a president from pardoning or commuting the sentence of someone who acted to shield that president from prosecution. House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff called it “offensive to the rule of law and principles of justice.”

And Trump's Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, resurfaced a 2019 tweet in which he said that “Trump has surrounded himself with people who flout our laws - we shouldn't be surprised that he thinks he is above the law.” He added: “Still true.”

Republicans largely stayed silent on the issue Saturday, reluctant again to challenge a president who remains very popular with rank-and-file GOP voters. But one loud voice was Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, who was also the lone GOP senator to vote to convict the president during his impeachment trial earlier this year.

“Unprecedented, historic corruption: an American president commutes the sentence of a person convicted by a jury of lying to shield that very president,” Romney tweeted Saturday.

Sen. Pat Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican, signalled dismay with the commutation, saying in a statement Saturday that it was a mistake while calling the Russia investigation “badly flawed” and a source of “frustration.” He added that Stone had been duly convicted and that any objections to the conviction and trial “should be resolved through the appeals process.”

Mark Sanford, the former South Carolina congressman who made a short-lived primary challenge to Trump, wrote: “So much for the Republican Party being the party of law and order. Have we not lost our minds in not condemning as a party the president's corruption by Roger Stone.”

But most of Republicans who did speak out about the decision supported it. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Trump confidant, said Stone was convicted of a “nonviolent, first-time offence” and the president was “justified” in commuting the sentence.

Advisers who had previously talked Trump out of acting on Stone's behalf awaited the possible fallout, but they considered that Congress may be too consumed with virus relief packages while wondering if the electorate long ago tuned out any talk of the complicated Russia investigation, particularly during a pandemic.

But Trump likely could not afford more political damage. He is decidedly trailing Biden, per his campaign's own private admissions, and his effort to reboot his reelection bid took another blow when his planned rally Saturday night in New Hampshire was postponed. Campaign officials had deeply worried about low turnout. While an impending storm was blamed for the cancellation, sunny skies were seen in Portsmouth an hour before the president had been due to arrive.

By commuting Stone's sentence, Trump evoked other controversial acts of clemency by his predecessors, though his was done in the height of an election year.

President George H. W. Bush pardoned former Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger on Christmas Eve 1992, six weeks after he was defeated for reelection, prompting an uproar from Democrats and the independent counsel investigating the Iran-Contra affair. And President Bill Clinton waited until his final hours in office in 2001 to issue a raft of pardons, including of financier Marc Rich.

But one president who resisted the use of pardon was Richard Nixon, who privately discussed acts of clemency but never followed through even as many of his associates faced legal trouble during the Watergate scandal.

A few months after resigning, Nixon himself received a pardon from his successor Gerald Ford.

Stone, a former Nixon aide, told the AP he expressed his gratitude to Trump in a phone call.

“You know, he has a great sense of fairness,” Stone said. “We've been friends for many, many years, and he understands that I was targeted strictly for political reasons.”

556,ctvnews,http://www.ctvnews.ca/world/mueller-defends-russia-probe-says-stone-remains-a-felon-1.5020696,"Mueller defends Russia probe, says Stone remains a felon",['Eric Tucker'],2020-07-11 19:22:00-04:00,"WASHINGTON -- Former special counsel Robert Mueller sharply defended his investigation into ties between Russia and Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, writing in a newspaper opinion piece Saturday that the probe was of “paramount importance” and asserting that a Trump ally, Roger Stone, “remains a convicted felon, and rightly so” despite the president's decision to commute his prison sentence.

The op-ed in The Washington Post marked Mueller's first public statement on his investigation since his congressional appearance last July. It represented his firmest defence of the two-year probe whose results have come under attack and even been partially undone by the Trump administration, including the president's extraordinary move Friday evening to grant clemency to Stone just days before he was due to report to prison.

Mueller said that though he had intended for his 448-page report on the investigation to speak for itself, he felt compelled to “respond both to broad claims that our investigation was illegitimate and our motives were improper, and to specific claims that Roger Stone was a victim of our office.

“The Russia investigation was of paramount importance. Stone was prosecuted and convicted because he committed federal crimes. He remains a convicted felon, and rightly so,” Mueller wrote.

Mueller did not specify who was making the claims, but it appeared to be an obvious reference to Trump, who as recently as Saturday derided the investigation as this “whole political witch hunt and the Mueller scam.”

The mere publication of the op-ed was striking in itself for a former FBI director who was tight-lipped during the investigation, refusing to respond to attacks by the president or his allies or to even make public appearances explaining or justifying his work. In his first public statement after the conclusion of his investigation, Mueller had said that he had hoped his report would speak for itself. When he later testified to House lawmakers, he was similarly careful not to stray beyond the report's findings or offer new evidence.

But that buttoned-up approach created a void for others, including at the Justice Department, to place their own stamp on his work. Even before the report was released Attorney General William Barr issued a four-page summary document that Mueller privately complained did not adequately capture the gravity of his team's findings.

In the months since, Barr assigned a U.S. attorney to investigate the origins of the Russia probe, and the Justice Department moved to dismiss the criminal case against former Trump administration national security adviser Michael Flynn even though Flynn had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about contacts with the Russian ambassador during the presidential transition period.

The op-ed traced the basis for the Stone prosecution, with Mueller recounting how Stone had not only tampered with a witness but also lied repeatedly about his efforts to gain inside information about Democratic emails that Russian intelligence operatives stole and provided to WikiLeaks, which published them in the run-up to the election.

Those efforts, including his discussions with Trump campaign associates about them, cut to the heart of Mueller's mandate to determine whether anyone tied to the campaign co-ordinated with Russia in the hacking or disclosure of the stolen Democratic emails.

Stone was particularly critical to the investigation, Mueller writes, because he claimed inside knowledge about WikiLeaks' release of the stolen emails and because he communicated during the campaign with people known to be Russian intelligence officers. He also communicated with members of the Trump campaign about the timing of the WikiLeaks releases, something that he denied.

“We did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian government in its activities,” Mueller wrote. “The investigation did, however, establish that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome. It also established that the campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts.”

Stone was found guilty last fall of witness tampering, false statements and obstructing a congressional investigation into Russian election interference. He was sentenced in February to 40 months in prison and was due to surrender on Tuesday, until the president commuted his sentence.

“Roger Stone was treated horribly. Roger Stone was treated very unfairly,” Trump told reporters on Saturday.

He was one of six former Trump associates or advisers to be convicted in the Russia investigation. In total, the investigation produced charges against 34 individuals, including 25 Russians accused either of hacking into Democratic email accounts of engaging in a covert social media campaign to divide American public opinion ahead of the election.",[]

Last week, the island nation’s prime minister, Mia Mottley, revealed that her government is looking at introducing a 12-month “Barbados Welcome Stamp.”

Mottley said the stamp would give visitors the opportunity to “come and work from here overseas, digitally so, so that persons don’t need to remain in the countries in which they are.”

According to the Barbados Government Information Service website, Mottley said the COVID-19 pandemic had made short-term travel more difficult because of requirements for testing for the virus.

As an alternative, the prime minister proposed the idea of travellers coming to Barbados for a lengthier stay, during which, they could continue to work remotely.

“You don’t need to work in Europe, or the U.S. or Latin America if you can come here and work for a couple months at a time; go back and come back,” Mottley said during a speech at the official reopening of a restaurant in the St. Lawrence Gap neighbourhood on July 1.

Even though Barbados is mulling over a one-year “welcome stamp” to visitors, the Canadian government still advises against all non-essential travel outside of Canada until further notice.

“The governments of those destinations that have opened their borders to tourists could impose strict travel restrictions suddenly, should they experience an increase in cases of COVID-19,” an advisory on the Canadian government’s website reads. “International transportation options could be reduced significantly, making it difficult for you to return to Canada.”

Barbados is set to reopen its borders to international travellers on Sunday, July 12.

According to the U.S. embassy in Barbados, the resumption of commercial flights will begin on July 12 with Air Canada, which will run flights to and from the island nation on Thursdays and Sundays.

British Airways, Jet Blue, Virgin Atlantic, and American Airlines will also operate flights to Barbados on dates after July 12.

There will be a number of new health protocols for visitors arriving to the airport in Barbados, including a PCR test for coronavirus, mandatory face mask use, and health screening. Travellers from high and moderate-risk countries, including Canada, will be monitored for the onset of symptoms for seven days.

Even before the borders reopen, Barbados has already started relaxing COVID-19 pandemic measures and lifting curfews.

On June 15, the government lifted restrictions on open hours for beaches and parks. On July 1, physical distancing requirements were reduced to a one-metre distance and all curfew restrictions were cancelled.

According to the U.S. embassy in Barbados and data compiled by John Hopkins University, the Caribbean country currently has 98 confirmed cases of COVID-19.",[]

Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom are reopening Saturday, while Epcot and Disney's Hollywood Studios will follow four days later.

“It's the chance to come back and be in the magic,” said Diane Watkins, a preschool teacher from Helena, Alabama, who visits the park about eight times a year. “Hot or not, mask or not, we're just happy to be here. I feel like everybody here is in the same frame of mind. Everybody is just so excited to be here.”

Watkins said that when she and her 16-year-old daughter walked into the Magic Kingdom on Saturday morning, then saw all the cast members lined up and clapping on Main Street, she cried.

“It was very emotional,” she said.

The reopening comes as a huge surge of Floridians have tested positive for the new coronavirus in recent weeks. On Saturday, there were about 10,000 new cases reported, according to state statistics. Many cities and counties around the state have recently reinstated restrictions that had been lifted in May, when cases seemed to drop.

All of Disney's Orlando parks closed in mid-March in an effort to stop the virus's spread. Universal Orlando and SeaWorld Orlando closed around the same time but reopened several weeks ago after instituting similar rules to protect employees and customers from the virus.

Lori Lovell of Evansville, Indiana, strolled around Frontierland on Saturday morning with friends.

“I have missed coming here. It just feels really good to be back. This is where I've made so many memories. It's kind of our second home. Not being able to come here was hard.”

Disney's new rules include mandatory masks and social distancing. Visitors will need reservations to enter a park, and they won't be allowed to hop between parks. Both visitors and employees will receive temperature checks when they enter. Fireworks shows and parades have been suspended to prevent drawing too many people together.

Park-goers say that nearly everyone in sight wore masks on Saturday morning. Capacity is nowhere near where it is under normal circumstances, they said.

“I've been here on spring breaks where you can barely walk around. The walkways are very wide open,” said Lovell.

There were lots of hand sanitizer stations around, and people were respecting the physical distancing cues and guidelines. Since the park is at lower capacity, there was only a five-minute wait for the popular Buzz Lightyear ride - normally it's about 90 minutes, Watkins said.

Some attractions and dining areas aren't yet open. Another change: visitors can't hug and greet the costumed Disney characters. Instead, the characters are in “cavalcades,” or motorcades, as they make their way through the park.

Disney has been opening its parks back up around the globe for the past two months. In May, the company opened Disney Springs, a complex of shops, restaurants and entertainment venues in Lake Buena Vista.

But the couple came together for a special Friday edition of her ""Red Table Talk"" show on Facebook to share their side of the controversy surrounding her relationship with singer August Alsina.

According to the superstar couple they ""were going through a very difficult time"" and had broken up when Pinkett Smith started a romantic relationship with the 27-year-old singer.

During their ""Red Table Talk"" chat Smith pushed his wife to be clear about what her relationship had been with Alsina.

""I got into an entanglement with August,"" Pinkett Smith said.

In a recent interview with radio host Angela Yee, Alsina said he had been involved in a romantic relationship with Pinkett Smith, who has been married to Smith since 1997.

""I actually sat down with Will and had a conversation,"" Alsina said during the interview. ""Due to the transformation from their marriage to (a) life partnership that they have spoken on several times, and not involving romanticism, he gave me his blessing.""

Alsina said he had lost money and relationships because of rumours he had been involved with Pinkett Smith, 48.

The actress and her 51-year-old husband have long been the subject of rumours that they have an open marriage.

The couple has denied this, but says their marriage is not traditional and that they have a ""life partnership.""

On Friday's episode the pair said they felt compelled to speak out because there was so much speculation after Alsina's interview.

""We specifically never said anything,"" Will Smith said. ""Coming to the table was like we just felt like it got to the point where you gotta say something.""

Pinkett Smith said she began a friendship with Alsina about four and a half years ago and that became more once she and her husband hit a rough patch.

She also said she wanted to clear up Alsina having said her husband had given permission for the affair, though she added that she understood why the young singer may have believed that to be the case.

""The only person that can give permission in that particular circumstance is myself,"" she said. ""I could actually see how he would perceive it as permission because we were separated amicably and I think he also wanted to make it clear that he's also not a homewrecker. Which he's not.""

The actress said she was ""in a lot of pain"" and ""broken"" during the relationship.

She and Will tried ""everything we could to get away from each other only to realize that wasn't possible.""

Pinkett Smith said her relationship with Alsina ended, the Smiths reconciled, and she said she has not spoken to the singer in years.

She said she and her husband have now gotten to a place of ""unconditional love.""

Smith said he had been unsure as to whether he would ever speak to Pinkett Smith again when they were having problems, but he reminded her of their commitment.

""I told you the first year we were married, that I could love you through anything,"" Will Smith said.

The couple bumped fists as they jokingly recited their rendition of his ""Bad Boys"" movie motto: ""We ride together, we die together. Bad marriage for life.""",[]

The combination of forced closures, decreased consumer spending and limited rent relief measures has left some retailers unable to maintain their existing operations.

Here is a look at some of the major retail closures announced in Canada in 2020, both before and during the pandemic.

Scholar’s Choice: The educational toys and teaching materials retailer announced on July 10 it was closing 13 stores across the country. Only three stores will remain open – London, Ont., Winnipeg and Moncton – and act as regional sales and distribution centres. Scholar’s Choice also filed for creditor protection through a notice of intention to propose a reorganization plan to restructure the company.

DavidsTea: The Montreal-based beverage retailer announced on July 9 that it was closing 82 of its locations in Canada and all 42 of its U.S. stores to focus more on its e-commerce business and supplying grocery stores and pharmacies. The company, which also filed for creditor protection, said it was closing shops that were unprofitable and that it hoped to negotiate more favourable lease terms for the 100 remaining locations in Canada. The company said COVID-19 pandemic had worsened an already challenging retail market.

Microsoft: The technology company revealed on June 26 that it would be closing nearly all of its 83 physical stores around the world as part of a “strategic change” for its retail business. Microsoft has seven stores in Canada, which will all be closing. Only four locations in London, New York City, Sydney, and Redmond, Wash. will remain as “reimagined” physical spaces.

GNC: Health and nutrition retailer GNC announced June 23 that it has filed for bankruptcy in the U.S. and says it will close at least 29 stores in Canada as part of its restructuring.

The Children's Place: Approximately 200 locations of child clothing store The Children's Place will close this year and 100 more next year in Canada and the U.S., company executives said June 11 on an earnings call.

Starbucks: Filings with U.S. regulators dated June 10 show that Starbucks plans to close 200 Canadian locations as part of a new two-year business plan.

Sail: Outdoor retailer Sail said June 4 that it will close four stores in Quebec and two in Ontario, leaving it with a total of 12 outlets remaining open in the two provinces.

Bestseller Canada: The company that operates Jack & Jones and Vero Moda filed for creditor protection June 2. Retail Insider reported in February that the Canadian subsidiary of the Danish company was shutting five of its Bestseller branded stores. It reported this month that sources indicated all nine Vero Moda locations would be closed and 13 of the 51 Jack and Jones stores would also close.

Thyme Maternity and Addition Elle: Financial woes at Reitmans left the company seeking creditor protection and announcing plans to close all stores under its Thyme Maternity and Addition Elle banners, as was announced June 1.

Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works: L Brands announced May 20 that it will close 13 of the 38 Victoria's Secret stores in Canada, as well as one Bath & Body Works location, as part of a larger restructuring that also affects the company's American operations.

Army & Navy: The 101-year-old Western Canadian department store chain announced in May that it was closing its doors permanently. CEO Jacqui Cohen cited the “unsurmountable” challenges caused by the pandemic. Touted as the country’s first discount department store, the company said it would be closing its five remaining locations in Vancouver, New Westminster, B.C., Langley, B.C., Calgary and Edmonton.

Henry’s: Cranbrook Glen Enterprises Ltd, the parent company of the Toronto-based camera and accessories chain, filed a NOI (Notice of Intention) in May. The company said it plans to close seven of its 29 store locations once COVID-19-related measures were loosened.

Aldo: Montreal-based The Aldo Group said May 7 that it was entering creditor protection. Although the footwear retailer said it will gradually reopen its stores as public health guidelines permit, legal filings reportedly state that an unspecified number of stores are not expected to ever reopen.

Ronsons: The Vancouver-based shoe retailer announced on April 8 that it was in receivership and closing its 18 stores, all of which are located in British Columbia. The company was founded 32 years ago by CEO Tony Aronson and his father.

Pier 1: Home decor chain Pier 1 announced Feb. 17 that it will close all of its stores in Canada, as the retailer began bankruptcy proceedings in the United States.

Carlton Cards and Papyrus: On Jan. 22, the owner of greeting card retailers including Carlton Cards and Papyrus announced it was closing all of its stores in North America, including 76 Canadian locations.

Bench: The owner of apparel store Bench's Canadian operations confirmed to BNN Bloomberg on Jan. 22 that all 24 locations will be closed.

He also said the couple's tempestuous marriage broke down for good after an incident in which he accused Heard or one of her friends of defecating in the couple's bed.

He said he thought it was an oddly fitting end to the relationship.

Depp was concluding almost four days of evidence in his libel case against a British tabloid newspaper that accused him of physically abusing Heard.

The Hollywood star is suing News Group Newspapers, publisher of The Sun, and the paper's executive editor, Dan Wootton, over an April 2018 article that called him a ""wife-beater.""

In the High Court witness box, Depp has described a volatile relationship with Heard that descended into screaming matches which sometimes turned physical.

But he has strongly denied hitting Heard and accused her of compiling a dossier of fake claims against him as an ""insurance policy.""

Depp, 57, and Heard, 34, met on the set of the 2011 comedy ""The Rum Diary"" and married in Los Angeles in February 2015.

Heard, a model and actress, filed for divorce the following year and obtained a restraining order against Depp on the grounds of domestic abuse.

The divorce was finalized in 2017.

The Sun's defence relies on a total of 14 allegations by Heard of Depp's violence between 2013 and 2016, in settings including his private island in the Bahamas, a rented house in Australia and a private jet.

He strongly denies all of them.",[]

563,ctvnews,http://www.ctvnews.ca/sports/nhl-nhlpa-announce-toronto-edmonton-as-hubs-and-cba-extension-1.5019889,"NHL/NHLPA announce Toronto, Edmonton as hubs, and CBA extension",['Joshua Clipperton'],2020-07-10 19:38:00-04:00,"TORONTO -- The NHL remains on course to resume its pandemic-delayed season north of the 49th parallel later this summer, and now has the labour peace needed to ride out the unprecedented economic storm brought on by COVID-19.

The league and NHL Players' Association announced Friday the return-to-play protocols - featuring Toronto and Edmonton as hub cities - and a four-year extension to the current collective bargaining agreement have been ratified.

The NHL board of governors and the union's full membership gave the documents, which were tied together in an all-or-nothing bundle, the thumbs up in separate votes.

“It was pretty civil,” Vancouver Canucks captain Bo Horvat said of negotiations on the deal that was tentatively agreed to Monday. “We're happy to get things going.”

Bringing the hubs to Canada, where coronavirus infection rates are largely under control, proved to be the logical choice after a significant spike in cases across the United States in recent weeks.

“While we have all worked very hard to try to address the risks of COVID-19, we know that health and safety are and will continue to be our priorities,” NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said in a statement. “We know that all of our fans are excited about our return to the ice.”

Training camps for the 24 teams primed to compete in the league's restart to a 2019-20 campaign that was suspended March 12 are scheduled to begin Monday - also the deadline for players to opt out of participating with no penalty - in each franchise's home market.

The plan will then see Eastern Conference clubs report to Toronto on July 26, while those from the Western Conference head to Edmonton before the games resume Aug. 1. The conference finals and Stanley Cup will be held in Edmonton as part of a first-of-its-kind NHL Final Four that could stretch all the way to Oct. 4 and result in next season being pushed into December or early January.

Once in Canada's largest city and Alberta's capital, players are set to be kept away from the general public in so-called “bubbles” that include strict health measures, daily testing, and mostly confine teams to hotels and empty arenas.

The extension of the current CBA, which was slated to expire in September 2022 and now runs through at least the 2025-26 season, provides both players and owners clarity on a number of challenging financial realities caused by COVID-19.

It also give the green light for negotiations with the International Olympic Committee and the International Ice Hockey Federation on participation at the 2022 and 2026 Winter Games. The NHL skipped the 2018 Olympics after taking part in five straight between 1998 and 2014.

The salary cap's upper limit will remain at US$81.5 million in 2020-21 and stay there until hockey-related revenue returns to $4.8 billion - this season's projected total prior to the pandemic. Players have agreed to defer 10 per cent of next year's salaries, and have owners pay that back over three consecutive seasons starting in 2022-23.

“This agreement is a meaningful step forward for the players and owners, and for our game, in a difficult and uncertain time,” NHLPA executive director Don Fehr said. “We are pleased to be able to bring NHL hockey back.”

Escrow payments, a consistent thorn in the side of players that guarantees a 50/50 split of HRR with owners, will be capped at 20 per cent in 2020-21, and decrease throughout the deal. If teams are still owed money following the 2025-26 campaign, the CBA will be extended another season.

The agreement marks the first time in Bettman's 27-year tenure as commissioner the NHL has bridged two CBAs without a work stoppage. Both the 1994-95 and 2012-13 seasons were cut to 48 games because of lockouts, while the 2004-05 campaign was cancelled.

Alberta Premier Jason Kenney was the most outspoken politician with regards to having his province host one of the hubs, pointing to a low infection rate and Edmonton's facilities.

He also penned a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in hopes of securing a waiver for the NHL when it came to Canada's mandatory 14-day quarantine for anyone arriving in the country. The federal government approved the league's proposal of a cohort quarantine last month, granting an exception that paved the way for Toronto and Edmonton to get the nod as hubs.

Speaking outside Rogers Place, Kenney said Friday's news will create jobs and millions of dollars in economic activity.

“The Stanley Cup is coming back to Edmonton, to Alberta,” Kenney said in a video posted to Twitter as he stood next to a statue of Wayne Gretzky. “We are going to get an unbelievable amount of free advertising across North America and around the world that will set us up well for the future relaunch of our tourism industry when travel comes back post-COVID.”

The Cup was last awarded in Edmonton when Gretzky hoisted it over his head for a fourth and final time on May 26, 1988.

Each team will be permitted to bring a maximum of 52 people into the bubbles, including a maximum of 31 players.

Meanwhile, it was also announced the NHL draft lottery's second phase has been tabbed for Aug. 10. The eight losing teams from the qualifying round will have an equal shot at the first pick in the draft, which is tentatively scheduled for Oct. 9-10.

Much like Kenney, Ontario Premier Doug Ford and Toronto Mayor John Tory supported their city's hub potential.

“There is no better place for the NHL season to continue,” Tory said. “We will make sure we put on a great show for the game of hockey ... while following all proper health and safety protocols.”

Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist at Toronto General Hospital, said choosing to hold the NHL's restart in Canada reduces the overall risk, but it's far from a fool-proof endeavour.

“We'd be blind to think that there isn't COVID-19 in Canada, there's just significantly less of it here compared to parts of the U.S.,” he said. “Everyone has to pay close attention to COVID-19 because even with the best laid plans, there still can be small weaknesses that might be exploited by this virus.”

Vancouver was the other Canadian city originally in the running to host, along with seven American markets, before the provincial government expressed concerns about the NHL's health and safety protocols.

Ford was asked prior to Friday's announcement why the plan worked for his province when it didn't for British Columbia.

“They have very stringent rules and regulations for their players,” Ford said of the NHL. “When they told me (players are) getting tested every single day, I'm no medical professional, but I don't think they need testing every day.”

The 24-team format - which includes every Canadian franchise, save for Ottawa - will see the top-4 clubs from both the East and West play mini-tournaments to determine playoff seeding, while the other 16 will battle in a never-before-seen qualifying round.

Boston, Tampa Bay, Washington and Philadelphia are set to compete for the No. 1 slot in the East, while defending champions St. Louis, Colorado, Vegas and Dallas will do the same out West.

The East's best-of-five qualifying series include Pittsburgh vs. Montreal, Carolina vs. New York Rangers, New York Islanders vs. Florida and Toronto vs. Columbus. In the West, the matchups are Edmonton vs. Chicago, Nashville vs. Arizona, Vancouver vs. Minnesota and Calgary vs. Winnipeg.

In all, there will be as many as 52 games played over the first nine days before the teams get a break on Aug. 10.

The four winners of the best-of-five series in each conference will then be pitted against the top-4 seeds to fill out the usual 16-team playoff bracket.

There could, however, still be choppy waters before the 2019-20 season can actually resume.

Players won't be quarantined during training camp, but instead asked to practise physical distancing when not at the rink in hopes isolation and testing will be enough to avoid any outbreaks.

Of the 396 NHLers tested at team facilities between June 8 and Monday during voluntary workouts, 23 results came back positive. The league said it's also aware of 12 other positive tests for players not taking part in those optional sessions.

The Stanley Cup has been awarded every year since 1893, except for 1919 because of the Spanish flu outbreak and in 2005 when the lockout scratched the entire season.

There's now a firm plan in place to - hopefully - see it handed out this fall.

564,ctvnews,http://www.ctvnews.ca/world/trump-lags-biden-on-people-of-colour-in-top-campaign-ranks-1.5020347,Trump lags Biden on people of colour in top campaign ranks,['Darlene Superville'],2020-07-11 12:01:00-04:00,"WASHINGTON -- Amid a summer of racial unrest and calls for more diversity in leadership, President Donald Trump lags Democratic rival Joe Biden in the percentage of people of colour on their campaign staffs, according to data the campaigns provided to The Associated Press.

Twenty-five per cent of the Republican president's senior staff are nonwhite, compared to 36% of Biden's senior staff. Biden's overall campaign team is 35% nonwhite; Trump's campaign did not provide a comparable number.

And neither campaign provided racial breakdowns for their nonwhite staff, nor the total number of staffers who are on their payrolls, including senior staff.

Advocates for minority groups say staff diversity is necessary to ensure political candidates hear a full range of voices and viewpoints to help them understand the concerns of various communities and interest groups -- especially at a time when racial injustice is front and centre in the national conversation. And while Biden has an edge on Trump, there is plenty more to be done in presidential campaigns overall.

Jennifer Lawless, commonwealth professor of politics at the University of Virginia, said ""there are still a lot of milestones that haven't been hit"" by political campaigns, such as a Black man or woman directing -- and winning -- a presidential campaign. And she said having diverse staff at lower levels in campaigns can help increase the pool of future managers, finance chairs and others.

""It's all part of the pipeline,"" Lawless said.

Trump's campaign makeup got a double-take in June when Vice-President Mike Pence tweeted -- and later deleted -- a photo from his visit to campaign headquarters. The photo at first drew attention for the lack of social distancing and use of face masks among the staff. But it also was notable for the sea of mostly white faces.

Eric Rodriguez, senior vice-president of policy and advocacy at UnidosUS, said the Biden team had more Latinos in senior positions than Trump.

""You need people from those communities to be able to make those connections,"" said Rodriguez, whose organization used to be called the National Council of La Raza.

The rival campaigns fared better -- and are about even --- on employing women, with females filling more than half of all jobs overall, and more than half of all senior positions.

The president's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, who is white, former White House aide Mercedes Schlapp, who is Cuban American, and Katrina Pierson, who is Black and worked on Trump's 2016 campaign, are among the highest-profile senior female staffers working to help reelect him.

Others include former Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle, now a top campaign fundraiser and the girlfriend of Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., and Hannah Castillo, the campaign's coalitions director. Guilfoyle's late mother was from Puerto Rico. Castillo is Mexican American.

Biden senior adviser Symone Sanders, who is Black, is the campaign's highest-ranking person of colour and, at 30, is the youngest member of his inner circle. The candidate also recently brought on several African Americans who worked for President Barack Obama, including Karine Jean-Pierre, formerly an NBC News and MSNBC political analyst.

Jamal Brown, a spokesperson for Biden, said the former vice-president's campaign reflects the ""diversity, breadth and promise of America.""

""He believes our democracy is strongest when people see themselves reflected in their government,"" added Brown, who is Black.

The killing in May of George Floyd, who was Black, by a white Minneapolis police officer sparked nationwide protests against racial injustice and calls for greater minority representation across the board in society that brought fresh scrutiny to the presidential campaigns.

Biden had faced questions earlier in the campaign about the lack of diversity on his staff. Along with adding more people of colour to his campaign, Biden has promised an administration that ""looks like America"" if he is elected on Nov. 3.

The U.S. population is about 60% white, 19% Latino and 13% Black, according to Census Bureau estimates.

Trump has not made a similar pledge about a potential second term. His campaign declined to discuss minority representation on the campaign staff.

Four women currently serve in Trump's Cabinet: CIA Director Gina Haspel and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, both of whom are white; Jovita Carranza, a Latina who leads the Small Business Administration; and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, who was born in Taiwan.

Housing Secretary Ben Carson is the only Black member of the Cabinet.

Rodriguez summed up the Biden campaign strategy as focused on winning support from a diverse pool of voters, especially in battleground states where large numbers of Latino and Black voters live. He characterized Trump's strategy as being ""really all about the base"" and attempting to replicate his successful 2016 campaign playbook, which used immigration as a wedge issue.

""The strategy is to run on racial division,"" Rodriguez said of the president, who has begun to use the racial tensions that surfaced after Floyd's killing in his reelection pitch.

Still, Trump and his campaign make regular appeals to Black and Latino voters.

The president regularly cites employment gains for these groups before the coronavirus pandemic struck, and he continues to showcase legislation he signed to overhaul criminal sentencing procedures and provide permanent funding for historically Black colleges and universities.

This week, Trump was surrounded by Latino American leaders as he announced a new advisory commission to help Hispanic Americans with economic and educational opportunities.

But the event also highlighted how far Trump has to go in winning support from people of colour. Critics of Trump's record with Hispanics called for a boycott of the Goya food company after its president praised Trump at the event.

The president does have strong support among some people of Cuban and Venezuelan descent, though, because of his tough stance against authoritarian leaders in those countries.

The Biden campaign said LGBTQ staff and staff of colour hold such positions as senior advisers, deputy campaign managers, national coalitions director, chief financial officer, chief operating officer and national press secretary, among others.

Trump's campaign defined its senior staff as ""senior leaders who meet regularly to make decisions. People with authority,"" and did not elaborate.",[]
565,ctvnews,http://www.ctvnews.ca/world/video-calls-separate-bedrooms-bolsonaro-s-first-covid-week-1.5020444,"Video calls, separate bedrooms: Bolsonaro's first COVID week",['Daniel Carvalho'],2020-07-11 14:44:00-04:00,"BRASILIA, BRAZIL -- After months in which Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro downplayed COVID-19 by flouting social distancing recommendations and mostly shunning masks, both coronavirus precautions became part of his cloistered life this week at the official residence in capital Brasilia.

Bolsonaro, 65, announced on Tuesday that he tested positive for the virus and had experienced fever, aches and malaise. He scrapped a trip he had planned to northeastern Piaui state, and all his meetings for the week were converted to video calls.

One was with former congressman Roberto Jefferson, president of the conservative PTB party. Jefferson told The Associated Press that he went to the presidential Planalto Palace and sat in front of a large television where he could see Bolsonaro in a makeshift office at his residence.

""I found the president well, flushed, willing. In very good health,"" Jefferson said Saturday. ""I only saw him cough once, when I made a joke.""

Since his diagnosis, Bolsonaro has held virtual meetings almost every day with Jorge Oliveira, secretary-general of government, to sign official documents. According to Oliveira's office, a protocol was created so work could be carried out digitally.

This was also how Bolsonaro interviewed candidates to head the education ministry, he said on Facebook on Thursday. The following day, he named to the post Milton Ribeiro, a former deputy dean of Mackenzie University in Sao Paulo who preaches at a Presbyterian church in Santos, outside the metropolis.

Only a few aides who were previously infected by the new coronavirus could get close to Bolsonaro during the week, one of them said on Tuesday. The person declined to be named, citing lack of authorization to speak with journalists. Bolsonaro also spent some time in the afternoons in front of the palace with photojournalists 400 yards away, on the other side of a garden. He had met his supporters by that garden until his diagnosis, but no longer.

The new routine marks a stark change for Bolsonaro, who spent months attending rallies with his fans, heading out to bakeries and food trucks to mix and mingle. He sometimes declined to wear a mask. He has scoffed at the restrictions mayors and governors implemented to contain the spread of the virus, arguing their economic impacts would cause more suffering than the virus, which he repeatedly called ""a little flu.""

Bolsonaro took hydroxychloroquine pills for five days, Monday through Friday, according to a member of the presidential medical team who asked to not be identified, citing patient confidentiality and because the person isn't authorized to speak publicly. The drug has no proven effect on the treatment of COVID-19 and can cause side effects such as cardiac arrhythmia, according to medical studies. As a result, Bolsonaro was subjected to electrocardiograms and blood tests, the person said.

Brazil's presidential press office said in a statement that the president has experienced no medical problems with his treatment.

The aide who spoke on condition of anonymity said Bolsonaro slept in a different bedroom to keep the first lady, Michelle Bolsonaro, safe. He lives with her, his daughter and step-daughter.

On Saturday, the first lady shared a photo of her COVID-19 test results showing she was not infected.

""My daughters and I tested negative for COVID-19,"" she wrote in the post on her verified Instagram account. ""I appreciate the prayers.""

On Thursday, Jair Bolsonaro held his weekly live broadcast on Facebook. This time, he was not accompanied by a minister or a sign language interpreter, as usual. Despite saying he felt well, he said he should still be isolated next week, so as to avoid contaminating anyone.

""I'm sorry I can't interact with you here. Not even next week will it be possible, because I think I will not yet be completely free of the virus, so I will not have anyone on my side here,"" Bolsonaro said on the broadcast.

During the broadcast, he wasn't wearing a mask. But the aide said Bolsonaro now regularly wears the equipment to protect both his family and the more than 100 employees who work at the residence.",[]

The unanimous decision by the Chama cha Mapinduzi party to back Magufuli came as no surprise.

The president, nicknamed ""The Bulldozer"" for his relentless work ethic and populist approach, has unsettled critics and some in the international community as his government clamps down on opposition gatherings, arrests opposition leaders and punishes dissent.

His administration's approach to the coronavirus pandemic -- not announcing case numbers since April, questioning face masks and declaring COVID-19 defeated -- has caused further alarm.

Former President Ali Hassan Mwinyi and members of the ruling party have urged Magufuli to try to stay in power after 2025 despite Tanzania's two-term limit. But he has said he won't seek an extension after two terms.

Opposition parties have not declared their official candidate, and they have expressed skepticism with the electoral commission, demanding amendments to ensure the upcoming vote is free and fair.

Ruling party secretary-general Bashiru Ali told the gathering that the National Executive Committee nominated Magufuli because of his commitment to social and economic development and fighting corruption.

Magufuli said he was surprised by the support. ""I never imagined I could get 100%,"" he said. ""This, however, should not mean winning the election by 100% as we have more work to do as a party.""",[]

""We're presuming that an accident happened and we're presuming she drowned in the lake,"" Deputy Chris Dyer said at a news conference Thursday.

Search and rescue efforts for the actress have now shifted to a recovery operation, Dyer said.

""The goal is still to bring Miss Rivera home to her family,"" he said.

Rivera, 33, vanished from Lake Piru on Wednesday evening. She went to the lake that afternoon and rented a pontoon boat with her 4-year-old son, according to authorities.

Dyer said Thursday that the boat was overdue for return around 4 p.m. local time. A rental employee found the boat on the north end of Lake Piru.

Rivera's son was on the boat, but she was nowhere to be found, Dyer said. One life jacket was found on the boat and the boy was wearing another. Investigators found Rivera's purse and her identification, but no other clues on the boat.

Search efforts began immediately and continued until about 10 p.m. Wednesday. The search resumed Thursday morning and will continue until sunset and resume at daybreak if necessary, the sheriff's office said.

Video from the dock shows Rivera and her son as the only two people getting on the boat, Ventura County Sheriff's Sgt. Kevin Donoghue said at a separate news conference.

Detectives have spoken to Rivera's son and as a result of that conversation do not believe Rivera made it to shore, he said.

The boat was not anchored, and was not near the shore when found, the sheriff's office said. The area in which it was found is approximately 30 feet deep.

The lake has very low visibility with numerous plants and trees in the search area, making it unsafe for divers and a more complicated search, according to Donoghue.

""If the body is entangled in something beneath the water, it may never come back up,"" Donoghue said.

Another spokesman for the Ventura County Sheriff's Office, Capt. Eric Buschow, previously said that the child and his mother went swimming and that she did not get back on the boat.

The child is healthy and with family, Dyer said Thursday morning. CNN has reached out to Rivera's representatives for more details.

Rivera's son is ""doing as well as can be expected,"" according to Donoghue. ""Our hearts and our prayers and thoughts go out to the Rivera family. This is a terrible tragedy for all of them and we hope to bring closure for that family,"" he said.

The lake has been closed during the operation, which involves more than 100 people, Donoghue said.

Specialized dive teams from the nearby counties of Tulare, San Luis Obispo, and Los Angeles are also searching the lake. Others are using helicopters, boats and personal watercraft to look for clues.

Searchers are using sonar and other technology to assist in the recovery. For now, the search is focused on the north end of the lake.

""We don't think it would have traveled the whole distance of the lake,"" Donoghue said, explaining that they are looking where the boat was initially found and working their way outward from there.

""I think it's too early to say what happened here. We're still investigating and just still trying to find out what happened,"" he said, noting that Rivera had been to this lake before.

Rivera played Santana Lopez on the Fox show for six years from 2009, and appeared in nearly every episode of the musical-comedy-drama. She was also on the CBS sitcom ""The Royal Family"" and in the comedy film ""The Master of Disguise.""

Fellow celebrities, including her ""Glee"" co-star Harry Shum Jr., shared their concern on social media.

Actress Jackée Harry tweeted a scene she shared with Rivera on ""The Royal Family,"" which was Rivera's first acting job at the age of 4.

""Prayers up for the lovely Naya Rivera,"" Harry tweeted. ""We starred alongside one another in her first very television series, The Royal Family, and I've watched her career blossom ever since. Please God, don't cut this life short.""

Zack Teperman, who described himself as Rivera's former publicist, said he was shocked by the news of her disappearance.

""I still can't believe what I'm hearing and hoping it isn't true,"" he posted on social media. ""I'm just sad. Naya Rivera was one of the first people I had the honor of working with back in 2009 when I got into public relations and moved to Hollywood.

""We're targeting August, maybe early September,"" he said in a recent interview.

""I was even shocked when (the doctor) told me. I met him last week and I asked him for a ballpark time frame. And he said August, and I said 'Oh, OK.' I wasn't quite ready for that.""

Thompson moved to Ontario from British Columbia in April to prepare for the surgery in London. It involves medical and psychological tests, as well as finding a donor.

If things go as planned, Thompson will be Canada's first double-hand transplant patient.

Thompson had all of his limbs amputated after contracting bacterial meningitis and septic shock in 2015.

He left work early one day in May, after feeling like he was coming down with the flu, and decided to sleep it off. A few hours later, he woke up to get a drink of water.

""But when I stood up my feet were like on fire. I could barely walk. I made it downstairs to where my wife Rita was watching TV. And that's pretty well the last thing I remember. I just collapsed on the floor.""

He woke up six weeks later in intensive care, confronted with the choice of dying in palliative care or amputation.

""If I wanted to survive, I would need all four limbs amputated,"" he said.

""In the end, the will to live is stronger than anything else.""

After 8 1/2 hours of surgery, doctors had amputated his limbs.

""That was a difficult time, obviously, because you know, you wake up as a different person. You look down and all you see is bandages ... where your hands used to be or where your legs and feet used to be,"" he said.

""The first thing that came to my mind was, what did I just do?""

After learning about hand transplants two years ago, Thompson met with a team of doctors in Ontario to assess whether he would make a suitable candidate.

""It's life changing,"" he said.

""Being able to shake someone's hand, being able to pick up a cup of coffee with one hand, write your name with a pen, open a door, you know, just the things that we take for granted every day.""

Dr. Steven McCabe, who performed Canada's first hand transplant, may participate in the surgery. He is a hand surgeon at Toronto Western Hospital and an associate professor at the University of Toronto.

The surgery can take 10 to 12 hours with four teams of surgeons. Each team consists of six to 10 people.

While operating on both hands makes the surgery logistically harder because it involves more people, McCabe said it is ""logical"" to do the two transplants at the same time.

""When you transplant, you're introducing this different tissue,"" he explained. ""And the theory behind that is that you don't want to introduce two different donor tissues.""

A person who undergoes a transplant has to take immunosuppressants, so the body doesn't reject the new organ or limb, and it's easier when surgery is done all at once, he said.

""So if you transplanted one limb, and then three months or a year later, the other one, you'd have to go through that again. The idea is to get that all over with one donor.""

But there's also another reason.

""Having one hand when you have none is a huge benefit,"" McCabe said.

""But if you're going to have that type of surgery, and it seems logical to transplant both hands, part of the sense of wholeness is restored. It seems to be very important for patients.""

There are risks associated with the surgery, including infections and the possibility of blood loss. But McCabe said the benefits outweigh the risks, and limb transplants have low rejection rates.

After the surgery, transplant patients face a long recovery, he added.

""If you transplant the limb near the elbow, it will take a few months for the muscles to start to work again, and maybe up to a year or more for the nerves to get down to the fingers to have some feeling,"" McCabe said. ""So, I think we would say, you can't judge whether it's really helped or not for at least a couple years.""

Thompson said unlike most organ transplants, a hand transplant is visible.

""It's physically there. So getting over the mental challenge is going to be the hardest one, because you know they belonged to someone else at one point and now they're on your body,"" Thompson said.

""You have to look at it as a gift ... (the donor) family has decided to give you this gift. And it's a gift I'm not going to waste.""

569,ctvnews,http://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/tories-calling-for-criminal-probe-of-pm-s-ties-to-we-charity-halted-federal-contract-1.5018997,"Tories calling for criminal probe of PM's ties to WE Charity, halted federal contract",['Rachel Aiello'],2020-07-10 11:35:00-04:00,"OTTAWA -- The federal Conservatives are calling for an RCMP investigation into the revelations that members of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s family were paid a total of nearly $300,000 to speak at WE Charity events, the organization that was granted a contract to deliver a now-halted $900 million COVID-19 student grant program.

“That revelation raises need for the police to take a look at it,” Conservative MP and ethics critic Michael Barrett said during a press conference on Friday.

The Conservatives are suggesting there could be criminal implications, but they aren’t sure and want police to investigate. The party has published an “open letter” to RCMP Commissioner Brenda Lucki asking the national police force to determine whether the matter runs afoul of the Criminal Code section on government fraud.

“On the question of if it is criminal, that's for the RCMP to decide,” said Barrett, who authored the letter.

“Federal government proactive disclosures show that the Canada Student Service Grant is not the beginning of WE Charity’s dealings with the federal government. Government records confirm that, since 2017, WE Charity has received seven grants or contributions totalling about $5.2 million, plus another five contracts,” writes Barrett.

“I encourage the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to investigate the possibility of criminal offences arising from these disturbing facts. You and the very able members of the national police force possess the necessary skills, expertise and tools to get to the bottom of this,” he writes.

Bloc Quebecois Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet has called on the prime minister to ""step aside"" until the completion of the ethics commissioner investigation that is already underway, though the Conservatives are stopping short of demanding the same.

Barrett said he wants to wait and see whether a criminal investigation is launched.

“We're not looking to bring down the government on this issue. We're looking to get the truth,” he said.

The Conservatives are calling for all documents related to the contract to be made public, and already MPs have taken steps to dig into the issue using the parliamentary tools available to them, launching two separate studies into the sole-sourced contract with the intent, in part, of calling cabinet ministers to testify.

In an interview on CTV News Channel, Conservative MP and leadership candidate Erin O’Toole said he agrees with his caucus colleagues that “an examination by law enforcement is warranted.”

Fellow leadership hopeful Peter MacKay sent an email to supporters saying he was “deeply troubled” by the story and said Trudeau’s conduct is “part of a pattern as a serial ethical offender,” and potentially “far more” than an ethics breach. He said he supports the police looking into the matter.

“Justin Trudeau has yet to display any sense of contrition, guilt or humility in the face of all of the morally questionable and outright offensive actions he has committed throughout his adult and political life. The list is long, and it's growing,” he said.

WE CHARITY PAID PM'S FAMILY

On Friday, CTV News confirmed that WE Charity paid Trudeau’s mother Margaret Trudeau’s expenses to send her to Kenya in July 2019 to appear at the opening of “WE College.” The costs associated with the trip are estimated at $10,000. Former prime minister Kim Campbell was also in attendance.

On Thursday, WE Charity revealed that Trudeau's mother, Margaret Trudeau, spoke at approximately 28 events and was paid $250,000 in speaking honorariums between 2016 and 2020. The prime minister’s brother, Alexandre Trudeau, spoke at eight events from 2017 to 2018 and was paid a total of approximately $32,000.

More than $60,000 of that money, which WE Charity said is usually administered by corporate sponsors, was paid directly to Margaret Trudeau by the charity as the result of what WE Charity referred to as an ""error"" in billing and payment that was discovered through an “internal review.”

In addition to this, Trudeau's wife, Sophie Gregoire Trudeau — who is an ambassador with the organization and hosts a mental health podcast under its name — received a ""one-time speaking honorarium"" of $1,400 for participating in a youth event in 2012, before Trudeau became leader of the Liberal Party.

The organization said all her other time spent participating in WE events and hosting a podcast series for the charity was ""donated.""

WE Charity said neither they nor ME to WE Social Enterprise have ever paid Justin Trudeau — who has spoken at a number of WE events — for any speeches or other matters.

In an emailed statement sent Thursday, Chantal Gagnon, a spokesperson for the Prime Minister's Office, said Trudeau's relatives ""engage with a variety of organizations and support many personal causes on their own accord.""

Facing questions about what he knew as a member at the cabinet table, Industry Minister Navdeep Bains restated the government position that the advice to go ahead with WE Charities came from the public service.

“Clearly we are going in a different direction right now, but make no mistake, our government and our prime minister are absolutely committed to supporting students,” Bains said.

ETHICS PROBE UNDERWAY

Prior to the family payments being confirmed, Trudeau had already become the subject of an ethics investigation over the matter. The ethics commissioner is investigating a potential conflict of interest over his government's now-cancelled decision to have WE Charity manage a $900-million federal program to set up placements and administer grants to students and new graduates for their volunteer work this summer.

""The Canada Student Service Grant program is about giving young people opportunities to contribute to their communities, not about benefits to anyone else,"" said the PMO in Thursday’s statement.

With the program halted, thousands of students are now in limbo without summer jobs and, for now, no chance for volunteer grants to help cover costs like fall tuition.

The grant to post-secondary students and recent graduates would provide one-time payments of up to $5,000 for volunteering in pandemic-related programs, depending on the number of hours worked. For every 100 hours spent, a student will receive $1,000.

While the charity backed out of the management of the program following days of controversy, Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion said, when confirming the probe, that the Conservatives’ request for an investigation ""satisfies the requirements"" laid out in the Conflict of Interest Act.

The Conservatives have alleged that Trudeau violated a provision in the Act that ""prohibits public office holders from making any decision or participating in the making of a decision that furthers their private interests or improperly furthers the private interests of another person.""

Opposition parties have said that Trudeau had a duty to recuse himself from any discussion or decision relating to the WE Charity, given the prime minister's close ties to the organization and his wife’s involvement, and that Trudeau violated the Act when he announced that WE Charity would administer the Canada Student Service Grant.

Trudeau confirmed on Wednesday that he did not recuse himself from the cabinet discussion on outsourcing the large government program. Asked why, Trudeau said he has “long worked on youth issues” before getting into politics.

He has previously said that the public service told his government that the WE Charity organization was the only group capable of administering the student program.

'A PATTERN OF BEHAVIOUR'

In a statement NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said Friday that the hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments to the trio of Trudeau’s family members is “more than disturbing,” and illustrates a “pattern of behaviour.”

Singh pointed to the fact that this is now the third ethics investigation Trudeau has been subjected to since he became prime minister, with the two previous times resulting in findings that Trudeau had breached federal ethics law.

In December 2017 then-commissioner Mary Dawson found Trudeau broke the federal ethics act when he vacationed at the Aga Khan’s private island over the 2016 Christmas holidays with friends and family. And then in August 2019, Trudeau was found to have broken the federal Conflict of Interest Act in relation to the SNC-Lavalin scandal, by seeking to influence former justice minister and attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould in ""many ways.""

In that report, Dion concluded after months of reviewing ""troubling"" evidence and relevant legal and constitutional principles, that Trudeau contravened section nine of the Act, which states that public office holders are prohibited from using their position to seek to influence a decision that furthers the interest of a private third party.

“The PM, his office and cabinet need to co-operate fully with the ethics commissioner and must waive cabinet confidentiality so the commissioner can truly get to the bottom of this,” Singh said.

“Canadians deserve to know the truth and need to know this won't happen again.""

In an interview on CTV News Channel, Liberal MP Nate Erskine-Smith said that while the contract was eyebrow-raising, he doesn’t think that Trudeau should step aside while the investigation is underway.

“The government rightly listened and walked the program back, now I think the question is squarely focused on this conflict question and that's for the ethics commissioner to pursue… I will follow it closely,” he said.

Now, the NDP are calling for an ethics investigation.

In a statement to CTV News, Morneau’s office said that there is “absolutely no link” between his daughters’ involvements with the charity and “any work that WE does with the Government of Canada.”

The statement confirmed what website Canadaland first reported: that the finance minister’s daughter Clare has spoken at WE events, and his daughter Grace is currently employed by WE Charity.

“Clare has spoken at WE events, as well as many other public events, in the context of the release of her book on young refugee girls. She has never been compensated for that work,” said Maeva Proteau, press secretary for Morneau.

As well, Morneau’s daughter Grace is a “contractual employee of WE in an administrative role in the travel department,” a job she has had since 2019 following her internship, according to Morneau’s office.

“She got this position on her own merits. There is absolutely no link between her employment and any work that WE does with the Government of Canada,” Proteau said.

Proteau confirmed that Morneau did not recuse himself from the discussions about the decision to offload the program meant to administer grants to students and new graduates for their volunteer work this summer.

NDP WANT INVESTIGATION

In light of Morneau’s statement, the New Democrats are calling for Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion to investigate Morneau. In a letter to the commissioner obtained by CTV News, NDP MP and ethics critic Charlie Angus says he thinks the finance minister’s decision to not recuse himself from conversations about outsourcing the program to We Charity merits more scrutiny.

“The Act has clear stipulations that prevent public office holders from making or participating in a decision related to the exercise of an official power, duty or function if the public office holder knows or reasonably should know that, in the making of the decision, he or she would be in a conflict of interest,” writes Angus.

“It would seem apparent that Minister Morneau would recognize that the fact that his family member was an employee of this organization necessitated him to recuse himself regarding this extraordinary decision to outsource nearly billion-dollar commitment of public funds in a single source contract,” Angus writes.

With the program halted, thousands of students are now in limbo without summer jobs and, for now, no chance for volunteer grants to help cover costs like fall tuition. The grant to post-secondary students and recent graduates was set to provide payments that amount to less than minimum wage for volunteering in pandemic-related programs, depending on the number of hours worked. For every 100 hours spent, a student would receive $1,000.

“The recommendation to have WE administer the program came from the public service,” Morneau’s office said.

APPEARED 'TOO CLOSE': LIBERAL MP

With Dion already looking into Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s ties to WE Charity and his decision to not recuse himself from the contract discussions, the Conservatives are now calling for an RCMP probe, and for a full accounting of what all cabinet ministers knew about the extent of the Trudeau family’s connections to the charities. Trudeau’s wife, mother and brother were paid a range of amounts to speak at WE events over the years.

In an interview on CTV News Channel, Liberal MP Nate Erskine-Smith said that while he can’t speak for the state of mind either Trudeau or Morneau were in, he was “skeptical” about how the project was announced.

“I was glad to see the government reverse course in response to feedback… The prime minister and the finance minister appeared to me to be too close to this as far as decision-making goes, but ultimately this is in the hands of the ethics commissioner,” he said.",[]

Current leader Andrew Scheer is in his final weeks in the job.

Party members are now voting for his replacement with the winner to be announced in late August.

Meanwhile, the issue is not going away.

The ethics commissioner has been called in to see if Trudeau broke conflict-of-interest law in awarding a multimillion-dollar contract to the WE organization, given Trudeau's long-standing family ties to the organization.

The commissioner is also being asked to probe Finance Minister Bill Morneau's ties as well -- one of the minister's daughters works for the organization.

The Liberals, and WE, have said there is no direct link between the awarding of the contract to run the $900 million Canada Student Services Grant program and the organization's connections to the Trudeaus.

The Conservatives also say that revelations Trudeau family members have been paid by WE for speaking engagements in the past elevates the seriousness of the matter. The party says the police should investigate for possible fraud.

Trudeau himself was never paid.

Both ethics and criminal investigations take time.

The investigation by the ethics commissioner into the SNC-Lavalin affair was requested in February 2019 and completed in August of that year.

The Senate expenses scandal first broke in 2012 and it took two years for criminal charges related to fraud to surface in that case. Former Conservative senator Mike Duffy was acquitted on all of them in April 2016.

So, given that the Opposition Conservatives will have a new boss while the WE story likely continues to percolate, how will Scheer's replacement seek to proceed?

The Canadian Press asked all four leadership candidates how they would deal with the scandal.

Leslyn Lewis:

The Toronto lawyer said the ethics commissioner has proven himself capable in the past of getting to the bottom of Trudeau's scandals and she trusts him to do that job here as well.

""The problem is that every time the ethics commissioner proves Trudeau has broken the rules, he just shrugs and moves on,"" Lewis said in a statement.

""The only way to hold Justin Trudeau accountable is for voters to vote him out. I look forward to leading the charge and replacing him with an honest and ethical government.""

Lewis does not have a seat in the House of Commons. If she wins, she would have to appoint someone to be the parliamentary leader until she could get elected.

Peter MacKay:

MacKay's wife, Nazanin Afshin Jam, a human rights activist, has spoken at WE events. His campaign says she has never taken money from the organization.

In an interview, MacKay said the WE controversy raises questions about the need to broaden and strengthen the power of the ethics commissioner, so if there's a finding a politician broke conflict of interest law, they could actually be penalized.

He also suggested that a stronger ethics screen might be required for whomever is prime minister to ensure there can be no blurring of lines between a prime minister's private life and public role.

In the meantime, MacKay, a former justice minister, said he thinks a criminal investigation into the WE contract could be warranted under Section 122 of the Criminal Code, which is breach of trust involving government officials.

The purpose of the section is to ensure government officials do not abuse their authority or their office, MacKay said.

By being in the cabinet room when the decision was made, knowing their family connection to WE, is a very serious thing, MacKay said.

""It's essential we keep confidence in public office holders,"" MacKay said. ""This undermines that.""

While it is the kind of issue that could result in a motion of non-confidence in the Liberal government, it's not that simple, MacKay said.

""We can't lose sight of the bigger picture here which is the economic and health crisis that still rages on as a result of COVID-19,"" he said.

""This is going to undermine severely the prime minister's legitimacy and ability to govern throughout this period.""

MacKay also does not have a seat in the House of Commons. What levers of parliamentary power he might want pulled would have to be done by someone else.

Erin O'Toole:

O'Toole has suggested the scandal brings with it the threat of a fall election.

When his campaign was asked whether he would seek to topple the government over it, a spokesperson did not directly answer the question, repeating only that they think the chances of a fall election are higher.

O'Toole supports his party's call for a criminal investigation. In an email, campaign spokesperson Melanie Paradis said that given O'Toole already has a seat in the House of Commons, he would be ready take on Trudeau on this issue from ""day one.""

""As leader, Erin will stand up for Canadians and get to the bottom of this corruption,"" she said. His campaign did not say how he would do that.

O'Toole's children have also attended WE events and he has spoken at one in his riding. His campaign said his family has never financially benefited from WE.

Derek Sloan:

Sloan is also a sitting MP. His campaign did not return two requests for comment on what he would do to address the issue.

The WMO said there was a 20 per cent chance that it will exceed 1.5 C above 1850 to 1900 average levels in at least one year, according to its annual climate predictions for the coming five years.

The last five-year period has been the warmest five years on record, said the Geneva-based United Nations agency, which counts 193 member states.

Temperatures over the next five years, 2020 to 2024, are very likely to be within the range of 0.91 C to 1.59 C above pre-industrial levels.

Almost all regions, except parts of the southern oceans, are likely to be warmer than the recent past, which is defined as 1981 to 2010.

""This study shows -- with a high level of scientific skill -- the enormous challenge ahead in meeting the Paris Agreement on Climate Change target of keeping a global temperature rise this century well below 2 C above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 C,"" said WMO secretary-general Petteri Taalas.

The 2015 Paris accord seeks to limit global temperature rises through sweeping cuts in greenhouse gas emissions.

WETTER SAHEL

The WMO forecasts do not take into account changes in greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions due to the shutdown of economic and industrial activity triggered by the coronavirus crisis.

""Due to the very long lifetime of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the impact of the drop in emissions this year is not expected to lead to a reduction of CO2 atmospheric concentrations which are driving global temperature increases,"" Taalas said.

The planet's average temperature is already more than 1.0 C warmer than the pre-industrial period, the WMO said.

Looking at the five-year period 2020 to 2024, the organisation said there was a 70 per cent chance that at least one month would be 1.5 C warmer than pre-industrial levels.

However, there is only a three per cent chance that the entire period would be 1.5 C warmer than that baseline level.

The northern North Atlantic region could have stronger westerly winds, leading to more storms in western Europe over the next five years.

High latitude regions and the Sahel are likely to be wetter than the recent past, the organisation predicted.

The WMO also said that in 2020 alone, many parts of South America, southern Africa and Australia are likely to be drier than the recent past.

Meanwhile, the Arctic is likely to have warmed by more than twice as much as the global mean.

It said the smallest temperature change was expected in the tropics and in the mid-latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere.",[]
574,ctvnews,http://www.ctvnews.ca/business/canadian-economy-adds-953-000-jobs-in-june-unemployment-rate-falls-1.5018613,"Canadian economy adds 953,000 jobs in June, unemployment rate falls",['Jordan Press'],2020-07-10 04:19:00-04:00,"OTTAWA -- Nearly one million more Canadians had jobs in June, Statistics Canada says, as businesses forced to close by the pandemic began to reopen and the country continued to recoup steep losses over March and April.

Statistics Canada's labour force survey released Friday showed 953,000 jobs were added last month, including 488,000 full-time and 465,000 part-time positions. The unemployment rate fell to 12.3 per cent after hitting a record-high of 13.7 per cent in May.

As in May, even though more people found jobs, more people also looked for work as the labour force grew by about 786,000 after a gain of 491,000 in May, bringing it to within 443,000 of its pre-pandemic level.

Statistics Canada said the unemployment rate would have been 16.3 per cent had it included in unemployment counts those who wanted to work, but did not look for a job.

Job gains were made in every province, including by 378,000 in Ontario, marking the first increase since the COVID-19 shutdown, Statistics Canada said. It didn't include any gains in Toronto as restrictions in that city loosened after the survey week.

Despite the good news, economist Jim Stanford said there remains a historic crisis in the job market with high unemployment and hundreds of thousands who have left the labour force altogether.

Also, gains nationally were not shared equally among groups, with women, youth and low-wage workers still slower to rebound, which Stanford said could be problematic if those jobs don't ever come back.

""I worry about a coming second round of layoffs motivated not by health restrictions, but by companies deciding their businesses are going to be permanently smaller. So that would be qualitatively different and in a way worse,"" said Stanford, director of the Centre for Future Work in Vancouver.

""We aren't remotely out of the woods yet, but this was a really encouraging step forward.""

Some three million jobs were lost over March and April due to the pandemic, and 2.5 million more had their hours and earnings slashed. By last month, some 3.1 million were affected by the pandemic, including 1.4 million who weren't at work due to COVID-19.

Brendon Bernard, an economist at Indeed Canada, said recapturing jobs at the same pace in the coming months will be tougher.

""A lot of areas of the economy still aren't running at full capacity,"" Bernard said. ""So while doors may be open and customers might be coming in, business hasn't come back to normal.""

Despite the overall improvement, the oil and gas industry continues to struggle.

The PetroLMI Division of Energy Safety Canada says direct oil and gas employment fell by more than 6,700 positions in June compared with May, with about 70 per cent of the net job losses in Alberta.

Compared with a year earlier, employment in the oil and employment sector was down 17 per cent.

The overall job losses were unprecedented in speed and depth compared with previous recessions, Statistics Canada said, and the rebound to date sharper than previous downturns.

Ottawa's response has been equally unprecedented: a deficit of at least $343.2 billion this fiscal year as the Trudeau Liberals dole out some $230 billion in emergency aid.

In June, 28.3 per cent of Canadians aged 15 to 69 reported receiving some form of federal aid since mid-March, Statistics Canada said. Meanwhile, the proportion of households reporting difficulty paying the bills dropped to 20.1 per cent in June from 22.5 per cent in May.

""Without the federal government being there to support Canadian workers, Canadian businesses and the Canadian provinces and territories, we would be in a bigger mess in this country right now,"" Hassan Yussuff, president of the Canadian Labour Congress said in an interview this week.

The Bank of Canada and federal government believe the worst of the economic pain from the pandemic is behind the country, but Canada will face high unemployment and low growth until 2021.

In a statement, federal Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough touted the overall jobs numbers as a sign the government's plan was working, before adding many Canadians still ""face real challenges during this time.""

She and other ministers are now reshaping programs so fewer workers stay on the $80-billion emergency benefit, and more get tied to jobs through the $82-billion wage subsidy program.

""We understand the need for those emergency programs. We also understand as we reopen and recover, we have to move away from emergency programs and into stimulus and recovery,"" said Leah Nord, senior director of workforce strategies for the Canadian Chamber of Commerce.

She said there are other issues to resolve around health and safety in the workplace, transit, and child care to help more Canadians get back to work.

In provinces where daycares reopened for children five and under, employment levels returned to pre-pandemic levels for fathers in June, but not for mothers. Similarly, mothers with children under 18 were more likely than fathers to work less than half their usual hours in June, Statistics Canada said.

Job gains have come at a faster clip for men. Their unemployment rate hit 12.1 per cent in June compared to 12.7 per cent for women. And the underutilization rate -- which counts those who are unemployed, those who want a job but didn't look for one, and those working less than half their usual hours -- was 28.3 for women and 25.5 per cent for men.

Economist Armine Yalnizyan said the numbers underscore the need to provide child care as well as options for schooling in the fall so mothers can work.

The alternative, she said, could pull back any economic gains.

""It means that even if there are jobs, some women won't be able to take them because there's no way they can leave their kids,"" said Yalnizyan, a fellow on the future of workers at the Atkinson Foundation.

""So we are looking at the potential for an economic depression instead of talking about paces of recovery and pivoting to building to better.""

Ltd. made their decision to end “pandemic pay” independently of each other, even as the decision was based in part on being aware of what some of their competitors were planning, the chief executives for the companies told the members of Parliament on Friday.

Executives for Canada’s three main grocery chains defended their decision to halt their temporary $2-an-hour wage increase last month, telling a House of Commons committee that there was no “collusion” and that the decision was based on employee workload, the economy re-opening, other retailers opening again, a return to more “normal” business conditions, and lower business volumes.

Lawmakers grilled the executives, questioning the “courtesy” calls and emails that were made and sent between them. This included an email Loblaw president Sarah Davis sent on June 11 to Metro, Empire, and others including Walmart, letting them know the company was planning to end its temporary pay hikes two days later. Metro decided to end theirs on the same day.

Davis had sent a similar email earlier when Loblaw, which owns No Frills, T&T and Valu-Mart as well, decided to initiate a wage increase for its workers.

Eric LaFleche, chief executive at Metro, which operates 950 food stores including Food Basic and Super C, said he did not send emails to any colleagues or competitors regarding the decision to end the temporary wage hike, but he had previously spoken to Davis and Empire CEO Michael Medline on the phone, in compliance with the Competition Act, to ask about their intentions with respect to the temporary bonuses. Both said at the time they were undecided. Medline added that a lawyer was present during his call with LaFleche and that he had declined to discuss the issue further.

“I don’t accept your premise that this was co-ordination, collusion or anything untowards. Everything was above board, within legal boundaries, I can say that wholeheartedly. I have no issue with what we did and what information we got and how we got it,” said LaFleche, who said the calls were to help inform his decisions for the company and its employees, and not any kind of tacit agreement on staff pay.

“We make our own decision based on the information we have, and the more information we have, the more clarity in our decision. When we made our decision, it was our own.”

LaFleche’s comments echoed Medline’s, who said in his opening statement to the committee that he wanted to be “absolutely clear” they did not co-ordinate their decisions. Medline told committee members that the company’s decision to stop the pay premium came before he received Davis’s email, though he did hear Loblaw was considering it. Empire operates Sobeys and Safeway among other banners.

The executives told lawmakers that they also consulted with corporate counsel to ensure that no laws were being violated.

In a series of tense exchanges during the two-hour session, committee members questioned the executives’ decision to halt the pay premium, particularly as dozens of retail and warehouse workers continued to be sick with COVID-19, and a new report that another two grocery store workers tested positive in southern Ontario.

Earlier this week, union leaders representing thousands of grocery employees, told the same committee that the pandemic was not over, and therefore the temporary premiums should also continue.

During questioning, Medline indicated that going forward, if a region were to go into lockdown again, they would offer “hero pay” again, and that he would look into retroactive compensation as well.

In Friday’s meeting, executives -- criticized for their own salary compensations and dividend payouts to shareholders -- said decisions like the installation of plexi-glass barriers in stores were made without consideration to costs and that tens of millions of dollars had been invested to ensure the safety of their store workers during the pandemic.",[]

If there is a word to describe how I feel about the pandemic it is ""sad."" I feel so sad for people who have lost their lives to this horrible disease, people who lost their job, small business owners who have had to close up shop, for those who have had their life savings evaporate and -- when it comes down to it -- anyone who has been impacted in any way.

When the fiscal update highlighted our deficit would run north of $343 billion I didn't panic. I know for now as a country we can afford it. This low interest rate environment helps, the Bank of Canada buying up bonds to provide liquidity helps and Canada continues to fare better than other countries around the globe.

My focus is always on the average Canadian trying to make ends meet and especially those who may have been struggling before the pandemic struck.

Canadians can't take on more debt. They are tapped out. The government can and did and as the PM said, ""we took on debt so Canadians didn't have to"". In my opinion that was a good thing to do. We don't have a playbook when it comes to shutting down the whole economy. In past recessions the money may have stopped but the people didn't.

The challenge is, we aren't through the pandemic and I fear more jobs losses are on the horizon. From a financial perspective, what I worry about most are jobs. As the CERB comes into question come the fall, families will be faced with harsh reality their lives have changed and like any challenging period of time some will be impacted more than others. Some companies will make it and some won't. Some families will rally and others won't.

However, the June jobs report showed a hint of encouragement with almost 1 million jobs created leading me to maybe just maybe believe we could see the ""V"" shaped economy that so many are hoping for. And while the job number surprised to the upside after 3 million jobs were lost in March and April it is still a little too soon to declare a roaring victory. There are 1 3/4 million people still unemployed. Yet, other signs of improvement point to recovery. Areas such as the real estate market in terms of sales and housing starts while vehicle sales exploded higher as well.

The analogy I will use: The patient who has a heart attack, or in this the case the economy that stopped in a heartbeat, is starting to shows signs of stabilizing. But that isn't enough. Like the patient, the economy needs a long-term recovery plan to ensure good health is sustainable.

I'm looking for long-term growth plans to get people back working. Some of the jobs losses will never come back. In my perfect world we would see money going toward new initiatives with new jobs created, supported with training, so families and business can begin to plan again.

In the meantime, I tend to confront the brutal facts while remaining cautiously optimistic we will get through this.

It was the Mercedes driver's record-extending 89th career pole and particularly impressive as he first beat Red Bull driver Max Verstappen's mark and then his own leading mark on his final lap.

""That was awesome,"" Hamilton said after placing 1.216 seconds ahead of Verstappen and 1.398 clear of McLaren driver Carlos Sainz Jr.

""I definitely had my heart in my mouth, but I was able to improve,"" Hamilton said. ""Honestly it was a fantastic lap, that lap was as close to perfect as I could get it in those conditions.""

Verstappen swerved a little on his final lap.

""It could have been better but I don't think it was enough to beat Lewis,"" the Dutch driver said. ""You can't see a thing, it is hard to see the braking zones but that is the same for everyone.""

It was the best career result in qualifying for Sainz -- underlining how McLaren is improving after Lando Norris finished last weekend's race in third place.

""It feels amazing, especially that qualifying was one of the toughest I have done. There was so much aquaplaning it was crazy,"" the Spanish driver said. ""We're completely blind in the car, we don't see what's at the front, what's at the back.""

Hamilton's Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas could only qualify in fourth place after taking pole position and winning last Sunday's Austrian GP.

It was another dismal day for Ferrari, with Sebastian Vettel 10th and Charles Leclerc 11th.

""The main problem was we were just not quick enough,"" Leclerc said. ""We're just too slow.""

Driving rain washed out the third and final practice session at midday and threatened qualifying altogether. But the cars managed to finally get out onto the Red Bull Ring at around 3:45 p.m. local time (1345 GMT) even though rain was still lashing down.

In the event of a complete washout, qualifying would have been moved to Sunday morning.

With drivers told the rain would soon get heavier, they were advised to post a solid time quickly in order to get into the second part of qualifying.

Verstappen said ""I can't see a thing"" and Romain Grosjean slid off track into gravel.

Some unexpected names popped up at the top of the leaderboard, before order was restored as Hamilton, Bottas and Verstappen swapped leading times.

""Leave me to it,"" Hamilton said over radio, trying to keep his concentration with water spraying everywhere in front and around him.

With two minutes left in Q1, Italian driver Antonio Giovinazzi lost control of his Alfa Romeo and it swerved sideways and then backward into a crash barrier. His car had to be lifted off the track.

The rain fell so heavily throughout the morning that firefighters had to remove excess water from the roof of one empty hospitality building. The race is being held without fans because of the coronavirus pandemic.

The race is changing names from last week but is still being held at the same track in Spielberg, which is surrounded by the Styrian mountains.",[]

The Los Angeles Lakers superstar won't wear one of the NBA-approved social justice messages on the back of his jersey when the NBA resumes competition later this month in the Orlando bubble.

""It was no disrespect to the list that was handed down to all the players,"" James said Saturday in a confernece call from Florida. ""I commend anyone that decides to put something on the back of their jersey. It's just something that didn't seriously resonate with my mission, with my goal.""

As part of the NBA's recognition of the nationwide invigoration of the social justice movement sparked by the death of George Floyd, NBA players are allowed to choose from a lengthy list of possible messages for their jerseys during the league's restart. James is among just a few who declined to choose one of the messages, he said.

""I would have loved to have a say-so on what would have went on the back of my jersey,"" James said. ""I had a couple of things in mind, but I wasn't part of that process, which is OK. ... Everything that I do has a purpose, has a meaning. I don't need to have something on the back of my jersey for people to understand my mission or know what I'm about and what I'm here to do.""

The 35-year-old superstar has a long history of social involvement and advocacy for progressive causes. James speaks frequently of what he feels is a responsibility to campaign for positive social change from his powerful position in sports and pop culture.

""This is the mission I've been on for a long time now,"" James said. ""It's great that a lot of people's ears are opening. A lot of people are understanding, a lot of people are recognizing. A lot of people still don't get it, and a lot of people are still afraid to talk about the racism that goes on in America, especially for our people. ... But we have some ears, and we will continue to push the envelope and let everyone know that we are human as well. We don't want to be just be used for our God-given abilities.""

JaVale McGee, the Lakers' veteran centre, said he will wear ""Respect Us"" on his jersey in Orlando.

""It's a blessing to have this platform,"" said McGee, whose asthma has him being particularly cautious during the pandemic. ""We have way more of a voice playing basketball ΓÇª Our fans are basketball fans over anything. This is the biggest platform we can speak about social injustices. That's the best time to talk about it.""

James also said he didn't consider not playing in the NBA's restart, believing the league can be a positive force through its visibility and competition. He expressed no concerns for his health inside the bubble.

""I believe the NBA and (Commissioner) Adam Silver, they took all precautionary measure to make sure that we as a league are as safe as we can be,"" James said. ""Obviously, in anything that you do, there can be things that can happen, so we will cross that line if it happens. But we're doing everything to make sure everyone stays safe during this pandemic. Adam Silver has given me no reason to not believe him since he took over. I have no concerns. I'm here 100% and in great health.""",[]
580,ctvnews,http://www.ctvnews.ca/sports/nhl-players-take-collaborative-approach-in-bid-to-resume-1.5020612,"NHL, players take collaborative approach in bid to resume",['John Wawrow'],2020-07-11 18:47:00-04:00,"Collaboration or bust.

Given the gravity of the new coronavirus pandemic and the abrupt decision to place the NHL season on pause in March, it didn't take commissioner Gary Bettman and union chief Don Fehr long to realize they were going to have to work together if play was to resume any time soon.

Nearly four months to the day since the last puck dropped, the two sides put aside past differences to have a return-to-play plan in place, and the assurance of labour peace through September 2026 to go with it.

“When we got to March 12 and decided to take the pause, that began a period of perhaps unprecedented collaboration and problem solving,” Bettman said during a Zoom conference call with reporters Saturday, a day after the league and players ratified a 24-team expanded playoff, set to begin Aug. 1, and a four-year extension of the collective bargaining agreement.

“It was a recognition by both sides that we were being confronted with an incredibly difficult, a novel, unprecedented situation. I believed we would get to this point because it was the right thing to do for the game and for everybody involved in the game.”

Fehr, the NHL Players' Association executive director, not only agreed with Bettman, but went out of his way to credit the owners for the approach

“I was persuaded well before the end of March that not only was this different, but it was being approached in a fundamentally different way. I always thought we would find a way to reach an agreement,” Fehr said.

The bond established between the two was apparent during the 55-minute session, with Fehr agreeing with Bettman and then acknowledging how unusual that was by by saying: “I think that indicates something about the approach that was taken in these talks.”

Training camps are set to open Monday, which also represents the deadline for players to determine whether to opt out without penalty. If all goes as planned, teams will depart for their two respective hub cities, Toronto and Edmonton, Alberta, on July 26 to open a two-month playoff leading to the awarding of the Stanley Cup.

Many uncertainties remain, with Bettman and Fehr unable to provide definitive answers.

While acknowledging the likelihood of players testing positive for COVID-19, deputy commissioner Bill Daly was unable to say how many players would have to do so for the league to postpone or cancel the playoffs altogether.

Though conference playoffs and Stanley Cup Final are scheduled to be held in Edmonton, a person with direct knowledge of the plans told The Associated Press the site might change if the pandemic spikes in Alberta's capital. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because it is an alternate plan that's not been discussed publicly.

Bettman and Daly, who are based in New York, weren't even sure if or when they could cross the border to personally attend games because those entering Canada are required to self-isolate for a 14-day period.

The only certainty is the NHL became North America's latest professional sport to forge a path back to playing, but minus the public hiccups experienced by its counterparts.

Major League Baseball's season was nearly scuttled before the two sides agreed to a 60-game format. Less than three weeks before NFL training camps are set to open, the league is experiencing push-back from its players on whether to play preseason games next month. Major League Soccer has had two teams already withdrawing from competition because of the number of players testing positive for the coronavirus.

And not only is hockey on the verge of returning, the CBA extension assures 12 straight years of labour peace, the NHL's longest stretch since Bettman took over in 1993. During that time, play has been halted three times by lockouts, the last in 2012-13, when the season was shortened to 48 games.

“I think Don and I both recognize labour peace was something we couldn't even quantify how important it was,” Bettman said. “But we both knew that for the business of the game to come back strong, there was enough disruption going on in the world that we didn't have to add to it.”

Fehr said the months-long talks to reach a solution were a matter of perseverance.

“This is a very bad analogy, but you have to sort of navigate the kayak in a storm until the storm's over, and then make sure the kayak isn't full of holes so that you can go on and sail it in calmer seas,” Fehr said in a separate interview with The AP. “Or to put it another way there was never any pretense that this was business as usual.”

Owners benefit because they can generate much-needed revenue through sponsorships and advertising, even though games will be played in empty arenas.

Though players will likely lose a portion of their salaries for seasons to come to make up for 50-50 split of revenue, they benefit from a CBA that includes the possibility of returning to the Olympics, after the NHL opted out from the 2018 Winter Games in South Korea. The new labour agreement also addressed players' demands to gain a post-career subsidy for health care.

581,ctvnews,http://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/have-you-visited-these-unesco-sites-some-say-aliens-have-1.5017091,Have you visited these UNESCO sites? Some say aliens have,['Jen Rose Smith'],2020-07-09 08:57:00-04:00,"Erich von Däniken dried his sweaty palms with granite dust as he scaled the Great Pyramid of Giza, crawling block by block up the nearly 4,000-year-old monument.

It was 1954, when you could still climb the pyramids. Von Däniken, a 19-year-old with a Catholic education and a passion for flying saucers, was captivated. Fourteen years later, he published an influential book called ""Chariots of the Gods,"" arguing that extraterrestrials influenced ancient sites, the pyramids included.

The magnificent Giza Pyramids are among the world's most famous ancient places, part of a sprawling UNESCO World Heritage Site that brings travelers to Egypt from across the globe.

Visitors come to explore hidden burial chambers, go eye-to-eye with the mysterious Sphinx and take in the sheer scale of Egypt's grandest monuments.

Von Däniken proposed that aliens offered technological help in building them.

WHAT THE SCIENTISTS SAY ABOUT THESE FAMOUS PLACES

Mainstream archeologists disagree with Von Däniken, retorting that ancient Egyptians developed their remarkable building tradition with no help from extraterrestrials.

But while scientists are generally united in rejecting the aliens idea, sometimes known as ""ancient astronaut theory,"" Von Däniken's ideas have endured.

He went on to write 32 additional volumes, selling more than 63 million copies. Penguin Random House, his publisher, claims Von Däniken is ""arguably the most widely read and most-copied nonfiction author in the world.""

And the pyramids aren't the only UNESCO site swept up in his theories, or in those of people he's inspired.

Some speculate that the UNESCO site of Teotihuacan, where the Aztec kings once ruled near modern-day Mexico City, could have been a space port, pointing to mica and liquid mercury found among the ruins that they say are anachronistic.

For travellers, Teotihuacan is a glimpse into an ancient, mysterious empire. Researchers believe the city predates even the Aztecs, who were living there when Europeans first arrived in Mexico.

Archeologists, who have carried out painstaking excavations here for centuries, see it as the crowning achievement of a little-known -- but earthbound -- civilization.

Instead of peering up toward space, they dig into the ground. Archaeologists have spent years excavating a tunnel at Teotihuacan, which leads to chambers full of ritual offerings that some believe symbolize the underworld.

Nearly 3,000 miles away is another enigmatic UNESCO site that draws travellers, researchers and alien enthusiasts alike.

At the Nazca Lines geoglyphs in Peru, visitors take sightseeing flights to view earthen shapes that are too massive to appreciate from ground level. For decades, some have conjectured that the shapes are some sort of ancient airport.

Peruvian scientists agree that the Nazca Lines are mysterious, but believe they are linked instead to rituals and water.

In recent years, researchers have used satellite imagery to discover more than 140 additional geoglyphs, carefully poring over data to find patterns in the landscape.

""They were not drawn by aliens, that's for sure,"" expert Javier Puente told CNN.

TEACHING AN ALTERNATIVE TO ANCIENT ASTRONAUTS

Archeologist Sarah Parcak teaches a seminar on debunking archeological myths and hoaxes at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.

In the class, she pushes back on theories about ancient aliens like those proposed by Von Däniken. She sees it as important work.

""The belief that aliens built the pyramids, or in fact any ancient monument, is deeply racist,"" Parcak says. It's no coincidence that alien theories focus on places home to black, brown and Indigenous people, she notes.

Not only that, Parcak thinks that aliens are a distraction from the real wonders of archaeology. ""It's not a mystery, it's a puzzle. And puzzles take time to put together,"" says Parcak.

One example of Parcak's step-by-step detective work is the city of Itjtawy in Egypt. It was missing for thousands of years, but Parcak found it by analyzing satellite images and NASA topography data.

Sometimes, piecing together archeological puzzles feels personal.

At Parcak's very first excavation, in the Egyptian Delta site of Mendes, she made a discovery that's fresh in her mind more than 20 years later.

""I found an intact pot that was kind of mashed, but we put it back together,"" she recalls. On the handle, Parcak could make out a clear fingerprint left behind in once-wet clay.

""In that moment, I could imagine the person who made it,"" she says. ""It kind of helps us to bridge the divide between past and present and create a sense of empathy.""

Parcak's work offers a personal contact with the past, but you don't need an archeology degree to connect with the ancient world.

On UNESCO-listed Easter Island, travelers can learn how ancient islanders cooked in earthen ovens and built stone-walled gardens. (Easter Island is a favorite with alien theorists, too. Archaeologists chalk up the island's remarkable stonework to Polynesian ingenuity.)

At the temple of Dendera, part of a sprawling UNESCO site in Upper Egypt, visitors follow vivid stories and myths on brilliant wall paintings. (Dendera? Also popular with alien theorists, who interpret one wall painting as proof the ancient Egyptians had electric light bulbs. Researchers say the painting is of a pillar and a lotus flower.)

WHY LEARNING ABOUT ANCIENT HUMANS MATTERS

Learning about ancient humans is fun, but Parcak says it's important, too. For travellers and researchers alike, exploring the ancient world can shed light on the present day -- and maybe the future.

In early April, Parcak was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship to write a book about collapse and resilience in the ancient world. Coronavirus, she says, has lent a new urgency and relevance to the work.

""It's like everything we study is happening in real time,"" she says. Now, she hears echoes of ancient strife whenever she turns on the news. ""The headlines we're seeing, it's like they could be archeology articles.""

For Parcak, though, visiting these ancient sites can be a source of hope. Itjtawy, the ancient city Parcak discovered using satellite imagery, is an example.

It became the capital of the Egypt after a period of widespread political instability, civil war and drought. The Old Kingdom, whose rulers built some of the greatest pyramids, had fallen.

But as power structures shifted, greater economic equality emerged. And from tomb decor to storytelling, Parcak says the area she studies represents a flourishing after chaos.

""I'm not saying it's always rosy,"" she cautions. ""But the site itself is a real symbol of what can happen after great turmoil.""",[]

Golf Canada reports that there were 17 per cent more scores registered with the national sport body this June compared to the same month last year.

A total of 1,483,506 scores were submitted to Golf Canada's handicap calculator last month compared to 1,271,782 in June 2019.

That ended a streak of three months when recreational rounds played in Canada dropped precipitously due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

As restrictions were lifted across the country in May, the number of scores registered increased.

In May, 165,026 people registered their scores between the 1st and the 15th but 265,480 submitted scores in the final two weeks of that month.

The May 1-15 numbers are a nearly 40 per cent drop from the same period in 2019 (211,809) but the May 16-30 numbers are just five per cent lower than last year (269,266).

The upward trend comes even as Golf Canada had to cancel all of its amateur and professional championships due to travel restrictions put in place to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.

A shift in how scores are registered has also been seen, with most recreational players entering their scores online instead of in the course's clubhouse or pro shop, which have largely been closed this summer because of physical distancing protocols.

Golf Canada plans to launch an updated version of its scoring app later this month, helping to keep players physically distant and improve their game.

However, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, many festivities and events have been forced to take place online. But despite dreams of grand and flashy parades being deferred, organizers say the upcoming celebrations may be more important than ever in delivering their message.

""The [Halifax] Pride Festival has always been more than just a parade or those big gatherings,"" says Halifax Pride Board chair, Morgan Manzer. ""It's an opportunity for us to remember our shared history and remember what we're fighting for in the future because there are still a lot of folks who are feeling left behind.""

Halifax Pride Festival begins on Thursday, and while there will be some in-person events – which will adhere to physical distancing protocol – most festival events have shifted online.

Adapting To The Times

It's been a difficult adjustment, but staff say challenges are nothing new.

""Since we had our first protest march here in Halifax in 1988 – 75 people walking down Brunswick Street, some with bags on their heads – this festival has constantly been evolving to meet the needs and serve the queer community,"" says Manzer.

In New Brunswick, festivities began on Friday with pride flags being raised in Moncton, Saint John and Fredericton. The three cities have joined forces to host the first Pride NB celebration.

""Instead of doing three smaller virtual Pride weeks, let's pool our resources and our talent and put on a bigger Pride festival than New Brunswick has ever seen,"" says Saint John Pride president, Michael Cummings, explaining the decision to band together.

Pride NB will feature film screenings, educational workshops, art shows, bingo, and trivia over live streams and video chat. While they can't gather in person, organizers say the message of Pride is more important than ever.

""It's about making sure that people who are marginalized have room and space to see each other, and still celebrate the fact that we exist and do it safely,"" says River of Pride president, Zivi Richard. ""So, there will still be parties, but they will be from your home.""

Community Support

With the absence of many group gatherings, organizers say individuals' need for community and support has increased.

""During a pandemic like this, maybe they're isolating with family members or roommates who may not recognize their gender or sexual orientation,"" says Cummings. ""So, it's especially important during this time that we continue with our pride celebrations and education to show them that they're not alone.""

2020 Pride festivals also have special significance in relation to recent social uprisings, including Black Lives Matter – which echoes the roots of the Pride movement.

""Pride was founded by riots because people were facing police brutality for being LGBTQ,"" says Richard. ""I think those sentiments are still present. So, making sure you can find other people like you is really securing, it feels safe to find your people.""

Richard notes for some individuals, the intersectionality of their identities presents unique challenges.

""LGBTQ people, who are white, live homophobia in one way, but when you're racialized, it's a completely different type – it's layered,"" says Richard.

Richard also notes LGBTQ individuals face various other problems that affect them more than other groups of people.

""LGBTQ people live with disproportionate mental health issues, suicide, drug addiction, homelessness,"" says Richard. ""So, making sure that we build communities that see each other, that's the core of why Pride exists.""

Come One, Come All

Meanwhile, Pride organizers across the Maritimes hope their message of communal support and unity will continue to bring people together – even if they have to stay apart.

""You'll meet new people and make new friends – even if it's online,"" says Cummings. ""So, we really encourage everyone to tune in to as many events as possible.""",[]

JOHN'S, N.L. -- Cool temperatures didn't stop hundreds of dog walkers, bikers and diners from flocking to St. John's, N.L.'s main downtown street Wednesday evening.

Friends waved to each other across Water Street and approached newly built patio decks to chat, as residents of Newfoundland and Labrador's capital basked in the product of a long-discussed vision that's been fast-tracked by city officials during the pandemic: a pedestrian-only downtown.

""The city really got this right this time. We're very happy,"" Dick Barter, co-owner of Green Door restaurant, said while working on his establishment's patio.

Barter, like other business owners on the colourful downtown strip, said he's advocated for closing the street to cars for years.

Less than a week after the July 3 launch, Barter said he's noticed an increase in business and his customers seem happy to be outside sharing a drink and a meal after staying home for months under restrictions meant to beat back the spread of COVID-19.

With one active case of the illness reported in the province, many restrictions on daily life have been lifted, and in June the capital city green-lit the pedestrian mall on Water Street to support struggling businesses reopening with new limits on capacity.

The experiment will run from July 3 until Sept. 7, closing four blocks of Water Street from noon to 10 p.m. each day, with picnic tables and other seating installed along the route.

Barter noted that businesses had just a few weeks to complete paperwork for their outdoor expansions, but he said the result has been worth it.

Water Street is one example of how cities are making quick changes to support businesses and cooped-up city dwellers in a physically-distanced world where outdoor public space is at a premium.

Cities around the world have introduced similar experiments since the pandemic began, closing some streets to cars and hastily expanding cycling routes, as Toronto mayor John Tory pledged to do in May.

In St. John's, many hope the transformation on Water Street will become an annual fixture -- including Liberal Finance Minister Tom Osborne, who has predicted tough times ahead for the province's already troubled economy.

Osborne had a front row seat to the new Water Street during his outdoor meal at The Merchant Tavern Wednesday. ""It's nice to see the economy start to take shape again,"" he said.

Osborne said he's happy with the outcome that he said resembles the bustling outdoor dining spaces he's admired in other Atlantic Canadian cities that rely heavily on tourist dollars in the summer.

""I hope it lives beyond this year because it does bring more people downtown and it's not only good for the hospitality industry but some of the shops down here may benefit as well,"" he said.

Osborne wasn't the only familiar face on the street Wednesday. Musician Alan Doyle of Great Big Sea fame was impressed by the turnout as he wandered to find a seat. ""It's fantastic, I'm glad to be down here,"" Doyle said. ""I can't believe this is the first year it happened in my lifetime.""

A handful of people were wearing face masks but most had their faces uncovered, including waiters at a number of the busy restaurants. People recognized friends and talked standing close together, but for the most part people appeared to stick to their social groups.

Kelly Whittle spent the evening on Water Street with two girlfriends. The group said it was exciting to see the downtown changed into a vacation-like destination with enough room to safely spread out.

Although it's been lauded as a success by residents and politicians, the modifications to Water Street are still being tweaked after some pointed out the changes didn't consider the needs of residents with reduced mobility.

In Facebook post shared widely this week, Lisa Walters posted 48 photos of herself outside downtown spaces she was unable to enter in her wheelchair. She wrote that the new patios and tables on the street made it more challenging for her to navigate the space.

""The glaringly obvious thing to me was how sad it was that so many businesses could build these elaborate patios overnight, and still not have small wheelchair ramps into their stores or restaurants,"" Walters wrote.

Mayor Danny Breen was one of the many people who commented on Walters' post, saying city staff would review the issues she raised. Walters said in a Facebook message that a subsequent conversation with the mayor left her ""hopeful that some changes will actually be made.""

A Friday news release from the city acknowledged room for accessibility improvements, and discussed a plan to develop a program to install ramps. ""It is important to recognize that this is just the beginning,"" Breen's statement said.

RCMP were called to a home on Howard Avenue shortly after 4 p.m. on Thursday, responding to a report of an armed man, who was uttering threats.

""When we arrived on scene, we located the man who was the subject of that complaint, a 60-year-old from that area,"" said Cpl. Jennifer Clarke. ""He was outside of the home with a handgun when we found him.""

RCMP say officers tried to de-escalate the situation, but they were unsuccessful.

""Police on scene did try to verbally engage the individual who was the subject of the complaint, and that means speaking with him, trying to get him to drop the weapon, things like that,"" said Clarke. ""When the individual raised the handgun at police, they fired and the individual died at the scene unfortunately.""

RCMP won't say how many officers fired at the man or how many times he was shot.

""The matters been referred to SIRT, so the RCMP is not able to provide any more information on the incident itself. We'll await the outcome of that investigation and proceed from there,"" said Clarke.

The Serious Incident Response Team or SIRT is responsible for investigating all serious incidents in Nova Scotia involving police and are working to piece together what happened.

The man's death is the third fatal police-involved shooting in the Maritimes in less than six weeks.

On June 4, Chantel Moore was killed by Edmundston Police during a wellness check. Eight days later, on June 12, Rodney Levi, was shot and killed by New Brunswick RCMP near Miramichi, N.B.

""Anytime there's a shooting, and anytime somebody dies, it's concerning. It's a serious matter obviously,"" said legal expert Wayne MacKay.

The name of the man killed in Eastern Passage has not been released. Those who knew the man did not wish to do an interview, but expressed shock at his death.

While MacKay can't speak to any specific case, he says good policing should be to only use deadly force as a last resort.

""I do think it's very important obviously that when we have what turns out to be deadly encounters with the police that we do everything we can to ensure that the police are well trained to do everything in their power to try to de-escalate the situation as much as possible, to obviously, only use deadly force as a final and last resort and, again, that may have happened here,"" said MacKay.",[]

""It's incredibly tough, because I've essentially spent the last four months in isolation, at work and then at home,"" said oilfield worker Adam Wiseman. ""It's really no life.""

Wiseman lives in Glace Bay, but travels to Alberta for work. He's there for 10 days, and then home for 10, but with COVID-19, any time spent at home is in isolation because of the 14-day rule.

""I had to go home and try to explain to my three children at home, that don't get too close to daddy,"" Wiseman said. ""How do you explain to three children that there's a global pandemic?""

With the Atlantic bubble, and easing of restrictions, most people are getting to see family and friends.

Wiseman wants the government to test workers as soon as they arrive home and says he's tried to address his concerns with his local MLA, but there's been no response.

""Why are we not able to be tested when we come home from work,"" Wiseman said. ""If we're able to be tested, then we can isolate while waiting for results. If it comes back positive then we quarantine, and if the test comes back negative, I don't see why we can't follow public health protocols like the rest of the population.""

According to an email from the province, workers who are asymptomatic, with low risk of exposure because of the settings they have been in and their adherence to public health measures, can have contact with other people in their household, but must not leave the home or property.

When results are negative, the province says it does not guarantee a person won't become positive the next day or within the next 14 days.

""It just seems like we've been forgotten about,"" Wiseman said. ""While they try to progress the economy and let people into the province with the Atlantic bubble, we haven't been addressed.""

It happened last weekend in the Tower Hill area which is about 17 kilometres northeast of St. Stephen.

""Two children had discovered a raccoon in a yard that was acting abnormally docile,"" said Dr. Steven Scott, a veterinary pathologist in Fredericton. ""They handled the raccoon. The raccoon did not bite, scratch or lick the children but the children were treated appropriately.""

After the incident, the young raccoon was captured and euthanized.

This marks the first confirmed case of raccoon-variant rabies in New Brunswick this year, according to the government website.

""What's interesting because it's the county that's closest to Maine, and Maine has a very different rabies management program than we do here,"" said Joe Nocera, a forestry and environmental management professor at the University of New Brunswick. ""So, we generally don't have raccoon rabies available in the population at any given time but it can come in from the U.S.""

For many years now, the province has been conducting an oral rabies vaccination program distributing baits both by air and hand to vaccinate raccoons and skunks.

That program will continue in the western and southern parts of the province this summer.

""The hand-baiting is scheduled to start next week and that will continue to about the middle of August, late August and the aerial rabies vaccine bait campaign will take place on the week of Aug. 10 through Aug. 16,"" said Dr. Scott.

Nocera says that program is essential for keeping rabies under control.

""Particularly where we have such a close neighbour in Maine where their vaccine keeps only a proportion of the population vaccinated, we run the risk of having it cross the border regularly,"" Nocera said from Fredericton. ""So the pre-baiting program or the aerial drop program with the edible baits, that's probably our best line of defence.""",[]

It can be difficult, but one home is trying to make it easier for families as they wait for restrictions to be relaxed further.

Early on during the pandemic, York Care Centre in Fredericton came up with the concept of drive-through visits, giving residents and families a window they can use to visit, without breaking isolation.

""We're constantly working as a team trying to figure out what else can we do? What ways can we be creative to bring families together and reduce social isolation and depression,"" said Lori McDonald, the VP of care and research services at York Care Centre.

It's been a balancing act to ensure residents' physical and mental safety, McDonald says.

In June, residents were allowed indoor visits with one designated loved one.

It was a welcome change, but one that comes with challenges.

""We have residents in here who are younger, or maybe have some cognitive delays, so both parents have been involved in their lives, and it's really hard for those parents to have to pick between the two of them, who gets to come in and be with, there, you know -- still their child, it doesn't matter how old they are,"" McDonald said.

Vitalite Health Network changed its visitor policy this week and is now allowing patients to see more of their loved ones -- but only one at a time.

Horizon Health Network has been doing the same.

These are changes that need to be made carefully, Dr. Jennifer Russell cautioned last Friday.

""Continuing to keep in mind that the vulnerable populations who were vulnerable before the pandemic … that those continue to be the part of the population that we need to be most concerned about,"" said the province's chief medical officer of health.

Visitors who are not designated at York Care can still see their loved ones outside or in the drive-through.

But McDonald says she understands that families feel that's not enough.

""It's like being told you can't see the person you love the most in the world, and you don't know when you're going to get to see them again, and so just to understand where they're coming from and as a team just try to put the parameters in place that will keep people safe but also alleviate some of that,"" McDonald said.

She says they are looking forward to a time when restrictions relax a little more, but there's no telling when that might be.",[]

The Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police is proposing increased access to health care, treatment and social services to divert people away from the criminal justice system.

This would apply to people possessing a small amount of illicit drugs for personal consumption.

The Trudeau government has already legalized recreational use of marijuana with the goal of keeping pot out of the hands of young people and denying profits to organized criminals.

Canada continues to grapple with the fentanyl crisis and a poisoned drug supply that has devastated communities and taken thousands of lives, said Chief Const. Adam Palmer of Vancouver, the association president.

""We recommend that enforcement for possession give way to an integrated health-focused approach that requires partnerships between police, health care and all levels of government.""

The chiefs say diversion would improve the health and safety outcomes for drug users while reducing property crime, repeat offences and the demand for drugs in communities.

They urge creation of a national task force to research drug policy reform, specifically looking at section 4(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, covering simple possession.

Enforcement and judicial efforts must continue to target trafficking and the illegal production and importation of drugs to choke off the supply of harmful substances coming communities, the chiefs say.

But the traditional role of frontline policing has fundamentally shifted to harm reduction when interacting with people experiencing addiction or mental-health problems, Palmer said in a statement.

""Frequently, our officers are the point of first contact and the ones who will assist individuals in accessing appropriate services and pathways of care.""

The chiefs' recommendations flow from the findings of a special committee to study the decriminalization of illicit drugs and its impact on public safety.

""We must adopt new and innovative approaches if we are going to disrupt the current trend of drug overdoses impacting communities across Canada,"" the committee report says.

""Merely arresting individuals for simple possession of illicit drugs has proven to be ineffective. Research from other countries who have boldly chosen to take a health rather than an enforcement-based approach to problematic drug use have demonstrated positive results.""

Cormier has been trying to make up for the loss of live concerts, with a roster of online performances.

But he says the lack of high-speed internet in his area, something he has called ""dismal,"" is making it increasingly difficult to keep up with the rest of the connected world.

He recently invested in the extra cost of an LTE hub, which turns cell signal into Wi-Fi to try to beef up his sluggish internet service. That service normally provides him with upload speeds well below the federal CRTC minimum standard of 10 Mbps.

But his LTE hub can only get a good signal while balanced precariously on the railing on the front deck of his studio.

""So when the weather changes,"" Cormier says, ""We're done; no more internet.""

His frustration has led Cormier to become a representative plaintiff in an intended proposed class-action lawsuit against the municipality of Halifax, the province of Nova Scotia, and Develop Nova Scotia. Develop Nova Scotia is the Crown corporation tasked with the job of getting the province's rural internet up to speed, with a $193 million budget to get the job done.

""And when Develop Nova Scotia is touting a certain level and not delivering,"" says Cormier, ""and still spending the money anyway, that's not acceptable.""

Cormier's lawyer, Rob Pineo of Patterson Law, has served the intended defendants with the 60-day notice required before the proposed lawsuit is filed in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in an application to be certified.

With the matter before the courts, none of the intended defendants would comment on the proposed lawsuit.

But a spokesperson with Develop Nova Scotia did respond in an email to overall concerns about high-speed internet service in rural areas.

""Our ISP partners are moving as fast as they can to build these new networks,"" writes Develop NS marketing and communications manager Deborah Page. ""We recognize it can't come soon enough, but we are working hard to make it happen as quickly as possible.""

Cormier takes issue with the performance of some of those internet service providers so far.

""The mandate (of Develop Nova Scotia) says all of those partners have to be vetted (to be) providing a 50 (Mbps) down, 10 (Mbps) up service,"" says Cormier. ""Twelve of those companies have never provided that type of service, ever.""

Page says Cormier's community, Cooks Brook, is on the list for improvements, with an update to come next month after a second round of proposals to address underserved communities.

Cormier says the province has already been far too slow to provide high-speed internet to those whose livelihoods depend on it, now more than ever.",[]

Not a complete washout though and the rain certainly could have been much heavier had Tropical Storm Fay moved in more directly.

On Friday afternoon, Tropical Storm Fay was located just off the coast of Delaware. It looks very likely that Fay will make a landfall in the state of New Jersey as early as Friday night. From there, Fay will move north through the state of New York and towards the Eastern Townships of southern Quebec. As it does so, it will combine with an approaching cold front from the west. This will likely result in the heaviest of the rain occurring along a line from Delaware into southern and western Quebec. Note that the area of heaviest rain associated with a tropical storm is most commonly seen on the western side of the track.

While that area of greatest rainfall potential is west of the Maritimes, the proximity of the two weather systems will be enough to bring us some wet weather this weekend. It is already very humid and tonight that humidity is likely to take the form of fog and patchy drizzle. Patchy drizzle will continue towards noon on Saturday for parts of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. A broken area of rain follows developing for western New Brunswick and Nova Scotia on Saturday afternoon. The rain fills in across New Brunswick and mainland Nova Scotia on Saturday evening. Rain and drizzle will reach Prince Edward Island and Cape Breton on Saturday night.

While still highly variable, the swath of heaviest rain that could exceed 50 mm will be just to the west of the expected track of Tropical Storm Fay.

For the Maritimes, the highest rain potential looks to be on the Bay of Fundy coastline of New Brunswick and the Atlantic coastline of Nova Scotia. There will be pockets of 15 to 30 mm for those areas and a general 5 to 15 mm is expected for the remainder of the Maritimes. Note that there is some tropical moisture tied up in this rain, so isolated downpours and thunderstorms will be possible. The initial band of rain clears early Sunday morning, but intermittent showers and drizzle look likely to linger in our region through the day Sunday.

In some periods of rain and drizzle this weekend amounts of 5 to 15 mm with pockets of 15 to 30 mm look likely. There is tropical moisture tied up in the rain so some embedded downpours or thunderstorms are a risk.

Southerly winds will get gusty at times this weekend. General gusts of 20 to 50 km/h forecast for Saturday. Gusts as high as 40 to 60 km/h on Sunday. The southerly direction of the winds along with the rain in the forecast will keep humidity levels high in the Maritimes straight through into the start of next week.

597,ctvnews,https://atlantic.ctvnews.ca/north-atlantic-right-whales-nearing-extinction-international-nature-body-says-1.5018284,"North Atlantic right whales nearing extinction, international nature body says",['Mia Rabson'],2020-07-09 20:51:00-03:00,"OTTAWA -- North Atlantic right whales are now considered one step away from complete eradication.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature is moving the whales from ""endangered"" to ""critically endangered"" on its red list of global species facing threats to their survival.

The only step beyond ""critically endangered"" is extinction.

Fewer than 250 mature whales were known to exist at the end of 2018, in a total population of only about 400.

More than 30 whales have been killed by ships or fishing gear entanglements in the last three years, two-thirds of them in Canadian waters.

The conservation group classified right whales as endangered in 2008, and since then the population has declined more than 15 per cent.

Sean Brillant, a senior conservation biologist with the Canadian Wildlife Federation in Halifax, says the change in status is not surprising and should put even more pressure on governments in Canada and the United States to do more to stop these whales from being wiped out.

""We are an affluent country with an incredible amount of knowledge and resources, we have good controls over our oceans industry,"" he said. ""And we can't figure this out? How embarrassing. We need to step up and solve this problem.""

He said Canada has done a lot in recent years to try to protect the whales, including closing fisheries and implementing speed limits for boats. This year, more than 12,000 square kilometres of the Gulf of St. Lawrence has already been closed to fixed-gear fishing until November, because so many North Atlantic right whales were spotted in the region this summer.

Department of Fisheries and Oceans rules close about 2,000 square kilometres for 15 days around a place where a whale is spotted; if a whale is spotted within that area again in that period, the area closes for the rest of the season.

Brillant said it's still not enough. Oceans Canada recently called on Ottawa to make speed limits in the Cabot Strait mandatory instead of voluntary after research showed most ship captains were choosing not to follow it. The Cabot Strait is the entrance to the Gulf of St. Lawrence between Newfoundland and Cape Breton that most of the whales use.

Brillant also said speed limits are better than nothing but the only full solution is to prevent the ships from going near the whales at all.

Amy Butcher, a spokeswoman for Transport Minister Marc Garneau, said the government has mandatory speed restrictions in most of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and this year imposed a new restricted area that requires ships to stay away or reduce speeds even further from 10 knots to eight.

""Our government takes the protection and recovery of the North Atlantic right whale very seriously,"" she said.

Brillant said so far this year has been positive with no whales dying in Canadian waters thus far. Two calves have died in American waters, and one of their mothers has not been seen since the calf showed up dead. Both calves were killed by ships, and one was hit by ships twice in its seven months of life.

The whales, which migrate along the eastern coast of North America, spend winters off Florida and Georgia before migrating north to New England and Atlantic Canada in the summer.

The whales are threatened by a combination of factors, including climate change, which appears to be driving them further north in the summer months to find food. Brillant said before 2017, surveys of the whales in the Gulf of St. Lawrence were limited, but when that work began in more detail, it was clear there were a lot of whales present in waters that opened them up to serious risk of being hit by big ships or tangled in fishing lines.

Brillant said in addition to the 31 whales that have died, at least another 10 have been entangled with fishing gear, most of them in Canada. Whales tangled up in fishing gear are ""as good as dead"" because they cannot reproduce and their prospects for survival are not good.

""We are not going to be graded on good intentions and good decisions unless we get the results. And the results have to be that we don't drive this species to extinction.""

Debate heats up in the Maritimes,[],2020-07-09 13:03:00-03:00,"HALIFAX -- Health officials in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island are all strongly urging Maritimers to wear a face mask in public places where physical distancing isn’t possible.

While face masks aren’t mandatory in the Maritimes, the debate around the issue appears to be heating up.

Kate Watson would like to see them become mandatory.

The Dartmouth, N.S., resident says a shopping trip to a big-box retailer turned sour over the weekend when she noticed most of the people lined up to get inside weren’t wearing masks.

“Then you get into the store and people are jostling and crowding and touching things and I got partway through the store and I literally had a panic attack and had to put down my blocks and leave the store,” said Watson.

Halifax councillor Shawn Cleary is among those calling for masks to be made mandatory.

Cleary took to his message to Twitter, urging Halifax-area residents to wear masks in public when a distance of two metres can’t be maintained.

Hey #Halifax, let’s wear our masks when we’re out in public and can’t maintain 2 metres of distance or when we’re indoors like shopping, on buses, etc. pic.twitter.com/3jpOANI6U0 — Shawn ""masked man"" Cleary (@shawncleary) July 8, 2020

He says he felt compelled to say something after reading that a new survey suggested nearly 40 per cent of people never wear masks.

“That is concerning to me because we have flattened the crap out of this curve,” Cleary told CTV News. “We’re good, but, as we saw, all it takes is one person to come in from the United States … and it’s back.”

However, even without an actual order, advocates say public health guidelines can be an imposition on our lives and need to be issued carefully, especially when there are only a handful of active COVID-19 cases in the region.

“The risk is so low that it seems to me to be an overreaction,” said Walter Thompson, a civil liberties lawyer in Nova Scotia. “But if there’s no virus … how can anybody be infected?”

However, Cleary points out that there may be cases of COVID-19 that have simply not been confirmed, so it’s best to err on the side of caution.

“There are still cases, just not reported cases of COVID-19 throughout the province, because we know that most people can be asymptomatic,” he said.

It’s a sentiment shared by Kate Watson, who would not only like to see masks be made mandatory, but also available for free.

“If we leave it to people to choose, a lot of people are going to choose not to, so why not just make it mandatory?”

While masks are only recommended in the Maritimes, some of Canada’s biggest cities, including Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal, have recently made them mandatory.",[]

SACKVILLE, N.S. -- A Nova Scotia couple is about to become parents -- a journey that has been years in the making.

Joel Arsenault and Jason Starratt, who have been married for almost four years, are excitedly awaiting the arrival of their baby.

“I've always, always, always wanted a baby. I've always wanted to have the pregnancy and the anticipation of knowing my child is on the way, which is problematic for us, being two males,” says Starratt.

Sarah Martin is the couple’s gestational carrier and friend. She is scheduled to give birth Friday morning.

“Ran into Jason one day and he was talking about being interested in having a baby and that he would be interested in a surrogate, so I impulsively volunteered,” says Martin.

The two men say they are eternally grateful to their egg donor, Isabelle Thurrott, and for Martin’s willingness to help them become parents.

“I feel like right now we're both thinking it was all worth it, the ups and downs, the time it took, the struggles, everything,” says Arsenault.

“I think I speak for both of us, we feel very blessed that it worked. It's a costly procedure and the fact that it worked on our very last embryos that we had left, we're just counting our lucky stars that it worked and here we are now.”

The baby's gender will be a surprise for everyone and the parents-to-be say they’ve already chosen names, but are keeping them a secret until the baby comes.

“We've decided that Jason is going to be daddy or dad and I'm going to be papa,” says Arsenault.

“I'm going to speak only in French to the baby and Jason will be speaking to the baby in English, so the baby is going to be bilingual.”

Martin says she is honoured to be able to help her friends fulfil their dream.

“I feel like I'm giving them their gift, that I've been able to grow and provide, and I'm just really excited,” she says.",[]

Halifax Regional Police responded to an altercation between a group of women in two vehicles in the 600 block of Windmill Road in Dartmouth, N.S., around 5:30 p.m. on July 1.

Police say the altercation started when two women in one vehicle confronted two women in another vehicle about being cut off in a drive-thru.

Police had received reports that a dog was also involved in the incident, but they weren’t aware of the severity of the actions against the animal.

Officers checked on two dogs in one vehicle at the scene and say they appeared to be in good health.

Police say the women didn’t want to pursue charges at the time.

However, investigators later learned that a video of the incident was circulating on social media, prompting them to launch an investigation.

Police say the video shows a dog being swung on its leash by a woman who is not the dog’s owner.

Warning: This video contains content that may be disturbing to some viewers.

Officers arrested a woman in connection with the incident in Dartmouth Wednesday morning.

Clarissa Angela Crawley is facing charges of assault with a weapon and wilfully causing unnecessary suffering to an animal.

The 27-year-old Dartmouth woman is due to appear in court on Wednesday.

Authorities were called to a North York apartment building, in the Weston Road and Finch Avenue area, just after 10 a.m. on Saturday morning.

Police said when they arrived they located two children, a six-month-old girl and a four-year-old boy, suffering from stab wounds inside an apartment unit.

A video sent to CTV News Toronto by a viewer shows a woman being led into the back of a police cruiser in handcuffs. It also shows what appears to be the children being carried into an ambulance.

The children were rushed to SickKids Hospital with serious injuries, police said. Their injuries were initially deemed life-threatening but police later said their condition improved and are expected to survive.

Const. Alex Li said the 36-year-old mother, who was arrested at the scene, has been charged with two counts of attempted murder, two counts of assault and two counts of aggravated assault.

The identity of the woman will not be released, police said, to protect the identity of the victims.

""This is a very serious stabbing and we're taking this very seriously,” Li said. “We have deployed our available resources to look into the matter... You can expect an active crime scene.""

""Having young children myself, I couldn't imagine that type of trauma and injury,"" Li said.

Trump flew by helicopter to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in suburban Washington to meet wounded servicemembers and health care providers caring for COVID-19 patients. As he left the White House, he told reporters: “When you're in a hospital, especially ... I think it's a great thing to wear a mask.”

Trump was wearing a mask in Walter Reed's hallway as he began his visit. He was not wearing one when he stepped off the helicopter at the facility.

The president was a latecomer to wearing a mask during the pandemic, which has raged across the U.S. since March and infected more than 3.2 million and killed at least 134,000. Most prominent Republicans, including Vice-President Mike Pence, endorsed wearing masks as the coronavirus gained ground this summer. Republican governors have been moving toward requiring or encouraging the use of masks as the pandemic has grown more serious in some states in the South and West.

Trump, however, has declined to wear a mask at news conferences, coronavirus task force updates, rallies and other public events. People close to him have told The Associated Press that the president feared a mask would make him look weak and was concerned that it shifted focus to the public health crisis rather than the economic recovery. They spoke on condition of anonymity to describe private matters.

While not wearing one himself, Trump has sent mixed signals about masks, acknowledging that they would be appropriate if worn in an indoor setting where people were close together. But he has accused reporters of wearing them to be politically correct and has retweeted messages making fun of Democrat Joe Biden for wearing a mask and implying that Biden looks weak.

Questions remain whether Trump will wear a mask with any regularity.

The wearing of masks became another political dividing line, with Republicans more resistant to wearing them than Democrats. Few masks were seen at recent Trump campaign events in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Phoenix and South Dakota's Mount Rushmore.

The only time Trump has been known to wear a mask was during a private part of a tour of a Ford plant in Michigan.

On its website, Walter Reed carries this recommendation: “Whenever you're out in public, like at your local grocery store or pharmacy, where it's difficult to maintain 6 feet of social distance, you should wear a cloth face covering.” The facility also notes that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends wearing cloth face coverings to slow the spread of the coronavirus.”",[]

""Land back, we want our land back, that's part of reconciliation,"" said Ellen Gabriel, a Mohawk activist and spokesperson for the People of the Longhouse in Kanesatake.

""Giving our land back and having us part of the decision making process on what happens on our land, that's reconciliation, and it has to be done in a decolonized framework, in a way that respects Indigenous laws, that respects the rights of the women who are the title holders of the land you're standing on.""

The commemoration was to honour those community members who played a critical role during in the summer of 1990, when the country's attention was on Oka, a small town about 50 kilometres northwest of Montreal.

""The stand taken that summer became an important symbol for peoples across North America, inspiring them to take similar stands against the emancipation of their ancestral lands,"" Gabriel said.

Thirty years ago Saturday, on July 11, 1990, Quebec provincial police moved in on a barricade erected by Mohawks that March to protest the planned expansion of a golf course and development on what is ancestral land.

A provincial police officer was killed and the situation escalated into a tense, 78-day standoff between Mohawks and Canadian soldiers.

""Our basic human rights were violated by the Surete du Quebec (provincial police), the Canadian army, condoned by the governments of Quebec and Canada, pushed forward by private enterprises including those within the municipality of Oka,"" Gabriel said.

The 1990 siege ended when the expansion was cancelled and the barricades came down.

Three decades later, however, the underlying land dispute remains unresolved.

The trio of federal ministers that oversee Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada said in a statement the pain and trauma inflicted continues to this day.

""Today, we must acknowledge that progress in our relationship has been unequal, halting, and often, far too slow,"" the government said, adding mistakes must be learned from.

""We must resolve to never order the deployment of the Canadian Armed Forces against Indigenous Peoples, as we remain deeply committed to dialogue and peaceful resolution of conflict.""

Like the conversation around residential schools and murdered and missing Indigenous women, Gabriel said the issue in Kanesatake won't be an easy one.

""It's going to be an uncomfortable discussion,"" Gabriel said. ""But when are we actually going to see actions and have a voice in what reconciliation is going to be.""

Under a light rain, a rolling convoy made its way through the community to a nearby provincial park, passing by a real-estate development in Oka that has been a flash point in recent years, before returning home.

A similar event took place Saturday in Kahnawake Mohawk Reserve, southwest of Montreal, where a rolling convoy of vehicles from that community stopped briefly on the Mercier Bridge, which was barricaded in 1990 in solidarity for those manning posts in Oka.

""A lot of people joined in and it lasted a good two hours, driving on the highway at about 10 kilometres an hour,"" said Joe Deom, a sub-chief in the Bear clan.

""I felt it good about the attention our own people had to this anniversary -- a lot of our own people weren't even born at that time, so it's good that they're enthusiastic about it.""

Among those present in Kanesatake on Saturday was NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh and Manitoba NDP MP Leah Gazan, invited by the Longhouse.

Singh said thirty years removed, lessons clearly haven't been learned.

""The problem was created by Canada,"" Singh said. ""It's 2020, with the resources this country has, there's no excuse why this cannot be resolved.""

In many ways, Gabriel said, the situation remains unchanged -- land rights aren't respected and systemic racism remains at the core of Indigenous people's relationship with governments.

Ghislain Picard, the grand chief of the Quebec Assembly of First Nations, marked the 30th anniversary with an open letter calling on Quebec Premier Francois Legault to change his tune on systemic racism, which the premier has said repeatedly doesn't exist.

""Systemic racism and discrimination are not just concepts or theoretical notions,"" Picard wrote. ""Rather, they are a set of facts and behaviours and we should not be afraid to name and denounce them if we are genuinely willing to correct them.""

The IWK Telethon for Children, which airs on CTV Atlantic every year, is one of the many charity events impacted by the virus.

“The IWK Telethon is a tradition that has brought Maritimers together for the past 35 years and symbolizes the true spirit of our community. We have always been there for each other united in our connection to the IWK,” says Jennifer Gillivan, the president and CEO of the IWK Foundation.

The telethon, which was scheduled to air on June 6 and June 7, will not go ahead as planned this year.

“We are sad that we can’t go ahead with the broadcast, but we are committed to bring content, as much as we can, using innovative ways to reach our community. We’re forever grateful to our community because they’ve always stayed with us. We’ve been in this relationship for over 35 years with our Maritime community, who in fact have built the IWK,” says Gillivan.

“We know some people are suffering and we would never expect them to do anything other than take care of their selves, and they are in our thoughts, but for those who can continue to support us, we hope they will.”

Much of the fundraising for the telethon has already taken place. Those donations will go towards priority equipment.

“The pandemic is happening and that just heightens and intensifies what’s already happening at the IWK,” says Gillivan.

“Kids can’t wait. They are already there. The sickest of the sick are there and then there is the heightened piece now, with the potential for infection during the pandemic. So the hospital still needs the equipment, they still need the beds, they still need the priority pieces that we fundraise for year-round. Probably now more than ever, they need that support.”

Gillivan says the IWK Foundation is committed to finding ways to celebrate donors and share the stories of patients and care teams at the IWK.

“Thank you to our broadcast partner CTV. Thank you to our many loyal donors who fundraise year-round for the IWK and thank you to our incredible telethon volunteer committees across the Maritimes,” says Gillivan.

“We applaud your unwavering commitment to the IWK. Stay healthy, safe and support each other.”

In a press release, the direction regionale de santé publique (DRSP) reported on Saturday that contagious customers or employees had visited at least five establishments since July 1. While authorities contacted some of them, several could not be reached.

According to public health, “it is very likely that other establishments were frequented by affected persons.”

The DRSP acknowledged that the proportion of new cases among young people aged 15 to 39 has increased in recent weeks in the region.

The urban environment head medical officer at the Montreal DRSP, Dr. David Kaiser says he fears that “these observations only reflect the tip of the iceberg” adding that community transmission is still present in Montreal.

He warned the population that the pandemic is not behind us.

“If we want to lessen the impact of a potential second wave, it is imperative that people who start to develop symptoms similar to COVID-19 and people who have potentially been in contact with cases must be screened and isolate themselves until they receive their results,” he said.

Thursday, the Quebec government imposed a curfew of midnight to end the sale of alcohol in bars and a demand that they close at 1 a.m.

Minister of Health Christian Dubé also imposed a customer limit of 50 per cent of the capacity provided for in the permit.

Dubé did not hide his concern at a sudden trend reversal, when public health authorities reported 137 new cases Thursday, more than double what was recorded in recent days.

Bar owners will also be encouraged to keep a customer registry on a voluntary basis.

610,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/pandemic-racism-compound-worries-about-black-suicide-rate-1.5020522,"Pandemic, racism compound worries about Black suicide rate",['Sophia Tareen'],2020-07-11 16:44:00-04:00,"CHICAGO -- Jasmin Pierre was 18 when she tried to end her life, overdosing on whatever pills she could find. Diagnosed with depression and anxiety, she survived two more attempts at suicide, which felt like the only way to stop her pain.

Years of therapy brought progress, but the 31-year-old Black woman's journey is now complicated by a combination of stressors hitting simultaneously: isolation during the pandemic, a shortage of mental health care providers and racial trauma inflicted by repeated police killings of Black people.

“Black people who already go through mental health issues, we're even more triggered,” said Pierre, who lives in New Orleans. “I don't think my mental health issues have ever, ever been this bad before.”

Health experts have warned of a looming mental health crisis linked to the coronavirus outbreak, and the federal government rolled out a broad anti-suicide campaign. But doctors and researchers say the issues reverberate deeper among Black people, who've seen rising youth suicide attempts and suffered disproportionately during the pandemic.

Mental health advocates are calling for more specialized federal attention on Black suicides, including research funding. Counsellors focusing on Black trauma are offering free help. And Black churches are finding new ways to address suicide as social distancing has eroded how people connect.

“There has been a lot of complex grief and loss related to death, related to loss of jobs and loss of income,” said Sean Joe, an expert on Black suicides at Washington University in St. Louis. “There's a lot of hurt and pain in America going on right now, and you only are getting a sense of depth in the months ahead.”

Suicides overall have increased. Roughly 48,000 people in the U.S. died by suicide in 2018, with the rate increasing 35% since 1999, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death among all ages. For ages 10 to 19, it's second after accidents.

The rates of suicides and suicide attempts for Black adults have trailed white and Native American adults. But newer research shows an alarming rise in Black young people trying to take their own lives.

Suicide attempts rose 73% between 1991 and 2017 among Black high school students while suicidal thoughts and plans for suicide fell for all teens, according to a study published in November in the journal Pediatrics. The findings, including troubling suicide trends among Black children, prompted the Congressional Black Caucus to issue a report in December deeming the situation a crisis.

Experts say the reasons are a complex mix requiring more study.

Suicide risk factors include a diagnosis like depression or trauma or having a parent who committed suicide. Many factors are amplified for Black families, who often face higher poverty rates, disproportionate exposure to violence and less access to medical care.

The pandemic has heightened the disparities

Black people are dying from COVID-19 at higher rates, leaving them to grieve more in isolation with restrictions on funerals and gatherings. Added to the mix is a national reckoning with racism after George Floyd's killing.

“Dealing with racism and stereotypes and all the inequity that we have to face, it's bandaged up,” said Arielle Sheftall, an author of the Pediatrics study. “It feels like the bandage is ripped off and everybody is looking at it and staring at it, and we are bleeding profusely.”

Part of the problem is the study of suicide remains largely white, with little race research. There's also been a misconception of suicide as only a “white problem.”

Michigan psychologist Alton Kirk was among the first to study Black suicides in the 1970s, outlined in his 2009 book, “Black Suicide: The Tragic Reality of America's Deadliest Secret.”

“When I first started, a lot of Black people were in denial about suicide,” he said. “We had suffered enough. We survived slavery and segregation and all this other stuff. They almost saw it as being a weakness.”

While many attitudes have changed, obstacles to health care persist

For one, there aren't enough mental health professionals. Also, treatment has traditionally been based on white experiences, potentially leaving some clinicians unprepared.

Each time there's a publicized episode of police brutality against Black people, calls to the Trevor Project's suicide-prevention lines spike immediately. The organization focuses on LGBTQ youth, including addressing racial disparities.

“You're already starting at a different point because you spent your life fighting back racism,” said Tia Dole, the organization's chief clinical operations officer. “People are walking around with a half-filled tank of emotional resources because of their identity.”

For suicide attempt survivors, navigating the pandemic means more uncertainty.

Kiauna Patterson, who graduated from Pennsylvania's Edinboro University this year, tried to end her life in 2018 as she felt pressure from school and working three jobs to help support family.

Since losing university health care, she meditates daily and focuses on her goal of becoming a doula.

“You don't really know what's going on or what's going to happen,” she said. “You're taking each day, just one at a time, to try and grasp some type of control or calmness.”

Pierre, who uses her experiences to counsel others, doesn't want people struggling alone. She created The Safe Place, a free Black-oriented mental health app that's seen more signups during the pandemic.

Others are also trying to fill care gaps.

Donna Barnes, who runs the National Organization For People of Color Against Suicide, plans a free online support group. After losing her son to suicide in 1990, she noticed a lack of resources for Black families and started the organization.

“It took me four years before I could smile again,” Barnes said. “It wasn't easy. My friends and family didn't know what to do with me.

Trinity United Church of Christ, an influential Black church once attended by former President Barack Obama, has met increased need in Chicago with Zoom chats and calls.

The Rev. Otis Moss III used a recent podcast to discuss his sister's suicide, which occurred before his wedding in the 1990s.

He called it an effective medium as people remain isolated with services cancelled. Moss said it took years to talk openly share about his sister's schizophrenia and to stop blaming himself.

“It is an appropriate time to let people know there are many people who are walking the same road they are walking,” he said. “I found how to punch holes in the darkness and witness light shine through.”

This story has been updated to correct that Barnes is planning a support group not a counselling course.",[]

The Syrian opposition and militant groups control the Idlib area, which is home to more than 3 million people, most of them displaced by the war and living in tent camps and overcrowded facilities. Local health facilities have been targeted in Syrian government attacks that have recently displaced nearly a further million people.

The Early Warning and Alert Response Network, which reports on the virus, said the two doctors had been in touch with patient zero, another doctor who works in a hospital in Idlib. The first case was reported on Thursday and the hospital where the doctor works has since suspended its operations and quarantined patients and support staff to carry out testing.

The enclave is now under threat of losing crucial humanitarian aid access. Moves by Russia, a major ally of the Syrian government, at the U.N. Security Council are threatening to shut down border crossing between the rebel-held enclave and Turkey.

A divided U.N. Security Council failed for a second time Friday to agree on extending humanitarian aid deliveries to the area from Turkey as the current U.N. mandate to do so ended.

Russia and China vetoed a U.N. resolution backed by the 13 other council members that would have maintained two crossing points from Turkey for six months. A Russian-drafted resolution that would have authorized just one border crossing in the area for a year failed to receive the minimum nine ""yes"" votes in the 15-member council.

A new vote is expected Saturday. Germany and Belgium, who insist two crossings are critical especially with the first COVID-19 cases being reported in Syria's northwest, circulated a new text that would extend the mandate through the Bab al-Hawa crossing into Idlib for a year and the mandate for the Bab al-Salam crossing -- which Russia wants to eliminate -- for three months to wind up its activities.

Russia, Syria's closest ally, has argued that aid should be delivered from within Syria across conflict lines. But the U.N. and humanitarian groups say aid for 2.8 million needy people in the northwest can't get in that way.

Kevin Kennedy, the U.N.'s Regional Humanitarian Coordinator for the Syria Crisis, told The Associated Press that leaving only one crossing open would make aid delivery more time-consuming, more costly, and more dangerous in a territory that is controlled by different armed groups.

""The pipeline to aid people should not be subject to these political considerations from any side in this conflict,"" Kennedy said late Friday.

A day after the detection of the first COVID-19 case, hospitals in northwest Syria announced they would be suspending non-emergency procedures and outpatient services for at least one week. Schools were to shut down until further notice.",[]

The 42-year-old man, identified by the official Vietnam News Agency as Stephen Cameron, was taken by ambulance from Cho Ray Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City to the city's airport. He was scheduled to take a flight to Hanoi, Vietnam's capital, where he will depart on a flight to London, with a stop in Frankfurt. He is scheduled to land in London on Sunday morning.

Vietnam has gone all out to save Cameron, who was working for national carrier Vietnam Airlines when he tested positive for the coronavirus in March. He had been critically ill and spent 65 days on life support.

""I'm overwhelmed by the generosity of the Vietnamese people, the dedication and professionalism of the doctors and nurses working"" at Cho Ray Hospital, Cameron said Saturday morning in a video released by the hospital, where he was last treated.

""I can only thank everybody here for things that they have done,"" he said, sitting in a wheelchair next to a group of doctors. ""I'm going home with a happy heart because I'm going home, but it is sad that I'm leaving so many people here that I'm friends with.""

Cameron is known in Vietnam as ""Patient 91,"" as he was the 91st person in the country confirmed to have the coronavirus. He was Vietnam's last patient in an ICU, and his recovery means the country still has not had any COVID-19 deaths.

""The patient's recovery has been like a very long flight,"" Dr. Tran Thanh Linh, the deputy head of the ICU ward at Cho Ray Hospital, said during a meeting between hospital officials, the British Consulate and Vietnam Airlines representatives just before Cameron's discharge.

""But he made it,"" Linh said. ""All of the health workers are overwhelmed with joy to see him fully recovered and being discharged from the hospital today.""

After the meeting, Cameron was handed a certificate stating that he is virus-free and healthy enough to travel on a long-haul flight.

He was scheduled to be flown on one of Vietnam Airlines' Boeing 787s -- the same aircraft he used to pilot when he was flying for the carrier.

""We want to make him happy, to make him feel like coming back to his second home on the aircraft,"" said Luu Hoang Minh, deputy head of Vietnam Airlines' flight crew Division 919, where Cameron used to work.

""It's going to be a long night tonight, but he will have his colleagues with him on the flight. He will feel like being a pilot again,"" Minh said.

Cameron had been so sick with COVID-19 that doctors said at one point they considered a lung transplant, with his lungs 90% damaged and nonfunctional.

On Monday, a group of doctors who had been overseeing Cameron's treatment announced that he ""has made substantial progress and his health condition allows him to travel"" to London. Cameron is virus-free, breathes normally without any support and is no longer treated as a COVID-19 patient, Dr. Linh said.

Most international speakers urged tolerance and reconciliation in Bosnia, still ethnically divided 25 years since the brutal execution in July 1995 of more than 8,000 Bosniak Muslim men and boys.

But the Bosniak Muslim member of the country's tripartite presidency, Sefik Dzaferovic - one of a few officials attending in person - went further, urging the world to demand Serb leaders finally accept responsibility and open the way for true reconciliation.

""I am calling on our friends from around the world to show not just with words but also with actions that they will not accept the denial of genocide and celebration of its perpetrators,"" he said.

""The Srebrenica genocide is being denied (by Serb leaders) just as systematically and meticulously as it was executed in 1995, we owe it not just to Srebrenica, but to humanity, to oppose that,"" he added.

On Saturday, the recently identified remains of nine victims were reburied in a memorial cemetery and centre just outside the town in eastern Bosnia.

The Srebrenica massacre is the only episode of Bosnia's 1992-95 war to be defined as genocide, including by two UN courts. But leaders in neighbouring Serbia still deny the extent of the 1995 massacre and refuse to acknowledge they amounted to a genocide.

After murdering thousands of Srebrenica's Muslims, in an attempt to hide the crime, Serbs dumped their bodies in numerous mass graves scattered throughout eastern Bosnia.

Body parts are still being found in mass graves and are being put together and identified through DNA analysis. Close to 7,000 of those killed have already been found and identified. Newly identified victims are buried each year on July 11 -- the anniversary of the day the killing began in 1995 -- in the memorial cemetery.

Dozens of world leaders, including Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Spain's Pedro Sanchez, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Britain's Prince Charles, addressed the commemoration ceremony held Saturday, before the funeral, via prerecorded video messages.

Typically, thousands of visitors attend the commemoration service and funeral, but this year only a relatively small number of survivors were allowed at the cemetery due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Bosnian Serb wartime political leader, Radovan Karadzic, and his military commander, Ratko Mladic, were both convicted of and sentenced for genocide in Srebrenica by a special U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague. In all, the tribunal and courts in the Balkans have sentenced close to 50 Bosnian Serbs wartime officials to more than 700 years in prison for Srebrenica killings.

Bosnian Serbs, however, still celebrate Karadzic and Mladic as heroes. Some are even staging celebrations of ""the 1995 liberation of Srebrenica"" on the anniversary of the crime.

Judge Carmel Agius, President of the UN court that is currently completing war crimes trials stemming from the breakup of Yugoslavia, warned in his video message that the victims of the Srebrenica massacre ""continue to be tormented by those who attempt to deny their lived experiences, and, thereby, their very existence.""

Agius voiced hope that the new generations in the Balkans will reject the narratives of their political leaders and ""champion the truth and justice in honour of the victims we are commemorating today.""

The Bosnian war pitted the country's three main ethnic factions -- Serbs, Croats and Bosnian Muslims -- against each other after the break-up of Yugoslavia. More than 100,000 people were killed in the conflict. When the war ended in a U.S.-brokered peace deal in 1995, a Serb-run entity was formed within Bosnia, of which Srebrenica became part.",[]

Gov. Denny Tamaki said he could say only that a ""few dozen"" cases had been found recently because the U.S. military asked that the exact figure not be released. The outbreaks occurred at Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, which is at the centre of a relocation dispute, and Camp Hansen, Tamaki said.

Local media, citing unnamed sources, said about 60 people had been infected.

""Okinawans are shocked by what we were told (by the U.S. military),"" Tamaki told a news conference. ""We now have strong doubts that the U.S. military has taken adequate disease prevention measures.""

Tamaki demanded transparency in the latest development and said he planned to request talks between the U.S. military and Okinawan officials. He said Okinawan officials also asked the Japanese government to demand that the U.S. provide details including the number of cases, seal off Futenma and Camp Hansen, and step up preventive measures on base.

Okinawan officials made similar requests to the U.S. military on Friday in order to address local residents' concerns, Tamaki said.

The Marines said in a statement Friday that the troops were taking additional protective measures to limit the spread of the coronavirus and were restricting off-base activities. The statement said measures are ""to protect our forces, our families, and the local community,"" without providing details on the infections.

The Marines did not immediately respond Saturday to an Associated Press inquiry about the latest outbreak.

Okinawa is home to more than half of about 50,000 American troops based in Japan under a bilateral security pact, and the residents are sensitive to U.S. base-related problems. Many Okinawans have long complained about pollution, noise and crime related to U.S. bases.

Okinawans also oppose a planned relocation of the Futenma air base from the current site in a densely populated area in the south to a less populated area on the east coast.

Local media reported that the Okinawan assembly adopted a resolution Friday protesting the U.S. military's lack of transparency about its outbreak on base.

Okinawa has about 150 cases of the coronavirus. In all, Japan has about 21,000 cases and 1,000 deaths, with Tokyo reporting more than 200 new cases for a third straight day Saturday.",[]

Police said the boy was surfing at Wooli Beach, near Grafton, about 600 kilometres (370 miles) north of Sydney in New South Wales state just before 2:30 p.m. when he was attacked. The shark attack left him with severe injuries to his legs.

Several surfers came to the aid of the boy and helped him to shore for medical attention. Despite CPR efforts to revive him, he died at the scene.

Police initially said the victim was 17, but later corrected his age to 15.

It's unusual for Australia to have five fatal shark attacks in the first six months of a year. On average, three people die from shark attacks each year in the country, according to figures kept by the Australian Shark Attack File. The last time there were five fatal attacks in an entire year was 2014.

Last Saturday, a 20-year-old scuba diver who was spear fishing died after being attacked by a shark off the coast of Australia's Queensland state. The man was attacked near Indian Head on the eastern side of Fraser Island.

The Ministry of Defense this week told members of the Diet, the country's parliament, that the new sixth-generation fighters would begin production in fiscal year 2031 and replace the country's aging fleet of almost 100 F-2 jets, single-engine fourth-generation fighters modeled after American F-16s, according to Japan's national broadcaster NHK News.

The country's fiscal 2020 defense budget said more than $261 million (28 billion yen) had been set aside for the program, known as the F-X, including money to develop drones that could operate with the stealth jets, a technology also being developed in Australia and the U.S..

Other features touted by Japan's Acquisition, Logistics and Technology Agency (ALTA) which could be expected to be featured in the new jet are:

-- an ability to sync missile targeting between multiple aircraft, known as integrated fire control or network shooting;

-- internal weapons bays, like those seen on American F-22 stealth jets;

-- the use of thrust-vectoring nozzles, devices that use the engine's thrust to turn more sharply.

The F-2, which first flew in 1995, along with F-15J jets, form the backbone of Tokyo's air defense. Those defenses are seen as in need of an upgrade, especially as regional rival China is investing in new fighter jets, including stealth J-20s of which the planned Japanese jet could be a strong rival.

Japanese Defense Minister Taro Kono noted the pressure on the Japanese fighter fleet last month when he told reporters that Japan's Air Self-Defense Force scrambles fighter jets daily in response to Chinese military flights near Japanese territory.

LARGE F-35 PURCHASE APPROVED

News of Japan's fighter development comes as the U.S. State Department approved the sale of more than 100 US F-35 fighter jets to Japan.

The sale would consist of 63 F-35A jets, which take off from runways, and 42 F-35B jets, which require a short takeoff roll and can landing vertically. Those would be used on Japanese helicopter destroyers, essentially small aircraft carriers it will upgrade to handle the F-35Bs.

""This proposed sale will support the foreign policy goals and national security objectives of the United States by improving the security of a major ally that is a force for political stability and economic progress in the Asia-Pacific region,"" the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency said in a release announcing the approval of the sale.

""It is vital to U.S. national interest to assist Japan in developing and maintaining a strong and effective self-defense capability,"" it said. Cost of the deal is an estimated $23 billion, with U.S. defense contractors Lockheed Martin and Pratt and Whitney noted as the prime beneficiaries.

With the new purchases, Japan plans to operate 147 of the F-35s. Its first squadron of 13 planes went operational last year at Misawa Air Base on the northern edge of the country's main island of Honshu.

One of those planes crashed into the Pacific during a nighttime training mission in April, an accident later blamed on its pilot losing spatial awareness.

The Pentagon touts the F-35, with the world's most advanced avionics, engines and weaponry, as the ""the most affordable, lethal, supportable and survivable aircraft ever to be used.""",[]

Friday's high of 36.9°C broke the Ottawa Airport's record high of 34.3°C, set in 1988.

Saturday's forecast includes a much milder high of 26°C, but it's not without its extremes.

A special weather statement says, ""The remnants of Tropical storm Fay will move northward across Southern Quebec today. Locally heavy rainfall will be possible, particularly during the afternoon and evening.""

Environment Canada says Ottawa could see between 50 and 70 mm of rain by Sunday morning. while admitting it is difficult at this time to specify exact amounts.

On Friday, they had warned the totals could be as high as 100 mm.

The statement is in effect for Ottawa, as well as areas to the south and east of Ottawa.

While no statement is in place for the Ottawa Valley, local forecasts predict up to 45 mm of rain Saturday.

The forecast for the weekend looks like this:

Saturday: Cloudy with showers and the risk of a thunderstorm. High: 26°C, humidex 36. Rainfall totals 40 to 50 mm. UV index of 4, or moderate.

Saturday night: Showers with the risk of a thunderstorm. Low: 19°C. Rainfall totals 15 to 25 mm.

Residents living at Extendicare Medex on Baseline Road are self-isolating in their rooms, where they are receiving meals and being provided with care.

“Unfortunately the global pandemic of COVID-19 has reached Extendicare Medex, and the Ottawa Public Health has placed Medex in COVID-19 outbreak,” said Melanie Dea, as she read an email from the home on Thursday. Her husband is living in the home.

“I gotta say I was shocked to find out they weren’t through the worst of it, and got through it, and now there’s an outbreak,” said Dea.

For four months, Dea has not been able to see her husband.

“It’s terrible to not hug your loved one, to give them a kiss, to be socially distanced, we’ve been together for 36 years, this is the longest we’ve ever been apart,” said an emotional Dea.

“He has gone downhill so much in the last four months, I’m losing him, everyday I’m losing a part of him and I can’t be there.”

While new lab-confirmed cases in Ottawa have recently remained low, Ottawa Public Health said this new outbreak is a reminder that COVID-19 is still in our community.

“If we’re starting to see cases in homes again, I think it shows you how difficult this virus is,” said Vera Etches, Ottawa's Medical Officer of Health.

In a statement to CTV News Ottawa, Extendicare said it is working closely with public health officials to contain the spread of the virus and protect both residents and staff.

“We would in this case then expect testing to occur in the home, so we would go out and look through testing for COVID-19 for more cases, whether it’s staff or residents,” said Dr. Etches.

Dea is also concerned about the heat — she said her husband’s room does not have air conditioning.

“With yesterday’s temperatures, I can’t imagine how hot it was in those rooms,” she said.

When asked about the situation in long-term care homes during the heat wave, Mayor Jim Watson said ""that's a real concern.""

""So I appreciate the fact that the premier (Doug Ford) has said that he will look into what can be done from a regulatory point of view to make sure that these loved ones of ours are living in conditions that we are back in our own homes, with air conditioning.”

Extendicare said that throughout the pandemic it has been conducting surveillance testing of staff for the virus every two weeks. That testing will now be happening on a weekly basis.

Extendicare also said staff are wearing full personal protective equipment and are being cohorted in specific areas of the home.

All residents living on the second and third floors of the home are now being tested for COVID-19.",[]

Medical Officer of Health Dr. Vera Etches announced that Ottawa Public Health is mandating the use of masks in indoor public spaces to help limit the spread of COVID-19.

Ottawa Public Health has tips for washing, re-using, storing and discarding a cloth mask or face covering after using it on its website.

The health unit says masks or face coverings become contaminated, especially when touched by your hands.

Removing the mask:

Ottawa Public Health says, ""after washing your hands with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, remove your mask by pulling the ties or ear loops away from your ears.""

Washing the mask:

If your mask has a removable, non-reusable filter, make sure to remove and throw out the filter before machine washing or hand-washing your mask.

When using a washing machine, Ottawa Public Health says put the cloth mask directly into the washing machine or in a bag that can be emptied into the washing machine. Throw out the bag after you have used it to store your mask.

Wash your hands again with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer after handling your mask.

Wash the masks with other laundry using a hot water cycle.

For hand-washing the cloth face mask, Ottawa Public Health says use laundry detergent and water as hot as you can stand, then dry thoroughly.

If you are discarding damaged or worn out masks, drop them in a lined garbage bin.

Ottawa Public Health says do not leave any discarded masks in places where others can come in contact with them such as shopping carts, public seats, but stops or on the ground.

Reusing your face mask

Ottawa Public Health says cloth masks may be re-used throughout the day, ""if not soiled and undamaged.""

When removing your face mask, public health says ""with clean hands, remove the mask from your face and fold it in half so that the outer space is inwards (so that the contaminated outer surface is not contacting anything during storage) and place it in a clean, sealable bag until ready to use it again the same day.""

Can I wear my cloth mask all day?

Ottawa Public Health says a mask can be worn all day as long as it does not become damaged, damp or dirty.

""Do not share your mask with others,"" the health unit says.

""Remove your mask with clean hands when you are safely able to do so and wash your hands using soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.""

Storing your face mask during the day

Ottawa Public Health reminds people ""do not place your used mask into your pocket.""

When reusing a mask, place it in a clean, sealable bag until ready to use it again the same day.""

Disposable masks

Ottawa Public Health says disposable masks should not be washed, reused or recycled.",[]

General Manager of Emergency and Protective Services Anthony Di Monte told reporters on Friday all paramedics are equipped with N95 masks--even before the COVID-19 pandemic--but each mask must be fit-tested and there are some members who can't use the standard model.

""It has to fit your particular face and seal appropriately,"" Di Monte said. ""We always have, because the physiology of each of us is different, a certain number of people that can't get a complete fit and there's approximately 30 of our 700 paramedics who have to use a different one.""

Di Monte said the vast majority of paramedics use the 3M 1805 model. The ones who can't use the 1805 have to use the 3M 1870+ model mask; however, the 1870+ is produced in smaller quantities and has become harder to obtain because of the pandemic.

""I heard a physician give an example this morning: if you have size 14 feet, it's difficult to find those kinds of shoes. The same with these masks,"" he said. ""We don't have 'em.""

Di Monte said, as soon as they realized they were running out of the masks, the service began looking at other options such as encapsulated respirators, but that requires different training to ensure each paramedic uses the new masks properly.

""In the interim, those 30 paramedics are assigned to other functions because they can't do patient care functions or we'd be putting them at risk,"" he said. ""We're continuing to work to try to get the ones that they would require, but we're not waiting for that to happen in the market. They'll get training for full-face respirators and then they'll be able to return to patient-care activities.

The encapsulated respirators, also known as Powered Air Purifying Respirators (PAPR), are full-face covering masks with hoods that connected to a battery-powered air purifier.",[]

“I think certainly right now there’s a big difference in the risk, in transmission, between Canada and the U.S.,” said Paterson in an interview with CTV News Ottawa.

Since March, Canada and the United States have agreed to temporarily close the border to non-essential travel while keeping it open for commercial traffic. The closure is set to last until at least July 21.

Under that rule, non-essential travel across the border is not permitted, and all Canadians returning to Canada must undergo a mandatory 14-day quarantine as per the Quarantine Act.

Earlier this week, Premier Doug Ford called on the Federal Government to continue to keep the border closed to non-essential travel.

On Thursday, Dr. Kieran Moore, medical officer of health at Kingston, Frontenac, Lennox and Addington Public Health, supported the move.

Moore says while there are many economic and social advantages of re-opening the border, it should remain closed to protect Canadians.

“Re-opening the border too soon will almost certainly increase the risk of COVID-19 cases in Canada, particularly given the previous rates of tourism between the two countries,” said Moore in a statement.

On Saturday, Paterson said he had spoken to mayors across eastern Ontario and says he feels it’s “unanimous.”

“Given the current conditions right now, I don’t think there’s anyone that I know of that’s pushing for the border to reopen,” he explained.

On Saturday, Ontario health officials announced 130 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the provincial total to 36,594.

Kingston, Frontenac, Lennox and Addington currently has 21 active cases, following a nail salon outbreak that began in June.

Ottawa Public Health reported 16 cases of COVID-19 on Saturday, but no new deaths for a 15th consecutive day. There are a total of 2,146 laboratory-confirmed cases in Ottawa.

Meanwhile, the U.S. recorded nearly 60,000 new cases of COVID-19 on Friday, including a near-record 11,433 in Florida alone. There have now been three million confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the U.S., and more than 133,000 deaths.

On Friday, Premier Ford said he hoped Federal Government officials will continue to be “very cautious” when it comes to reopening borders.

“As long as the goods and products are flowing which they have been (we should keep it closed). I love our American neighbours but not right now,” Ford said. “Come and visit us when things cool down especially south of the border.”",[]

The community group ACORN helped to set up a mobile testing clinic, in conjunction with the Ottawa Hospital, CHEO, Ottawa Inner City Health, the Sandy Hill Community Health Centre and the Ottawa Paramedic Service.

The one-day clinic is on until 3 p.m. Saturday at Ogilvie North Park, 1059 Ogilvie Rd. It is piloting the Honey Group's ""SMRT"" mobile testing booth.

""It’s a positive pressure HEPA filtered booth. There are gloves that they can put their hands through. A patient will walk up, they can test that patient, they disinfect with the wipes outside the booth,"" Brock Mosley, VP of Strategic Partnerships with Honey Group told CTV News. ""They also don’t have to burn through all of the PPE.""

The location was chosen because it is close to two high rises on the eastern end of Donald Street, which ACORN says house ""a concentration of newcomers, tenants whose first language isn’t English, low income families and people with disabilities.""

In a press release, ACORN said residents in the area identified several barriers to getting COVID-19 tests.

""Common barriers to accessing testing include long bus routes with multiple transfers, fear of public transit, inability to afford the cost of a taxi, lack of internet access to stay informed and language barriers,"" the group said.

""We have an awful lot of senior's residences around here and transportation is just too difficult,"" ACORN's Vanier Chapter co-chair Stephanie Graham told CTV News at the scene.

For example, according to OC Transpo's travel planner, a trip from 1240 Donald St. to the COVID-19 assessment centre at 151 Brewer Way takes between 45 minutes and an hour by bus/train on a Saturday morning, with either a single, hour-long bus ride or one to two transfers, and anywhere from 10 to 25 minutes of estimated walking time. Returning from the assessment centre would take another 45 to 60 minutes.

Walking from 1240 Donald St. to the mobile testing centre would take approximately four minutes, according to Google Maps.

""It’s very difficult to drive all the way out to Brewer where our main test facility is,"" said Beacon Hill-Cyrville Councillor Tim Tierney. ""We see this as something as part of the new norm. Something that we can bring to communities that have transportation issues. As well as seniors that have mobility issues.""

""It’s a first using this mobile booth. It was invented in Nepean, which is great, using local expertise and technology,"" Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson said.

The Ottawa Mission will provide food and there will be free masks, hand sanitizer and information pamphlets available to local residents who come for a test.

The clinic Saturday is the first of its kind for the Ottawa-based Honey Group. Several dozen people turned up for testing.

Medical Officer of Health Dr. Vera Etches said she was happy to see people making use of the new testing booth.

""It’s the first time that this booth has been used for clients, so I appreciate that people are willing to step up and make sure that this is a system that will work for us into the future,"" she said.

Data collected by Ottawa Public Health show racialized communities and immigrants are overrepresented in positive test results.

Two thirds of the positive cases studied by OPH in May and June were from racialized residents, despite just 26 per cent of Ottawa's population identifying as visible minorities.

Dr. Etches told city council in June that areas in Ottawa with the highest proportion of recent immigrants or racialized minorities have rates of COVID-19 almost twice that of areas with the fewest recent immigrants or racialized minorities.

Speaking on Saturday, Dr. Etches said mobile clinics can help vulnerable communities by providing more immediate access to tests.

""We need to get testing out to communities that are at higher risk,"" she said. ""So, absolutely, lower income communities, we know it's possible the nature of their work and the types of housing situations can sometimes increase the risk of COVID-19.""",[]

City staff recommend Council approve holding a byelection to fill the seat vacated by Stephen Blais, who was elected Liberal MPP for Orleans in February.

Council has two options for filling the vacant seat: holding a municipal byelection or appointing a Councillor to fill the role until the 2022 municipal election.

Council delayed a decision on how to fill the vacant seat due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In a report for Wednesday's Council meeting, staff recommend Council hold a byelection to fill the vacant seat in Cumberland ward. If approved, the deadline to file nomination papers would be August 21, and voting day would be Monday, October 5.

Under the plan, the city would hold traditional, in-person voting and a special mail-in ballot process to allow electors to vote without having to attend a polling station.

Staff say measures will be put in place at polling stations to encourage physical distancing and limit the spread of COVID-19, including:

Limiting the number of electors in a voting place

Developing a line management strategy and installing signage at voting places

Installing acrylic barriers in voting places

Requiring electors to wear masks in voting places

Personal protective equipment, including masks and gloves, for staff in voting places

Providing single use stationery at voting places

Brockville Mayor Jason Baker addressed the crowd, encouraging the community to come and enjoy the new experience.

“Today is a celebration of this facility once again, and its ability to pivot and adjust and to react to what’s needed,"" Baker said to a crowd of about 30 people.

""Congratulations on being one of the first to get back to the new normal in operation. Thank you.”

With that, chair of the board Mary-Jean McFall cut the ribbon, standing with other local dignitaries including MP Michael Barrett and MPP Steve Clark.

A big change to the operation at the Aquatarium during the COVID-19 pandemic is the hands-on experience, now more of a history lesson.

""We’ve gone from a very immersive, very touch, very engaging experience to more of a tour experience. There's more of an educational, what you would expect from a guided museum tour,” said Michelle Osborne, executive director of the Aquatarium.

“You’re going to find out a lot about the history of each exhibit, real knowledge of how those exhibits came about and what they are intended to teach the public as they go through.”

Director of operations Thomas Harder said to change the facility was a challenge.

“We’ve had to create a linear path, as we were a free roaming facility before. We have to keep our hands touching to a minimum. Most of our exhibits were designed to be touched and interacted with so we’ve had to learn to move through those and still make it fun and interactive for everyone.”

When you arrive for a tour, guests must go through a screening protocol and masks are mandatory.

A guide will lead the approximately two-hour tour in groups of eight, with a new group leaving every 30 minutes.

Once inside, arrows along the floor walk you from one exhibit to the next.

""Everyone is looking for something to do, myself included,” said Harder

""We’ve really gone about it with the idea of 'here’s something we may have seen but we can see it in a new light, we can learn some new things.' We really hope that people come in and enjoy it and learn a little bit more that they may not have otherwise known before.""

A couple families were waiting outside for their tour, excited to get their kids out of the house.

""We wanted to figure out how to get our kids out into public a little bit and get used to adjusting to masks and people because they've been home the last number of months,” said one father.

""I thought it’d be a good opportunity to try things out in a safe way the way everything is organized really well here.”

Another family waiting outside agreed.

""We’re just looking to get out and especially on a rainy weekend just do something inside. It’s always been on our to-do list to get down here,” the man said.

Mayor Baker is happy to see a business adapt under the situation.

“Under this mask I’m smiling. This is a big day. The Aquatarium had an awful lot of work from going from a facility that is geared towards touching to one that can operate under COVID-19,"" said Mayor Baker.

""So I think its symbolic of our spirit here in Brockville and I congratulate the board and staff and the volunteers for being able to pivot and find a way to operate inside COVID-19 parameters. It's fantastic!”

Now the Mayor says the Aquatarium can be an example for other businesses and attractions to reopen.

“It's going to be a test. It's also going to be hopefully an example. They've done an awful lot of planning and an awful lot of work to try and figure out ways to keep people safe and also entertained and those two things in COVID-19 don’t always run in parallel.”

Tickets can only be purchased on the Aquatarium website, and the facility is offering a discount with the community discount code XBR613.",[]

Saturday marked his five-year wedding anniversary with his wife Mary-Lou, and on Sunday Levesque celebrates 100 years around the sun.

A group of residents gathered below Levesque’s balcony Saturday morning to celebrate the milestone. The town of Arnprior even presenting Levesque with a certificate and Mayor Walter Stack calling in a favour from the fire department for someone he has known his entire life.

“My family and his family literally grew up next door to each other, with a paved driveway between the houses. For me it was like a second father situation. We just ran in and out of each other’s houses,” says Stack.

Two fire trucks made the trip to Levesque’s apartment; one current truck, and another from model from 1923 (still younger than Levesque) pulled from the town’s museum. Arnprior’s mayor went up on the fire truck’s crane to speak with his life-long friend, who has been in isolation during the entire COVID-19 pandemic.

“Well he’s 100. So rather than take a chance that’s what they’ve done, they’ve just stayed put,” says Marian Clemow, Levesque’s daughter in-law.

Clemow attended the celebration with family friend Gwen Skuble, who says that despite his age, Levesque is still the life of the party, “Eddie’s 100 years old, but he’s in a 70 year old body”.

“He does the shuffle and he dances, and yeah, he does everything,” laughs Clemow.

Levesque is a World War II veteran and is known for giving his time to his community while asking for nothing in return.

“Eddie was a key organizer of the Santa Claus parade at the legion every day. Quite an artist in his day. He built and carved out the reindeer for the Santa parade, painted the sleigh and the set up for the parade in those days,” according to Mayor Stack.

Stack says the two shared a moment while he was up in the crane, face to face with his old friend. Stack says he handed him a note filled with memories, “He was getting kind of choked up so it was a really great day I think for him.""",[]

ISIDORE -- Under the baking midday sun, Markus Haerle checks on his wheat crop near St. Isidore, Ont.

“We’re into an extreme drought.,” he says, looking at the dry field.

“We’ve not had significant rainfall the last six to seven weeks that actually amounts to something. It’s getting into a desperate need for any kind of moisture to come.”

His wheat crop is roughly at 80 percent maturity, and harvest is just a couple weeks away.

“It’s in the grain-fill stage and as it doesn’t have any moisture it cannot fill the grain so what that is going to do is reduce yields significantly.” Haerle said.

“Look at the bottom of the plant. It’s all started to turn yellow and that means the conduit of water going up the plant is basically already dead, so that's not going to draw any more moisture. Even if we were to get an inch, two inches of rain this plant is basically finishing off.” he adds, discouraged.

The field here is so dry, you can see up to three-centimetre cracks in between the rows.

Haerle estimates yield loss for spring grains in the area will be between 20 to 50 percent.

“We grow crops now that are quite drought-tolerant. They can actually handle drought stress up to a certain degree....But there is a point of no return and this is where we are at with the wheat crop. There is no point of return anymore.”

Haerle is also chair of Grain Farmers of Ontario, and says the whole province is seeing a drought, but it’s at different stages in different areas.

Near Carleton Place, soybean and corn crops are also feeling the effects of the record heat.

Kevin Stewart of Ottawa Valley Grain Products in Carp, a company that has been around since 1929, says farmers in his area are worried as well.

“Beans would be the most resilient to the drought conditions but grain particularly right now, grain needs that rain in the next say week or two,” Stewart says, squinting in the sun.

His mill deals with specialty grain products like red barley that are then turned into flour.

“For the food products that we are making, we want big full kernels—plump kernels that are good for milling. Certainly what I’ve heard from farmers is that we really need the rain in the next two weeks or those losses are going to be a guarantee.” Stewart said.

Farmers he has contracts with are looking at a 10 to 15 per cent loss in grain yields, which means Stewart has to fill that void.

“I’ll go out and find more farmers to work with or possibly buy grain a little further outside of the Ottawa Valley bubble.” he said.

“The drought conditions are just one additional stress that is on farmers,” he said. “They’re already impacted like everyone else with COVID its just they have another thing they need to worry about and making sure that they are making money from their investment thy have in the ground.”

Back in St. Isidore, Haerle heads over to his cornfield to see how its faring.

“The corn and soybeans still have a long way to go before they actually going to put the crop on its plant so there is still a lot of optimism about that.” he says, looking at the staggered height of the plants.

“We just have to be optimistic and hope that Mother Nature is going to bring us a few days of nice steady rain,” he said. “What we need is a steady, slow rain for about two or three days overcast, that would be perfect.

“To suggest a more violent conclusion would have been inevitable if the suspect was of another race is speculative and disheartening to the responding officers, their families, and all partners who helped successfully and professionally resolve this threat,” said Commissioner Brenda Lucki and National Police Federation president, Brian Sauve.

“This creates an abstract and negative distraction from an evolving and important national dialogue with all stakeholders seeking solutions to societal issues.”

The statement went on to say that the speculation may “further distance” some Canadian communities from police officers even as it said that the organization welcomed the “constructive and necessary dialogue” happening across Canada.

Earlier this week, NDP leader Jagmeet Singh said when compared to recent incidents between people of colour and the police, the case of Corey Hurran, the Rideau Hall suspect, should be a reminder that systemic racism is real.

""That contrast -- someone showed up to potentially kill the prime minister of Canada, or with weapons at his residence, and that person was arrested without any violence -- and you had a person who in his own home was killed,” Singh told The Canadian Press on Wednesday. “That to me is what systemic racism in policing is all about, that difference.”

Singh was referencing the recent deaths of four non-white individuals in the Toronto area and New Brunswick who died during interactions with police.

Friday’s RCMP comments come after Lucki acknowledged in June that the RCMP is grappling with a long history of racial discrimination and that systemic racism exists within the national police force.

Hurren was charged in early July with ramming a truck through a gate at Rideau Hall and threatening the Prime Minister. Police said Hurren, a Canadian Forces member, was armed with two shotguns, a rifle and a revolver at the time, but was arrested “without incident” as officers took time to de-escalate the situation.",[]

Ottawa Public Health reported two new cases of COVID-19 on Friday, but no new deaths.

The number of deaths in the city from the virus stands at 263. The last time Ottawa Public Health reported a death from COVID-19 was June 26.

In addition, the one person hospitalized by the virus has left intensive care, the latest public health report says. They had still been in intensive care as of Thursday’s report.

Eight more people have recovered from the virus, meaning the number of active cases in the city has fallen to 40.

Ottawa has had 2,130 total cases of COVID-19. Of those, 1,827—more than 85 per cent—have been resolved.

Below you will find the latest figures from Ottawa Public Health on all current COVID-19 outbreaks in the city. These data are compiled from the daily reports from Ottawa Public Health unless otherwise stated. If an institution is not listed, that means it has never experienced an outbreak of COVID-19 as of the most recent reporting.

Since April 1, a single staff or resident case of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 is considered an outbreak in A long-term care home, retirement home, or other non-hospital congregate setting.



Since May 10, 2 staff or patient cases of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 within a specified unit within a 14-day period where both cases could have reasonably acquired their infection in hospital is considered an outbreak in a public hospital.

Ottawa Public Health warns these data may differ from other numbers published elsewhere due to data entry lag, different reporting sources, or download times. Please note these numbers are preliminary and will continue to change as new information is received, and quality assurance work takes place.

Johnson'],2020-07-10 08:31:00-04:00,"Bill Nye the Science Guy took to TikTok to demonstrate why the general public should wear a mask.

""Why do people in the scientific community want you to wear a face mask when you are out in public?"" Nye asks in his social video.

""Masks prevent particles from my respiratory system from getting into your respiratory system... Blocking the movement of air is an old trick.""

Nye then uses a candle to show how much air and other respiratory particles escape his mouth when it is covered by a variety of fabrics.

He starts with a plain ordinary scarf to demonstrate how it is used to block the wind from his neck, but when he covers his mouth with it, the scarf is not as effective. The candle gets blown out.

Next, he uses a homemade two-layer cotton mask that has a pipe cleaner in the top to conform it to his nose. The candle moves, but remains lit, showing that even a DIY sewing project can keep air and respiratory particles from escaping.

In a second video, he continues his experiment with an N-95 mask, and the candle remains unaffected.

""The reason we want you to wear a mask is to protect you, sure, but the main reason we want you to wear a mask to protect ME from YOU!"" He exclaims towards the end of the video.

""This is literally a matter of life or death.""

Nye's videos have been viewed over seven million times since he posted them on Wednesday, and they were even shared by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Twitter.

Face coverings are required in a handful of states and a certain number of cities as well. Though the use of masks has been somewhat controversial over the course of the coronavirus pandemic, a recent study found that the use of masks and face coverings has been the most effective way to reduce person-to-person spread of coronavirus.",[]

While many other facilities, including splash pads and outdoor pools, have been permitted to reopen as part of Stage 2, playgrounds are still off limits in Ontario.

Speaking to CP24 on Saturday morning, Tory said he believes playground equipment will be on the list of things that can reopen when regions move to Stage 3.

""We will be making sure those playgrounds are safe. We wouldn't open them if they weren't safe. But they will be part of (Stage) 3 and I think that is coming soon if all stays the way it is,"" he said.

While restaurant patios, hair salons, and shopping malls have reopened as part of Stage 2, a large swath of businesses and facilities remain closed around the province, including indoor swimming pools, fitness studios, movie theatres, and amusement parks.

The provincial government has not said when regions can advance to Stage 3 but has indicated that health officials will need to see a consistent decline in new cases and hospitalizations before moving forward.

The number of new and active cases of the virus has continued to trend downward in the province over the past month.

At the height of the pandemic, more than 1,000 people were hospitalized with COVID-19.

Tory said playgrounds will be regularly disinfected when children are given the go ahead to use the equipment again.

""You can't be disinfecting every time somebody uses it,"" Tory said. ""We have to rely on the good sense of the people of Toronto, as we do with Bike Share, for example, where we say look we are going to disinfect them once a day but bring along some wipes and help to look after this yourself.""",[]

""At a time when there are no people coming, when there are no flights coming and when the hotels are basically empty, this is going to be a big deal,"" Tory told CP24 in an interview on Friday evening after the decision was announced.

""It's going to fill up at least two hotels and probably more for several weeks.”

In April, the city projected a $1.5 billion loss in revenue this year because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The mayor described that figure as a ""best-case scenario.""

The NHL and NHL Players' Association announced that they have ratified return-to-play protocols, which include Toronto and Edmonton as hub cities, and a four-year extension to the current collective bargaining agreement.

""While we have all worked very hard to try to address the risks of COVID-19, we know that health and safety are and will continue to be our priorities,"" NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said in a statement.

""We know that all of our fans are excited about our return to the ice.""

TSN hockey insider Bob McKenzie said the agreement gives players and team owners a six-year runway to repair the significant economic damage done by COVID-19 to the league.

""I'm sure there are players that don't love everything about this return to play or this CBA. And I'm sure there are some owners that don't love it either,"" McKenzie said.

""But when you weigh the decision that had to be made in terms of two years of economic Armageddon, and then an uncertain future after that versus six years of knowing how you're going to manage the economics of the game, well, obviously that was the choice that both the owners and the players made.""

The mayor credited the league and Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment for making this happen. He said both organizations went through a painstaking process to satisfy all medical officers of health in all levels of government.

""There were a lot of requirements. Nobody was going to let this happen without making sure that you can keep all the players and all the officials and everybody safe, but also all the people of those cities, Edmonton and Toronto,"" Tory said.

He believes the modified NHL season will be a good national unifier.

""It is going to put the spotlight on Toronto across North America in terms of the hockey world. When people do start visiting again, they'll once again see our city like they did when the Raptors were in the finals last year,"" he said.

""It would make the fans very happy and proud that those games are going on inside our arena,"" Tory said.

""I look forward to that delicious moment when in the arena in Edmonton since the finals are going to be played there, the mayor of Edmonton has to watch the Toronto Maple Leafs hoisting the Stanley Cup.""

""While we have all worked very hard to try to address the risks of COVID-19, we know that health and safety are and will continue to be our priorities,"" NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said in a statement.

""We know that all of our fans are excited about our return to the ice.""

TSN hockey insider Bob McKenzie said the agreement gives players and team owners a six-year runway to repair the significant economic damage done by COVID-19 to the league.

""I'm sure there are players that don't love everything about this return to play or this CBA. And I'm sure there are some owners that don't love it either,"" McKenzie said.

""But when you weigh the decision that had to be made in terms of two years of economic Armageddon, and then an uncertain future after that versus six years of knowing how you're going to manage the economics of the game, well, obviously that was the choice that both the owners and the players made.""

The mayor credited the league and Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment for making this happen. He said both organizations went through a painstaking process to satisfy all medical officers of health in all levels of government.

""There were a lot of requirements. Nobody was going to let this happen without making sure that you can keep all the players and all the officials and everybody safe, but also all the people of those cities, Edmonton and Toronto,"" Tory said.

He believes the modified NHL season will be a good national unifier.

""It is going to put the spotlight on Toronto across North America in terms of the hockey world. When people do start visiting again, they'll once again see our city like they did when the Raptors were in the finals last year,"" he said.

The Toronto Maple Leafs will face the Columbus Blue Jackets in the qualifying round.

""It would make the fans very happy and proud that those games are going on inside our arena,"" Tory said.

""I look forward to that delicious moment when in the arena in Edmonton since the finals are going to be played there, the mayor of Edmonton has to watch the Toronto Maple Leafs hoisting the Stanley Cup.""

In March, Canada and the U.S. agreed to temporary close the border to non-essential travel while keeping it open for commercial traffic.

Since then the agreement has been extended on a number of occasions with the latest iteration lasting until at least July 21.

At this point it is unclear whether the border closure will be extended again, though Ford said at his daily briefing on Friday that he has already told Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland that he is not supportive of opening it up this month.

“I said very clearly I am not in favour of opening up the borders July 21. As long as the goods and products are flowing which they have been (we should keep it closed). I love our American neighbours but not right now,” he said. “Come and visit us when things cool down especially south of the border.”

The U.S. recorded nearly 60,000 new cases of COVID-19 on Friday, including a near-record 11,433 in Florida alone.

In Canada, meanwhile, transmission of the virus continues to wane and over the last week there have been about 380 new cases per day on average.

Ford said on Friday his hope is that government officials will continue to be “very cautious” when it comes to reopening borders, particularly the one to the south.

“I talked to a very smart doctor the other day and I said ‘Doc when do you think the second wave is coming?’ and he said ‘Doug, as soon as you open up the border to international travel that is when you are going to get hit.’ So that is concerning,” he said.

There have now been more than three million confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the United States, making it the hardest-hit country in the world.

There have also been more than 133,000 deaths.

Speaking with CP24 earlier on Friday, infectious disease specialist Dr. Issac Bogoch said that Canada is now at the point where it has the pandemic mostly under control and the United States is “the complete opposite.”

He said that so long as that is the case, the border should be closed.

“If we reopen our border we are going to import more cases to Canada and we could undo everything we have done here which would be really upsetting,” he said. “I think it should be closed for the foreseeable future.”",[]

According to Friday's epidemiology report, 35 of the new cases were found in Peel Region, 14 were found in York Region, 23 were found in Toronto and 10 were found in Windsor-Essex, a region that has been grappling with outbreaks among migrant workers.

Of the new cases in Ontario, 86 are between the ages of 20 and 59. There are 14 patients who are 19 years old or younger and 17 patients who are over the age of 59.

Emergency crews were called to the mall, located near Ellesmere and McCowan roads, just after 2 p.m. after receiving numerous reports of gunfire in the area.

When officers arrived at the scene, they found a man suffering from a gunshot wound in his abdomen area. The victim was rushed to the hospital for treatment is currently in serious, but non-life-threatening condition, police said.

""What I can confirm now from our preliminary investigation is officers have confirmed that the shooting occurred outside of the mall,” Toronto police Const. Alex Li said. “Currently, entrance three to the mall is closed.""

Investigators say that the suspects fled the area in a dark-coloured SUV travelling in “an unknown direction.”

At the scene, Insp. Paul Rinkoff told reporters that the “immediate area” around the mall has been locked down to assess the scene, speak to witnesses and gather surveillance video.

“The information we have is that the victim was situated outside the mall. It’s too early to tell if this was targeted. We don’t know the motive at this time,” he said. “Investigators are on scene, we are interviewing, [and] hopefully we will be speaking to the victim shortly.”

Premier Doug Ford announced the ""Ontario Made"" program during a news conference on Friday saying the initiative would help residents better identify products made in the province.

“As we fight to get through the economic downturn, now more than ever, we need to support our own,” Ford said. “We can’t forget that as a province our collective buying power is massive. We generate 40 per cent of the Canadian economy. We are titans of industry – and I know that every Ontarian is proud of what we do.”

The $500,000 in funding for the campaign would come from the $50 million Ontario Together Fund, which was launched in April. The highlight of the program is the creation of a ‘Ontario Made’ logo that manufacturers can use to identify their made-in-Ontario products.

Developed by the Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters, the province says that the organization will meet with major Ontario retailers to promote the program in their stores as well as increasing visibility for customers.

Additionally, the launch of the program will include a new online portal which will connect consumers and supply chain partners to manufacturers of products made within the province.

“Ontario is Canada’s economic engine and workshop and our quality is second to none,” said Minister of Economic Development Vic Fedeli.

“This [program] will help in Ontario and beyond. We all have a role to play and we thank the CME for leading this important initiative,” Fideli added.

The announcement comes as Ontario works to restart the economy following months of closure as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Now more than ever we need to support our own.

Patients with HIV can manage the virus with treatment and anti-HIV drugs, but if a person stops their life-long therapies the dormant, hiding virus can rapidly re-emerge.

The hiding virus is known as the “latent reservoir” and is what prevents a cure for HIV.

“The aim is to get it all out of dormancy with a targeted punch, so the remaining virus can be killed,” said lead researcher Prof. Eric Arts.

“Now that we’ve shown that this can be done with patient samples at early HIV disease, the hope is this will lead to targeted cure strategies.”

Arts and his team say they have developed a way to pull HIV out of the latent reservoir making it visible to the immune system and providing the chance to be killed by treatment.

By studying cells from individuals who are HIV positive and receiving treatment early in disease, the team, in collaboration with Case Western Reserve University and Imperial College London, has shown that their formulation, called Activator Vector (ACT-VEC), was successful in targeting the latent HIV reservoir.

“If the virus is not replicating, the drugs can't have an effect on it. By reactivating the virus, we can either inhibit it through antiretroviral therapy or it can be targeted by the body’s immune response,” said Jamie Mann, researcher on the study.

This strategy is known as “shock and kill.” Essentially the virus is shocked out of hiding, now researchers need to determine if they can kill it.

The team looked at whether the virus was actually hiding in the very cells that are designed to kill it, mainly T cells.

“ACT-VEC is designed specifically to activate these cells that had previously responded to HIV that now remain dormant,” said Arts.

“This activation has a dual purpose - it stimulates the remaining virus out of dormancy and induces the immune system.”

The team will now move into studying ways to kill the newly reactivated virus.

The study was published in the journal eBioMedicine where it can be read in full.",[]

Chief Tanner called Singh’s suggestion that the RCMP would have handled the July 2 situation differently if the suspect was not white “politics at an all-time low.”

Ohhhh Mr Singh ⁦@theJagmeetSingh⁩ ⁦@NDP⁩ really? A situation safely resolved and you choose to somehow make it an issue about racism? I suppose you openly believe the accused should have been killed by the Rcmp then.Politics at an all time low https://t.co/MG570OylDO — Chief Steve Tanner (@ChiefTanner) July 9, 2020

Corey Hurren, a 46-year-old reserve Canadian Ranger from rural Manitoba, stands accused of ramming a gate to the Rideau Hall grounds, where Governor General Julie Payette and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau currently reside, and roaming inside the grounds while allegedly carrying a semi-automatic rifle, extended magazine, two shotguns and a revolver.

He was able to walk for 13 minutes before he was confronted by RCMP officers who surrounded him and took him into custody without incident after about 90 minutes of discussion.

When asked Wednesday if he thought the situation would not have ended peacefully if Hurren was not white, Singh said “yes.”

“That contrast - someone showed up to potentially kill the prime minister of Canada, or with weapons at his residence, and that person was arrested without any violence and you had a person who in his own home was killed,” Singh told The Canadian Press on Wednesday. “That to me is what systemic racism in policing is all about, that difference.”

Singh was referring to the deaths of 62-year-old Ejaz Choudry in Mississauga’s Malton area, Regis Korchinski-Paquet in Toronto, Chantel Moore in New Brunswick and Rodney Levi, also of New Brunswick, who were all shot dead or died in interactions with police over the past two and a half months.

All four were not white and were in the throes of severe mental health crises when they encountered police.

Their deaths and previous incidents, including the police shooting death of D’Andre Campbell in Brampton in April, have emboldened an existing major movement across Canada to deal with systemic racism in policing and defund police services, transferring some of those funds to other organizations that deal with mental health.

Tanner said on Twitter he wished Singh would have commended the RCMP for its handling of the Rideau Hall situation.

Agreed. Making a point. This is Twitter. He’s a political leader. He could also have commended the RCMP officers involved and say that he wished all instances were more like this one. — Chief Steve Tanner (@ChiefTanner) July 9, 2020

He also referred to a July 8 incident in Oakville where police arrested a barricaded male teen armed with a knife after a standoff, suggesting the fact the teen was not injured in the encounter meant the incident would “never make the front page.”

The Halton Regional Police Service said Thursday that Tanner’s comments were his own.

Mississauga’s city council approved a new bylaw on Wednesday making masks mandatory in all indoor public spaces to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

This comes one day after masks became mandatory in all public indoor spaces in Toronto.

Mississauga Mayor Bonnie Crombie told CP24 that masks will add more protection from the virus and hopefully avert the second wave of the pandemic.

""I'm really proud of my council for stepping up and doing the right thing,"" the mayor said.

""I'm very pleased that there will be a coordinated approach, and people will understand if they're going inside, whether it's a retail establishment, an indoor mall, any indoor common area that a face covering will be required.""

Crombie is urging those who oppose the bylaw to do the right thing in order for the city to move to phase three sooner.

""There are many bylaws that are difficult to enforce, whether it's a seatbelt bylaw, bike, helmets, motorcycle, helmets, littering, for that matter, walking your dog on a leash, but we do them because they change behaviour. They modify behaviour,"" she said.

""We're asking you, please, please protect your friends, your neighbours, your family. Please protect your friend whose child may be undergoing cancer treatment. Please protect those businesses that are already open, want to stay open.""

Just like in Toronto, Crombie said people with medical conditions, respiratory issues and young children will be exempt from wearing masks in indoor public spaces.

Meanwhile, Brampton’s city council is meeting today to ratify its bylaw on mandatory masks.

Mayor Patrick Brown said masks could also become mandatory in the city this week.

“Right now staff are looking to implement it for July 10,” Brown told CP24. “That will give residents a few days to adjust and make sure that they can accommodate this new bylaw without the fear of fines.”

As for enforcement, both Crombie and Brown said education is the top priority to ensure people wear masks indoors but people could be fined if they don’t comply.

Crombie said the amount of the fine will be decided in council today.

“Any bylaw has to have some teeth so there will be a fine,” said Crombie. “We’ll be discussing that today in council. But staff have recommended a fine of about $130.”

Yesterday, Caledon passed a bylaw making masks mandatory in all indoor public spaces as of Friday.

Burlington is following suit with a motion on mandatory face coverings presented by Mayor Marianne Meed Ward and Councillor Shawna Stolte.

In a joint statement issued yesterday, the city officials said they are bringing forward the motion to the Corporate Services, Strategy, Risk and Accountability Committee tomorrow. A final vote is expected on Monday.

“Our understanding of the need for masks has shifted after learning more about the potential for asymptomatic spread of the virus,” said Ward and Stolte in a written press release. “We need to look ahead and be ready to use every tool available to us as we prepare for the eventual Stage 3 of the Province’s phased reopening.”

Elsewhere in the province, masks will be mandatory in Halton Hills starting tomorrow, in Durham Region on Friday and in the Waterloo area on Monday. Residents in Simcoe Muskoka will also be required to wear face coverings as of Monday.

Results of votes on the face covering bylaws in Mississauga and Brampton will be announced later today.",[]

In late March, the Ontario government allowed all restaurants to sell takeout alcohol alongside food to help them weather the COVID-19 lockdown. Some outlets that sell rare wines and spirits say customers are jumping at the chance to take home products that government-run liquor stores rarely carry.

Shamez Amlani, co-owner of La Palette, a French bistro in downtown Toronto, said his restaurant is selling more wine than it has in 20 years of business. Amlani said he sold 120 bottles in a single day near the start of the pandemic.

""Before, (my supplies) would have lasted me for months and months, but now I can go through them in a couple weeks,"" he said, adding his customers are drawn to the value of takeout wines versus the cost of dining in.

""If you were to spend $40 to $50 in a restaurant, you'd get the house wine or maybe the second-cheapest wine. But now, if you were to pull out $40 to $50, you're getting access to some pretty thrilling product that you might otherwise not know about.""

Glenn Wesley, the owner of Bathurst Local, a Toronto bar that specializes in imported sake, wine and craft beer, said his restaurant will rely on takeout sales even after the pandemic is over because the extra income will help it recover financially from the lockdown.

In fact, the bar has rebranded as an e-commerce platform where it offers provincewide shipping for its drinks.

""I'd expect it to be a vital point of anyone's business model for the foreseeable future,"" said Wesley.

He said he'd also expect the industry to push back against any moves to scale back takeout alcohol laws as lockdown measures are lifted.

""I would be really surprised if they took it away at any point,"" said Wesley. ""It's the new norm, and I don't think there's been a problem with it so far. Customers have really loved it, and so what would be the reason behind taking it away?""

A spokeswoman for the Ministry of the Attorney General reiterated that the takeout law is a temporary measure that ends on the last day of 2020, but did not say whether an extension is being considered.

""As Ontario carefully moves towards recovery, the government continues to work with licensed establishments to support a thriving hospitality industry in Ontario,"" Jenessa Crognali said in a statement.

""The health and well-being of Ontarians continues to be our top priority.""

But as more restaurants build a customer base around takeout alcohol, some owners said they won't let things go back to normal without a fuss.

Stuart Sakai, who runs Sakai Bar in Toronto, said his bar gives customers a personal experience when buying drinks.

He said customers pay a marked-up price to experience the environment when they dine in, and part of that can be carried over when taking drinks home from a small restaurant.

""The thing I've enjoyed doing very much is trying to continue that experience,"" said Sakai, who says 500 people subscribe to a newsletter that advertises his imported sake offerings.

""When they come and pick it up, maybe we chat about it for a while, they still get that experience part of it. I think people do very much enjoy that.""

Sakai said takeout sales might only be a supplemental form of income in the long term, but like other restaurant owners he said he'd like to see the new rules made permanent.

Amlani, who runs the French bistro, said he had spoken with his local member of provincial parliament about takeout laws even before they were implemented.

""I don't see why we should go back to what it was before,"" said Amlani.

""I will fight to keep this once Jan. 1 comes rolling around.""

Sales in the month of May compared to June spiked up to 89 per cent, and the average selling price for all homes in June was $930,869 — up 11.9 per cent compared to last year.

Bosley Real Estate Broker Davelle Morrison told CTV News Toronto Tuesday that there are many people who have decided they want to buy a home after being cooped up for months.

She said people living in condos are looking for homes, and people with homes are looking for cottages.

Morrison said she’s aware of several properties in the GTA which received multiple offers and is aware of one place in Toronto’s west end that received dozens of bids before it sold over the asking price.

“We got a bit of pent up demand and now the number of showings is basically back to pre-COVID levels. Everybody is ready to get out of their house and they want a new home,” Morrison said.

Morrison’s advice for buyers is to get a mortgage broker, have finances lockdown and do research.

Toronto couple with $1.1M budget looking to buy a home for a year

Together for a decade, Grégory Thinet and husband Jason Chow would love to upgrade from their two bedroom condo and buy a house.

They want a backyard, and have more space for pets and family.

“It’s been very frustrating to find our little piece of heaven because of how crazy the situation is in Toronto,” Thinet said.

The couple both have steady employment, but said they have yet to put in an offer because many properties sell for two to three hundred dollars above the listed price and therefore are out of reach.

“We’re hopeful. We’re always hopeful,” said Chow.

“This is our next step in our life, and we’d like to take it, but we can’t right now.”",[]

Restaurant and bar patios have been allowed to operate since Toronto entered stage two of the province’s reopening plan on June 24 but there has been come confusion around whether patios with a roof are permitted.

On Friday, the province announced that it is amending the emergency order to “to clarify that outdoor dining areas can open if they have a roof, canopy, tent, awning or other covering.”

The province said that in order to qualify as an outdoor dining area, at least two sides of the space must be open to the outdoors.

That means that restaurants with large garage doors that open to the outdoors remain limited to take out only for now.

The province also announced on Friday that it is issuing another emergency order to help municipalities quickly pass the temporary bylaws needed to allow for the creation of new patios and the expansion of existing ones.

The province said that in doing so it will help reduce the delay for the approval of new and expanded patios from “several weeks or more” to “a matter of days.”

The City of Toronto has already announced its own program to streamline the process for approving new and expanded patios and has said that it has approved more than 400 applications so far.

""Businesses across the province are demonstrating that we can still enjoy our beautiful Ontario summer while protecting the health and safety of their patrons,"" Premier Doug Ford said in a press release announcing the new emergency order. ""Restaurants and bars are an important part of our economy, and a great driver of employment. I am proud to say that we will continue to support them as our province reopens and recovers.""",[]
671,ctvnews,https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/durham-region-joins-most-of-gta-in-making-masks-mandatory-1.5012519,Durham Region joins most of GTA in making masks mandatory,[],2020-07-06 12:41:00-04:00,"TORONTO -- Durham Region will make it mandatory for residents to wear masks within public indoor spaces by the end of the week, joining a number of other GTA municipalities that have already announced similar policies.

Durham Region Chair John Henry announced the new policy in a statement issued on Monday morning.

He said that as of July 10, all residents will be required to wear masks or face coverings when in enclosed commercial spaces as well as “business offices open to the public” and other public buildings, such as libraries and community centres.

He said that businesses will also be required to “implement a policy for the use of non-medical masks or face coverings” and to “refuse entry when people are not wearing a face covering.”

Children under two are exempted from the policy, as well as anyone with a medical condition that makes it difficult for them to wear a mask.

“There is growing public health evidence that widespread use of non-medical masks or face coverings—when used with other public health recommendations—is effective in the fight against COVID-19,” the statement from Henry reads. “We intend to enforce this policy in ‘good faith’ using it as an opportunity to educate people on the use of face coverings, combined with other recommended public health practices, to help keep our community—and each other—safe.”

Masks will officially become mandatory in all indoor public settings in Toronto as of Tuesday following the passage of a bylaw by city council last week.

Similar bylaws are also expected to go into effect in other GTA communities in the comings days and weeks.

Brampton passed its own mandatory mask bylaw at a meeting last week but it still needs to be ratified by city council on Wednesday. The mayors of Mississauga and Caledon have also committed to making masks mandatory but the proposed bylaws in those communities still need to be considered by their respective city councils as well.

York Region Council will also hold a special meeting on Thursday to consider its own policy after repeated lobbying from Markham Mayor Frank Scarpitti.

In his statement, Henry said that residents do not need to wear a mask or face covering “while eating on a restaurant patio” or “in the workplace where other standards apply” but will have to get use to donning one when in public settings that are enclosed.

It should be noted that the policy is being implemented under powers given to the region’s medical officer of health by the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act and not through a bylaw, as has been the case in other communities.

The mayors and chairs of the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area municipalities previously wrote an open letter last week asking the province to issue a blanket order making masks mandatory in large municipalities but Health Minister Christine Elliott refused to do so, citing the fact that local officials already had the authority to implement their own policies.",[]

Toronto's top doctor answers virus-related questions,[],2020-07-08 21:47:00-04:00,"TORONTO -- Toronto Public Health recorded 57 new COVID cases over the past two days, bringing the city's total to 14,735.

Of those cases, 12,935 have recovered, while 1,110 have died.

On Tuesday, the masks became mandatory in indoor settings. Peel Region is also set to make face coverings mandatory on Friday.

""I do think that using masks is a very simple and relatively inexpensive intervention and an action that we can all take in order to best protect our community and to find that way for us to co-exist safely with COVID-19 in our community,"" Dr. Eileen de Villa, the city's medical officer of health said.

De Villa stopped by CP24 on Wednesday to answer COVID-19 questions from viewers.

CP24: Do you sense the residents in the city understand how important masks are in fighting the spread of COVID-19?

De Villa: I think I've been so impressed with the residents of Toronto. We've all worked so hard together to get where we are. And it's clear that we all want our city back and we want to have some sense of normalcy. My sense is when I go outside, I do see more and more people wearing masks, and people are really trying to maintain that physical distancing, even as they are wearing masks, which is the right thing to do. I've been super impressed thus far, and I hope to continue to see more people and now hopefully joined by the people of the city of Mississauga.

CP24: Why are apartment condo elevators and public spaces exempt from mandatory masking bylaw? There are all kinds of people who use elevators and don't wear masks. There are bylaws on social distancing and elevators but nothing regarding masks.

De Villa: There are some exceptions to the mask bylaw, but that doesn't change the fact that masks are still officially the recommendation. And it is certainly the advice that's being put out there for landlords and property managers who are in charge of maintaining condos and apartment buildings.

This is the kind of thing that actually makes sense for our community, whether you're living in a multi-unit dwelling or whether you live in your own home. We're certainly putting out that information and making it available for landlords and property management types to be able to use and create that kind of environment. I hope that by having it in these other public spaces, it becomes part of our habit and part of how we just do and how we live in our city regardless. It becomes just how we do and how we co-exist with COVID-19 until we get treatments or a vaccine to protect us.

CP24: Speaking of exemptions, is there a concern that people who can't wear masks may take some heat from people for not wearing them?

De Villa: I understand that people will have questions. People will be concerned in certain settings, and that's understandable. But, I've seen a great deal of understanding amongst Torontonians. And the expectation isn't that you have to have some kind of sign or that you need to justify what the reason is. I think the issue is, how do we co-exist with COVID-19? How do we co-exist with each other?

And if we can offer those who cannot wear a mask some space, let them go and do whatever it is that they need to do in public space quickly, and then move on. I think that's really the best thing that we can all do. It's how we co-exist safely with each other and with the virus in our community.

CP24: With the emerging evidence from the World Health Organization that the virus could be airborne, how will this change safety measures moving forward? Why do you think this potential of an airborne virus wasn't caught sooner, and would it have made a difference?

De Villa: I think these are interesting debates that are ongoing, and it tells you that we're dealing with a new virus. There's still some uncertainty here because this is again a virus that was only discovered in January. There is still much understanding within the scientific community that has to be formed. We've learned a lot for sure, but there is still much more that we need to learn. What I think we're getting at is that it may linger in the air for a little bit longer or travel a little bit further, especially if it's aided by air conditioning flow that kind of thing.

But at the end of the day, physical distancing is still important. And it's still the mainstay of protecting oneself and each other from a spread of coronavirus. It just bolsters the argument for masks because if we can protect ourselves and protect each other by stopping the spread of our germs, then frankly, the airborne issue becomes a non-issue or less of a problem.

Wear those masks when we can't physically distance, wash our hands and do the best we can until we have treatments and a vaccine.

CP24: Do you have any concern about running people going outdoors exercising who are not wearing shirts or coverups from the waist up who are sweating profusely? Droplets are falling off bodies, whether walking, jogging, or cycling, passing others. Do droplets not travel? Is this airborne-related?

De Villa: When it comes to COVID-19 risk of transmission outdoors, it is definitely reduced. It's a question of just practicing good respect and courtesy. If you're going to do that and sweating profusely or spreading droplets in one form or another, try to pass people quickly give them their space. But by and large, the risk of coronavirus or COVID-19 transmission in the outdoors is significantly reduced, just because you've got big air and constant wind movement. So not a lot of what we would call dilution.

CP24: Where can we go to socialize safely?

De Villa: It is hard to stay isolated at home, and we are social creatures, and that counts a lot for health as well. Having the opportunity to interact with each other. With our social circles, we are allowed to have a social circle of up to 10 people. And with those in your social circle, you can get closer, and you don't need to maintain that physical distance. Hugs and physical contact are allowed within that social circle. If you have a bigger social circle, you need to continue maintaining that physical distance. Socializing outdoors, mainly if physical distance is maintained, creates a circumstance where you can still have fun connect with others, but do so in an environment that's definitely lower risk.

CP24: How concerned are you when you see the surge of COVID-19 cases in the United States in the past few weeks?

De Villa: It gives rise to concern. I worry about what has been happening in some of their hospital systems. We're seeing their healthcare system in Texas and other states getting overwhelmed, and that's always a concern. These are the kinds of lessons and experiences we should be heeding to continue to have our progress. We don't want to slide back into negative circumstances. I would encourage us to watch what's happening and to continue our progress by keeping up with those public health measures, keeping up with the physical distancing, the wearing of masks when that's not doable, hand-washing, avoiding touching your face and staying home when you're not feeling well.

CP24: When will serology testing be available to Toronto residents?

De Villa: What's being referred to is a blood test to determine whether you have been already exposed and might have some degree of immunity to COVID-19. These tests are in development. Some are technically available but not yet available to us here in Ontario. I understand that our provincial counterparts are working on this and working to make it available and determine the circumstances when the test can be used and, therefore, who gets access to it. Stay tuned. My understanding is that there's work happening on that right now. We'll look forward to telling people when we hear more about it.

CP24: How effective is the test in fighting the spread of COVID-19?

De Villa: You can think about whether that might create circumstances where people can understand, can they now go into an environment where they might not otherwise have been able to go because there's concern that they're infectious or that there's a risk. I think that there are a number of uses. The question is, how expensive is the test? How reliable is the test? And therefore, how best should it be used? I know that our provincial counterparts will be working on that and figuring those important questions out.

CP24: Actor Tom Hanks who recovered from the coronavirus, recently shared that a recent test showed his COVID-19 antibodies are fading. What does that say about being immune from the virus?

De Villa: What we're hearing about in respect of immunity after having had a COVID-19 infection is that we're still learning. We're still trying to understand this new virus. The interesting thing is, is that you would expect with as, with most viruses that after you have an infection, you'll have immunity for some degree of time. The real question is, how long? How long does this immunity last? And that's a question that we have yet to answer given that the virus has only been with us for a number of months. We don't really have all that much experience. It's one of those areas that we need to continue to watch and continue to monitor.

CP24: When will you allow tennis players, especially the seniors, to play doubles games, which is pretty safe because of at least two meters distancing? She says playing singles is for the young, and most seniors have no stamina to play it.

De Villa: I do believe that that comes in stage three as part of the province's reopening plan. And I appreciate and understand that people do want to get out there. As I understand it now, though, if somebody is in your social circle, that doubles game would be allowed for those within your social circles. If you're lucky enough to be in those circumstances, then you can go and do that.

CP24: A viewer says, I am a senior, and I have a hard time with a face mask, but can have, and have been wearing a face shield. Are face shields considered a face covering?

De Villa: I understand and appreciate that many people prefer having a face shield over a mask or a face covering because you're just able to breathe easier. You don't have that same coverage over your nose and mouth. But at the end of the day, a face shield is not a substitute for a mask or a face covering. You just don't get the same sort of protection for others. You don't get the same prevention of the spread of germs. While I appreciate that you get that coverage over your eyes with a face shield, it really isn't meant to be a substitute for a mask or a face covering.

673,ctvnews,https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/ontario-residents-more-likely-to-wear-a-mask-than-other-regions-in-canada-survey-says-1.5015645,"Ontario residents more likely to wear a mask than other regions in Canada, survey says",['Katherine Declerq'],2020-07-08 11:28:00-04:00,"TORONTO -- Ontario residents are more likely to wear a mask and wash their hands than those in other regions of Canada months into the COVID-19 pandemic, a new survey says.

According to a report by Canada’s national statistics agency issued on Wednesday, about eight in 10 Ontario respondents—or about 78 per cent—said they would wear a mask if physical distancing were not possible.

Fewer than 70 per cent of respondents from other regions reported that they would wear a mask in crowded places, with Quebec residents at the bottom of the list at about 52 per cent.

The majority of Ontario respondents also said they have been avoiding large gatherings (89.4 per cent) and remaining two metres away from others (87.3 per cent).

The data shows that only 65 per cent of respondents in Quebec, which borders Ontario, say they keep a two-metre distance from others.

Statistic Canada also found that Canadians living in rural areas were less likely to report that they would wear masks in public compared to those living in urban areas—a fact that may be governed by the sheer difference in the number of COVID-19 cases in Ontario and Quebec compared to the rest of the country.

As of Wednesday, more than 92,000 of Canada’s 106,166 lab-confirmed COVID-19 cases can be found in those two provinces.

While there are regional discrepancies for some health safety measures, the majority of Canadians appear to agree that hand washing is a priority.

More than 90 per cent of survey respondents across all regions said they wash their hands more frequently now in an effort to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus with Ontario leading at 95.4 per cent.

Statistics Canada said that this data suggests “this measure has been widely adopted by most Canadians.”

About four in 10 workers in Canada feel unsafe returning to work

The survey found that about 38 per cent of Canadian workers reported not feeling safe enough to return to work due to the pandemic.

“The most commonly-reported reasons for not feeling safe were fear of contracting the virus and fear of infecting family members,” the survey said.

In Quebec and Ontario, more than 40 per cent of workers reported feeling unsafe about returning to work compared with the approximately 25 per cent in other regions.

The online survey was conducted by Statistics Canada between June 15 and June 21 and is the third poll since the pandemic was declared in March. In the report, Statistics Canada noted that “not all Canadians were equally likely to report that they would follow precautions in the context of activities resuming.”

Men were generally less likely than women to report whether they would follow COVID-19 health precautions, the report found, and young Canadians between the ages of 15 and 24 were less likely to report whether they would wear a mask or remain physically distanced from others.",[]

Ford said he is involved in active talks with Ottawa to secure funding for municipalities strapped for cash due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Municipal leaders said earlier this week that an aid package from both upper levels of government is needed to prevent tax increases and service cuts.

The premier said he is not willing to settle for the current federal offer because it is more than a billion dollars short of what's needed to help shore up Ontario communities.

""If I walked away, the municipalities wouldn't be too happy with the amount that the federal government's offering right now,"" Ford said.

The premier said Ontario represents 38 per cent of Canada's population, and he believes it should receive the equivalent to that in the federal deal.

""I don't rush a bad deal,"" he said.

Some municipalities have expressed frustration in recent months that they are stuck in the middle of a lingering stand-off between the federal and Ontario governments over the aid package.

The municipal leaders have said $10 billion is needed for communities across the country, including Ontario, and federal and provincial governments must resolve their differences before cuts and fee hikes are needed.

A spokeswoman for Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said the federal government recognizes municipalities face serious financial pressures.

""We have offered $14 billion to support Canadians and we hope we can soon conclude an agreement with all the premiers that will ensure this funding is delivered to those who need it,"" Katherine Cuplinskas said in a statement.

Meanwhile, Ford's government introduced a sweeping new piece of legislation Wednesday it said will help the province's economy recover from the pandemic.

The omnibus bill -- dubbed the COVID-19 Recovery Act -- proposes to change 20 pieces of current legislation that govern the province's schools, municipalities, and justice system.

Municipal Affairs Minister Steve Clark said if passed, the bill would speed up environmental assessments, offer new consumer protections and help address unemployment.

Ford defended the bill and said it will help change an environmental assessment process that has been on the books for decades.

""We aren't going to dodge (environmental assessments) or anything,"" he said. ""We're going to make sure we strengthen them, but we're going to do them quicker, smarter.""

Clark said the bill would also create an economic agency -- Invest Ontario -- to help attract more international investment to the province.

The 188 page bill also includes measures announced by Education Minister Stephen Lecce this week to end school suspensions for students in junior kindergarten to Grade 3.

Clark said with limited days of sitting at the provincial legislature, it made sense to combined the different changes into one package.

NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said the bill isn't actually a pandemic recovery plan at all, and is short on rent relief, solutions for long-term care, and details on schools required to truly help Ontarians.

""I'm worried that Doug Ford is using the COVID-19 recovery as cover to plow ahead with changes that have nothing at all to do with recovering from this pandemic,"" she said.

Green party Leader Mike Schreiner said changing environmental regulations is not necessary to get the economy moving.

""Caring for nature, farmland and water is a vital part of the economic recovery, not something we sacrifice,"" he said in a statement.

The government also tabled a motion on Wednesday to extend the province's state of emergency until July 24.

The current state of emergency declared at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic is set to expire July 15.

Ford's office said the government wants to extend the measure to ensure there is no gap between that declaration ending and a new bill extending Ontario's emergency measures taking effect.

Solicitor General Sylvia Jones introduced that bill on Tuesday, saying the province will need to keep some emergency measures in place in the months ahead.

Ontario reported 118 new cases of COVID-19 on Wednesday, and nine new deaths due to the novel coronavirus.

The total number of cases now stands at 36,178, which includes 31,805 marked as resolved and 2,700 deaths.

The province also reported 202 newly resolved cases, and completed more than 22,832 tests for the novel coronavirus over the previous 24 hours.

The number of people in hospital because of the virus, in intensive care units and on ventilators all slightly decreased.

Health Minister Christine Elliott said 30 of the province's 34 public health units reported five or fewer new cases, with 18 reporting none.

A number of towns and cities are now working on policies to make masks mandatory for people inside enclosed public or commercial spaces.

Here are what some regional and city councils in the Greater Toronto Area are deciding on:

Toronto

Toronto has now made it mandatory to wear face masks while inside enclosed public spaces. The policy came into effect on Tuesday in an effort to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 as more businesses start to reopen.

People in Toronto will now be required to wear a mask on public transportation and inside shops, grocery stores and malls.

They will not need to wear a mask while at home, while eating on a patio or at most workplaces where physical distancing is possible. It will also not apply to child-care centres or people who have underlying medical conditional that make it difficult to wear a mask.

Durham Region

Durham Region has said it will make masks mandatory for residents in public indoor spaces starting Friday. The new policy was announced in a statement issued Monday.

All residents will be required to wear a face covering while visiting enclosed commercial or public spaces, including public business offices, libraries and community centres.

The statement said that businesses will be required to implement the policy and to “refuse entry” to people who are not wearing one. Children aged two and under are exempt from the policy, as well as anyone with a medical condition that makes it difficult for them to wear a mask.

York Region

York Region Council is holding a special meeting on Thursday to decide on its own mandatory mask policy. Markham Mayor Frank Scarpitti was the lead on asking the Ontario government to implement a province-wide rule for a while. He is now trying to make face coverings mandatory in his region.

Peel Region

Peel Region and its area municipalities in Brampton, Caledon and Mississauga are also planning on implementing a mandatory masks rule.

The rule would temporarily require residents to wear a non-medical mask inside public spaces where physical distancing is not possible. Like the other regions, children under the age of two and people with medical conditions will not have to wear one.

Brampton city council decided on making masks mandatory at a special council meeting last week. The new policy is expected to be ratified by council on Wednesday.

Mississauga is also pursuing similar policies. Mayor Bonnie Crombie said she expects council to pass the bylaw on Wednesday. Caledon also passed a bylaw making masks mandatory in all indoor public spaces as of Friday.",[]

Speaking at Queen's Park on Tuesday afternoon, Health Minister Christine Elliott said any increase in allowable gatherings will be announced in conjunction with Stage 3.

""The public health doctors who have been advising us are asking that we proceed in stages and not to do things incrementally because they really want to see the effects of everything that we’ve done at a particular stage on its effect on public health,"" she said.

""So it is going to be something that will happen together with Stage 3.""

Under Stage 2 of the province's reopening plan, gatherings of no more than 10 people are permitted.

As of today, all regions in Ontario have been permitted to enter Stage 2, including Kingsville and Leamington, two municipalities that were held back due to outbreaks involving migrant farm workers.

As part of Stage 2, restaurant patios, hair salons, barbershops, and shopping malls were all given the green light to reopen.

The province has not said when regions will be allowed to enter the final stage of restarting the economy, which could involve the reopening of businesses such as fitness studios and movie theatres, which have been closed to customers since March.

Health officials have said there would need to be a consistent decline in the number of new cases and hospitalizations in order to proceed to the next stage.

New cases in the province are continuing to trend downward, with 112 new cases confirmed today, the second lowest number of new cases in months.

""Since it's going to be last stage we want to make sure our t’s are crossed and i’s are dotted,"" Premier Ford said last week.

Elliott said officials are still trying to determine the size of gatherings that will be permitted at Stage 3.

""The increase perhaps in the number of people for Stage 3 is something that is being discussed right now as the data is being analyzed but you will be able to expect, as time goes on, that the number of people involved in a gathering can be increased,"" she said.

""I can't advise you the exact number right now but that is what is currently being discussed at the health table.""",[]

“I nearly passed out. I thought where am I going to get the money to pay that bill,"" Kenny Wong said, speaking to CTV News Toronto.

Wong said he bought the property in February and he received the bill in June.

“It’s $38,000 and that's the outstanding water bill from the previous owner,"" Wong said.

Wong explained that on closing the deal for the property, his lawyer didn't check to see if the utility bills were paid in full. The home was vacant for a year and a half and he now believes a water pipe must have burst while the home sat empty.

“I called Alectra Utilities and they said due to privacy reasons I’m not entitled to know anything [about the previous owner] which is really frustrating, but they are demanding I pay the $38,000 outstanding.""

Wong feels the utility companyshould have known something was wrong and questioned why a bill would get that high.

“Why didn't they do anything about it? I mean that is really, really off the charts to add up to those kinds of dollars,"" Wong said.

When CTV News Toronto reached out to Alectra a spokesperson explained that they tried to collect the money from the the seller, but were unsuccessful.

“Mr. Wong was not informed about the water account arrears until the sale had closed,"" the spokesperson said. “It is the purchaser’s responsibility to ensure they understand any costs and arrears related to the property they are buying.”

Wong did purchase title insurance and has filed a claim hoping it will cover the cost of the bill. Alectra has now assigned an agent to Wong's s case and hopes the two sides can reach a reasonable resolution.

The most common reason for high water bills in the GTA is a running toilet. A single leaky toilet can waste more than 900 cubic metres of water in a month creating a water bill of more than $2,600.",[]

However, there are a few things you should know before you decide to rent a cottage or a vacation home to keep you and your family safe.

“Right now people have been locked up in their homes so now they are looking for somewhere to go and it's often nearby,"" Airbnb Canada Spokesperson Nathan Rotman told CTV News Toronto.

In the wake of the novel coronavirus, Rotman says Airbnb has adopted strict measures to ensure that their listings are clean and safe for guests.

“There are protocols of how to clean your home to make sure it is completely sanitized as well as making sure there is a buffer for guests,” Rotman said.

Meanwhile, some owners of rental cottages in Port Stanley, Ont. say they are anxious to have visitors from the Greater Toronto Area and are asking renters to bring their own personal belongings and groceries as well as limiting the number of guests.

“We are going to have our renters sign a contract simply stating the cottage is sanitized from best of our ability and that they assume all responsibility while renting from us,” owner Kate Deshaw explains.

Ideally, the property should already be disinfected but to be safe, you can also do a thorough wipe-down yourself, making sure to clean high-touch surfaces like counters, faucets, doorknobs and refrigerator handles.

You will also want to check the cancellation policy carefully and expect additional cleaning fees. You should bring sanitizer, masks and practice social distancing.

Family and friends, all together for the first time in months, gathered outside Erin Mills Lodge Nursing Home on Thursday to cheer and express their love to Jovita Lee, who smiled and waved at her physically distant visitors.

“It was bitter sweet because, of course, we couldn’t get too close, we couldn’t hug her or touch her but it was just a relief to be able to see her,” Lee’s granddaughter Sarah Barnett told CTV News Toronto on Thursday.

“To see all of us together at once and to see us singing happy birthday to her, I think that really lifted her spirts and for the first time she was able to lift her head up higher and just waive to everyone.”

Lee’s fight against COVID-19 was not easy. Her family says that she and her roommate were the first two people in their long-term care home to get the disease.

Lee, who had been moved into the home only two weeks before the pandemic hit, had trouble eating and was fighting a high fever.

Despite the outbreak at the facility being over, her family says it still took a significant toll on her. Her granddaughter said Lee now needs to use a wheelchair, has trouble lifting her head and is very low energy.

Barnett describes her grandmother, who came from the Philippines to Canada in the 80s, as a fun-loving person who loves the Toronto Blue Jays, parties, dancing and being in the spotlight, and so Thursday’s surprise was the perfect one.

“She loved to dance, loved having parties. Every year, she wants a party so she could invite everyone and feed everyone,” Barnett said.

Barnett said her grandmother, who loves to be around family, had a tough few months and lost some friends at the long-term care home due to COVID-19 after 17 people died at the home.

Now, Barnett said she’s glad things are starting to look better.

“She was already in an unfamiliar place and then shortly after to not see her family at all for three months [was hard],” she said. “[Thursday] was the first time she had seen us all together since moving to the home and overcoming the virus.”",[]

“I just decided to start this ‘Colours for COVID’ initiative because my husband’s a doctor working in a COVID-19 assessment centre at Mount Sinai,” Logan Lass told CTV News Toronto. “It was just a way for me to give back and really just help the community.”

Lass has been selling tie-dye clothing through her Instagram account, @ColoursForCOVID.

“I had a bunch of friends reach out and say, ‘I want a sweater! I want a hoodie!’” she explained. “I was like, why don’t I actually make these and raise money for a good cause. And so I’m donating 100 per cent of all net proceeds to Sinai.”

So far, Lass has sold more than 150 hoodies and has raised more than $4,000. Each hoodie costs $55.

“From us, just as customers, I think one, it’s great to support a friend who’s doing this,” Allison George, a coworker of Lass who purchased a hoodie, said. “I think it actually is a literal way to give comfort to people during a pandemic.”

“The response to Colours for COVID has been amazing,” Dr. Elliot Lass, Logan’s husband, said. “So many of my coworkers have supported it and I’m so proud of Logan.”

The funds raised are going to the Mount Sinai Health System, with donations helping with personal protective equipment.

Canadian volunteers with GlobalMedic are now working to assemble and send emergency food kits to those in need.

About 1,400 families in areas that were affected by Category 5 Hurricane Dorian will be receiving these kits.

The hurricane swept through the island, causing catastrophic damage, on Sept. 1, 2019.

In the months that followed, many people in the Bahamas were left strongly affected by not only the hurricane, but also the sharp decline in the tourism industry due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Some residents were just starting to get their lives back in order six months after the hurricane hit when all of a sudden no one was able to travel to the island anymore, leading to many people losing their jobs.

The global shutdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has slowed, and in some cases stopped, any progress made in rebuilding on the island, according to GlobalMedic.

Rahul Singh, the executive director of GlobalMedic, said these volunteers are now trying to help feed those in need, which he calls a step in the right direction.

The emergency food kits being assembled by the volunteers include grains, beans, rice, peas, and grits. The kits will be loaded onto a shipping container on Wednesday before being railed onto a boat in Halifax and then shipped out to the harbour in Freeport, Bahamas.",[]

Many parents, however, are getting creative, including Sepideh Coady, a mother of two young children.

“Right now we’re not going to the playground. We have to accept it,” Coady tells CTV News Toronto. “And we have to use whatever we have at home to keep them engaged and keep them moving.”

Coady is a yoga and pilates instructor, and has found a way to include her kids, ages two and four, in the physical activity.

“I’m telling you, it’s not easy. It’s challenging,” Coady said. “But I’m getting used to working out with them around me. And sometimes, engaging them. The more I engage them, the happier they are and they learn.”

One of the DIY (do-it-yourself) activities Coady came up with for her kids is an obstacle course in the living room, using items already in the house.

“I had these leftover cups from their birthday, and yesterday I thought, ‘let’s do some obstacle training!’” Coady said, laughing. “We’re connecting, we’re doing something together, and it’s a successful experience.”

Coady says that other activities she’s hoping to take on with her children in the coming weeks range from cooking to cleaning together.

“We have lots of time,” she says. “At the end, they’re happy, they’re entertained and they learn some life skills.”

Quieter DIY activities

When it’s time for some quieter activities, like arts and crafts, DIY expert Denise Wild says parents can make learning tools on their own.

“You can even have kids help you make these tools, and that way they’re crafting and creating and getting involved with their own education,” Wild said. “Use what you have at home, or search online. Pinterest is a great source for ideas and inspiration, and there are so many learning downloads right now that are available for free to use.”

Wild has the following DIY activity ideas for different age groups:

Pre-schooler: A mindfulness tub

“You create a little bin with lots of little goodies to help your child learn to regulate their emotions, whether you’ve got flash cards, maybe it’s Playdoh, some beads, puzzles and books. Anything that you can either do with your child, or your child can do on their own,” says Wild.

Kindergartener: A binder of printables

“If you just go online and even search ‘free learning printables’ or free learning downloads, you’ll find a lot of really great stuff,” says Wild. “If you put them into plastic sleeves, you can use a dry erase marker so that you can do the project over and over again.”

Elementary school student: Creative writing prompts

“So for older kids you can come up with questions and engage them in conversation. Encourage them to be thinking differently,” Wild explains. “I’ve got something that says ‘who do you admire?’, ‘if you could travel in time where would you go?’, and these are great for just discussing as a family or for having your child work on their creative writing.”",[]

Randy VanDerStarren was granted rare access to 60 locations in Toronto for the project, including attractions, sports fields, buildings and places of worship, to name a few.

Dubbed “TOgether,” the photos will be compiled into a book which will compare pictures of empty places in the city normally teaming with people and images of the same spaces as they reopen and see people return.

“You could get depressed, if you actually looked at all these empty buildings,” VanDerStarren told CTV News Toronto Monday. “I have a very rare lens that I get to look through to see that vitality come to life again.”

The ‘TO’ in ""TOgether"" is for Toronto and the project wouldn’t have been possible without VanDerStarren’s partner, Deputy Mayor Michael Thompson, who helped get permission to enter some the most tightly controlled places.

“While it was difficult with respect to the process, the fact of the matter is that we knew that the darkness that existed in the city as a result of COVID and everything being shutdown wasn’t permanent, but we really needed to capture that,” Thompson told CTV News Toronto.

“And at the same time, we needed to be aware as to what happens when we’re back again. We’re alive, we’re energized.”

Money raised throught the project is being directed to DonateTO –which is helping community organizations through the recovery.

VanDerStarren is volunteering his time for ""TOgether,"" and said being granted the access has been an honour and privilege.

”I hope the work we do not only captures these locations, but does it in a way that you, as a viewer, as readers will look at the book and will look at the gallery that will come out of this and say ‘that’s my city, and I’m part of its recovery, I’m part of overcoming this virus’, he said.

VanDerStarren said he hopes to finish taking the pictures of Toronto’s reopening by the fall and show off all the comparisons by the end of the year.",[]

“We were sitting in my backyard, and we were just talking about the amount of stuff we’re seeing on the news at the moment, and trying to find a way for us to make a change, or at least try to,” Leszek told CTV News Toronto.

“Just seeing everything you kind of feel the need to do something about it a bit,” adds Ishikura. “And like, do your part.”

The Grade 9 students from Humberside Collegiate came up with an idea for a fundraiser – they would sell posters supporting the Black Lives Matter movement to their family, friends and neighbours.

“We reached out on Facebook asking if there were any designers who were able to volunteer to help us out to create a fundraiser, and we had an amazing designer reach out to us and say she was more than happy to,” says Leszek.

“We gave her some ideas, and she was able to recreate them in her own way, and it was really helpful,” adds Ishikura.

In the end, the girls had three posters. They shared the posters with CTV News Toronto over a ZOOM call.

“The first one, which is the rainbow fist, that’s kind of the Pride one with the Black Lives Matter movement,” Leszek explains. “And then we have ‘This Home Believes Black Lives Matter’ and the BLM one that shows that we’re all together and we’re going to fight for change together.”

The fundraiser took off. Ishikura and Leszek began selling the posters for $15 each, and quickly raised nearly $3,000.

“We decided to donate it to Black Lives Matter Toronto because we thought it was important to do something local,” explains Ishikua.

The teens have been hand-delivering the posters to those who purchase them, often making the deliveries by bicycle. They say it has been exciting to see their posters in the windows of people’s homes.

“When people walk down the street and they see these posters everywhere, they know they have allies,” says Leszek. “We’re supporting them, there for them, and that we’re all working together to try to create change.”

Eleonor Lentini purchased one of the posters, saying she wanted to support the students’ initiative and efforts.

“I have two sons. I want them to hear the message,” Lentini says. “A lot of racism comes from the home. It starts from the home and it branches out, and we’re proud to place [the poster] on our window.”

Lentini also tells CTV News that she’s impressed by what Ishikura and Leszek are doing at a young age.

“These ladies are our future,” she says. “I just loved the fact that Callie and Sofi are in Grade 9 and took this on. There’s so much that the youth can do.”

Ishikura and Leszek have been friends since long before high school, having met in daycare at age two.

“We’ve been best friends ever since,” says Leszek, smiling.

“I think [the fundraiser] has brought us closer together!” adds Ishikura.

The teens hope that using their voices to support the Black Lives Matter movement will inspire other young people to use theirs, too.

“I know we’re fortunate. We’re lucky, and so we felt we needed to do something to help others,” Leszek says. “So much of the population is under 18 and they sort of feel powerless throughout this. We can show them that there’s things you can do to make a difference.”

“Right now, with everything happening, the only way to make change is if everybody makes change.”

The posters can be purchased at Cookery on Roncesvalles Avenue in Toronto for anyone who would like one of their own.",[]

“Prom would have been tomorrow and commencement the day after, so there is really no sense of closure in a way,” said Nelson Lee, who is graduating from Marc Garneau Collegiate .

Nelson is the student council president at his Toronto high school and had been planning the end-of-year celebrations long before the pandemic.

“It doesn’t feel as fulfilling,” he said about missing out on so many school events, graduation and other extracurricular opportunities.

He has been accepted to the University of Toronto’s Engineering program. He’s excited about the next chapter, but acknowledges it won’t be normal.

“The university has sent out a lot of information about they will proceed in September, for the larger classes they will be online and smaller seminars will be in person,” he said. “I think it’s a great combination for the best of both worlds at this time.”

In the meantime, with limited options due to the pandemic, he’s taking courses offered by UofT to prepare him for his first semester.

“Just to keep myself engage and push myself to learn new things during this time.”

Students organize virtual prom

Zaiboon Azhar wanted to make sure her classmates had the opportunity to celebrate their achievement. The Woburn Collegiate graduate was part of a national committee that organized a virtual prom with an open invitation to every high school student across Canada.

“The idea was to give the class of 2020 some sort of prom, graduation experience because it is difficult being all alone at home for months without access to your friends - we wanted to make these seniors feel special,” Azhar said.

The online event called ‘Prom is On’ was held in May and raised more than $150,000 for Kids Help Phone.

Azhar will attend the University of Toronto in the fall to study international relations.

Schools honour students with virtual graduation

Some schools are hosting virtual graduation ceremonies to celebrate their students achievements.

Bayview Middle School is hoisting a virtual graduation Tuesday evening, giving staff and students one last opportunity to connect.

“It means a lot to me because I will see my teachers talk one last time, just knowing I’m going to be present there with all my classmates and peers,” Grade 8 student Nadine Al-Junaidi said.

Nadine’s classmate Pradyumn Jha is equally excited about the opportunity to see friends one last time before going their separate ways to different high schools.

“For the past three years I’ve been thinking about this moment and having it virtual is showing how in these unprecedented times we’re being innovative and its better than no graduation,” Pradyumn said. “I’m looking forward to the new experiences and meeting new people, the new environment.”

Transitioning to high school can be anxious and exciting for students under normal circumstance. However, with the province recently announcing measures for the school year that include smaller class sizes and remote learning at home, these students don’t know what to expect.

“I’m a little bit nervous about what grade nine will hold and we still might be doing online learning, so I will have to see how it will go,” Nadine said. “It’s not how I hope to start high school career.”

If anything, these graduates say the pandemic has taught them to persevere.

“We need to do our best, we need to support each other,” Pradyumn said.",[]

Currently, high school students in Ontario are asked to choose between more practical, hands-on applied courses and more theoretical academic courses in core subjects like math, science and English.

The practice has been a subject of much debate, with critics arguing that the streaming process has disproportionately impacted racialized and low-income students, resulting in lower graduation rates and test scores.

Speaking at Queen’s Park on Thursday afternoon, Ford said academic streaming “can exclude a student form a world of opportunities later in life.”

He went on to state that the phasing out of streaming will begin in September 2021, starting with Grade 9 math courses. A new math curriculum for the de-streamed class will be unveiled at a later date, the government said.

“Our Black, Indigenous and racialized students face more social and economic barriers to success than their fellow students and that’s just not right,” Ford said. “They deserve the same shot at their dreams as any other young person.”

Ford also said that it was “unfair” and “not right” to ask students to make a decision at the age of 14 that could determine the course of their high school and post-secondary careers.

No further details have been provided regarding a timeline for the de-streaming of other core subjects or what the new curriculum will look like.

Ontario’s Advocate for Community Opportunities Jamil Jivani praised the policy, saying that he was streamed as a teenager and knows first-hand the impact the process can have on students.

“I was put into applied courses. And I know that very few people who experience streaming in our schools ever make it to a place like this, standing before you at an official podium alongside the premier of Ontario,” Jivani said. “By the grace of God I am here.”

Every student – irrespective of the colour of their skin, socio-economic status, heritage, or orientation – deserves to achieve their full potential.



We are breaking down barriers that have held students back for too long.

Teachers’ unions and advocates of the change have said that while they approve of ending streaming, they want to know more about what kind of supports will be available for both students and teachers.

Advocacy group People for Education, who has been lobbying for an end to streaming for years, said earlier this week that further details are needed about how students with different learning styles will be supported during the transition.

“You can’t just flip a switch,” spokesperson Annie Kidder said.

The change also comes as teachers are struggling to learn a new math curriculum for students in Grade 1 to Grade 8 in September 2020 while also adjusting to a new yet-to-be-decided educational format that would deal with the risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Ford government is also proposing additional and mandatory anti-racism and anti-discrimination training before the end of the calendar year.

A day earlier, the government has also introduced a bill that would ban the suspension of students in junior kindergarten up until Grade 3 for “non-serious offences.” The motion is part of a larger omnibus bill that is meant to help the province deal with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic once the state of emergency has been lifted.

If passed, the suspension ban would go into effect this September.",[]

He said he will personally call the owners of homes in Ontario without air conditioning and plead with them to have it installed.

The BC Human Rights Tribunal has ordered a man to pay his former house cleaner just over $44,000 in damages for sexually harassing and assaulting her while she worked for him.

According to the June 26 decision, the woman, who the tribunal refers to as M.P., began working for the man, J.S., in 2011. At that time her employer, who the tribunal refers to as J.S., was still married. His wife died in 2013.

At first, J.S. and M.P. had a warm and friendly relationship, according to the tribunal’s decision. She referred to him and his wife as Uncle and Auntie, and after J.S.’s wife died, M.P. and her husband included J.S. on some family outings.

But as early as 2012, according to M.P.’s testimony to the tribunal, J.S. would touch her shoulder or buttocks from time to time. The contact escalated over the years, to the point where J.S. would attempt to touch M.P.’s breasts and genitals and remove her clothing, and would repeatedly attempted to pull her down on his bed.

While M.P. attempted to stop working for him around 2015 or 2016, she and her husband testified that J.S. came to their home to ask why she had stopped coming to his house to clean.

M.P. testified that J.S. had threatened to tell her husband about what was going on and “break her family up,” so she returned to work.

M.P. testified J.S.’s unwanted sexual touching and coercion escalated in 2017, until an incident on Oct. 27, 2017 when she said he pulled her down on the bed, touched her breasts and her genitals and attempted to have intercourse with her.

For his part, J.S. testified that the sexual relationship had been consensual and that he had paid M.P. money after the encounters.

However, tribunal member Emily Ohler said that on the whole, she found the testimony of M.P. and her husband more credible than J.S.’s account. Ohler found that M.S. had been discriminated against on the basis of sex.

Ohler ordered J.S. to pay M.P. $40,000 for “injury to dignity, feelings and self‐respect,” as well as $4,300 for wages lost as a result of the discrimination. Ohler also ordered J.S. to pay a total of $156 to cover medication and tribunal hearing expenses.",[]

Marcel Hanson recorded the ordeal using his phone, and said he and other beachgoers at the popular South Surrey beach attempted to help the family by calling a tow-truck and the fire department.

But the sand on that part of the beach also claimed one of the tow trucks, which eventually had to be pulled out with a second tow truck.

“We were just relaxing at Blackie Spit on Crescent Beach,” Hanson said. “All of a sudden this G-Wagon (Mercedes SUV) with a trailer with a Sea-doo on it comes down the ramp there, through the sand.”

Hanson said he was surprised to see the vehicle driving on the beach, which is near the sailing club; most people who bring their boats down to the beach use a hand-trailer to move relatively light sailboats, and they usually put boats into the water at high tide.

Hanson observed the SUV going further and further into the mud on the beach.

“I thought ‘Oh my gosh, this is not going to end well,’” Hanson said

Several people gathered to see if they could help, and eventually Hanson called several tow truck companies – but all the companies said they wouldn’t be able to send a truck for two to three hours.

On the advice of the sailing club staff, one of the beachgoers also called the fire department. A Surrey RCMP officer also arrived at one point.

Clover Towing eventually did arrive, sending three trucks. One of those trucks got stuck itself, and had to be pulled out by another truck.

Two to three hours later, the Mercedes and the tow truck were finally unstuck. Based on what he heard from the sailing club staff, Hanson said it appears this happens around once a year.

Hanson said while the event made for “good entertainment” to beachgoers, “I felt really sorry for the people.""

“They probably just wanted to come to the beach to try out their new Sea-doo, and it just ended completely differently than what they anticipated,” he said.",[]

In the past two weeks, six catalytic converters have been stolen from vehicles in North Vancouver, according to the RCMP.

The valuable device is made from layers of precious metals designed to reduce many of the toxic emissions created by the vehicle’s engine.

Police say its metal components make it a target for thieves.

""Someone might steal one for its resale value, but more likely a thief will sell it to a recycling facility for the small amount of valuable metal it contains,"" the RCMP said in a release. ""A new catalytic converter costs between $100 and $200, but having one professionally installed will add hundreds of dollars to the bill.""

In a warning to the public, Sgt. Peter DeVries gave the example of a resident who called police after noting suspicious behaviour late one night in central Lonsdale.

""If it's 4 a.m., you hear a grinding noise on the street outside, you see a person under a car with a power tool, and there's a vehicle idling next to them – that's not your local house-call mechanic getting an early start on the day's work.""

Police also released a video on Twitter to demonstrate the sound residents might hear if someone is working to get the catalytic converter off a car in their neighbourhood.

If you hear this on the street at 4 a.m., call 9-1-1. It's a thief stealing a catalytic converter from under a car. A cat reduces exhaust pollutants. Thieves sell them to a recycling facility for the metal they contain.

If you witness this kind of behaviour, DeVries said, ""Call 9-1-1 and tell us what you see.""

The RCMP also share these tips to prevent the theft of a catalytic converter from vehicles:

• Park in your home garage, if possible

• Use motion sensing exterior house lights if you park in your driveway

• Park in a well-lit area

""That said, we know not everyone can park in a secure garage, or even in a driveway,"" said DeVries. ""The only choice for many people is to park on the street, and not everyone can park under a street lamp.”

He said the emphasis is on reporting suspicious activity, meaning if something seems highly unusual, it may also be unlawful.

""We understand it can be difficult to know what to report and what not to report,"" he said. ""This simple rhyme might help you make that decision, 'If in doubt, just give us a shout. We're always home and we'll answer the phone.'""

Anyone who thinks they may have witnessed the theft of a catalytic converter or who may have information about someone committing these thefts, is asked to call the North Vancouver RCMP at 604-985-1311 or Metro Vancouver Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477.",[]

Some indicated changes brought on by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including reduced opening hours and distancing.

But this sign referred to what some say is an unpleasant byproduct of current conditions: bad customer behaviour.

Under the title “Unacceptable,” the sign called out what was described as “appalling” disrespect and abuse towards staff.

“If you think you will be unable to behave in a calm, respectful manner and accept our current situation with empathy and an expectation of compromise, we kindly ask you to shop elsewhere,” it read.

George Schwab told CTV News he used to work at the store earlier this year, and experienced some rude customer behaviour himself.

“There is a sense that people, with their frustration, feel they can take it out on the employees,” Schwab said, and added they would try to explain the changes were for everyone’s safety, but it didn’t help.

“They ramp it up even more, and more, to the point where they’ve called myself, they’ve called all the employees….pretty derogatory names and swear words that we can’t say on TV. And it’s really sad.”

CTV News tried to reach the store’s independent owner, but did not hear back.

Home Hardware’s director of communications, Jessica Kuepfer, said while the sign was not one they provided to the store, the intention behind it was to try and protect employees.

“He wasn’t out of line in terms of suggesting that customers act in a kind and courteous manner,” Kuepfer said, and added shoppers have experienced a lot of change, and emotions are heightened. “We’re all dealing with a global pandemic, and as we strive to keep our stores safe, we ask that customers extend that level of safety and kindness back.”

Kuepfer said Home Hardware has created its own signs, which were also visible at the Davie Street store, reminding people that aggression, intimidation, and harassment will not be tolerated, and anyone behaving in that way will be asked to leave.

“We certainly did unfortunately need to create that sign in the last little while,"" she said. “We understand that it is a difficult and unusual time for everyone…we do ask that everyone is mindful of being a little more kind than necessary.”

Director of government relations for the Retail Council of Canada Greg Wilson said increased anxiety has ramped up the number of “problematic” interactions.

“I think people are accustomed to grocery stores and other stores being the same, and that they’re not right now completely the same, so I think there’s an element of that,” Wilson said, and added he thinks over the longer term, more businesses will end up investing in de-escalation training for their employees. “We encourage everybody to be kind, and remember that the employee in that retail store is also very anxious about their own health.”

Over the course of the day, a store employee came out and removed the unofficial sign, saying he was told to do so.

Kuepfer said the store owner made a decision to take the sign down, but was not asked to take that action.

Schwab said he remains grateful to the customers who were kind and would stand up to other shoppers getting out of line with the staff.

“I would just restate what Dr. Bonnie Henry has said all the time: Be kind, be safe, and be calm,” he said.",[]

The entire ordeal has left Kevin McIntosh shaking his head as he waits out another two-week quarantine at home.

""It's asinine, is it not?"" asked the 63-year-old, who lives a short distance from the U.S. border crossing into The Point.

""I put myself at probably substantial risk of being exposed to COVID-19 when it could have been done so simply by just going eight blocks across the border.""

McIntosh is the man behind an online petition urging the government to let B.C. residents with property in Point Roberts briefly cross the border to do necessary maintenance on homes and water vessels.

The roughly 2,800 signatories are calling for a special dispensation to access the small, sparsely populated pene-exclave (an area that can only be reached by passing through another area) to do things like shut off water, disconnect gas lines and secure their vacation properties from the threat of skunk and raccoon infestations.

In McIntosh's case, his primary concern was his 42-foot powerboat sinking at Point Roberts Marina, potentially releasing 400 U.S. gallons of diesel fuel into the ocean.

There are regular power interruptions at the marina, McIntosh said, and they sometimes mess with his boat's battery charging system. No battery power would mean no bilge pumps.

""Any water intrusion into the bilges would eventually fill it up and sink it,"" McIntosh said. ""You can imagine the problems that would ensue from an event like that, and I'm being prevented by the land border crossing agents from accessing the boat.""

Some residents have ponied up to have their boats towed back to Canada, but McIntosh said his was in pieces and not fit for moving. He was partway through the process of servicing his raw water cooling system when the pandemic hit back in March.

McIntosh credits one border guard with allowing him to briefly enter Point Roberts to check on the boat back on May 14, but he was only given 30 minutes to rush in and rush out. The guard made a strong impression, McIntosh said, that if he took a minute longer there would be hell to pay.

That little expedition triggered his first two-week quarantine at home.

After his petition garnered little traction, and after being brushed off by his local MP's office, McIntosh finally decided to try flying into the U.S. last Friday - despite some misgivings about spending time on an international flight, and in Washington state, where the COVID-19 case count is about 13 times higher than B.C.'s.

While his pleas have mostly fallen on deaf ears at the land crossing, McIntosh said the U.S. customs agents who screened him at Vancouver International Airport deemed his concerns a valid reason for entry.

He was ultimately able to fly to Seattle on a plane ticket that cost about $310, rent a car to drive to Bellingham for $134, and charter a flight to Point Roberts that cost him US$135.

That charter would have cost US$375, McIntosh said, but by sheer luck there were two other people looking to fly over to The Point that day.

He reached his boat Friday afternoon, and had it repaired and ready to move by the following Wednesday. McIntosh finally arrived at Steveston for customs clearance on Thursday, allowing him to begin his second quarantine.

""It was a journey, all right,"" McIntosh said.

With his boat now secured on blocks, McIntosh said he's done with his petition, but he's hopeful someone will take the reigns and formally present it to the government.

""Quite honestly, I'm somewhat angry at the political powers that be,"" he said. ""This world has just gone topsy turvy when it comes to thinking things through logically.""",[]
700,ctvnews,https://bc.ctvnews.ca/public-inquiry-into-long-term-care-would-take-too-long-says-seniors-advocate-1.5020121,"Public inquiry into long-term care would take too long, says seniors' advocate",['Michele Brunoro'],2020-07-10 19:16:00-07:00,"VANCOUVER -- While many agree the pandemic has highlighted serious flaws in B.C.'s long-term care system, the province's seniors' advocate is casting doubt on the need for a public inquiry.

Isobel MacKenzie believes changes to how the province provides long-term care are absolutely needed, but that a public inquiry would take too long to conduct. She said the circumstances will be reviewed, however.

“Whether it is what we would call a full blown public inquiry or whether it is looking at what happened and finding out what went wrong, where and why, certainly I believe the minister of health has indicated we are going to be doing that. I know my office will be doing that,” she said.

A number of family members came forward this week to speak about what they described as a disturbing lack of support for seniors at the outset of the COVID-19 outbreak at Lynn Valley Care Centre in North Vancouver. They have been calling for such an inquiry, even as B.C. Premier John Horgan has repeatedly rejected the idea.

The families said they saw seniors' calls for help go unanswered, and residents left in urine-soaked clothing for extended periods of time.

Mackenzie told CTV News one of the biggest issues facing long-term care is inadequate staffing, which impacts everything from feeding to bathing to bathroom use.

“We were seeing the impact of that magnified many times over in Lynn Valley (Care Centre),” MacKenzie said.

She suggested Lynn Valley, the first care home in the country to report a COVID-19 death, became a tragic learning ground.

""From that suffering came some positive outcomes in terms of learning what we could do better in subsequent care homes,” she said.

The MLA for North Vancouver-Seymour, Jane Thornthwaite, agrees that ""more could have been done,"" but also that a public inquiry would take too long to complete.

""We definitely need an independent review,"" Thornthwaite added. ""And it should start immediately.""

Of the 186 deaths from COVID-19 in B.C., almost three quarters have been linked to nursing homes.

From staff shortages to care aides infecting residents in multiple homes, efforts in some care facilities clearly failed to stop the spread of the virus.

And there continue to be significant outbreaks at seniors' homes in the province. The most recent is at Holy Family Hospital in Vancouver, where 13 residents have died.

Haro Park lost 11 seniors, and 25 residents died at Langley Lodge, which has had two COVID-19 outbreaks since the start of the pandemic.

“Langley Lodge invites some questions about how did that get so out of control so quickly given what we knew around controls at that point in the pandemic,” MacKenzie said.

Both the seniors' advocate and Thornthwaite agree change is needed.

The MLA also said there's ""not enough emphasis on giving seniors the support they need to stay at home as long as they possibly can and then the next issue is an entire revamp on the staffing.""

The seniors’ advocate expects her investigation to be complete by the fall, before an anticipated second wave of COVID-19 hits the province.",[]

As customers slowly trickle back, businesses may have to face another hurdle as discussions are now beginning about possible changes to Granville Street.

""We were a little bit taken aback because we had no advance notice of potentially any changes to the road network, Granville Street in particular, given that it is a busy thoroughfare,” says Claudia Laroye, executive director of the Marpole Business Improvement Association.

Laroye first learned TransLink will be recommending changes at the latest Mayors’ Council for Regional Transportation meeting on June 25.

Granville Street is one of 20 corridors that have been identified by TransLink as having major congestion.

""We need to look for efficiencies and we need to look for smarter ways to do that,"" says Ben Murphy, spokesperson for TransLink.

TransLink is exploring a variety of ideas, including changing left-turn signals and removing parking spots.

The idea of possibly losing parking has Laroye concerned.

She says businesses are just starting to pick back up as customers slowly become comfortable with the idea of dining in, shopping and attending appointments.

""To have all of that put in jeopardy at a time when everyone is operating at razor-thin margins…is not what we need to have right now,"" she says. ""What does parking removal mean for those areas? If in fact that is what’s being proposed.""

Murphy says TransLink wants to partner with businesses and will be consulting with them for the report.

""A strong transit system is absolutely a benefit to businesses as well, and I think we need to get away from this idea that it’s either transit or it’s business and you can’t have both -- you can absolutely have both,"" he says.

At the last meeting, TransLink numbers show ridership has gone down by 33 per cent of pre-pandemic numbers.

""In terms of encouraging transit, it’s not about speed, it’s about comfort and safety,"" Laroye says, adding many community members expressed at a recent meeting that that they didn’t feel comfortable riding transit because face coverings aren’t mandatory.

Laroye says she and other BIAs have a virtual meeting scheduled with TransLink next week.

While TransLink is consulting with stakeholders and providing proposals, it won’t be taking any actions.

""Ultimately, it’s the municipalities who decide what they want to do with their road space,"" Murphy says.

TransLink is expected to provide recommendations at the next mayors’ council meeting at the end of the month.",[]

The matriarchs, known as Gaandlee Guu Jaalang or “daughters of the river,” say in a statement the Queen Charlotte Lodge and West Coast Fishing Club reopened as a local state of emergency remains in effect because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Haida Gwaii is a remote community with limited health-care services and only two ventilators,” the statement says. “One case would devastate our communities.”

The statement says the matriarchs are upholding Haida law through the occupation of the villages, Jung and Sk'aawats.

Both the fishing lodge and club say they are fully complying with orders and guidelines issued by the B.C. government, health authorities and WorkSafeBC.

Brian Clive, vice-president of sales and corporate development for the lodge, said it has had several meetings with Haida leadership and developed plans so that workers do not go into town or anywhere near a Haida community. It also has medical staff on site and if a COVID-19 case were to develop, there's a plan in place to evacuate the affected person by air to Vancouver.

“We have gone to incredible lengths to avoid any contact with the communities and therefore have created what we call a zero-risk chance of contamination in the communities,” he said.

The lodge expects about 80 guests at a time, down from the typical 125, he said. None will be travelling from the United States because the border is closed, he said.

President Brian Legge said the West Coast Fishing Club is remotely located about 83 kilometres from the nearest community and only accessible by boat or air. It also has an emergency evacuation plan in place.

“First and foremost we would never put the health and well-being of Haida Gwaii communities and residents at risk and equally as important our staff and clients,” he says in a statement.

“That's why we have worked hard and gone to significant expense to eliminate all contact with the residents of Haida Gwaii and their communities through direct helicopter transportation from the mainland to our remote island and back.”

Without the plan, the club's employees would have been out of work and the business faced possibly unsustainable losses, Legge said.

The club is continuing to speak with the council of the Haida Nation, he added.

Duffy Edgars, chief councillor of Old Massett Village, said he supports the matriarchs and expected 20 to 30 people to occupy the villages. He said he didn't expect any interactions with lodge staff.

“We're just occupying our land and doing some fishing,” he said.

Haida member Deana Young, who was on her way to support the matriarchs, said the community is following physical distancing protocols, while children have not returned to school and are not seeing their elders.

“One person coming from outside our region is one person too many,” said Young.

The occupation of the land is an exercise of Haida rights to the land, she said.

“What we are doing is occupying our lands, asserting our rights to harvest the foods that we live on and to ensure food security for our communities,” she said.

703,ctvnews,https://bc.ctvnews.ca/18-months-house-arrest-for-b-c-physiotherapist-who-sexually-assaulted-multiple-patients-1.5019802,18 months house arrest for B.C. physiotherapist who sexually assaulted multiple patients,['Jen St. Denis'],2020-07-10 16:03:00-07:00,"VANCOUVER -- A B.C. physiotherapist who pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting multiple patients will serve 18 months of house arrest, followed by two years of probation.

Stephen Witvoet pleaded guilty to nine counts of sexual assault, after a total of 14 female patients came forward to report that he had touched or rubbed their breasts or genitals during physiotherapy sessions when there was no valid therapeutic reason for the touching to occur.

Witvoet will serve his sentence as house arrest for the first six months, and then have a curfew from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. for the next 12 months of his sentence, according to the reasons for sentencing.

Witvoet, a physiotherapist who practiced in Vernon, B.C., was originally charged with two counts of sexual assault after two women accused him of touching their breasts during physiotherapy treatments in 2015 and 2016, according to court documents.

A trial had started in May 2019, but had not concluded when Witvoet was charged with two more counts of sexual assault on June 7, 2019.

When police published a request for any other victims to come forward on July 12, 2019, several more women made police reports about similar assaults.

The women reported that they had made appointments for physiotherapy treatment, but during the sessions Witvoet had put his hands under their clothing and touched the breasts or genitals without their consent.

In his reasons for judgment, Judge Jeremy Guild explained that by pleading guilty, Witvoet avoided a series of lengthy trials. He said the court’s main consideration of the recommended sentence included the strength and weakness in evidence, but also the victims’ wellbeing.

Overall, Guild wrote, the victims preferred not to have to go through the ordeal of a trial.

The women who filed victim impact statements said the assaults made them feel “shame, guilt, depression, panic attacks, and loss of ability to concentrate and function at work,” according to court documents.

They said they had “decreased trust in others, fear for other family members, fear of treatment from professionals, difficulties in relationships with family and friends, attending counselling and psychiatrists, loss of employment, headaches and muscle pain from stress and anxiety, and feeling like they were mere sexual objects, rather than patients.”

Guild said that he also took into consideration that Witvoet is a first-time offender. Even though Witvoet committed multiple sexual assaults over several years, Guild said “they are all treated the same - as a first offence - because this is the first time he will be convicted and sentenced.”

Pleading guilty to the offences has taken a toll on his personal life, Guild wrote: Witvoet’s wife has left him, he has been impacted financially, and if he ever tries to practice his profession again, he will be subject to review by the College of Physiotherapists of BC, according to court documents.

Guild wrote that while Witvoet’s character is flawed, the 18-month sentence will allow him to focus on rehabilitation. The judge wrote that if Witvoet was sentenced for all nine offences, with the sentences to be served consecutively, it would end up being a 13.5 year sentence, which Guild said would be too harsh.",[]
704,ctvnews,https://bc.ctvnews.ca/overnight-homeless-camping-recommended-to-vancouver-park-board-1.5019300,Overnight homeless camping recommended to Vancouver Park Board,['Penny Daflos'],2020-07-10 11:18:00-07:00,"VANCOUVER -- One of the most controversial and persistent issues in Vancouver has entered a new phase after the Vancouver Park Board announced a special meeting to receive a new staff report suggesting bylaw changes to allow campers to put down stakes in parks overnight.

A report, authored by the board’s general manager, recommends ""the Parks Control Bylaw be amended to allow people to erect temporary overnight shelter in a park when they have no other housing or shelter options.""

""Our bylaws aren’t in line with the constitution and people’s right to shelter themselves from the elements when there’s no other alternative shelter,” explained park board commissioner John Irwin. ""You couldn’t just say 'oh, I want to camp in the park for the weekend.' The plan is, as people aren’t able to shelter in shelters or, ideally, temporary modular housing at some point, they would have the right to shelter themselves overnight in a park.""

Under the proposed changes, campers would be expected to pack up their tents by 8 a.m. and, if approved, washroom facilities and storage options would then be arranged by the board.

The report also recommends the designation of authorized parks for overnight camping, which would have to be 25 metres from schools and playgrounds, avoid sensitive environmental features, protect green spaces and support public use of fields, pools, and other amenities.

Dozens of homeless campers have set up tents in East Vancouver’s Strathcona Park in recent weeks after dozens were arrested under judicial authorization for refusing to leave an encampment parking lot owned by the Vancouver Fraser Port Authority next to CRAB Park. Before that, they’d been forced from a long-term tent city at Oppenheimer Park in the Downtown Eastside under a ministerial order driven in large part by concerns the COVID-19 pandemic could spread like wildfire.

Nearby residents told CTV News they can no longer use Strathcona Park's running track, children's playground and other features as more campers arrive each day.

""I personally don’t feel the housing and social crisis we have in the city should be solved in public park areas,"" said Elana Zysblat. “It’s not an acceptable or sustainable or healthy solution for anyone.”

Irwin hopes to harness public frustration to get more resources on the problem.

“My hope is if people don’t like it, they will pressure the federal, provincial and the city government to provide more temporary modular housing and more public housing,” he said.

Another resident was cautiously in favour of the idea, but wanted a lot more details.

“I’m in total support of this bylaw change if the number of tents will be limited to maybe a number of five and then my question would be who makes sure the tents are really gone in the mornings?"" said nearby resident Sandra Rohler. ""They already say there’s a big strain on park rangers.”

Irwin acknowledged enforcement is an outstanding issue. Vancouver police didn't respond to our request for comment when asked if they'd been consulted and what role they might play.

The minister overseeing the very difficult task of housing the homeless is urging patience, reminding people that building long-term housing takes years and even modular housing, which can be constructed in months, requires more than just four walls and a bed.

""Housing is important but it is the wrap-around services — the meals, the cleaning, mental health and addiction services, overdose protection services that make that housing work,” said minister of social development, Shane Simpson, explaining that those services are in short supply with more than 200 people housed from Oppenheimer Park and other sites.

""We are looking at and making other (hotel) acquisitions. Part of the reality is, we are going to need additional support here and the federal government needs to step up with capital investments and we’re having those discussions now,” he said, adding that few hotels are available for sale at the moment. ""If we need to take action, we need to do it right. The last thing we want to do is go in and misstep and get it wrong so it is about some patience as we look at what the options are and bring the partners together.”

The report notes that the Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation has a duty to all park users, including those who are experiencing homelessness, which it describes as a crisis.

It also includes a chart showing there’s been a 625 per cent increase in ranger calls since 2015, a rate that’s surged in lockstep with the growth in the number of temporary structures in parks.

""When temporary structures erected as shelters remain in parks for extended periods of time, particularly if in concentrated numbers, the resulting encampments can impede community use of much needed public green spaces; result in the accumulation of debris and human waste; and create opportunities for increased violence and health risks,” says the report.

While the park board was reluctant to remove campers from Oppenheimer Park, the province announced that the need to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission was of vital importance, so government bought hotels to house 261 people. Others were offered housing at social housing facilities. Not everyone has accepted the accommodations offered.

The report to park board commissioners also emphasizes that ""Although the Parks Control Bylaw does not permit people to remain in parks overnight, or to erect temporary structures, these bylaws have not been enforced as the BC Supreme Court ruled that any bylaws prohibiting homeless people from erecting temporary shelters and sleeping in city parks would be a Charter right violation given the lack of adequate shelter capacity for individuals experiencing homelessness.“

Commissioners will hear a staff presentation and debate the report at a special meeting on July 13 at 6 p.m. and speakers from various community groups, organizations and businesses are already registering to speak to the board.

Irwin is asking people to keep an open mind.

“I think we’re at a point where we have to go, ‘ok, do we look after people, do we look after our homeless residents or do we just keep shoving them around as we’ve been doing from park to park?’” he said, adding that if the bylaw is passed it will take some time to craft the wording.

""This is a bylaw and once we put in place we don’t want to have to suffer another legal challenge or try to change it in a year. We want it to be in place for a long time.”",[]

The park started to welcome visitors again on Friday, but PNE officials describe it as a ""modified park experience"" because of COVID-19 safety protocols.

""Our team, in dialogue with Vancouver Coastal Health, has developed a number of sanitization protocols in order that guests can have the fantastic summertime Playland experience they love, but at the same time ensure that the park is doing everything possible with respect to cleaning standards to ensure a healthy, safe experience,"" Shelley Frost, president and CEO of the PNE, said in a statement.

Playland will be open on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. Tickets must be purchased ahead of time for specific dates and times and are available online. Attendees can choose between 10:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. slots or from 3:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.

The park will offer a limited selection of rides, which includes the Tea Cups, Bug Whirled, Flutterbye, Balloon Explorers, Honeybee Express, and Kettle Creek Mine Coaster. Visitors must wear masks while waiting in line and on rides, and they are recommended to be worn throughout the park. Guests are also asked to stay home if they're sick.

Capacity has been reduced to allow for more physical distancing, and Plexiglas shields have been installed in some areas. Additionally, visitors are asked to wash their hands regularly and to use hand sanitizer before and after each ride.

The park will offer some food options, including mini-doughnuts, candy floss and Triple-O's, but all transactions must be cashless.

The PNE had previously announced in April that the traditional fair would be cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic. But in late June, officials said Playland would reopen in phases with the PNE reopening for its 110th season in late August.​ Frost previously said it would be a drive-thru experience for visitors.",[]

The survey, conducted by Research Co., found 75 per cent of Canadians would take the vaccine. That number is slightly higher than when Canadians were polled on the same question in April.

Even more B.C. residents said they'd consider a vaccine, with 80 per cent polled saying they'd either ""definitely"" or ""probably"" get one.

But 15 per cent of Canadians polled said they would ""probably not"" or ""definitely not"" get a vaccine if it became available. Another 11 per cent said they weren't sure.

With B.C. currently in Phase 3 of its restart plan, health officials have said the province is unlikely to move onto Phase 4 until there's a either a vaccine or a reliable treatment.

In fact, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said Thursday that the virus is here to stay until one of those are developed.

""I know some people may be thinking this is all over and they can relax and go back to normal, but until effective treatment or a vaccine is available, we know that this virus is going to circulate in our communities,"" she said.

In the meantime, Canadians are still taking other precautions to protect themselves from COVID-19.

Almost half of Canadians say they wear a mask every time they go out.

""There is a big gender gap when it comes to wearing protective masks outside the home,"" said Mario Canseco, president of Research Co., in a news release.

""While more than half of women in Canada (57 per cent) are not leaving their home without a mask, only 39 per cent of men are partaking in the same behaviour.""

As well, about two-in-five Canadians say they're cleaning any groceries they buy, while 23 per cent say they're not ordering takeout because they're afraid of infection.

Research Co.'s results are based on an online study conducted from June 26 to June 28, 2019, among 1,000 adults in Canada. The margin of error—which measures sample variability—is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.",[]

Tracy Matthews, vice-president of operations for GoodLife Fitness, says an individual who tested positive for the virus spent time at the Burnaby Northgate Club, on North Road, between June 22 and July 3. The person was there at some point between 7:30 and 10:30 a.m. on those days.

Matthews says the company was told by Fraser Health that the person hasn't been at the fitness centre since July 3 and the location is allowed to remain open.

""We are following the guidance from the local public health authority, which is to inform anyone who may have been in the club during the specific time frames of the possible exposure and advise them that public health has asked that they monitor for symptoms,"" Matthews said in an emailed statement.

Matthews says Fraser Health has advised the gym that the risk of transmission is “small.”

""We have not been advised to close our facility or prevent members who may have been in the club at the same time to refrain from working out in our club.""

Matthews said all members who may have been in the club at the same time as the individual have been notified by email.

Gym member Jennifer Brown says she received an email Friday morning advising her she was potentially at the facility at the same time as the person who tested positive, but she still felt safe coming in for her regular workout.

“It’s unfortunate to hear that’s happened, but I have no apprehensions about coming back whatsoever because of the measures I have seen put in place here, how diligent that have been ,” Brown told CTV News. “I find it almost safer to come here than many other places that I have been going to in the public.

GoodLife noted it had introduced stringent cleaning protocols meant to reduce the risk of transmission.

“I feel safe being in there,” gym member Marian Pozzolo told CTV News .""I think gym staff have done a phenomenal job, I’m not worried.”

There have been several recent advisories about possible COVID-19 exposure at Metro Vancouver businesses, including at the No. 5 Orange Strip Club, Brandi’s Exotic Show Lounge and at the Belmont Hotel in downtown Vancouver.",[]

According to Statistics Canada's monthly labour force survey released Friday, B.C.'s unemployment rate was at 13 per cent in June – down from 13.4 per cent the month before. Nationwide, the rate was 12.3 per cent, down from 13.7.

The survey results were gathered from June 14 to 20, which Finance Minister Carole James said was ""right in the middle of (B.C.'s) gradual economic reopening.""

""The data released today for British Columbians paints a picture of cautious optimism with a long road ahead of us,"" James said Friday morning.

""We continue to see positive signs as a result of B.C.'s restart plan.""

B.C. has been in a state of emergency because of the COVID-19 pandemic since mid-March.

But things are starting to improve in the province's economy and James said more than 118,000 people found jobs last month. She also said the employment gains made in both May and June brought back about 40 per cent of the total job losses seen since February.

""So no question these numbers are encouraging, but as I said, we have a long road to go,"" James said, adding that thousands of B.C. residents and businesses are still struggling.

""The total net job loss since the start of the pandemic stands at 235,000 … while that's a large number, those are people, those are families, those are individuals in communities.""

In May, Canada reported a record-high unemployment rate, but also saw signs of recovery in June.

More locally, however, at least four B.C. cities saw their unemployment rates go up in June.

Vancouver 13.1 per cent (up from 10.7)

Kelowna 10.2 per cent (up from 9.6)

Abbotsford-Mission 8.8 per cent (up from 7.5)

Victoria 11 per cent (up from 10.1)

James said ""there's no question"" that these increased unemployment rates in some cities is because of the challenges facing service and tourist sectors.

""You would, by now in Vancouver and in Victoria, be seeing cruise ships coming in, seeing passengers unload, be seeing people through the downtown core,"" she said. ""And that's just not possible.""

Services sector, youth hit hardest

James said B.C.'s services sector continues to be the hardest hit since the start of the pandemic.

However, with businesses reopening in the province's restart, she said this sector has also seen significant job gains recently.

""In fact, the accommodation and food services sector accounts for 50 per cent of this month's gain in jobs,"" she said.

James also said youth are still seeing a significant unemployment rate in the province at 29.1 per cent, which is slightly higher than it was in May.

Moving ahead, James said following provincial health orders and guidelines remains important.

""We need to stay focused on our restart plan, doing it in a responsible way so we can see more and more businesses reopen,"" James said.

""The best recovery for our economy is making sure that we continue to fight COVID-19.""",[]

Transit Police confirmed she was attacked just before 10 o’clock the night of May 12, at the Main Street-Science World SkyTrain Station.

The victim is seen approaching the fare gates on Main Street, when a man wearing shorts, T-shirt and a baseball cap comes into frame, winds up and slugs her in the back of head. The woman’s wig and belongings fall to the floor, and then the man is seen taking off.

The next images show the victim getting up and looking bewildered as she collects her possessions off the station floor.

The footage was captured by the security camera of a neighbouring condominium.

“Acts of violence occur all the time in this neighbourhood,” said Patricia Chartrand, who lives in the building at Main and Terminal.

“It’s horrific and shocking. It’s gotten progressively worse, and more and more dangerous.""

“When our kids (are) here, they’re afraid to walk in this area,” said another resident of the building. “Sometime we’re all afraid.”

Witnesses saw the man in the video cross the street moments after the SkyTrain attack and smash the glass of a bus stop stand.

Both Transit Police and the Vancouver Police Department acknowledged issues in the neighbourhood.

“We do have additional officers and resources working that area,” said VPD spokesperson Sgt. Aaron Roed.

Transit Police confirmed they tracked the attacker down and have recommended assault charges. They are also seeking a warrant for his arrest, but so far nothing has been approved by Crown.

That means the man is still at large.

The victim is understandably still shaken but is doing well otherwise.",[]

“I want the city to pull their socks up,"" said resident Patricia Chartrand.

After 20 years as a condo owner in the building near the corner of Main Street and Terminal Avenue, Chartrand explained the situation has become dangerous.

“On the weekend I had some gentleman out here throw a container of food at me,” she said.

Residents are perturbed at the amount of garbage, drug paraphernalia and graffiti they see in the area despite it being a major transit connection and close to tourist attractions like Science World.

“I never know what to expect there could be people lying, sleeping, guys doing drugs and shooting up, “ said long-time resident Mort Broverman.

The residents explain that the breaking point came in the spring after a random assault just steps from a neighbouring SkyTrain entrance led to Transit police recommending multiple charges.

The incident was captured on the building’s security cameras.

In the video a man is seen walking up to another person and punching them from behind.

Transit police told CTV News that after a full investigation the suspect was identified.

The residents of several condo units near the intersection have also paid for a temporary fence to block people from openly using drugs on a courtyard area outside their front doors.

“There are children in this building, elderly with walkers and I'm tired of having people impacted by this,” said Chartrand.",[]

Jamie Bacon, who has been identified in previous trials as the former leader of the Red Scorpion gang, entered a guilty plea Thursday afternoon to conspiracy to commit the murder of 21 year-old Corey Lal, one of the victims of the Surrey six killings in October 2007.

Six people ended up being killed in execution-style shootings in a Surrey condo, including two innocent bystanders: Chris Mohan, who lived across the hall, and Ed Schellenberg, who was doing maintenance work on a gas fireplace.

Eileen Mohan, Chris Mohan’s mother, was in court to hear the pleas.

“He could have done this 10 years ago,” she said. “He made a calculated plea deal to set himself free.”

In May, the B.C. Court of Appeal had ordered a new trial for Bacon in connection with the Surrey six killings after prosecutors appealed a December 2017 stay of the charges involved. Bacon had also originally been charged with first degree murder in the case. That charge is now expected to be stayed.

Crying could be heard in court as Bacon appeared by video. He also pleaded guilty to counselling to commit murder in connection with a 2008 shooting.

The Crown and defence are making a joint sentencing submission of 18 years on the conspiracy charge, and 10 for the counselling charge, to be served concurrently. The maximum possible sentence carried by each charge is life, and there is no minimum sentence. Bacon has been in jail since his arrest in 2009, and will also get credit for time already served.

Outside court, Bacon’s defence lawyer Kevin Westell said if the judge accepts their proposal, factoring in time served, his client will have “somewhere between five or six years left to serve.”

“This has been a long, deliberative process of coming to the right agreement with the Crown,” Westell said. “We think, for many reasons, we’ve come to a resolution that’s principled, and is appropriate from all sides.”

Mohan said she hopes the judge considers how long it’s taken to come to this point.

“Mr. Bacon has dragged us since 2009, to plead guilty, and he didn’t. So maybe the judge will take that into account, and give him the sentence that’s really due to him,” she said. “It’s not just my son’s life. And that has to be taken into consideration, that six people’s lives meant something to this country and to the laws of Canada.”

Sentencing is scheduled for July 23. Mohan intends to read a victim impact statement in court at that time.

“I will have my day in court with him,” she said. “He will not escape me. He has escaped me for 13 years.”",[]

""This investigation is not trying to determine whether racism exists in B.C.'s health-care system. It does exist, just as it does in every aspect of Canadian society,"" said lead investigator Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond, adding the system ""clearly needs work.""

Turpel-Lafond, who previously served as B.C.'s representative for children and youth, was called in to investigate the allegations, and delivered an update Thursday. She announced a small team has been assembled to help with the investigation into a racist game allegedly being played in B.C. emergency rooms, behaviour she described as ""egregious.""

Indigenous people are being encouraged to fill out a survey about their experiences with the health-care system, and Turpel-Lafond said a preliminary report is expected in a few months. Health-care workers who have witnessed racism are also encouraged speak out and will not face incrimination in their workplace, she said.

""This is an issue of urgent concern, this issue of racism and Indigenous-specific racism in the British Columbia health-care system,"" she said.

Those who have experienced or have knowledge of racism in the health-care system can share their information over the phone at 1-888-600-3078 or addressing_racism@gov.bc.ca.

While not everyone will feel comfortable coming forward to share their stories, Turpel-Lafond said everyone who comes forward will be treated with ""utmost confidence and respect.""

""I want to assure all Indigenous people that you are safe to share the story with myself, my team,"" she said, adding that it is independent from government and there will be no retaliation for people who speak out.

The investigative team will include people with clinical experience and knowledge of the health-care system, including former provincial health officer Dr. Perry Kendall. Members will also include those with experience in conducting complex investigations and data analysis.

""But it's also very important to note that in all of those areas, there are Indigenous people on my team, and they're Indigenous professionals,"" she said. ""And that's important because safety and trust—to be able to work in this space—is a precondition.""

The investigation will look at the specific allegations around the racist game, but will also examine issues around systemic racism in B.C.'s health-care system.

""I think it is very important to send a clear message that this is not a healthy and appropriate way to behave,"" she said.

On June 19, B.C.'s health minister told the public he was made aware of allegations that health-care workers were guessing the blood-alcohol levels of patients, particularly Indigenous ones.

Health Minister Adrian Dix did not identify the hospital or health authority allegedly involved, but indicated the game may have been played at multiple emergency rooms.

He said he first heard the allegation from Deputy Health Minister Steve Brown who received information about the guessing game from both the community and ""inside the system.""

After the allegations were revealed, multiple Indigenous organizations – including Métis Nation B.C. and the BC Association of Aboriginal Friendship Centres – called on the province to hold a public inquiry into Indigenous-specific racism in B.C.

An employee at the Musqueam Golf and Learning Academy confirmed to CTV News that Kyle Ledingham was employed as of Monday, even as the company removed a posting on its website that said Ledingham ""has taught our youngest juniors, to teenagers, adults and senior players.""

On Wednesday, when CTV News visited the course to find out more, officials there didn't answer whether Ledingham was teaching teenagers.

On Thursday, Devin Sharma, the interim chief administrative officer of the Musqueam Band, said that Ledingham had been an independent contractor at Musqueam Golf and Learning Academy since 2017.

“Effective July 5, 2020, Mr. Ledingham’s services have been suspended while this investigation is ongoing,” he said in an e-mailed statement.

“Musqueam Golf and Learning Academy strives to create a safe and welcoming environment for every individual visiting our facility, including staff and players, and have offered our full co-operation to authorities investigating this matter,” he said.

Ledingham has not been charged. His lawyer says he is innocent, and if charged vows to defend him vigorously in court.

The Musqueam Golf and Learning Academy was one place the 17-year-old student said Ledingham drove her to, and while in the car, she said, she was propositioned for oral sex.

The student says she was sexually assaulted on four different times in the band room at Prince of Wales Secondary School.

Ledingham's teaching licence is on hold with his agreement, pending an investigation into his conduct. The Vancouver Police Department concluded its investigation into the claims and handed a report to Crown counsel in December. Crown prosecutors are now weighing whether to lay charges in the case.

""He teaches in many environments where there are kids and vulnerable students and that isn't right,"" the student told CTV News in an interview.

Prince of Wales school was the base of the Quest Program, where teacher Tom Ellison was convicted in 2006 of abusing several students while on trips with them in the 1970s. Concerns about his behaviour were ignored for years, according to news reports at the time.

The student says she also spent time with Ledingham alone, during a community service placement with him.

The Vancouver School District says there were almost 1,800 students registered in community service programs across the district. Supporters say it provides students with valuable learning and volunteer opportunities.

But some critics are calling for that program to be reviewed.

""Men need to be supervised in a lot of cases especially when it is one-on-one,"" said Karla Djini of Vancouver Rape Relief.

She said it's probably an overreaction to ban one-on-one time between students and teachers. But she said it makes sense to reduce it, and try to include even another student where possible.

""Having even just another person there would be a reasonable thing to try,"" Djini said.

The district says it has changed multiple policies since Ellison was convicted, saying it reported allegations against Ledingham to provincial regulators as soon as it heard of the situation.

The public didn't hear about the concerns, and it's not clear whether the Musqueam Golf and Learning Academy was informed.

Two other B.C. teachers were disciplined in the past week for having sexual contact with students. The first was with an 18-year-old graduate the teacher had taught for two years. The same teacher also gave alcohol to a 17-year-old former student before initiating contact.

The second teacher taught a student in Grades 10, 11, and 12, spending a ""significant"" amount of time with her outside school hours. The consent agreement says the relationship began the following September.

Both teachers were barred from teaching for 15 years. Their names are not published, as is customary, as the regulatory body says it feels publicizing their names could harm the students involved in the cases.",[]

Two-month-old Lucy van Doormaal has a neuromuscular disorder called Spinal Muscular Atrophy 1, or SMA1. The rare genetic disorder affects Lucy’s motor neurons, “reducing her ability for activities such as sitting, crawling, head and neck control, and swallowing,” her parents wrote on a GoFundMe page they set up.

If left untreated, the baby may not reach her second birthday.

Lucy’s father, Scott van Doormaal, said he and his wife have been using every social media platform available to spread the message, and it’s starting to pay off.

“We’re optimistic with one week’s worth of fundraising,” van Doormaal said. “It’s literally all we’ve been doing, all day, all night.”

The effort isn’t just for Lucy, but for other families who are affected by the genetic disorder, van Doormaal said. That includes Edmonton toddler Kaysen Martin, whose family is also fundraising to cover the cost of the new drug, called Zolgensma.

Since media stories first appeared about Lucy and Kaysen, the issue has caught the eye of celebrities like Ryan Reynolds. The Vancouver-raised actor donated $5,000 each to fundraisers for the two children.

B.C.'s health ministry currently covers one treatment for SMA called Spinraza. The other treatment the Van Doormaals are considering, called Zolgensma, was submitted to the Common Drug Review on June 25.

Both drugs are expensive: a single dose of Zolgensma costs around $3 million, and it’s often referred to as the most expensive drug in the world.

But Spinraza costs about $750,000 for the first year and about $350,000 after that, said Dr. Durhane Wong-Rieger of the Canadian Organization for Rare Disorders.

That makes the eye-popping cost of Zolgensma actually cheaper than a decade of similar treatment on Spinraza, she said.

Children who are able to take Zolgensma early in their lives have better outcomes than those on Spinraza, according to van Doormaal, such as not being as reliant on feeding tubes to help them eat and ventilators to help them breathe.

Lucy is on both a feeding tube and a bipap ventilator at night, said van Doormaal. Since taking Spinraza, the baby girl has shown improvement in being able to move her arms and legs.

However, Zolgensma is not covered in Canada because it is still being reviewed by the national Common Drug Review. B.C.’s health ministry says it needs to wait for that review to be completed before the Van Doormaals can request PharmaCare coverage for it.

Van Doormaal said he has every faith that the drug will eventually be approved in Canada, just like Spinraza was, and will help other families like his.

But in the meantime, the young father is focused on “the pricetag they’ve set on Lucy’s life.”.

Premier John Horgan said Thursday that he's happy with where the province is at in its COVID-19 recovery, but cautioned B.C. is still ""far from out of the woods.""

Horgan spoke to media Thursday morning from Victoria where he addressed a broad range of issues from the film industry to a provincial review of the police act to US-Canada relations.

""I think there's great reasons for optimism as we look at how our restart has been going across the province. We continue to see relatively low cases of COVID-19,"" Horgan said. ""I'm pretty excited about where we are.""

Horgan is confident federal stimulus spending will flow to British Columbia and said hundreds of millions was confirmed by the feds just last week, solidifying his plans to make strategic investments in infrastructure.

Along with low cases, Horgan said many sectors have started to see recovery after dramatic downturns because of the pandemic, like BC Ferries and transit.

""More and more people are coming out of their homes, participating in the economy, going to restaurants, shopping in retail outlets and participating broadly speaking in the restart of our economy,"" he said.

But the premier also had tough talk for the forestry industry, which as been closing down mills and struggling amid economic headwinds and various challenges.

""I wanted to make it clear to industry I value their historic contribution but they have obligation to future as well,” said Horgan, who warned logging companies that their access to lumber on public, Crown lands is contingent on their continued employment of local workers and support of B.C. communities.

When it comes to the US border, Horgan held firm on his position that now is not the time to be ""inviting people from jurisdictions without the same levels of success for a visit.”

On the positive side, 24 TV and movie productions have resumed in the province, Horgan said.

Even so, B.C. reissued its record-breaking state of emergency for a ninth time.

States of emergency can only be issued or extended for two weeks at a time, so the latest will only remain in effect through July 21 at the latest.

The province's solicitor general explained that even though COVID-19 restrictions have been slowly lifted in B.C., some measures must still remain in place.

That is the feeling of six women who were inside the Lynn Valley Care Centre, each with a parent living there, when the COVID-19 outbreak began in March.

“The whole system broke apart during this worldwide pandemic,” says Debbie Drew, whose father lives at LVCC in North Vancouver.

Althea Gibb-Carsley, whose mother-in-law died of COVID-19 at Lynn Valley, agrees. She said the virus has ""exposed a great many fragilities in our system.

The women believe staffing levels are too low system-wide.

“We witnessed, in the last six months, people falling and crying out in the hallway. And no one came. So we’re helping people get up and calling the call bells,” says May Mikhail, whose mom, Isobelle, died of COVID-19 on March 18.

“The perception that (long-term care is) working alright is skewed because people like us go in, help with feeding, identify needs, we clean up the room, we mop the floor,” explains Gibb-Carsley, who also says that the care for seniors needs to be more personal.

She offered an example of a conversation she had with her mother-in-law, Isobelle, before her death. She says Isobelle seemed down that day and she asked her why.

Her mother-in-law told her, ""The (care aides), they come, they put the lotion on my legs. They're very good, but they forget: I'm up here. I'm up here.""

Drew says long-term care needs to be better.

“It goes back to skilled staff and can they do it? Can they meet all the needs of the seniors who are at end of life? Is there humanity?” she questions.

”And we as a group have decided that no, (staff) don’t have the time to give a basic need to a dying person.

The women say that if there’s one thing good that could come from the pandemic, it’s fundamental change. And they believe that starts with more staff caring for the seniors lucky enough to have survived the pandemic.

They are urging the B.C. government to ensure the province's vulnerable seniors get the care they deserve.",[]

The research, which was conducted at the University of British Columbia and published in Scientific Reports, is the first time human hearing has been investigated close to death.

All the patients were in palliative care at St. John Hospice in Vancouver. A device was used to measure their brain's electrical activity both when they were conscious and later when they were unconscious. Young, healthy people were used as controls in the research.

""In the last hours before an expected natural death, many people enter a period of unresponsiveness,"" said study lead author Elizabeth Blundon, who was a PhD student in the psychology department at time of the study, in a news release.

""Our data shows that a dying brain can respond to sound, even in an unconscious state, up to the last hours of life.""

The results of the research suggest hearing might be the last sense to go. However, researchers were unable to tell if the patients were able to identify voices or understand language.

Thirteen families participated in the study and brain recordings were collected from five patients once they were unresponsive. The research required patients to give consent ahead of time.

""We were able to identify specific cognitive processes from the neuro-typical participants as well as the hospice patients"" said Lawrence Ward, a psychology professor at UBC, in the news release.

""We had to look very carefully at the individual control participants' data, to see if each one of them showed a particular type of brain response before we felt confident that the unresponsive patient's brain reacted similarly.""

As a result, researchers say this new information can help friends and family comfort a loved one in their final moments.

Dr. Romayne Gallagher, who used to be a palliative care physician at St. John Hospice but has since retired, said she's noticed positive reactions in people who have been spoken to in their final moments.

""This research gives credence to the fact that hospice nurses and physicians noticed that the sounds of loved ones helped comfort people when they were dying,"" Gallagher said.

""To me, it adds significant meaning to the last days and hours of life and shows that being present, in person or by phone, is meaningful. It is a comfort to be able to say goodbye and express love.""",[]

The CACP is advocating for a health-based approach instead of criminal sanctions and says evidence from health leaders suggests a public health-based approach is an effective way to reduce harm in the community.

""The bottom line is that addiction issues should be best handled through a health-care system and not through a criminal justice system,"" CACP president and Vancouver police chief Adam Palmer said Thursday.

The CACP says enforcement will still be required to stop putting illegal drugs on the street.

""If you arrest somebody right now for possession of any kind of a drug, that's a very short-term action that doesn't provide any sort of solution,"" Palmer said. ""Whereas if we have somebody and we can get them into a pathway of treatment, get them proper supports, then you have longer-term benefits.""

The organization is also calling for a national task force to research drug policy reform, which it said should include the departments of justice, health and public safety, as well as the Public Prosecution Service of Canada.

Palmer added he believes the ""tide is turning"" on drug enforcement and people are starting to realize that health-care is a better solution for these issues.

During his weekly media availability Thursday, B.C. Premier John Horgan voiced his support for the idea.

""I firmly believe we have been, here in British Columbia, in a public health emergency for over five years when it comes to opioid overdoses,"" he said.

""We're in the midst of a global pandemic when it comes to COVID-19. In British Columbia, that is further complicated by an overdose crisis which saw last month the highest monthly number of deaths that we've seen in a good long time.""

May was an especially deadly month for drug users in British Columbia. A report from the coroners service found 170 people died in May 2020, an average of nearly six people a day.

Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry has previously called for the government to decriminalize drug possession for personal use.

The 49-page report released in April 2019 recommended ""immediate provincial action"" and called for the decriminalization of people who possess controlled substances for personal use.",[]

A female RCMP officer from British Columbia has been docked 20 days' pay after making a lewd comment to a male colleague and later squeezing his genitals.

Const. Valerie Little was working at the Vernon RCMP detachment when the two separate incidents happened between November 2009 and February 2010, according to a disciplinary report from January.

While the constable contested the allegations, the RCMP's Conduct Board determined they were credible ""on a balance of probabilities."" She was ordered to forfeit almost three weeks' worth of pay and 10 paid vacation days, and won't be eligible for a promotion for two years.

The first incident took place while Little and another constable, identified only as A.F. in the report, were on duty watching a live video feed of officers interviewing a suspected sex offender.

The suspect was discussing his sexual preferences when Little put her hand on A.F.'s thigh and whispered something to the effect of ""I like to take it from behind,"" according to the disciplinary report.

The second happened while they were off-duty but representing their detachment in a community broomball tournament. A.F. said Little approached him while he was leaning against a wall, then squeezed his genitals and said, ""I see you're not wearing a cup.""

The constable testified that he felt shocked and embarrassed by what happened, and walked away without saying anything.

A.F. said he asked a respected senior officer for advice on whether he should file a sexual misconduct complaint shortly after it happened, and was upset when she initially chuckled in response.

That senior officer, identified as Mrs. K.S. in the report, testified that she remembered the conversation and that she advised him not to speak out because she didn't trust the people who were then leading the detachment to deal with it properly.

Looking back, Mrs. K.S. recognized she had a duty to report it herself and that she failed in her obligation to do so.

Instead, the senior officer said she tried to resolve the situation by making an offhand comment to Little that was something to the effect of: ""You gotta keep your hands to yourself it'll get you in trouble.""

A.F. left the detachment in 2011 without speaking about either incident to Little. He only came forward in 2018 after learning that she was transferring to his current detachment on Vancouver Island.

""He was completely overwhelmed and never thought that he would see her again,"" the report reads. ""He felt stuck and knew he could not work with her as he was afraid something else may happen.""

While the RCMP Conduct Board described Little as a generally credible witness, with positive performance evaluations and no prior disciplinary record, it found her testimony to be ""embellished and editorialized"" in comparison with A.F.'s.

The board also found A.F. more believable, in part, because he seemed anxious and uncomfortable coming forward. It would have been ""less embarrassing and stressful"" to simply keep the incidents to himself, the board wrote, while speaking out ""subjected him to making public statements and testifying.""

On top of the order docking Little's pay and temporarily barring her from promotions, the RCMP Conduct Board said she is not to be posted at the same detachment as her accuser.

Little was not fired due to a number of mitigating factors, according to the board, including that she displayed an effort at ""bettering herself personally and professionally"" by earning a university degree and having weekly meetings with a psychologist.",[]
720,ctvnews,https://bc.ctvnews.ca/heatstroke-danger-for-kids-left-in-hot-cars-1.5004930,Heatstroke danger for kids left in hot cars,[],2020-07-10 06:00:00-07:00,"VANCOUVER -- Dozens of children die every year in the U.S. after being left in a hot car, most of them under the age of three. In Canada, the number is lower but the risk is the same.

Even on days with mild temperatures, the heat inside a vehicle can reach dangerous levels within an hour, posing significant health risks to small children and pets left inside. And the risk is ever-present. Earlier this year, a four-year-old boy in the U.S. died after sneaking out and into the family car unnoticed.

""Because everyone's home more often than usual, parents need to make sure that their keys are always out of reach of little hands,"" says Emily Thomas with Consumer Reports. ""And that their vehicles are locked at all times.""

The risk hot cars pose to children may be higher than usual this year. Because of the pandemic, most stores have implemented restrictions, limiting the number of people allowed inside at a time. Parents may be tempted to leave their child in the car to decrease the risk of exposure to COVID-19 while they shop.

But even with the window cracked or the vehicle parked in the shade, the interior temperatures of the car can reach dangerous levels in a short period of time.

""Children's bodies heat up three to five times faster than adults,"" Thomas says. ""That's why it's never safe for them to be left unattended inside of a closed vehicle. It doesn't matter if you're parked in the shade or if you've left the window cracked, or even if you think it's not that hot out. It effects them differently and it's never safe.""

A study from GM found that on a 35 degree day, a small car in the sun could get hotter than 50 degrees in just 20 minutes, and up to 65 degrees in 40 minutes. And it found that leaving the window cracked didn't alleviate the heat.

To keep your kids safe, leave them at home and arrange for childcare when running errands. You should also keep the car locked when it's in the driveway or in the garage, so kids can't get in when you're not looking.

And make it a habit to keep your cellphone or purse in the backseat. That way, you'll have to turn around and check the backseat every time you get out of the car.

If you spot a child or a pet that's been left in a hot vehicle, call 911 right away.

But last year, ICBC cleared the way and now vehicle owners can put their idle cars to work and potentially make hundreds of dollars a month.

Daniel Barozzini loves his Tesla so much, he's named it Artemis.

""I have a great passion for cars,"" he says. And now he's going to share Artemis on Turo, which launched on June 16.

""We already have 65,000 users signed up to our app in British Columbia,"" says Cedric Mathieu, Turo's Canadian director.

An Angus Reid study recently found that Canadians spend thousands of dollars on their cars every year, but typically only drive them four per cent of the time, something that motivated Barozzini to join Turo.

""I have two cars, one of them usually sitting in the parking lot,"" he says. Now they're both listed on the site – the Tesla 3, which you can borrow for about $167 a day, and a Chrysler 200 for $37 a day.

Turo supplies the insurance - a percentage of the daily rate, depending on the kind of coverage you want. That's something that took ICBC a while to approve.

""We're happy that this product has finally been made available and that protects every car listed on the platform,"" Mathieu says.

Or, B.C. residents can buy rental car insurance for $10 a day, but only on vehicles that rent for less than $125 a day.

The company screens every guest and host that joins the platform and they review one another too, something Barozzini, as a host, likes.

""It creates an environment of trust and transparency,"" he says. ""And so far, since it's launched it's been great for me and I'm definitely going to continue it.""",[]

Consumers have complained they've been getting short-changed when they return their empties at some recycling depots.

You should get 10 cents for every beer can and bottle, but only select recycling locations, licensed by the brewers, give a full refund. Other depots that accept empties don't get paid to recycle them, so they've been keeping some of the deposit money and giving back as little as five cents per item at some locations.

Janette Kryzanowski recently recycled some beer cans at the Kensington Return-It depot in Vancouver and was not happy to be getting only five cents back.

""If you’re going to charge a deposit, then that means you get that money back. It shouldn’t vary on location,” she said.

Return-It, which handles most of the recycling for beverage containers in the province, has launched a pilot program at some of its locations to address the problem.

""We’re tired of dealing with the complaints so we’re going to run this pilot to show that this is the way it should be done,"" said Allen Langdon, president and CEO of Return-It. ""We’ve had a growing number of complaints over the past few months about consumers not getting their full refund back when they go to the depot.""

Doug Abrahams is a regular at the Brentwood Return-It location in Burnaby, and certainly sees the value of getting the full deposit back.

""This is all going towards my daughter's hockey team,"" he told CTV News Vancouver.

In addition to absorbing the cost of recycling beer bottles and alcohol cans, Return-It will no longer make consumers separate cans from bottles. You can now mix them up in the bags you drop off at some select locations.

This will come as a great relief to those who need the extra cash and can’t afford to give up money on the cans and bottles that they collect.

""Having all the aluminum containers in one stream actually makes it way easier for the binners,” Langdon said.

The pilot program will only last six months, but Return-It hopes that it will result in permanent changes.

The company is now pitching the provincial government to take over recycling from the breweries to make it simpler and less confusing for consumers.

CTV News reached out to the Brewers Distributors Ltd., which works with the BC Brewers’ Recycled Container Collection Council, for comment, but as of this publication has not received a response.

B.C.’s Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy said in an emailed statement that the choice is up to producers.

""The Ministry regulates the producers, who ultimately choose which stewardship agency they wish to execute their regulatory obligations and in the manner they prefer e.g. charge and eco fee or not, one return system over another, etc.,"" the statement says.

While Return-It will drop the pilot program to give full refunds and accept mixed bottles and cans in six months, other changes being made will not go away.

In an effort to reduce line-ups and touch points during COVID-19, Return-It is introducing reverse vending machines. You just pop in your empties, they're automatically sorted and you get paid on the spot.

Abrahams hopes all the changes will stay in place, including full refunds no matter where you go.

""It's way, way better,"" he said.

Last fall, Return-It also introduced a uniform deposit on all beverage containers of 10 cents, except on containers over one litre. Beginning this fall, the 10 cent deposit will be on all containers, regardless of the size.",[]

Soon, the owlets were ready to emerge from the nest and stretch their wings, Lavoie said. The father owl would start hooting, a signal to the young owls it was relatively safe to come out of their nest. First, they would fly just a short distance, with Mom by their side. A few weeks later, Lavoie observed them flying to a tree a bit farther away.

""The owlets stuck together, always flying to the same tree as one another,"" Lavoie said. ""They often snuggled up to one another, possibly to stay warm and safe.""

As the owlets have practised flying, they've also learned to hunt, he said.

""A fellow photographer has actually seen a male owl drop a rat in the field so the owlet can swoop in and learn to pick it up,"" Lavoie said.

A thrill for Lavoie was the chance to get an elusive shot of the male adult owl carrying a dead rat in its beak, preparing to share the tasty morsel with the owlets.

""I was sick for about two weeks, I was in isolation within our home in a guest bedroom and there was about three days where I was gasping for air,"" Gullacher said.

The Gullacher family has been hit hard by COVID-19.

Paul’s father Butch is the only person from Regina to die from the virus, while his wife and kids also showed a variety of symptoms.

Gullacher’s wife, Aimee, lost her sense of taste and smell for 10 days. His daughter, Athena, had a fever and headache, but Gullacher says she showed her normal energy, and his son, Willem, had pink eye.

He says they did everything they could to avoid the virus.

""Prior to even my dad showing symptoms, we had been exercising social distancing, we were disinfecting door handles, we were doing all the things,"" Gullacher said.

Gullacher’s father had reduced kidney function and hadn’t travelled prior to contracting COVID-19.

He was admitted to hospital on March 19 and put into an induced coma a few days later. He battled the virus for weeks before dying on Apr. 10.

The 69-year-old was the fourth person in Saskatchewan to die from the virus.

""It’s funny that when my mom called me on the Thursday, I didn’t realize that I’d seen my dad for the last time already,"" Gullacher said.

The family still hasn’t been able to have a funeral for him.

""At the time it doesn’t really set in because everything is so unknown, everything is so sudden, it’s not totally clear to you how this is going to work out and you don’t think it’s going to happen to you,"" Gullacher said.

In the aftermath, Gullacher says he’s learned how precious his memories with his father have been.

""You need to cherish your family and spend time with your family now because there’s no guarantee that time is going to be available at the end,"" he said.

He’s disappointed that his father won’t be able to create more memories with his grandchildren.

""He fully unfolded as a human being when he became a grandpa, I’d never really had a ton of strong memories of my dad smiling as much as when he became a grandfather, his grandkids meant everything to him,"" Gullacher said.

Gullacher says his son believed he may have been responsible for his grandfather contracting the virus.

""All he knew is kids don’t get really sick and kids make their grandparents sick, that’s all he was seeing in media, so even though the timeline doesn’t work out for him to have infected him, he felt guilt,"" he said.

Cases in Saskatchewan have remained low during the pandemic and Regina hasn’t had an active case in almost a month.

Gullacher says his family’s experience should serve as a warning against letting your guard down.

""Because so few people have been infected here in Regina, it’s easy to believe that this is someone else’s problem, that it can’t effect us here,"" he said.

Since recovering, Gullacher says his family has continued to take precautions and remain close to home.

He also made the decision last month to donate convalescent plasma, which is being used in a clinical trail by Canadian Blood Services to prove whether antibodies can be effectively used to treat COVID-19 patients.

Gullacher hopes it can help save a life.

“The City has been working with the Co-op Refinery Complex and they have been hauling the metal concentrated wastewater offsite to a specialized treatment facility,” the City of Regina said in a media release.

Final testing results received on Friday indicate a “low risk to Wascana Creek.""

“Downstream users were notified on July 10, with no action required. As of July 6, the Wastewater Treatment Plant final effluent levels were below provincial reporting standards,” the release said.

The City of Regina says its sampling program detects material entering and exiting he plant in order to reduce risk to residents and the environment.

""The city has made significant advancements in our wastewater sampling program over the last few years to protect the environment and the new wastewater treatment plant,” said Kurtis Doney, the director of water, waste and environment with the City of Regina.

“These particular test results that have been found are due to the proactive work that we have done to improve our wastewater sampling program and the results are above the provincial reportable standards so it’s important for us to report them as we’re doing them.”",[]

“We knew it was going to be busy,” said SARCAN communications coordinator Nolan Hubbard-Richards.

“We knew that people were going to be accumulating more containers than normal. But, we were completely blown away with the reception of our reopening and how many people showed up on that opening day and continue to show up.”

Some customers have seen wait times up to two hours long at locations across Regina. Zena Bear waited outside of the Rochdale location.

“I’ve got five [bags], but I’ve got another six or seven in the car and they said, ‘just what we can carry,’ so I have another day of this.”

SARCAN continues its COVID-19 practices at all locations and customers are seeing them as a success.

“Everybody just kept their distance and did their own thing. So it was all good,” said Bear.

Hubbard-Richards says there is no way for SARCAN to be able to predict what days or times they will be busy. But, it does look like the long lines will continue to be the norm for the foreseeable future.",[]

""Right place, right time,” said Meyers, who is better known to many people in Saskatoon as DJ Anchor.

“I like to think that if something like that happened to me or my family, someone would be there and they would just do the right thing too.”

The two were enjoying the beach with their families when Tye, an experienced lifeguard, noticed a pair of men jump into the water from the breakwater.

“I’m a lifeguard, so I recognize to watch the water just in case of situations,” he said.

Anderson had just spent the better part of an hour in the water searching for fishhooks with his nephew Hunter, and knew the water was cold, which he believes led to the incident.

“I think they maybe kind of panicked a little bit,” Meyers said. “Maybe the muscles were starting to seize up a little bit, panic, shock, all those things came into play.”

“And then we saw his hat go up, and he said ‘help,’” Anderson said. “And my wife was the one who said, ‘Oh he just said help’ and then immediately my whole family broke out running.”

Meyers started swimming out to the men, while Anderson grabbed a paddleboard from a nearby family and started paddling.

“It was 50 metres away, but you know, every second counts,” he said.

In a video recorded by Anderson’s wife Makenna, five people are shown coming to help; Anderson and Meyers, a family friend, a woman with a paddleboard, and another man who was swimming in the area.

“We had three standup paddleboards coming in sequence,” Meyers said. “The cavalry was coming.”

One man was able to grab onto a nearby buoy, while the other struggled, his face and mouth just out of the water.

“We get to the situation, and I’m like, ‘Keep breathing, keep breathing, take deep breaths, hang onto the buoy,’” Anderson said.

“I get into the water off my paddleboard, I grab the one guy’s hand and throw his hand onto the paddleboard.”

“I’ll always compare it to this,” said Meyers of the man trying to climb aboard.

“I don’t know if you grew up around lakes but it’s like a five, six, seven-year-old kid trying to get into the boat for the first time without a ladder. They kind of put their arms up on the side of the boat, but it’s that much higher than them, and they’re just kicking their legs wildly trying to get on.”

They were eventually able to pull the men from the water.

“He gets himself up onto the paddleboard and he’s struggling to breathe,” Anderson said. “He grabs onto the side and we get him up there and we start pulling him in.”

“I just started yelling to my wife and my nephew Hunter on the beach,” Meyers said.

“Get towels ready, get something warm to get them dried off, all that kind of stuff. My wife had called the national park people there to get vehicles up with the proper medical devices.”

“We left him with the authorities,” Anderson said. “The park rangers came and checked him out, made sure he was good.”

As his family was going to their car to leave, Anderson says he was able to talk with one of the men, who oddly enough, had his car parked in the next spot.

“He was sitting at the edge of my car, and I was like, ‘Oh hey, how’s it going?’ It was such a weird situation, and he was like, ‘Oh man I’m just so grateful for you being there for me.’”

It wasn’t the first water rescue experience Anderson has had.

In 2014, the quad that his great aunt was riding was swept away by strong currents in the South Saskatchewan River near MacDowall and he was one of several people that helped pull her out.

Anderson was given a medal of honour from the incident.

“I’ll remember that day forever because it was the most shocking day of my life,” he said.

Sunday was Meyer’s first foray into water rescue—he hopes it was also his last.

“I just feel like I did what I had to do,” he said. “If that ever happened to somebody I knew or someone else, I’m happy to do it again, but hopefully I don’t have to put myself in that situation.”",[]

All while reporters increasingly turn their attention to detailing institutional discrimination in nearly all other facets of society, including justice, politics, health care and education.

For the similarly flawed media industry, a long-standing problem has suddenly become harder to ignore: Many outlets striving to inform the public of widespread racial bias do so with stories that are assigned, reported and analyzed by predominantly white editorial staff.

The not-so-surprising result? They're failing, say industry watchers and a growing number of staff members risking their jobs to speak out. And while many media organizations are expressing renewed commitments to diversify their newsrooms and coverage, those journalists say it will take more than pledges to create meaningful change.

A SERIES OF MISSTEPS

Revelations have emerged in recent weeks of racial indignities suffered at multiple news outlets, where current and former employees are attempting to lift the curtain on how and why tensions persist.

Corus Entertainment faced a public lashing by rank-and-file staff over claims of toxic workplaces for people of colour; the National Post endured a newsroom revolt over contentious columns that denied the existence of systemic racism in Canada; CBC suspended and disciplined star Wendy Mesley for twice quoting a racial slur in editorial meetings and CBC Radio's ""Yukon Morning"" host Christine Genier resigned over the lack of Indigenous representation in Canadian media.

While there might be an increase in the number of on-air personalities who are people of colour, that's not an accurate measure of success, says diversity consultant and former journalist Hamlin Grange, whose firm DiversiPro Inc. was recently hired by Corus Entertainment to review its operations.

""It's the people who are behind the scenes, the decision-makers that really matter and that's where the media in this country have failed.""

It's not for lack of trying, of course.

Over the years, there have been recruitment efforts, training sessions, and diversity pledges, just as there have been in other business sectors.

But anything that fails to dismantle systemic and structural barriers are superficial measures that don't achieve meaningful change, says Brian Daly of the Canadian Association of Black Journalists.

MORE EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS

The CABJ and Canadian Journalists of Colour have partnered for a joint call to action that includes: regular disclosure of newsroom demographics, more representation and coverage of racialized communities (in part through hiring), and proactive efforts to seek, retain and promote Black and Indigenous journalists and journalists of colour to management positions.

They also suggest regular consultation with racialized communities on news coverage, identifying and addressing systemic barriers, targeted scholarships and mentorship opportunities, and encouraging journalism schools to lay the groundwork with diverse faculty and more focus on how to cover racialized communities.

Many on the ground agree conditions won't improve without system-wide changes.

An expressed desire to address diversity is not enough, says TSN's SportsCentre anchor Kayla Grey, who weathered blowback and sparked a Twitter hashtag when she criticized white freelance journalist Sheri Forde for using the N-word in a Medium blog post that ironically detailed Forde's efforts at building racial awareness.

""Companies and newsrooms are showing their ass right now,"" says Grey, the first Black woman to anchor a national TV sports show in Canada.

""I'm seeing people fumble and it's clear that they just don't have those voices in those rooms that check them in the first place. Or they might have those voices in the room, they might have that representation, but are they listening clearly to those voices? And have those voices felt empowered to speak out about such issues?""

THE IMPACT ON STAFF

The National Post met condemnation both within and outside of its newsroom for several inflammatory commentaries, most notably one from Rex Murphy on June 1 that declared, ""Canada is not a racist country."" The online link now features an apology for ""a failure in the normal editing oversight"" and points readers to a rebuttal by Financial Post writer Vanmala Subramaniam.

Nevertheless, Murphy defended the piece in another column June 16 and Post founder Conrad Black added his denials of systemic racism in columns June 20 and 27, the latter of which dismissed the current reckoning with racial injustice and systemic racism as an ""official obsession"" causing ""an absurd displacement for other concerns.""

A few frustrated staffers began withholding bylines from their own stories shortly after that first Black column, growing to involve more as the week wore on.

Editor-in-chief Rob Roberts would not comment on the byline strike, only saying: ""We stand by our columnists' right to state their opinion.""

Phyllise Gelfand, vice-president of communications for Postmedia, says in an emailed statement that the company is revisiting its diversity and inclusion programs and that diversity training for its newsrooms will roll out ""immediately.""

Daly says it would be harder to dismiss the lived experiences of Black people if they were welcomed into newsrooms and their leadership.

""Allow people of differing worldviews and differing lived experiences to coexist in a newsroom environment, and then you're going to get a healthy newsroom,"" says Daly, a TV producer for the CBC in Halifax.

Throughout a 25-year career spanning five provinces, Daly has worked at CBC, CTV and Global, plus The Canadian Press and the former QMI Agency, and says he has never had a manager of colour. He recalls just three full-time colleagues who were Black.

NEXT STEPS

In June, the CABJ penned an open letter to Corus Entertainment urging improved supports for Black voices and staff while expressing solidarity ""with Black employees at Global News who have grappled with feelings of defeat"" over repeated microaggressions.

That was followed last Thursday by another open letter to Corus and its Global News division signed by more than 100 hosts, producers, reporters, editors and camera operators with similar demands. ""If we are to expect accountability of others, we must demand it of ourselves,"" they wrote.

Corus has hired Grange's agency, DiversiPro Inc., to review the entire organization, while its executive vice president of broadcast networks, Troy Reeb, says in a statement it's ""acting immediately"" at Global News to increase representation, remove systemic barriers to retention and promotion, and consult with marginalized communities on news coverage.

Grange, who wouldn't discuss details of the review, notes an enduring lack of diversity in the broader media industry when it comes to those who decide which stories are covered and how they're told.

Entire communities and perspectives are at risk of being ignored or distorted when coverage is filtered through a predominantly white lens, says Daly.

And when that happens, news coverage can effectively uphold the status quo, sustain systemic barriers and actively deepen racial inequities, adds Anita Li of the Canadian Journalists of Colour.

""That's actually bad for democracy because if people don't see themselves reflected in the news they're less likely to vote, to trust their neighbours, to engage civically,"" says Li, whose career has included stints with CTV Ottawa, CBC, the Toronto Star and the Globe and Mail.

These are not new problems, she adds, suggesting recent scrutiny rather than genuine insight has spurred some organizations to declare serious plans to address race-related failings.

Li notes the CABJ and CJOC issued their joint calls to action in January but the response from legacy organizations ""was crickets.""

""We didn't hear anything from them until these mass protests started happening,"" she says of widespread demonstrations against anti-Black racism and police brutality.

Grange, too, says the majority of his clients have not traditionally been media. But that's changing.

""Suddenly, we're getting them. It's kind of interesting.""

THE GROWING RESPONSE

Despite recent high-profile transgressions, the media industry does appear to be confronting its role in upholding white bias, says Li, pointing to emerging outlets, major media unions and larger organizations that have publicly committed to the calls to action.

She says they include the Toronto Star, the Globe and Mail union, Global News, and the Walrus.

The Canadian Press says it has met with the CABJ and CJOC on the recommendations and is working to ensure it has the proper infrastructure in place to fully enact them.

""I actually feel like there's genuine traction being made and there's actual, candid conversations about the barriers that journalists of colour are facing,"" says Li.

The conversation is long overdue at the Winnipeg Free Press, editor Paul Samyn wrote July 3 in an opinion piece titled, ""An apology for marginalizing people of colour; and a promise to atone for our past."" The article admits the paper has, ""at times, been part of the problem, not the solution,"" while promising to better reflect and serve marginalized communities.

Measures there include the addition of four full-time reporters of colour, a special news project examining race and racism, and plans to close online commenting as of July 14 because it too-often served as a magnet for racist commentary.

Li acknowledges that dwindling ad revenues, dropping readership and fragmented audiences amid a plethora of free online competitors make it financially difficult for many outlets.

But investing in diversity and inclusion pays off in the long run, she says, noting Canada's immigrant and racialized population is growing.

""So you're just increasingly missing a bigger and bigger portion of Canadian society,"" she says of ignoring change.

""Sooner or later these folks, these communities that are being overlooked, are going to go to alternative sources of media.""

Li encourages journalists and outlets to guard against feeling defensive when forced to acknowledge failures.

""For me it's about calling them in, not calling them out,"" says Li.

""The only way we can solve this issue is collaboratively together, with all hands on deck. It's not just the responsibility of people of colour or journalists of colour. It's the responsibility of the entire industry.""

Lorelei Cornell and Rick Bathgate have been dealing with the grasshoppers for a few weeks on their farm near the hamlet of Fairy Hill.

“They’re eating all the crops in the area,” Lorelei Cornell said. “Our front lawn is gone and they’re eating our pasture, so all the grass for our horses is slowly disappearing.”

Dr. James Tansey, the Province’s entomologist, said these insects are a part of a high-density localized outbreak of clear-winged and two-striped grasshoppers.

“We are starting to see adults which are starting to speed along pretty quickly,” Tansey said. “We usually don’t see adults until later in July, typically late July.”

Tansey said the hot and dry condition in the Fairy Hill area have allowed these insects to thrive. He is encouraging producers in the region should start monitoring their grasshopper populations.

“Numbers can be very high.” Tansey said. “It really is a numbers game. Broad acceptability of different host plants and they can cause a lot of damage in a hurry.”

Along with the concerns of running out of pasture for their horses, the large amount of the insects are also a nuisance.

“They’re covering the house so you have to scoop them away to get in the house,” Cornell said. “You have grasshoppers all over in the house. They fill up the water troughs for the horse’s drinking water so you have to clean those and scoop them out.”",[]

""Why can't we spend a normal day together?!""

That's the stage of Summer we're at weather wise. Storm season has just begun and it's already been really active, days will feature normal parts but they'll rarely stay that way.

During the course of the storm season in Saskatchewan we get an average of 13 tornados, last weekend we had three in one day! On Saturday, July 4 during the afternoon and evening a cyclical tornadic supercell thunderstorm moved through Southern Saskatchewan. This big baddie of a storm not only produced three separate tornadic events but also threw softball sized hail from the sky. Surprisingly the reported damage from these storms was minimal

The first tornado touched down near Glenbain, Sask. around 4:30 in the afternoon, no damage was reported from this event. Number two happened just 10 minutes later at 4:40 near Kincaid. This time it stayed on the ground for approximately 40 minutes and moved Eastward towards Woodrow. Damage to a home and farm property was reported and investigated from this event. The storm continued on towards Assiniboia and near that community another touchdown occurred, around 6:23. Once again no damage was reported.

DID YOU KNOW

On Sunday, June 30,1912 the deadliest tornado in Canadian history hit the city of Regina. The Regina Cyclone started to develop at about 4:50 p.m., green funnel clouds formed and touched down South of the city. It tore through the residential area between Wascana Lake and Victoria Avenue, continuing through the downtown business district, rail yards, warehouse district and Northern residential area. There were a total of 28 fatalities.

Photos sourced from the Provincial Archives of Saskatchewan.

After things from the weekend settled down they ramped back up on Tuesday, July 7. A large line of storms from around the Swift Current area to Southern Montana moved across Southern Saskatchewan. This line of intense storms brought severe wind gusts, large hail and heavy rain. The Southwestern corner took the brunt of these storms once again.

Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) recorded the top wind gust at 141 km per hour at the Mankota station. Two other stations were in triple digits, Coronach at 139 km per hour and Val Marie at 117 km per hour. Nickel sized hail was reported in the Golden Prairie area and reports of trees being snapped came in from near Hazenmore.

Once this line of storms subsided a large area of low pressure developed and moved slowly through Central Saskatchewan. The Northwest side of this system dropped large amounts of rain and a good portion of that also slide through the Southwestern corner of the Province. The 24 hour accumulated precipitation, as of 11 a.m. Wednesday July 9, for North Battleford was 133.8 mm or around 5 inches. Localized flooding happened in North Battleford and Swift Current as city drains couldn't keep up to the downpours. The average rainfall for the whole month of July in North Battleford is 74 mm or 3 inches, they recieved almost double in 24 hours!

As we continue to move through the month of July we'll stay unsettled for the next couple of weeks. Now that moisture has blanketed the Province daytime heating will continue to produce the risk of thunderstorms on an almost daily basis.

Moisture breeds more moisture. If you're looking for a consistent nice day this weekend it will be Saturday. Temperatures will be seasonal and the sun will stick around all day.

Sunday afternoon the trouble starts to bubble up once again and we'll watch for more thunderstorms scattered through the Province.

A report published by CBC News alleges Harmony Builders failed to pay several sub contractors for completed work. Some of those sub-contractors have placed liens on properties and field lawsuits against Harmony Builders.

“We had first heard from some of our members that are creditors of Harmony Builders that they had received notification that Harmony was essentially offering them 20 cents on the dollar,” said Stu Niebergall, from the Regina Home Builders’ Association.

Similar complaints have appeared on Harmony Builders Facebook Page.

A former customer who spoke with CTV News said they moved into a Harmony built home in 2018. They said they are still waiting for the builder to address leaking windows, cracked stairs and interior flooring.

CTV News contacted Harmony Builders but did not receive a response to our request for an interview.

PROMPT PAY

The Provincial Government passed prompt pay legislation for building contractors in 2019, but it is still not enacted.

“It’s brought to the foreground, a lot of the emotions that we’ve been going over for the past two years about getting this legislation enacted,” said Jason Duke, from Certa Pro Painters.

The legislation comes into effect in 2021. Duke hopes the law will tighten up inefficiencies in the current construction system, offering protection for sub-trades and home owners.

“You’re actually out the cost on that project, in most cases, 90 plus days, so I can see how sub contractors and contractors are always in a conundrum because basically it’s always their good customers that are always paying for their bad customers,” said Duke.

The Saskatchewan Construction Association is lobbying the government to withhold any exemptions for residential builders under the prompt pay legislation.

“It’s not uncommon for us to get calls from leaders of construction companies where they are in tears, wondering how they are going to pay their employees, keep their business alive,” said Mark Cooper, from the Saskatchewan Construction Association.

“We believe that every contractor has the right to be paid in a timely manner and the right to defend themselves if they haven’t been paid in a timely manner and we don’t see why that legislation shouldn’t apply across the board.”

Cooper advises homeowners to choose a contractor you trust and ask questions. He said it is important to talk to everyone on-site to make sure they’re being paid, and ask for proof.",[]

Cody Peters is a 24-year-old linebacker who was looking forward to his final season with the University of Regina Rams.

After COVID-19 forced the cancellation of the 2020 season, Peters hoped he, and other 24-year old players, would be granted another year of eligibility. However, U Sports has upheld its rule, meaning his career with the Rams is likely finished.

“I thought I would at least get my last season or they would have tried to accommodate us with everything that’s going on,” said Peters. “Feels like we’re getting blamed for it, or we’re taking all the punishment for something that’s out of our control.”

When the Canada West conference and U Sports decided to cancel a handful of 2020 varsity seasons, including football, University of Regina’s Director of Sport Lisa Robertson hoped the league would review the age cap.

Many felt the Board would explore the possibility of a one year exemption, but the Board voted to retain the current U Sports policy.

“I am surprised by the ruling and I’m really disappointed frankly,” said Robertson. “I’m disappointed for these young men across the country.”

The age cap was implemented in 2014 on the basis of “student health and safety”.

“[We are] certainly sympathetic towards those student-athletes who will exceed the age cap prior to the 2021 football season, the rational of health and safety was ultimately determined to be too important of a factor to provide an exemption,” the Board said in an email statement.

The rule was introduced so older and more mature players would not pose a threat to younger players on a team if there was a large age discrepancy on rosters.

“We are in unprecedented times and a one year relief of this rule, to allow a 26 year old to play, I am comfortable from a safety perspective,” said Robertson, who added she is not naïve to the rule.

“The reality is the number of 18 and 19-year-old men that make the playing roster and get on the field is frankly the exception and not the rule. Our coaches are professionals and they know that they have to build these young men up in order to play at this level of football.”

Before making a decision, the U Sports Board requested feedback from multiple sources, including the 27 football institutions, as well as the Men’s Football Sport Technical Sub-Committee before presenting a recommendation to the U Sports Board of Directors.

However, the Board is facing criticism as only half of the voting members have football programs.

“This is a freak of nature situation that we’re in” said Peters. “I would want to tell them to put themselves in my shoes.”

Peters was named the CJFL’S Defensive Player of the Year with the Hilltops in 2018 before joining the Rams. That same year, he was also invited to the Saskatchewan Roughriders training camp. He’s worried this decision could threaten any future professional football opportunities.

Cody Peters is a 24-year-old linebacker who was looking forward to his final season with the University of Regina Rams.

After COVID-19 forced the cancellation of the 2020 season, Peters hoped he, and other 24-year old players, would be granted another year of eligibility. However, U Sports has upheld its rule, meaning his career with the Rams is likely finished.

“I thought I would at least get my last season or they would have tried to accommodate us with everything that’s going on,” said Peters. “Feels like we’re getting blamed for it, or we’re taking all the punishment for something that’s out of our control.”

When the Canada West conference and U Sports decided to cancel a handful of 2020 varsity seasons, including football, University of Regina’s Director of Sport Lisa Robertson hoped the league would review the age cap.

Many felt the Board would explore the possibility of a one year exemption, but the Board voted to retain the current U Sports policy.

“I am surprised by the ruling and I’m really disappointed frankly,” said Robertson. “I’m disappointed for these young men across the country.”

The age cap was implemented in 2014 on the basis of “student health and safety”.

“[We are] certainly sympathetic towards those student-athletes who will exceed the age cap prior to the 2021 football season, the rational of health and safety was ultimately determined to be too important of a factor to provide an exemption,” the Board said in an email statement.

The rule was introduced so older and more mature players would not pose a threat to younger players on a team if there was a large age discrepancy on rosters.

“We are in unprecedented times and a one year relief of this rule, to allow a 26 year old to play, I am comfortable from a safety perspective,” said Robertson, who added she is not naïve to the rule.

“The reality is the number of 18 and 19-year-old men that make the playing roster and get on the field is frankly the exception and not the rule. Our coaches are professionals and they know that they have to build these young men up in order to play at this level of football.”

Before making a decision, the U Sports Board requested feedback from multiple sources, including the 27 football institutions, as well as the Men’s Football Sport Technical Sub-Committee before presenting a recommendation to the U Sports Board of Directors.

However, the Board is facing criticism as only half of the voting members have football programs.

“This is a freak of nature situation that we’re in” said Peters. “I would want to tell them to put themselves in my shoes.”

Peters was named the CJFL’S Defensive Player of the Year with the Hilltops in 2018 before joining the Rams. That same year, he was also invited to the Saskatchewan Roughriders training camp. He’s worried this decision could threaten any future professional football opportunities.

“That was always my dream, my goal, to get to there and be given another opportunity to show what I have,” says Peters, who was released after the training camp. “But with everything that’s going on I feel like that was just taken away from me.”

The age cap rule will affect six current members of the Rams.

In a news release, Haldimand-Norfolk Public Health said the outbreak at Scotlynn Group in Vittoria was officially declared over on Friday.

“I think we’re all happy for Scotlynn, for the migrant workers, and certainly for the community,” said Kristal Chopp, Norfolk County mayor and chair of the Board of Health. “When you look at the totality of this, the program was really an employer-focused program as oppose to an employee-focused program.”

Around 200 workers tested positive for COVID-19 at the peak of the outbreak, and one person died from complications.

Chopp says there are lessons to be learned from what happened.

“We have two workers that have now admitted to concealing symptoms,” she said. “I think one of the biggest things we need to look at is who is taking those wellness checks and really evaluating them.”

Norfolk and Haldimand counties now administer serial sentinel testing on farms as a proactive measure.

Chopp describes this process as taking the highest risk population in a certain bunkhouse and testing around 10 per cent every couple of weeks.

“The idea being here is that it would give some sort of a signal in advance of a large outbreak, like we saw,” she said.

Chopp says she sent letters weeks ago calling on the provincial and federal governments to take control over the screen and quarantine process for migrant workers in a similar way that British Columbia has done.

She adds that they haven’t heard a response yet.

“This is a tragedy and crisis that could have been prevented a long time ago,” said Chris Ramsaroop, an organizer Justice for Migrant Workers. “Permanent status on arrival at the federal level is essential. It’s time.”

On the provincial level, Ramsaroop is calling for the inclusion of minimum wage for all farm workers and ensuring they have equal access to occupational health and safety.

“If people are getting sick here in Canada, or injured here in Canada, it’s our responsibility to take care of them,” he said. “This isn’t about good and bad employers. This is systematic overhaul that needs to happen.”

Ramsaroop adds that municipalities should enact their own Section 22 orders similar to the one by the Haldimand-Norfolk Health Unit.",[]

The Canadian Association of Police Chiefs released a report on Thursday recommending all police agencies recognize substance abuse and addiction as a public health issue.

""[It's] time for us to take a different, modernized, innovative and bold approach to managing addiction in our country,"" WRPS Chief Bryan Larkin said. ""Let's not criminalize addiction, let's actually move towards a public health model.""

The CAPC wants the federal government to establish a national task force to research drug policy reform.

Sanguen Health Centre clinical supervisor and educator Alice Maguire said decriminalization would help reduce the stigma associated with addictions.

""This has a lot of potential to be really, really helpful, to save lives,"" she said. ""That will ultimately lead to less overdose deaths and less crimes associated with substance use.""

However, Cambridge councillor Jan Liggett, who said she opposes consumption and treatment sites in the city, said adopting this approach could be dangerous.

""Decriminalized just gives free rein for more happening on the streets,"" Liggett said. ""You'll have more and more people actively using out in the open because there are no consequences, there's no enforcement of the law.""

Larkin said decriminalization isn't legalization, meaning police will continue to stop trafficking, producing and importing drugs.

""We don't support perpetual drug use,"" he said. ""We still believe drugs ought to be illegal, it's how we manage the outcome.""",[]

The instructions issued by Dr. Miriam Klassen, the area’s Medical Officer of Health, state that business ownersmust implement the policy for everyone entering commercial establishments.

“These additional instructions for commercial establishments that are open to the public build upon the diligent work many are already doing to ensure physical distancing and hand sanitizers,” said Dr. Klassen in a news release. “Face coverings are extra protection to prevent COVID-19 spread, they also send a message that the wearer wants to protect others.”

Public health describes a face covering as a medical or non-medical mask, a bandana, scarf, or other item that covers the mouth and nose.

Certain exemptions to the requirement are in place, like for those who have a medical condition that prevents them from wearing a mask.

“As we work towards a successful Stage 3 re-opening, we also increase the risk of spreading the virus,” said Klassen. “Normalizing the use of masks helps reduce this risk and helps keep businesses and services up and running.

“We ask everyone to be kind and understanding when others can’t wear masks, and to physically distance from them.”

Public health says business operators should use signs and verbal reminders to enforce the policy, but that there is no requirement to turn away customers.

According to public health’s website as of Thursday, Huron and Perth counties have 58 confirmed cases of COVID-19, five deaths, 52 resolved, and have tested 9,386 people.

Huron Perth Public Health is the latest region to enact a mandatory mask policy. Earlier this week, Waterloo Region voted in favour of bylaws that would make them mandatory on transit and in businesses.

The City of Toronto has also mandated masks, and Brantford council will be considering a move to do the same.

Lucy Van Doormaal, who is just three months old, has spinal muscular atrophy. Without treatment for the rare neuromuscular disorder, her parents don't think she'll make it to her first birthday.

""She just looks like any normal three-month-old, but she is eating through a feeding tube,"" Heather Kendall, Lucy's aunt, said. ""It's very different and at night she sleeps with a respirator machine.""

An antibody test when Lucy was five weeks old showed she could be a candidate for a ground-breaking gene therapy called Zolgensma. The price tag of that treatment is $3 million.

""They had heard of this treatment and it's availability, but $3 million seemed like an insane amount of money,"" Kendall said.

The single-dose treatment isn't covered under Canadian health care.

""Every day that goes by, that quality or that ability gets lost,"" Lucy's grandfather Brian Van Doormaal said. ""We need to raise that money as soon as possible.""

There are other treatments available, but Brian said they're also expensive and more long term.

The family is raising money through a GoFundMe for the treatment and to keep Lucy from getting worse. It raised $1 million in one week. Donations came in from across the country, even garnering celebrity attention from Ryan Reynolds and Jillian Harris.

""It's been very overwhelming in a very positive way,"" Lucy's mother Laura Van Doormaal said. ""We are uplifted by the community's response to Lucy's story.""

Kitchener's Play-a-Latte Cafe has also launched a fundraising campaign, selling cinnamon buns to raise money for the treatment.

""We heard her story and, just as parents, we felt for the family and wanted to do something, so this was a way for us to give back,"" owner Heather Lynn Patel said.

Kaysen Martin, an Edmonton toddler, has also been diagnosed with the disorder. Her family has also launched an online campaign to raise money for treatment.

Marie closes its doors,['Jairus Patterson'],2020-07-11 15:29:00-04:00,"SAULT STE. MARIE -- After six years on Gore and Albert Street, The Neighborhood Resource Centre in Sault Ste. Marie has closed its doors and will look for a new location.

The police chief said the decision to move was made for safety reasons.



""When we had bylaw and the fire department in there was significant issues associated with that facility,"" said Chief Huge Stevenson.



""There’s no way an employer could allow people to work in that, based on employee standards.""

The Neighbourhood Resource Centre opened in 2014. People hoped the centre would help solve the drug, theft and prostitution issues surrounding the area.



As of late, the chief said the area was a hub for crime.



""We had significant secondary crimes associated with that area, open drug dealing, prostitution,"" said Stevenson.



""Really I think it became more of a hang out then it was helping or treating people.""

Luke Dufour is the chair of the board for the District of Sault Ste. Marie Social Services. He also owns a building a block away from the resource centre. He said the success of the centre can not be viewed upon simply by looking at crime stats.

""If all you’re measuring is crime, you’re not necessarily going to measure the impact of a place like the Neighbourhood Resource Centre. Because increasing the quality of life is also part of the equation and helping increase those social determinants of health and make them better for downtown residence.""

The chief said the closure of the building is a perfect time to reassess the goals of the centre.



""During the latter part of the NRC, there was no performance measure, no objectives that were being sort of attained to and so this was an opportunity to re-examine what we were doing there.""

Moving forward, Dufour said it makes sense for social services to take over the lead of the next Resource Centre.



The chief agrees and says there will still be a police presence wherever the next centre is located, but there won’t be an officer stationed there all the time.

The John Howard Society had workers stationed at the Centre for six years. Executive Director Suzanne Lajambe said its time to change the goals of the centre.



""We accomplished what we intended to do but as the time went by and needs changed certainly we have a lot more issues happening in our community around addictions and mental health. I think we need to grow beyond when it originally started up.""

Chief Stevenson, Dufour and Lajambe all agree that wherever the new Neighbourhood Resource Centre will be, it should be located in the downtown.",[]

Police say 10 people died in collisions involving a transport truck or other commercial vehicle on OPP patrolled roads in northeastern Ontario in 2018. Last year six people died and so far this year, two lives have been taken.

They're warning all drivers, especially truck drivers, to pay attention.

""It's even more important for commercial motor vehicles because these vehicles are so much bigger and have the potential to cause so much more damage or possible injury and or death,"" said OPP Const. Phil Young in a phone interview with CTV News.

A major concern for police right now is a spike in crashes.

Commercial motor vehicle collisions have increased by almost 100 from 2018 to 2019. Police attribute most of these crashes to speed.

""Most of the time it's speed or the driver is not paying attention,"" said Farmer. ""One time I saw a guy on the 401 watching a movie from an iPad on the dash. Have some respect for the other drivers on the road.""

Farmer said some transport drivers drive faster to meet deadlines.

After a thorough search, the kitten was found in a car fender and has now been given the name ‘Fender.’

Fender is about 10 weeks old and was found under Shirley Anderson’s car, who was able to rescue the distressed feline.

“I glanced at the side of the road and I saw this little black thing hopping and I thought it was a weasel,"" Anderson said. ""I look over and see a man trying to stop traffic and I realized it was a kitten. So I did a U-turn, got out and tried to help rescue this kitten. As I approached … a vehicle almost hit the kitten, then she ran under my car,”

Anderson said someone from nearby Speedy Glass helped her look for Fender for close to an hour Tuesday afternoon.

“We kept on trying and trying, then another man from Fountain Tire named Corey came by and he said, 'hold on I’ll go get a jack,'' she said. ""He jacked up the car and went under the fender, and there she was. She was terrified.”

Anderson then called SAINTS Rescue Sudbury, which stands for 'Safeguarding Animals In Need Today Society,' and a volunteer immediately picked her up.

Found good homes

“We got the cat, we put her in the carrier and I brought her home and now it’s time to get the cat to relax, know that it’s safe,” said Carole Gascon, a volunteer at SAINTS.

Officials with SAINTS said the number of applications to adopt a cat has doubled this summer. Just last month, 32 cats were adopted, which they say is significantly higher than June of 2019.

“We believe we have found good homes for them,” said Gascon. ""Last year in comparison, nothing was moving. People were busy, we had kittens that were being adopted late in the year and now they don’t even make it to the shelter. They are pre-adopted. We have a waiting list of people wanting to adopt cats and kittens.”

Volunteers say COVID plays a big role in that.

“People have the time to spend to get the cat accustomed to their new home and to train it,” said Gascon.

Officials with SAINTS said donations are vital at this time. Money donated goes to feeding the cats and getting them the medical help they need.

Working with the Canadian Mental Health Association Cochrane-Timiskaming branch, the program pairs clients with one-bedroom housing from participating landlords, helps subsidize rent and provides mental health and life skills supports.

Brian Marks, CAO of the social services board, told CTV it’s a switch away from the shelter system to focus on what it hopes is a more sustainable solution.

“Long-term, it’s the continued application of those supports that will determine the success of this program,” Marks said. “Getting somebody housed for a day: great, it was a success. Keeping them housed for six months, 12 months, 18 months, that’s where the work really comes in.”

Making an ‘impactful change’

Marks said getting landlords on board for the program didn’t take much convincing, as long as the social services board could guarantee rent, along with added incentives like damage costs.

Clients stay in the program for as long as necessary, until they can cover rent on their own and no longer need as many supports. So far, Marks said at least 20 clients have been housed.

Paul Jalbert, the mental health association’s local executive director, said the program is still a work in progress and will require adjustments as community partners figure out the most effective ways to address client needs.

But with the pandemic seeming to put the world on hold, he said this is the time to explore different tactics.

Focus on building self-reliance

“It lets us really take a step back and say ‘OK, if we’re going to make meaningful, impactful change, this is an opportunity to do it,’” Jalbert said in a Zoom interview. ""Let’s see what we can get out of this, let’s see what we can learn from it.

""It’s a very action-oriented project but in the background, we’re collecting information ... that lets us know if we’re on the right track.”

If the program works, Jalbert said it will be something the association and the services board can take to other communities as an example of how this approach worked in Timmins. If it doesn’t, he said they will keep looking for better options.

But Marks said he’s now convinced that a housing-first approach is the best method to give the homeless population a pathway to break out of that cycle. And when compared to the shelter system, he said it will end up saving the community money since it would reduce the cost for hospitals, paramedics and police.",[]

The Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police is calling for the decriminalization of possession of small amounts of illegal drugs, at the same time proposing increased access to health care, treatment and social services to divert people away from the criminal justice system.

The changes would apply to people possessing a small amount of illicit drugs for personal consumption.

North Bay Police Chief Scott Tod said the decriminalization announcement is part of a long-term trend in Canada where police develop partnerships in communities they serve to take a broader approach to the drug crisis.

""The announcement is just an extension of the belief that police and our community partners in collaboration together can do a much better job in regards to providing a safe place where members of our community can live and grow and enjoy our the public spaces,"" Tod said.

Decriminalization is not legalization

He said it's important to draw a distinction between decriminalization and legalization.

""The offensive of possessing an illicit substance is still a crime,"" he said. ""But what (decriminalization) provides is the opportunity for … diversionary measures.""

Giving an addict a criminal record is a barrier to their recovery, and in some cases, Tod said having the option to direct people to treatment can be a more effective choice for the person, and the community as a whole.

""Remember, 17,000 people have died in the last four years as a result of opioids in Canada,"" he said. ""It's an incredible number of people in such a short period of time.""

""What (decriminalization) can allow is for some rapid intervention for a person suffering from a substance use disorder,"" Tod said. ""And it could allow for the courts to quickly divert the person into a program or offer the person assistance in regards to their substance use disorder.""

In Greater Sudbury, Insp. Dan Despatie said the announcement by the Canadian police chiefs is all about giving police options other than putting people in jail.

Despite the huge number of people who have been arrested, the drug crisis keeps getting worse. He compared it to the definition of insanity: doing the same thing over and over, while expecting a different result.

'What we have done in the past hasn't worked'

""What we have done in the past hasn't worked,"" Despatie said, filling in for Chief Paul Pedersen, who is away. ""We want to get away from arrest, arrest, arrest ... Police want to be part of the solution.""

Despatie, who has extensive frontline experience dealing with the drug crisis, said the key is having health supports and places that addicts can access to give police options on how to best address each case.

""Frontline officers have to have somewhere to go"" if they're not putting addicts in jail, he said. ""You don't just flip a switch. So before decriminalization, those options need to be in place.""

The move from the chiefs of police comes at a time when many people are calling for police to be defunded, in the wake of the George Floyd killing in Minneapolis. Tod said the announcement had been in the works for a long time, and the two were not connected.

""Racism in any form is horrendous to our society,"" he said, adding that police chiefs in Ontario have acknowledged systemic racism does exist in policing. But police in the north want to be not just part of the solution, they want to be a leading voice.

""We want to be the headlights on the car going forward, not the tail lights,"" Tod said. ""We want to be able to identify now where we need to change. Working with our community partners on this, we want to identify how we have to change, where we need to change, so that going forward we may have less systemic discrimination going on and racism going on in policing across Canada.""",[]

By the thousands, they cling to walls, lamp posts, signs and even trees.

""I love them,"" said one woman. ""They're a sign of a healthy lake. If you're born and raised in North Bay, you have to accept them.""

The smelly bugs are harmless. They're known for their foul odour and fast mating. They have no mouths due to their short lifespan, but that doesn't mean they aren't a nuisance to some, especially anglers.

The bugs are a tasty treat for area fish and with the bugs coming out in the masses, the fish get quite full after eating them.

""It sucks for fishing and it sucks for swimming for a couple of weeks,"" said another North Bayite. ""It is what it is, but I love seeing tourists run away screaming from them.""

Shad flies are also known as mayflies. They come out of Lake Nipissing when the water temperature is just right. They usually hang around for a couple of weeks starting every July.

""They're our mascot,"" said Tourism North Bay Executive director Steve Dreany. ""Around the shores we have so much shallow water and because the water is really shallow there, the sun heats it up and it gets a lot warmer than deeper water that has the cooling effect.""

They gather in large swarms to escape predators -- and because they are not skilled flyers.

""When I was a teenager, some friends of mine and I went to the movie theatre and a lot of tourists were there,"" recounts one man. ""They covered me in shad flies and when the tourists came out, I started screaming and the tourists were panicking.""

While we have seen shad fly pins and T-shirts for sale in the past, this year, a local band known as the 'J Houston Band' has written and released a new song and music video about the tiny insects called the 'Shad Fly Shuffle.'

""The words were given to Jim from J Houston Band,"" said bass player Carolyn Houston. ""He thought the words were great, so we wanted to write a song and we did a garage recording of it.""

Just like Toronto's CN Tower, North Bay has its own tourist attraction, even if they are only a couple of millimetres in size.

Beatty said the centre was losing the college roughly $500,000 each year. With new safety guidelines in place and day cares only being allowed to accept 50 per cent of their capacity, the cost of staying open was going to be too expensive.

“Mario is a community champion who truly understands the importance of education both to the individual and community,” Dr. David Nanang, former chair of the university’s board of governors and the chancellor search committee, said in the release.

“He will be an excellent chancellor for Algoma University, particularly in this period of program and enrolment growth where we will welcome increasing numbers of students and employees locally, provincially, nationally and from across the world.”

Born in Italy, and immigrating to Canada as a young child, he had a 42-year career in education, including nine years as director of education for the Algoma District School Board. ""Turco has become a passionate advocate for student success, equity and public education,"" the university said.

""Mario is highly regarded and respected for his experience, his interpersonal skills, his knowledge, and strategic thinking. He has worked extensively with government, school boards, and organizations across the province and country.""

Since retirement, Turco has been active in Sault Ste. Marie. He currently serves on the board of directors for the Sault Area Hospital as first vice-chair as well as chair of the education committee and chair of the recruitment and Selection committee.

“I am honoured and pleased to be chosen as chancellor of Algoma University,” Turco said. “Working in education has been my life calling. I have been fortunate to be associated with students, educators, and other stakeholders from the elementary, to the university level advocating the importance of education to the individual and to society in general.""

""Algoma University has exemplary leadership, faculty, and staff,"" Turco continued. ""I am impressed with their great work, their many accomplishments and ambitious direction for the future.

""I look forward to working with all members of the university and its partners to advance its vision and mission to provide first-class education while at the same time cultivating cross-cultural learning through partnerships with Indigenous communities, organizations and groups. I thank the Algoma University Board of Governors, the selection committee, and my nominators for their confidence and support in my appointment.”

Algoma University’s chancellor serves as the ceremonial head of the institution and confers all degrees. An adviser and supporter to the president, the chancellor is a public proponent of the goals and objectives of the university and is an active participant in activities and the university community. It is a voluntary, unpaid position.

Turco succeeds Shirley Horn who served in the role since 2015. “Our university community is excited to have Mario Turco appointed to the role of chancellor,” said Asima Vezina, president and vice-chancellor. “His skill set will be an important asset as we move forward with our Special Mission, new programming, an aggressive capital plan and targeted enrolment growth on all three campuses.

Sault Ste. Marie City Council is set to vote on a motion Monday, asking the federal government to extend its border shutdown, but Shoemaker said eventually, that won't make sense anymore.

""Whether that's next month, two months, three months, six months from now, we can't keep the borders closed forever,"" he said. ""But what we can do, is consider a regional approach, similar to that of Ontario.""

That would include opening borders in sections of the country, where the risk for COVID-19 is lower.

""The facts in Algoma and Chippewa County, right across the river here, are certainly a lot different and I would expect them to be a lot different,"" Shoemaker said. ""That's because of the population size then say, Windsor-Detroit or Buffalo and Niagara Falls, where we know cases are much higher.""

Shoemaker said he's hoping fellow councillors will agree to call on the government to consider a regional approach.

However, it's so far not resonating.

""If you compare Michigan to Ontario over the course of the last 24 hours, for example, they've had twice as many cases as Ontario has,"" said Coun. Corey Gardi. ""I don't want to be a gateway for people coming into our country and specifically, here.""

Gardi said he agrees with Shoemaker, that the Sault's economy benefits greatly from border travel.

""But right now, the right move is to limit travel until we know we can get a handle of this virus,"" Gardi said.

He said despite COVID-19 cases being lower in Chippewa County, he has doubts whether he can trust American travel will be strictly from citizens with lower risk.

""So if you live in the south of the United States and you wanted to get out of the United States for a while, why could you not just come up here and cross our border?"" asked Gardi.

City council will vote on a motion asking the federal government to extend its border shutdown on Monday, July 13.

Many, like Nicole Graham and her husband, Allen, worried COVID-19 would leave food markets closed, which made it all the more of a relief as the market joined others across the province in returning for another season.

“We put in 12 acres of garden, so we’re going ‘Do we take the leap? Where do we sell this if markets don’t open?’” said Graham. “But we were happy to hear that they all opened up.”

Graham said as she’s taken her farm, Graham Acres, to markets in Timmins, Iroquois Falls and Kirkland Lake, she has seen the effort put into adhering to physical distancing and hygiene standards.

Communities have been passionately supporting local businesses, she said, including her farm's meat products during the province’s economic lockdown.

Noella Rinaldo, the Downtown Timmins BIA’s executive director, said markets will be crucial in supporting local producers through the crisis.

“I think if there’s one thing that people understood during COVID, it’s that food security is very important,” Rinaldo said. “So supporting local and supporting our farmers, it’s very important that we do this.”

Aside from the pandemic, farmer Marion Veens said the high temperatures this summer have taken a toll on vegetable production, since plants react to the heat by growing out their leaves instead of their produce.

That will contribute to a tough year ahead for her business, Sunrise Orchards and Produce, Veens said. Having open food markets means an opportunity to battle through both the health and economic crisis.

“Now that the markets have opened ... we’re happy and as long as people keep their safe distance, we’re a go.”",[]

The for-sale sign on the Birch family's house on Dawson Point Road in the community of New Liskeard had just gone up Saturday only to be taken down less than 24 hours later due to the extensive exterior damage caused by the violent summer storm.

Tracy DeLenardo-Birch said after a month and a half of working on the home every day, her yard was finally perfect as she had picked up the last pinecone out of the driveway at 9 p.m., and by 10:15, it was ""total destruction.""

""We were just in shock,"" said DeLenardo-Birch. ""I couldn't believe it.""

The homeowner said the siding was ""smashed to smithereens"" and that even the hard trim around the windows will have to be changed because of the hail.

A drone that was scheduled to fly over the house the next morning as part of the real estate listing was cancelled, and the home was taken off the market. The Birch family was hoping to build a new house on Lake Temiskaming in the fall and plans to relist once repairs are complete.

DeLenardo-Birch said the vehicles that were in the driveway sustained lots of little dents because of the hail as well.

Restoration experts in the area say they have had an influx of calls from the neighbourhood due to the storm and are busy with site visits to determine the extent of the damages.

Patrick Rivard of First General Temiskaming said because of the pandemic, there is a delay for some materials because many suppliers are still not up to full capacity. He says he is seeing a lot of damage to siding, fascia, soffit, roofing and windows.

The contractor said they are working to prioritize restoration jobs to ensure safety and prevent any further damage.

Dr. Penny Sutcliffe, the area's medical officer of health, is also requiring passengers aboard city transit vehicles to wear masks. Both directives take effect on July 8.

“The face-covering requirement for commercial premises that are open to the public is in addition to the diligent work many are already doing to ensure physical distancing and hand sanitizers,"" Sutcliffe said in a news release Friday. ""Face coverings are extra protection to prevent COVID-19 spread, they also send a message that the wearer wants to protect others.”

She said the measures are in tandem with the gradual reopening of the province, which brings new risks of spreading the virus.

“Establishing common expectations about routine face-covering helps reduce this risk now and will pave the way to successful Stage 3 re-opening,"" Sutcliffe said. ""It will also help protect us against a potential second wave in the fall and keep businesses and services up and running.”

As of July 8, city transit and businesses will have to have policies in place to stop people from entering if they are not wearing a face covering. The instructions are being issued under the authority of the provincial Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act, Public Health Sudbury said.

Businesses don't have to turn away customers

While commercial establishments are expected to use their best efforts to implement their face covering policies, there is no requirement that a business must turn away the customer not wearing a mask.

""This is in line with the 'good faith' enforcement framework of the Public Health Sudbury & Districts instructions, which builds on education and reminders,"" the release said.

In the instruction letter sent out Friday, all employers are reminded of their ongoing responsibilities to maintain two metres distance between employees and clients, to screen employees and members of the public for COVID-19 symptoms, and to promote excellent hygiene practices including handwashing.

For the purposes of the directive, a face-covering means a medical or non-medical mask or other face coverings such as a bandana, a scarf or cloth that covers the mouth and nose. Certain exemptions apply, for example, based on age or medical circumstances.

“I encourage everyone to be kind, patient, and respectful to one another,"" Sutcliffe said. ""How we navigate this pandemic is our individual and our shared responsibility. These latest instructions continue to count on everyone’s best intentions and my confidence is well placed. I fully expect we will show the province and the world how to do this right.""

Growing evidence shows the widespread use of face coverings decreases the spread of respiratory droplets, and expert opinion supports the widespread use of face coverings to decrease transmission of COVID-19.

Public Health is also reminding residents to follow public health guidance—wash your hands; cover your cough or sneeze with your arm or a tissue; avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth; stay two metres apart from others; wear your face covering, and stay home when ill.

If you have any COVID-19 symptoms, get tested. People who are asymptomatic, who are concerned that they have been exposed to COVID-19 are also encouraged to contact an assessment centre and get tested.

796,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/expert-says-studies-on-risk-of-virus-transmission-through-surfaces-don-t-reflect-real-world-1.5015069,Expert says studies on risk of virus transmission through surfaces don't reflect real world,[],2020-07-07 22:13:00-04:00,"TORONTO -- Is it necessary to wear gloves outside, or wipe down groceries or mail to keep yourself safe from potential COVID-19 exposure?

It’s a question that has been posed since the beginning of the pandemic.

Numerous studies have been carried out over the past few months to measure how long the virus can live on surfaces, looking at its lifespan on different materials and how infectious it remains for longer periods of time. Some studies have found the survival rate to be a matter of hours, while others have found that the virus, under some circumstances, can survive for days on surfaces.

Emanuel Goldman, Professor of Microbiology, Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics at the New Jersey Medical School, wrote in a comment published in the scientific journal The Lancet last week, that he believes the risk of virus transmission through infected surfaces has been “exaggerated.”

A “comment” does not present new data found through experiments or studies, but simply provides scientific commentary.

Goldman believes the results of all of these studies on the lifespan of the virus on surfaces have been used to direct courses of action for the general public that the data itself doesn’t call for.

“It’s not that the studies are wrong, it’s that they’re the wrong studies,” he told CTVNews.ca in a phone interview.

“So the belief that there was a risk from inanimate objects and surfaces stems from experiments that were done where virus was placed on surfaces, and then at intervals of times subsequent to doing that, the amount of virus that was left was measured. Well and good, but the problem with those experiments was that the amount of virus that they started with was much, much orders of magnitude larger than what you’re going to find in the real world.”

He said some of the studies measured the lifespan of the virus on surfaces by placing as much as “a hundred thousand to 10 million virus particles on a small surface area” -- which he believes is far higher than the amount of virus particles that would be present in the average sneeze.

He had not come across any scientific literature that specifically measured how many virus particles that caused COVID-19 were in a sneeze, but stated that similar research regarding the common flu found that there are around 10-100 viral particles within a droplet from an influenza patient.

Goldman emphasized that he doesn’t think these studies on the surface life of the virus are a problem themselves, but said the way their results have been interpreted and applied is.

“The supermarkets won't take returns of anything that you buy now because of this. You have to pack your own bags because they're worried about this. And it’s, in ways little and large, it's directed behaviour in a way that's not justified by the data,” he said.

“And even worse, it distracts and takes people away from what really protects you against this virus and that’s the masks. That's where the emphasis has to be. That's what's going to save us.”

He said that while it’s “not impossible” to contract COVID-19 in the grocery store by handling something that had recently been coughed on by an infected person, “there’s so many steps that would have to happen.

“First, someone infected would have to deposit the virus on the thing you bought, then you'd have to buy it right after. And after touching it, then you'd have to touch your mouth, your nose, [or] your eyes, and all that within a relatively short period of time.”

This means a person could handle a cereal box with virus particles on it and still remain safe if they were following the main public health recommendations -- wearing a mask in a grocery store and washing their hands at home before touching their face at all.

Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist, also told CTVNews.ca that transmission of the virus through surfaces was not “the main mode of transmission,” but said he doesn’t believe there’s an issue with being extra cautious by doing things such as wiping down groceries.

“If that's what gets people through the day, if that's what enables people to go get groceries, if that’s what enables people to open their mail, so be it, that's totally fine,” he said. “I think the pendulum is swinging away from that, but I would certainly not shame people for doing that at all.”

He said no one study alone is able to pinpoint an exact risk of transmission, and that one needs to look at the big picture to get an idea of the risks.

“At the end of the day, the data that's emerging now, when we sort of take a step back and look at who's getting infected, where are they getting infected and how are they getting infected -- this is generally people who are in close contact with one another, typically in indoor settings, when people are in close contact with one another for prolonged periods of time,” he said. “That’s who's getting the infection.”

New infection rates are also significantly lower in Canada than in countries such as the U.S., contributing to a lower risk of encountering surfaces that were coughed or sneezed on by an infected person within an hour or two of another person touching that surface.

Goldman acknowledged that disinfecting surfaces and tools and wearing gloves are things that are necessary in a hospital setting. But his worry for the general population is that the surface transmission discussion is a “distraction,” and that people might actually be less likely to follow any health guidelines if they feel overwhelmed by instructions to wipe down everything.

“You see now people not using masks, partly because it was such an overriding concern with including the surfaces. It just gets to be too much,” he said.

“Just use common sense and focus mostly on protecting your airways and your breathing.”",[]

Here's how to do better even if you're worried about everything.,['Jen Rose Smith'],2020-07-10 11:45:00-04:00,"Just before the lockdown began, London-based writer Valentina Valentini made the choice of a lifetime: She agreed to marry her partner. She didn't think twice about it.

A few weeks later, Valentini was struggling with pandemic-related anxiety that made even the most basic decisions seem daunting.

""It was just sort of this anxiety around everything,"" she said. ""Sometimes it can manifest itself in the smallest ways, like 'I don't know what to eat right now.' I can't choose the simplest thing.""

Experts say Valentini is not alone in her anxiety and the paralyzing indecision it can cause.

In the United Kingdom, 39% of people who are married or in a civil partnership now report high levels of anxiety, according to the Office for National Statistics. Researchers across Europe have found rising anxiety, depression and other mental health impacts amid the pandemic.

More than 35% of Chinese respondents had generalized anxiety disorder, a study found this month. Nearly a third of Americans are now experiencing symptoms of anxiety disorder, according to early-June data from the Household Pulse Survey, a partnership between the United States Census Bureau and the National Center for Health Statistics.

Those numbers might be shocking, but some mental health professionals say they're not surprised.

""Anxiety often goes up in any moment where our bodies perceive a real threat,"" said Luana Marques, a psychologist and president of the Anxiety and Depression Association of America. ""It certainly makes sense in the middle of a pandemic.""

For many, anxiety is something that you know when you feel it. The American Psychological Association defines anxiety as an ""emotion characterized by feelings of tension, worried thoughts and physical changes like increased blood pressure."" Other physical symptoms can include a rapid heartbeat, dizziness, sweating and trembling.

While anxiety is distinct from depression, another mood disorder, it's common to experience symptoms of both at the same time. There are several main types of anxiety disorder, including generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder and phobia-related disorders.

And while the symptoms of anxiety can be deeply unpleasant, Marques said the emotion is actually an essential tool our body uses to get us out of dangerous situations. ""Anxiety, as a biological response, is a state of fight or flight,"" she explained.

Escaping from a lion? The hypervigilance associated with anxiety can help.

But while that heightened awareness and vigilance makes biological sense, Marques said the emotion also erodes our ability to make well-reasoned choices.

""When you have a lot of anxiety you actually have trouble making decisions. That's something I'm seeing in my clinic,"" she said. ""Patients are having trouble figuring out: 'Is this a good decision or not?' And that's because their brain is not fully on to be able to make decisions.""

That's concerning: As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds, many are facing daily decisions with high stakes for their families' lives and livelihoods.

Fortunately, resources are available for those seeking help. The ADAA has a page dedicated to COVID-related mental health resources, including an online support group, how-to videos and tips on finding a mental health provider that offers telehealth services.

Want more good news? Marques and other experts say there's also a lot you can do to manage anxiety at home — techniques you can use to feel better and make wise choices. Here's where to start.

WHY IS IT SO HARD TO MAKE DECISIONS?

When we're feeling anxious, we've fired up a set of structures in our brain called the limbic system, said Marques. That's an area responsible for emotional responses, memory and motivation.

Our best reasoning and decision-making comes instead from the prefrontal cortex, what Marques called our ""thinking brain."" The limbic system and the prefrontal cortex fight for attention, she explained.

If your brain is in fight-or-flight mode, your overheated limbic system can cycle through an endless series of scary possibilities. Scientists call that ""amygdala hijack""— it's like your prefrontal cortex has lost control of the vehicle altogether. The amygdala is a part of the limbic system.

""When you're on [amygdala] hijack, you're 'spinning,'"" Marques said. ""You might say: 'If I don't put on a mask right now I'm going to catch the virus, and if I get the virus, who's going to take care of my kids?' — which of course makes you more anxious.""

That feeling can paralyze your ability to make a choice. And with your limbic system in control, you might not like what you settle on anyway. ""Because they are emotionally driven, those are decisions that might not be your best decisions,"" Marques said.

HOW TO HACK YOUR BRAIN'S ANXIETY RESPONSE

""The best response is to cool off your brain before making decisions,"" Marques said. By doing that, you'll give your rational prefrontal cortex the chance to take control.

One way to slow down your brain is to engage in a calming activity that makes you feel good — Marques suggested meditation, taking a walk, drinking a cup of tea or calling a supportive friend. For more information on this step, watch a YouTube video on slowing down the brain that Marques created with Harvard Medical School.

Using techniques drawn from cognitive behavioral therapy, Marques also helps patients learn to recognize and see their feelings and thoughts for what they are. (Marques and HMS also created a YouTube video about this process.)

Those strategies can help you step out of the cycle of anxiety, putting your prefrontal cortex back in the driver's seat.

And while Marques recommended employing these anti-anxiety strategies as needed, she said it's just as important to lay some healthy groundwork by taking care of yourself. That means you'll have more resources to draw on when anxiety strikes.

""Charge up,"" she said. ""What I mean by that is eating, sleeping and exercise. All three of those are things that we know help us activate our prefrontal cortex."" Charging up the brain helps regulate emotions and build resiliency.

DETERMINE WHAT YOU CAN (AND CAN'T) CONTROL

Once you're in a good frame of mind, Marques suggested reminding yourself that you don't need — or get — to manage everything.

""We're in the middle of this major uncertainty, and a lot of things are out of our control,"" she said. Rather than try to plan for every possibility, Marques recommended we face uncertainty head-on. ""Staying with this discomfort for a little bit is important.""

Lynn Bufka, a psychologist and a senior director at the American Psychological Association, agreed. You might not be able to control whether your employer stays afloat, for example. Instead, she suggested focusing on the things within your power while letting go of the rest.

""Some things, you can say: 'This is not a decision I have to make,'"" she said. Your kid's messy bedroom, for example? Bufka said to let that one go.

Once you've narrowed it down, pull out a sheet of paper and write out pros and cons, Bufka recommended. When everything is down in black and white, it can be easier to put your issues in perspective.

And if you find yourself obsessing over research and news-reading, consider setting a time limit: ""Like 'I can spend one hour researching this issue and then I have to stop,'"" she said.

MAKE AN IMPERFECT DECISION IN AN IMPERFECT SITUATION

You might not make the perfect decision, but Bufka offered a gentle reminder that it's OK to forge ahead anyway. ""We are making the best decisions that we can with the information that we have,"" she said.

As for Valentini, the London-based writer, she employed the kind of self-care that experts like Marques and Bufka recommended. She tuned in to virtual yoga classes. Normally an exercise hater, she started taking jogs that seemed to elevate her mood.

She's still super anxious. As the pandemic wore on, her friends and family wanted to know when the wedding would be. Valentini said that thinking about it gave her heart palpitations.

But in the end, Valentini and her fiance made the best decision they could with the information they had, putting down a deposit for a 2021 wedding in Southern California.

And you know what? It helped, she said, even though the world is as confusing and stressful as ever. ""It was like an exercise in forcing yourself to do something when there's no certainty around you,"" she said.

""You're like: 'That actually made me feel a lot better.'""",[]
798,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/trump-administration-can-allow-employers-to-deny-birth-control-coverage-supreme-court-1.5016016,Trump administration can allow employers to deny birth control coverage: Supreme Court,['Jessica Gresko'],2020-07-08 14:42:00-04:00,"WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court ruled broadly Wednesday in favour of the religious rights of employers in two cases that could leave more than 70,000 women without free contraception and tens of thousands of people with no way to sue for job discrimination.

In both cases the court ruled 7-2, with two liberal justices joining conservatives in favour of the Trump administration and religious employers.

In the more prominent of the two cases, involving U.S. President Barack Obama's health care overhaul, the justices greenlighted changes the Trump administration had sought. The administration announced in 2017 that it would allow more employers to opt out of providing the no-cost birth control coverage required under the law, but lower courts had blocked the changes.

The ruling is a significant election-year win for President Donald Trump, who counts on heavy support from evangelicals and other Christian groups for votes and policy backing. It was also good news for the administration, which in recent weeks has seen headline-making Supreme Court decisions go against its positions.

In one of those earlier cases, the court rejected Trump's effort to end legal protections for 650,000 young immigrants. In another, the justices said a landmark civil rights law protects gay, lesbian and transgender people from discrimination in employment.

Another particularly important decision for Trump is ahead. The justices are expected to announce Thursday whether Congress and the Manhattan district attorney can see the president's taxes and other financial records he has fought to keep private.

In its second big ruling on Wednesday, the court sided with two Catholic schools in California in a decision underscoring that certain employees of religious schools can't sue for employment discrimination.

Lay teachers whose contracts had not been renewed had sued their schools. But Justice Samuel Alito wrote in his majority opinion: ""When a school with a religious mission entrusts a teacher with the responsibility of educating and forming students in the faith, judicial intervention into disputes between the school and the teacher threatens the school's independence in a way that the First Amendment does not allow.""

The court's birth-control decision was cheered by conservative groups, and White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany joined in. ""Today's Supreme Court ruling is a big win for religious freedom and freedom of conscience,"" she said in a statement.

Liberal groups and Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, decried the decision, which she called a ""fundamental misreading"" of the health care law. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said the decision will make it ""easier for the Trump-Pence Administration to continue to strip health care from women.""

The Trump administration is still seeking to overturn Obama's Affordable Care Act in its entirety. It has joined Texas and other Republican-led states in calling on the justices to do just that. The case is scheduled to be argued in the court term that begins in October.

Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for the majority of the court, said in Wednesday's decision that the administration has the authority to make its birth-control coverage changes and followed appropriate procedures in doing so.

The government has estimated that the rule changes would cause between 70,000 women and 126,000 women to lose contraception coverage in one year.

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg cited those numbers in dissenting.

""Today, for the first time, the Court casts totally aside countervailing rights and interests in its zeal to secure religious rights to the nth degree,"" she wrote in a dissent joined by Justice Sonia Sotomayor.

Birth control coverage has been a topic of contention since the health care law was passed.

""The ACA's contraceptive mandate ... has existed for approximately nine years. Litigation surrounding that requirement has lasted nearly as long,"" Thomas wrote.

Initially, churches, synagogues and mosques were exempt from the contraceptive coverage requirement. The Obama administration also created a way by which religiously affiliated organizations including hospitals, universities and charities could opt out of paying for contraception, but women on their health plans would still get no-cost birth control. Some groups complained the opt-out process itself violated their religious beliefs, and years of legal wrangling followed.

After Trump took office, officials announced changes. Under a new policy issued by the Department of Health and Human Services, more categories of employers, including publicly traded companies, can opt out of providing no-cost birth control to women by claiming religious objections. The policy also allows some employers, though not publicly traded companies, to raise moral objections and do the same.

The changes were blocked by courts after New Jersey and Pennsylvania challenged them.

Future administrations could attempt to alter the Trump administration rules. And two liberal justices who sided with the administration, Elena Kagan and Stephen Breyer, suggested the legal fight over the administration's changes may continue.

Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro said in a statement after the ruling, ""This fight is not over.""

In the religious-schools discrimination case, the court had ruled unanimously in 2012 that the Constitution prevents ministers from suing their churches for employment discrimination, but the justices didn't rigidly define who counts as a minister.

The additional charges involve five new alleged victims of Dr. George Tyndall, who has previously pleaded not guilty to criminal charges involving 16 women.

The amended complaint adds five counts of sexual penetration of an unconscious person and one count of sexual battery by fraud that allegedly occurred while Tyndall, 73, worked at a USC health centre between 2011 and 2015.

Arraignment was scheduled for July 24.

""Dr. Tyndall takes every allegation seriously,"" said his attorney, Leonard Levine. ""However, he continues to be adamant that he has treated every patient within the standard of care and always for a state medical purpose. He is confident when all the evidence is presented and tested in a court of law that he will be totally exonerated.""

Tyndall was initially charged in June 2019 with 18 counts of sexual penetration of an unconscious person and 11 counts of sexual battery by fraud, all felonies.

All 21 victims went to the campus facility for annual exams or for other treatment dating back to 2009, prosecutors said.

Tyndall resigned in 2017 and allegations against him became public in 2018 through a Los Angeles Times investigation.

If convicted as charged, Tyndall now faces a possible maximum sentence of 64 years in state prison.

In February, the U.S. Department of Education said it found systemic failures in USC's treatment of allegations of sexual abuse by Tyndall and ordered the school to overhaul its procedures for preventing sex discrimination and to conduct a formal review of how employees responded. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos called it a ""total and complete failure to protect students.""

USC's new president, Carol L. Folt, pledged to protect the safety of students, faculty and staff and to restore trust in the university.

A federal judge has approved a US$215 million class-action settlement between USC and about 18,000 women who saw Tyndall at the university. Payments would range from US$2,500 to US$250,000, with specific sums decided by a panel of experts.

Hundreds of women have opted out of the federal court settlement and many are pursuing separate lawsuits in state court.",[]

Researchers from The Ottawa Hospital say the goal is to strengthen the immune system of a particularly vulnerable population.

The trial will explore the potential of IMM-101, a preparation of safe, heat-killed bacteria that stimulates the immune system.

Cancer patients are at much higher risk of severe complications from COVID-19 because their treatments further weaken an already compromised immune system.

The trial will recruit 1,500 patients currently receiving cancer treatment, and patients will be randomly assigned to receive either regular care, or regular care plus IMM-101.

Researchers say people interested in participating should speak with their cancer specialist.

Study lead Dr. Rebecca Auer, surgical oncologist and director of cancer research at the Ottawa Hospital, points to an ""urgent need"" to protect cancer patients while the world waits for an effective COVID-19 vaccine.

She notes a vaccine could take another year or more to develop, test, and implement.

Researchers from the Ottawa Hospital came up with the idea and worked with the Canadian Cancer Trials Group at Queen's University to design the trial.

Dr. Chris O'Callaghan of the Queen's University group notes cancer patients are also at greater risk because they require regular medical care, making it difficult to adhere fully to public health guidelines around COVID-19.

""These patients are unable to practice social isolation due to the need to regularly attend hospital to receive critically important cancer treatment,"" says O'Callaghan, who will oversee the trial.

Funding and in-kind support, valued at $2.8 million, comes from the Canadian Cancer Society, BioCanRx, the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, The Ottawa Hospital Foundation, The Ottawa Hospital Academic Medical Organization, ATGen Canada/NKMax, and Immodulon Therapeutics, the manufacturer of IMM-101.

One month after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 situation a pandemic, researchers surveyed more than 1,400 parents to see how their children were faring.

Not only did parents report that 79 per cent of kids were spending more time on screens, only 2.7 per cent of kids were meeting the recommended 60 minutes of physical activity per day.

“We've got a lifestyle of our children and youth that is sub-optimal to begin with. Twelve to 15 per cent meeting healthy sleep, healthy screen time, healthy physical activity guidelines. And that's dropped by close to 80 per cent during the crisis,” Mark Tremblay, study co-author and researcher at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Research Institute, told CTV News.

“This has been collateral damage to the lifestyles of kids.”

The study, published in International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity this week, also found that 41 per cent of children were sleeping more -- a positive finding, according to Tremblay, but one that may be attributed to boredom.

Fifteen-year-old Aneira Cleur says without school and extracurricular activities to keep them occupied, she and her friends have become “pretty lazy.”

“A lot of them are just lying in bed all day,” Cleur, who considered herself fairly active before the pandemic, told CTV News.

Her 13-year-old sister, Kerri, says that without the need to go anywhere or the ability to see her friends, she lost her motivation to leave the house.

""It was frustrating because there was what we little we could do,"" their father, Adrian Gay, told CTV News. ""They really weren't keen on venturing out when we forced them to. So it was tough.""

But as COVID-19 restrictions begin to ease across the country, and warmer weather draws more kids outside, experts warn it may not be enough to recondition kids for a healthier lifestyle -- especially in the event of a second wave.

""This could be the new normal for quite some time,” Trembley explained.

“We simply can't afford to shrug our shoulders and say, ‘It's okay this is just the way it's going to be.’ The consequences of that would be fairly serious.""

Trembley notes that, on average, Canadian parents were already struggling to encourage their children to meet daily activity guidelines and have less screen time.

Earlier this week, a study commissioned by ParticipACTION to support the annual Report Card on Physical Activity for Children and Youth, found that, before the pandemic, Canadian children were barely getting a passing grade for overall physical activity.

According to that study, only 39 per cent of children aged five to 11 and youths aged 12 to 17 met the national physical activity guidelines.

“Already we had a challenge to try and increase the proportion of kids that are benefiting from healthy movement behaviours,” said Tremblay.

""Now we're going to have to rehabilitate the population somewhat just to get back to that already rather weak baseline.”

Moving forward in the pandemic, Tremblay says it’s imperative that health officials focus on the promotion of healthy behaviours as well as disease prevention.

""Wouldn't it be great if, as a result of this rather horrible circumstance, that on a population level, families, and the communities they live in recalibrate themselves to ones where healthy active living becomes much more normative than it has been in recent years in Canada,” he said.

Experts recommend that parents incorporate physical activity into daily routines as much as possible and look for opportunities to be active as a family, while setting limits around screen time in the home.",[]

But for Nicole Stringer, who suffers from cystic fibrosis, it's been the reality for her entire life.

For Stringer, every breath is a battle. Now, she's fighting for access to a drug that could change that.

The Kelowna, B.C. woman was born with cystic fibrosis (CF), a genetic disorder that causes mucus to clog her lungs and damages her organs. On top of that, Stringer is also infected with a superbug, a bacteria called Pseudomonas aeruginosa which can't be killed by antibiotics.

Stringer uses puffers, an oxygen machine and takes a hundred pills every day to control symptoms like fever and nausea. But she's still constantly in and out of hospital, and plagued by the knowledge that at any time, her lungs could fail.

Her best friend, also a CF patient, recently succumbed to the disease.

Stringer has tried every treatment -- including travelling to the U.S. to become the first Canadian CF patient to try an experimental treatment called phage therapy, which uses viruses to kill bacteria. No treatment so far has truly helped.

""I have developed resistance to almost all of the antibiotics that I can take,"" she told CTV News. ""So now I have lung infections that are just doing what they're going to do and I have nothing to fight them with anymore, so I am going to continue to get sicker.""

COVID-19 poses yet another risk to Stringer's life, and has kept her isolated indoors for months.

But she sees hope for her declining health in the form of a drug that is already improving the health of CF patients in the U.S.: Trikafta.

Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in a specific gene, which create a faulty protein. Trikafta works by targeting that mutation to help the defective protein work more efficiently, with signs it can slow or even stop the progression of the disease.

""Within a week's time many people have had less mucus, they can run up the stairs, they can play with their kids, so it is a drug that's life changing, it's transformational for people with a fatal genetic disease,"" Kelly Grover, CEO of Cystic Fibrosis Canada, told CTV News.

Trikafta is a combination of three drugs: elexacaftor, tezacaftor, and ivacaftor. The therapy can potentially treat up to 90 per cent of CF patients, according to a press release by Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, the company behind the drug.

However, Stringer can't access it, because it's not approved in Canada.

""To have something that … is life-changing that it's right there, but we can't grab it, is the most frustrating thing of my life,"" she said.

Trikafta has made all the difference to Stephi Lee, an American artist and online influencer. Several American patients have documented significant improvements on their YouTube channels.

""Listen to this,"" Lee says in one video. She inhales. ""I didn't even cough.""

Part of the frustration for Canadian patients is that the drug was fast-tracked for approval in the U.S. last year, where studies show it helps to improve lung function by up to 14 per cent.

Grover said it was ""horrendous"" that we haven't seen any progress towards approving the drug here, considering it was approved so quickly within the U.S.

""In the U.K. they are fast-tracking its approval, Ireland and Switzerland have said they will fund it as soon as it becomes approved,"" she said. ""And so every country seems to be clamouring to get its hands on this drug for people with CF, and in Canada we can't even get it into Health Canada for safety reviews. So we're very concerned.

""Patients are really being held hostage in Canada because of that.""

Cystic Fibrosis Canada is calling on Canadian governments and regulators to collaborate with each other and manufacturer Vertex in order to accelerate the approval of Trikafta in Canada, so that it can be made available to patients there.

But the real problem is price. In the U.S., the listed cost for Trikafta is US$311,000 per year.

According to Cystic Fibrosis Canada, in order to get to a Canadian price, the manufacturer must first apply for Health Canada approval of the drug, after which Canada's drug review and reimbursement processes kick in. The Patented Medicine Prices Review Board will determine the maximum price a company can charge for a new patented drug sold in Canada. What public and private insurers pay is negotiated with the company. A body called the pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance negotiates the price that consumers will actually be paying on behalf of the provincial, territorial and federal programs.

The estimated cost for one Trikafta patient in Canada could be more than $400,000 a year.

And Vertex hasn't even applied to sell it here, amid speculation it would not be approved at that price.

An evidence report put out on April 27 by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), an independent watchdog for drug pricing in the U.S., investigated Trikafta and three other CF treatments by Vertex.

ICER gave the drug their highest ""A"" evidence rating a vote of confidence in the drug's transformative effect on patients' lives but added that the price was far too high.

They estimated that the health-benefit price benchmark for Trikafta should be between US$67,900 and US$85,000 per year, which would require a 73 to 78 per cent discount from the drug's current listed price.

In a press release for the report, David Rind, ICER's Chief Medical Officer, said that ""despite being transformative therapies, the prices set by the manufacturer costing many millions of dollars over the lifetime of an average patient are out of proportion to their substantial benefits.

""When a manufacturer has a monopoly on treatments and is aware that insurers will be unable to refuse coverage, the lack of usual counterbalancing forces can lead to excessive prices,"" Rind said.

""Patients who receive the treatments will benefit, but unaligned prices will cause significant negative health consequences for many unseen individuals those throughout society who will experience financial toxicity and may have to delay care, forego care, or even abandon insurance as their out of pocket costs and premiums are driven upward.""

But Canadian doctors and patients say that the drug being unavailable in Canada doesn't fix the price problem.

""I think we need a long-term solution,"" Dr. Pearce Wilcox, a respirologist at St. Paul's Hospital, told CTV News. ""We recognize that medication like this and others are very expensive medications and that's the reality and the public system will have challenges in coming up with that funding.

""On the other hand … cystic fibrosis is a rare disease. So, the long term solution is we need some type of strategy that recognizes rare diseases and the challenges of costs for these medications.

""In the shorter term, there needs to be some of innovative approach,"" to allow patients to get access, he added.

The pharmaceutical company does provide a compassionate care program that allows the sickest patients to have access to medication at a discount, but many patients dealing with a lot of suffering in their day to day lives still will not qualify for that, Wilcox said.

""I think everybody has the right to a life-changing drug,"" Grover agreed. ""I think at this stage we need to get it into the queue, so that the public and private payers can negotiate with the manufacturer to [a] price that makes sense to the Canadian system. And right now we can't even get it into the queue to assess its safety.""

The population of Canadians with cystic fibrosis is around 4,300, ""so you're talking about thousands that this [drug] could help,"" Grover said.

Wilcox said he has been working with cystic fibrosis patients for more than 20 years, and has seen a lot of initiatives introduced over the years to improve care.

But Trikafta is in ""the game-changer category,"" for him in how much it can improve quality of life and slow the progression of the disease.

""There is a medication that has the chance of making a dramatic difference in their, their outcome, and yet … we have very limited access to this compound,"" he said.

For Stringer, the drug feels like her last chance.

""If I don't get Trikafta, I'm going to continue to get sicker,"" she said. ""I could be one infection away from dying. That's really all it takes, is one infection.

""The life that I have right now is not life,"" she added. ""I'm at home all the time, I need oxygen a lot of the time. I barely have enough energy to get up and go into my living room. I'm 28 years old and I don't have a life.""

Stringer made her own urgent appeal directly to Vertex, through Health Canada's Special Access Programme the only way a Canadian can access medication not yet available for sale in Canada but was turned down.

There is a government push to assist her, led by Conservative MP Dan Albas from B.C.

On May 4, he and 58 MPs signed a letter addressed to Health Minister Patty Hajdu asking what she is doing to ensure that Canadians get access to the drug.

In the letter, they mention that Vertex has ""signalled their willingness to negotiate and conclude a Price Listing Agreement with the pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance.

""During the negotiation period, they have offered to supply their drugs to Canadians suffering with CF for free,"" the letter continues.

""As the Minister of Health, please provide us with an update on what you are doing to support the negotiations with Vertex and ensure that Canadians have access to these life-saving and life-changing drugs.""

Stringer, and other patients like her, are waiting to see if anything comes of the letter, and if Trikafta will come to Canada or not.

In the meantime, Canadian patients with cystic fibrosis will have to remain in limbo, caught between hope and reality.",[]

With immense political and public pressure to develop a vaccine, a process that can take years, researchers are carrying out trials at an unprecedented pace in efforts to bring a successful vaccine to market in a matter of months.

And although vaccine-related reactions are rare, experts say a new vaccine -- especially one developed using new technology -- may come with unknown risks.

At least 19 countries already have programs in place that compensate individuals injured by vaccines, but Canada does not.

In fact, it is the only G7 country without such measures in place, and experts are now calling on the federal government to prepare in advance of the COVID-19 vaccination program.

“If you do suffer an adverse event, a serious adverse event, one of those very rare events, you should be compensated,” said Jennifer Keelan, a retired researcher who worked at the University of Toronto’s Department of Public Health, told CTV News.

“An ideal process is to think about these things before you implement the mass vaccine program, rather than reacting.”

Adverse reactions to vaccines are rare, but have had deadly repercussions in the past.

In 1976, the U.S. government rushed to develop a swine flu vaccination over fears of the next big pandemic. The immunization program was halted after 10 weeks due to reports that the vaccination increased the risk for Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), a rare form of paralysis that starts in the feet and creeps up the body.

Though the associated risk was approximately one in 100,000, more than 450 people developed GBS after receiving the vaccine. Of those, 25 died.

Similarly, in 2009, the H1N1 influenza vaccine, while largely deemed safe, was linked with cases of narcolepsy in Europe.

Experts warn that vaccine manufacturers may demand legal protection against lawsuits regarding adverse reactions to a new vaccine.

In 2009, the Canadian government put forth an emergency process to release the H1N1 vaccine without waiting for Health Canada to review the results of clinical trials concerning the vaccine’s efficacy.

According to the Canadian Medical Association Journal, Canada agreed to indemnify the vaccine’s manufacturer, Glaxo-SmithKline, from potential lawsuits.

At the time, the federal government was said to be considering a no-fault compensation scheme, or a vaccine injury compensation program. However, no such program was ever created.

Quebec is the only province that offers such a plan for adverse reactions stemming from immunizations.

In other provinces and territories, any healthcare costs associated with an adverse vaccine reaction would be covered through the public health system or, if disability occurred, through disability income.

According to the Canadian Vaccination Evidence Resource and Exchange Centre, the only other recourse would be through litigation. However, there is a limited understanding of the number of vaccine-injury related lawsuits in Canada.

CTV News contacted the federal government to see if there was any consideration for such a program in light of the circumstances surrounding COVID-19. A request for comment was not returned.

“Some of these individuals may actually be front-line workers, personal support workers, health-care workers, or those working in long-term care centres who will be asked to receive this vaccine not only for their benefit, but to protect the patients, the people they are caring for,” Dr. Kumanan Wilson, senior scientist at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, told CTV News.

“Despite best practices being taken, if these individuals are harmed, we need a system in place to help compensate them in the event of injury.”

Wilson and Keelan have been calling for Canada to implement a vaccine injury compensation program for nearly 10 years.

In a 2011 report for the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs, the researchers noted that, “the history and experience with vaccine-related injuries in many other western countries also suggests that it is highly probable that Canada will be faced with circumstances.”

At the time, Keelan noted that a no-fault compensation program for vaccine-related injuries would not only benefit people who suffer harm, it might also give those who are waffling about whether to get a vaccine the incentive they need to go ahead.

""We want people to be vaccinated. Vaccines are incredibly safe and they are one of the most effective public health measures that we have for preventing vaccine-preventable diseases,” she said in a 2011 interview with CTVNews.ca.

“We want them to have confidence in our publicly funded vaccine.""​

In a report to the World Health Organization in December 2018, the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety wrote that no-fault vaccine injury compensation programs are considered a measure to maintain confidence in immunization programmes.",[]

It was the Mercedes driver's record-extending 89th career pole and particularly impressive as he first beat Red Bull driver Max Verstappen's mark and then his own leading mark on his final lap.

""That was awesome,"" Hamilton said after placing 1.216 seconds ahead of Verstappen and 1.398 clear of McLaren driver Carlos Sainz Jr.

""I definitely had my heart in my mouth, but I was able to improve,"" Hamilton said. ""Honestly it was a fantastic lap, that lap was as close to perfect as I could get it in those conditions.""

Verstappen swerved a little on his final lap.

""It could have been better but I don't think it was enough to beat Lewis,"" the Dutch driver said. ""You can't see a thing, it is hard to see the braking zones but that is the same for everyone.""

It was the best career result in qualifying for Sainz -- underlining how McLaren is improving after Lando Norris finished last weekend's race in third place.

""It feels amazing, especially that qualifying was one of the toughest I have done. There was so much aquaplaning it was crazy,"" the Spanish driver said. ""We're completely blind in the car, we don't see what's at the front, what's at the back.""

Hamilton's Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas could only qualify in fourth place after taking pole position and winning last Sunday's Austrian GP.

It was another dismal day for Ferrari, with Sebastian Vettel 10th and Charles Leclerc 11th.

""The main problem was we were just not quick enough,"" Leclerc said. ""We're just too slow.""

Driving rain washed out the third and final practice session at midday and threatened qualifying altogether. But the cars managed to finally get out onto the Red Bull Ring at around 3:45 p.m. local time (1345 GMT) even though rain was still lashing down.

In the event of a complete washout, qualifying would have been moved to Sunday morning.

With drivers told the rain would soon get heavier, they were advised to post a solid time quickly in order to get into the second part of qualifying.

Verstappen said ""I can't see a thing"" and Romain Grosjean slid off track into gravel.

Some unexpected names popped up at the top of the leaderboard, before order was restored as Hamilton, Bottas and Verstappen swapped leading times.

""Leave me to it,"" Hamilton said over radio, trying to keep his concentration with water spraying everywhere in front and around him.

With two minutes left in Q1, Italian driver Antonio Giovinazzi lost control of his Alfa Romeo and it swerved sideways and then backward into a crash barrier. His car had to be lifted off the track.

The rain fell so heavily throughout the morning that firefighters had to remove excess water from the roof of one empty hospitality building. The race is being held without fans because of the coronavirus pandemic.

The race is changing names from last week but is still being held at the same track in Spielberg, which is surrounded by the Styrian mountains.",[]

Musk, who has made premature predictions about the advent of completely autonomous cars before, offered the updated timetable in a pre-recorded message to a Shanghai tech fair.

""I'm extremely confident that 'Level 5', or essentially complete autonomy, will happen, and I think will happen very quickly,"" Musk said.

""I remain confident that we will have the basic functionality... complete this year.""

In years past, Musk had said Tesla may develop the technology for a completely autonomous vehicle by 2018, and then last year he said it may come by early 2020.

The California-based electric carmaker became the world's most valuable auto manufacturer earlier this month and its shares have soared this year thanks to strong output figures despite disruptions from the coronavirus epidemic.

The complexity and autonomy of self-driving car technology is classified up to ""Level 5"". Lower levels feature some combination of autonomous decision-making by the vehicle, along with as-needed human intervention.

But Level 5 denotes a car that requires no human intervention at any time, allowing the passenger to sleep or watch a movie while the car handles all navigation as well as adjustments to avoid collisions.

Tesla already enables partial autonomy for its cars, but analysts say the road to full autonomy faces considerable legal and regulatory hurdles, not to mention getting consumers to feel comfortable entrusting their cars with full control.

Tesla is racing with Waymo, Uber and traditional automakers to bring autonomous vehicles to market.",[]

Instead of closing the gap to front-runner Mercedes this season, Ferrari's SF1000 car looks slower than last year and is also in danger of slipping behind other teams.

""The SF1000 didn't measure up, even compared to expectations,"" was Ferrari's blunt assessment.

Ferrari failed in qualifying at the season-opening Austrian Grand Prix, with Charles Leclerc only seventh -- having taken the most pole positions in 2019 -- and Sebastian Vettel a dismal 11th.

Leclerc's second-place finish in that race was more about his composure amid crashes than the car's speed. Vettel, who finished 10th, was so irked about lack of balance he called the car undriveable.

It means that Ferrari team principal Mattia Binotto is facing increasing pressure, given that the team was already way behind Mercedes in the drivers' and constructors' titles in 2019.

His decision making also faced scrutiny after a sudden change of strategy, three days before the first practice session in Austria.

He announced a different direction in terms of aerodynamic development, which effectively meant there could not be any car upgrades until the third race in Hungary next week.

But then hierarchy intervened.

Ferrari CEO Louis Camilleri felt it was necessary to stop slipping back further and some of the aerodynamic package -- scheduled for Hungary --will be introduced in Austria.

""This is certainly not the grid position that a team like Ferrari should have and we have to respond immediately,"" Camilleri said. ""It's clear that we have to improve on all fronts.""

This weekend's race is the second of eight races during a hectic 10-week European swing.

The GP itself is changing names yet is still being held at the Red Bull Ring in Spielberg -- surrounded by the Styrian mountains it is now being named after.

Different name, same objective for Red Bull driver Alexander Albon.

While Lando Norris secured his first career podium last weekend -- the youngest British driver ever to do so in F1 at the age of 20 -- Albon narrowly missed out on a first podium for the second time in three races.

Both times Hamilton was directly involved.

With a few laps left last Sunday it was Albon was on better tires than Hamilton and his Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas, who won the race.

Albon made a hasty but clean move on the outside Hamilton, who appeared to slightly nudge his car left against Albon's passing wheel. Albon span off track while Hamilton was given a five-second time penalty, moving him from second to fourth.

Last November in Brazil, in the penultimate race of 2019, they chased second place on the second-last lap. Hamilton tried to pass Albon on the inside and clipped his car, sending Albon spinning down to 14th.

Albon was frustrated after Sunday's race, which proved doubly disheartening for Red Bull as Max Verstappen retired early when in second place.

But team principal Christian Horner sees cause for optimism.

""I believe the potential is there to fight Mercedes. Perhaps not over a single lap but over the course of the season,"" he said. ""Our race pace looked pretty decent with Max and Alex, so I think we've got the basis of a good car.""

It remains uncertain whether drivers will again take the knee in support of racial equality on Sunday. Hamilton wore a Black Lives Matter T-shirt last time, when 14 of the 20 drivers took the knee.

""I want people to feel excited to be a part of the change,"" Hamilton said. ""To me it was an emotional and poignant chapter in the progress of making F1 a more diverse and inclusive sport.""",[]
807,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/autos/judge-dismisses-gm-s-bribery-lawsuit-against-fiat-chrysler-1.5016116,Judge dismisses GM's bribery lawsuit against Fiat Chrysler,['Tom Krisher'],2020-07-08 15:31:00-04:00,"DETROIT -- A federal judge in Detroit has dismissed General Motors' lawsuit alleging that rival Fiat Chrysler paid off union leaders to get better contract terms than GM.

In a ruling Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Paul Borman wrote that GM's alleged injuries were not caused by FCA violating federal racketeering laws. He wrote that GM has not stated a claim that can be granted, so the case must be dismissed.

GM said it disagreed with the ruling and will pursue legal remedies.

The ruling came after a federal appeals court on Monday overturned Borman's order that the CEOs of both companies meet in person to talk about settling the case. But the court denied GM's request to assign the case to another judge.

In the lawsuit, GM alleged that Fiat Chrysler bribed officials of the United Auto Workers union to get lower labour costs, giving FCA an advantage over its Detroit-area rival. GM alleged that FCA CEO Sergio Marchionne wanted to pressure GM into merging by weakening GM with higher labour costs.

In his ruling, Borman wrote that GM's “pay to harm” theory initially had appeal “but fails on a closer look.”

GM alleged that FCA used bribes to get the UAW to deny GM concessions that were given to Fiat Chrysler. But Borman wrote that the UAW wouldn't give the concessions to any company that didn't pay bribes. Therefore, GM's labour costs weren't any higher than they would have been without the bribes.

“In other words, FCA's UAW workers were the direct victims of the bribes because they were paid less, and GM suffered only an indirect competitive harm,” Borman wrote.

GM failed to show facts backing up the claim that it was harmed by Fiat Chrysler's actions under federal racketeering laws, Borman ruled.

FCA denies that it directed any prohibited payments. Its former labour chief, Al Iacobelli, is in prison after pleading guilty in 2018 to conspiracy and tax crimes in a scheme worth more than $1.5 million. He admitted that he turned the budget of a company-sponsored training centre into a slush fund.

Earlier, Borman described GM's lawsuit as a “nuclear option” that would be a “waste of time and resources” for years if he allowed the case to move forward. That prompted GM to ask an appeals court to change judges.

Federal agents have been rooting out corruption in the senior ranks of the UAW. The first wave of convictions in 2017 involved key FCA employees who used money from a jointly run training centre to reward union officials.",[]

Chairman Carlos Ghosn wired more than $860,000 to a company linked to one of the men accused of helping smuggle him out of Japan in a box last year, prosecutors said in a new court filing.

Prosecutors filed documents Tuesday detailing two wire transfers made by Ghosn in October 2019 as evidence they say shows Michael Taylor and Peter Taylor “have the resources with which to flee and therefore should continue to remain detained as flight risks.”

The documents show two wire transfers to the company Promote Fox LLC, which prosecutors say is managed by Peter Taylor.

Michael Taylor, a 59-year-old U.S. Army Special Forces veteran, and his 27-year-old son Peter Taylor are wanted in Japan on allegations that they helped Ghosn flee the country in December while he was out on bail and awaiting trial on financial misconduct allegations.

The Taylors are urging a judge to order their immediate release from jail while they challenge Japan's extradition request, arguing among other things that their health is in danger behind bars because of the coronavirus pandemic. Their lawyers say the men don't pose a risk of flight or danger to the community.

The defence says the Taylors were unlawfully arrested and argue they can't be extradited because “bail jumping” is not a crime in Japan and, therefore, helping someone evade their bail conditions isn't a crime either.

“Even assuming the Taylors were properly arrested, holding them without bail on a tenuous charge in a jail that has been plagued by COVID-19 violates their Fifth and Eighth Amendment rights. This is especially the case because neither is a risk of flight and there are undoubtedly conditions under which they can be released,” their attorneys told a judge in a filing this week.

Authorities say the Taylors helped sneak Ghosn out of the Japan on a private jet with former Nissan boss tucked away in a large box. The flight went first to Turkey, then to Lebanon, where Ghosn has citizenship but which has no extradition treaty with Japan.

Ghosn said he fled because he could not expect a fair trial, was subjected to unfair conditions in detention and was barred from meeting his wife under his bail conditions. Ghosn has said he is innocent of allegations he under-reported his future income and committed a breach of trust by diverting Nissan money for his personal gain.",[]

Trump suggested Bubba Wallace should apologize after the sport rallied around him after the noose was found in his assigned stall at Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama. Federal authorities ruled last month the noose had been hanging since October and was not a hate crime. NASCAR and the FBI have exclusively referred to the rope -- which was used to pull the garage door closed -- as a noose.

It was the only garage pull out of 1,684 stalls at 29 inspected NASCAR tracks to be fashioned as a noose.

NASCAR President Steve Phelps has bristled at suggestions the noose was a hoax. Wallace was shown a photograph of the noose, never personally saw it, and was told by NASCAR officials he was the victim of a hate crime.

""Has @BubbaWallace apologized to all of those great NASCAR drivers & officials who came to his aid, stood by his side, & were willing to sacrifice everything for him, only to find out that the whole thing was just another HOAX?"" Trump tweeted. ""That & Flag decision has caused lowest ratings EVER!""

The tweet came after Trump used a pair of Independence Day speeches to dig deeper into America's divisions by accusing protesters who have pushed for racial justice of engaging in a ""merciless campaign to wipe out our history."" The remarks served as a direct appeal to the Republican president's political base, including many disaffected white voters, with less than four months to go before Election Day.

Wallace responded on Twitter with a note to ""the next generation and little ones following my foot steps"" in which he urged people to use their platform and not be detracted by ""hate being thrown at you.""

""Love should come naturally as people are TAUGHT to hate,"" Wallace tweeted. ""Even when it's HATE from the POTUS .. Love wins.""

White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany defended the president's decision to wade into the Wallace case, likening it to actor Jussie Smollett's claims he was a victim of a hate crime. McEnany criticized the press in a White House briefing, calling Trump's tweet a ""complete indictment of the media's rush to judgement.""

McEnany declined to explain why the president thought Wallace should have to apologize given he didn't report the noose. McEnany refused to say whether or not the president supports NASCAR's ban on the Confederate flag.

NASCAR did not directly address the Trump tweet in a Monday statement.

""We are proud to have Bubba Wallace in the NASCAR family and we commend his courage and leadership,"" NASCAR said. ""NASCAR continues to stand tall with Bubba, our competitors and everyone who makes our sport welcoming and inclusive for all racing fans.""

Andrew Murstein, co-owner of the Richard Petty Motorsports team that fields Wallace's car, called Trump's tweet ""a late, misinformed, and factually incorrect statement."" He also said it was unwarranted and cited the photo NASCAR released of the noose.

""A picture is worth a thousand words,"" Murstein said in a statement. ""Bubba has reacted in a truthful, professional, level headed manner. The NASCAR community and those in the know all stand by him.""

Wallace led the push for NASCAR to ban Confederate symbols at tracks. Two weeks later, the noose was found at the first race some fans were allowed to attend since the shutdown. On the same day, a plane pulling a banner of the Confederate flag that read ""Defund NASCAR"" was circling the track and protesters outside the speedway displayed their flags.

Two NASCAR drivers came to Wallace's defence Monday. Seven-time NASCAR champion Jimmie Johnson, currently sidelined with the coronavirus, posted an image of Wallace's No. 43 that had been used by drivers in an earlier .IStandWithBubba campaign. Rookie Tyler Reddick tweeted but later deleted a reply to Trump that read: ""We don't need an apology. We did what was right and we will do just fine without your support.""

LeBron James and Chelsea Clinton were among those outside of NASCAR who backed Wallace on social media, with James stating he stands with Wallace.

NASCAR's complex relationship with Trump dates to early in his campaign when former chairman Brian France brought a contingent of drivers to a rally in Georgia.

France later sent a memo to NASCAR employees stating his political beliefs were his own and he was not speaking on behalf of the organization. France was replaced as chairman following his arrest for driving while impaired in 2018.

Other members of the France family welcomed Trump to Daytona for the season-opening race in February. Many drivers and owners mingled with Trump and posted selfies with the president.

Wallace, who was born in Alabama, has taken an active role in the push for racial equality. He has worn a shirt saying ""I Can't Breathe,"" and raced with a Black Lives Matter paint scheme in Virginia.

Ramsey Poston, a former NASCAR consultant and now head of crisis management firm Tuckahoe Stategies, said Trump's tweet is harmful to NASCAR's push for inclusion. Wallace is one of just a handful of non-white drivers. Daniel Suarez is Mexican and Aric Almirola is of Cuban descent. Kyle Larson, who is half-Asian, was fired in April for using a racial slur.

""The brewing cultural war within NASCAR for equality has just erupted and the sport's efforts to separate from its past just got tougher,"" Poston said. ""The president's comments are essentially a rallying call for people who support the Confederate flag to challenge the sport's recent flag ban and create chaos.""

While Trump claimed NASCAR's ratings are down, they are actually up. Michael Mulvihill, executive vice-president at Fox Sports, tweeted that Fox viewership is up 8% since the sport returned from the pandemic hiatus on May 17. NBC took over the broadcast rights this past weekend and said its ratings for Sunday's race were up 46% from last year's event at Indianapolis.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-SC, pushed back against Trump's NASCAR tweet on Fox News Radio, saying NASCAR is trying to grow the sport by removing divisive symbols.

""I don't think Bubba Wallace has anything to apologize for,"" Graham said.

Trump suggested Bubba Wallace should apologize after the sport rallied around him after the noose was found in his assigned stall at Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama. Federal authorities ruled last month the noose had been hanging since October and was not a hate crime. NASCAR and the FBI have exclusively referred to the rope -- which was used to pull the garage door closed -- as a noose.

It was the only garage pull out of 1,684 stalls at 29 inspected NASCAR tracks to be fashioned as a noose.

NASCAR President Steve Phelps has bristled at suggestions the noose was a hoax. Wallace was shown a photograph of the noose, never personally saw it, and was told by NASCAR officials he was the victim of a hate crime.

""Has @BubbaWallace apologized to all of those great NASCAR drivers & officials who came to his aid, stood by his side, & were willing to sacrifice everything for him, only to find out that the whole thing was just another HOAX?"" Trump tweeted. ""That & Flag decision has caused lowest ratings EVER!""

The tweet came after Trump used a pair of Independence Day speeches to dig deeper into America's divisions by accusing protesters who have pushed for racial justice of engaging in a ""merciless campaign to wipe out our history."" The remarks served as a direct appeal to the Republican president's political base, including many disaffected white voters, with less than four months to go before Election Day.

Wallace responded on Twitter with a note to ""the next generation and little ones following my foot steps"" in which he urged people to use their platform and not be detracted by ""hate being thrown at you.""

""Love should come naturally as people are TAUGHT to hate,"" Wallace tweeted. ""Even when it's HATE from the POTUS .. Love wins.""

White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany defended the president's decision to wade into the Wallace case, likening it to actor Jussie Smollett's claims he was a victim of a hate crime. McEnany criticized the press in a White House briefing, calling Trump's tweet a ""complete indictment of the media's rush to judgement.""

McEnany declined to explain why the president thought Wallace should have to apologize given he didn't report the noose. McEnany refused to say whether or not the president supports NASCAR's ban on the Confederate flag.

NASCAR did not directly address the Trump tweet in a Monday statement.

""We are proud to have Bubba Wallace in the NASCAR family and we commend his courage and leadership,"" NASCAR said. ""NASCAR continues to stand tall with Bubba, our competitors and everyone who makes our sport welcoming and inclusive for all racing fans.""

Andrew Murstein, co-owner of the Richard Petty Motorsports team that fields Wallace's car, called Trump's tweet ""a late, misinformed, and factually incorrect statement."" He also said it was unwarranted and cited the photo NASCAR released of the noose.

""A picture is worth a thousand words,"" Murstein said in a statement. ""Bubba has reacted in a truthful, professional, level headed manner. The NASCAR community and those in the know all stand by him.""

Wallace led the push for NASCAR to ban Confederate symbols at tracks. Two weeks later, the noose was found at the first race some fans were allowed to attend since the shutdown. On the same day, a plane pulling a banner of the Confederate flag that read ""Defund NASCAR"" was circling the track and protesters outside the speedway displayed their flags.

Two NASCAR drivers came to Wallace's defence Monday. Seven-time NASCAR champion Jimmie Johnson, currently sidelined with the coronavirus, posted an image of Wallace's No. 43 that had been used by drivers in an earlier .IStandWithBubba campaign.

The probe covers more than 614,000 Cobalts from the 2008 to 2010 model years and HHRs from 2008 and 2009.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says it has 208 complaints from owners about gasoline leaks. Thirty-nine owners have told the agency about gas puddles or drips from leaky fuel lines toward the left rear wheel well. The agency says in documents posted Tuesday that the leaks are caused by corrosion of metal fuel lines near polymer blocks that hold the lines to the body. The leaks are beneath an insulation heat shield near the exhaust pipe and muffler.

The agency says it doesn't have any reports of crashes, fires or injuries. It says the probe will determine how often the problem happens and assess potential safety issues. Investigations can lead to recalls.

GM said in a statement that it's co-operating in the investigation. The company said owners who see a leak or smell gas should contact a Chevrolet dealership.",[]
813,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/autos/ford-revives-bronco-brand-aims-at-jeep-s-big-off-road-sales-1.5012126,"Ford revives Bronco brand, aims at Jeep's big off-road sales",['Tom Krisher'],2020-07-06 08:34:00-04:00,"DETROIT -- When it comes to rugged vehicles that go off the road, over rocks and into the mud to experience nature, Jeep for years has cornered the U.S. market.

Now Ford is reviving the Bronco brand name in an effort to take a slice.

Later this month the company will introduce two new off-road vehicles, a Ranger pickup-sized Bronco that will come in two- and four-door versions, and the smaller Escape-sized Bronco Sport, both aimed at taking sales from Fiat Chrysler's top brand.

It won't be easy for a brand best known as O.J. Simpson's ride in a 1994 low-speed chase with Los Angeles police who wanted him on murder charges. Jeep has sold well over 800,000 vehicles for the past five years, and more than 900,000 in three of those years.

Ford wants to avoid the O.J. ties. It moved the date it would unveil the SUVs from July 9, Simpson's birthday, to July 13. The automaker believes the Bronco name will evoke good memories from its off-road heritage during a three-decade run that ended in 1996. At its introduction in August of 1965, Ford called the Bronco a new line of sport utility vehicles, the first reference to SUVs from an American automaker, the company said.

""There's a huge brand cache here,"" said Kumar Galhotra, Ford's president of the Americas. ""That's why we felt strongly enough that we could build a family of vehicles.""

Galhotra says people are passionate about the Bronco, pointing to high prices that restored old vehicles are commanding and frequent searches for the name on the internet.

Although the new Broncos will share some parts with other Ford vehicles, they've got beefed up suspensions and were designed for off-road use, the company said. They've also been torture tested on trails and in extreme heat and cold and will come with a new system to manage all terrains. All will come standard with four-wheel-drive. Specific details of the vehicles won't be released until the July 13 event. The Sport goes on sale late this year and the larger Bronco hits dealers in the spring.

David Kelleher, owner of a Jeep dealership in Glen Mills, Pa., near Philadelphia, says he's happy to see the Bronco name return, but he's not too worried about the threat to Jeep sales.

The Broncos don't seem to be aimed specifically at Jeep's top sellers, the Grand Cherokee large SUV and the smaller Wrangler, he said. He's surprised that another automaker hasn't come after the Wrangler, a traditional-looking Jeep with a removable roof and doors.

If the Bronco is able to dent sales of the Grand Cherokee, it probably won't be for long, Kelleher said. A redesigned Grand Cherokee is due out next year, he said.

""If Bronco takes a little bit of a stake in the marketplace, shortly thereafter they may not be the new kid on the block anymore,"" he said.

The Bronco name is highly recognized by consumers, says Michelle Krebs, executive analyst at Cox Automotive, but she doesn't think it carries the weight of Jeep.

She said the coronavirus pandemic may increase the size of the market for off-road vehicles with more people now opting to take road trips and travel outdoors by vehicle. The Bronco, she said, will have to prove its off-road capability.

""Jeep has pretty much that territory all to itself,"" she said. ""It's been overdue that they've had some competition.""",[]
814,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/sports/harvick-takes-advantage-of-hamlin-s-crash-to-win-brickyard-1.5012387,Harvick takes advantage of Hamlin's crash to win Brickyard,['Michael Marot'],2020-07-06 11:25:00-04:00,"INDIANAPOLIS -- Kevin Harvick turned up the pressure on Denny Hamlin late in the Brickyard 400.

And on a cooling track, Hamlin's worn tires simply gave out.

As the sun set Sunday over Indianapolis Motor Speedway and Hamlin seven laps from one of the few victories that has eluded him, he went careening into the first turn wall with a flat right front tire, and Harvick beat Matt Kenseth by 0.743 seconds off the final restart to win his second straight Brickyard.

""We had great tire wear today, so I was able to really push my car as hard as I could,"" Harvick said after his third 400 title. ""I was able to push him a little harder that last run than earlier in the race and when the sun went down the track was cooling and speeds were going up in the turns.""

The strategy worked out perfectly -- just like Stewart-Haas Racing's holiday weekend.

Not only did Harvick race to his 53rd victory to move within one of tying Lee Petty for 11th on NASCAR's career list, teammates Aric Almirola and Cole Custer, a rookie, finished third and fifth on Sunday. Fellow Stewart-Haas driver Chase Briscoe won the Xfinity Series race Saturday on the road course.

Harvick tied Hamlin with a season-high fourth victory and lead in the points. The California driver has four straight top-10 finishes.

For the third straight race, it looked as if it would be another one-two finish for Harvick and Hamlin. And until the late, stunning twist, Hamlin looked as though he would take his first Brickyard.

""It's just, it's tough. I hate it for the FedEx team,"" Hamlin said. ""It was just kind of roulette if it (the tire) stays together or not and mine didn't.""

How dominant have Harrvick and Hamlin been recently?

After trading victories and runner-up finishes at Pocono last week and Sunday's result, they've combined for seven of 12 victories since the season restarted at Darlington in mid-May and it's only the second time in seven races Hamlin and his No. 11 Joe Gibbs Racing entry hasn't finished in the top seven.

Harvick crew chief Rodney Childers sensed Hamlin was on borrowed time.

""We tried to play it a little safe and we had backed down ours down a little bit to save our tires,"" he said. ""It just depends on how that situation plays out at the race and it just so happened we were out there a long time on tires so backing down was the way to go.""

Kenseth couldn't catch him.

""We were really fast,"" the Chip Ganassi Racing driver said. ""I think if we were in front, would have been tough to beat.""

One person was noticeably absent: Seven-time Cup champion Jimmie Johnson in the No. 48 Hendrick Motorsports car. Johnson watched the race from his Colorado home as the series' longest active streak of consecutive starts -- fifth-longest in series history -- ended at 663. Johnson was also hoping to become the third driver to win five races on the 2.5-mile oval.

Instead, Justin Allgaier replaced him in the car and he didn't stick around long.

Allgaier was involved in a six-car pileup near the entrance to pit road that brought out a red flag on Lap 16 when one of Ryan Blaney's crew members was pinned between two cars. Track workers put Zachary Price on a stretcher, where he was smiling and gave a thumbs-up. He was eventually transported to a nearby hospital and has since returned to North Carolina.

Two laps after the incident, Allgaier's day was over.

""I didn't know if I got the gentleman on the No. 12 or not,"" Allgaier said. ""Once the wreck started happening in front of us and we all got bottled up there, one car after another was getting run into. It's just a shame. I hate it for these guys.""

Kurt Busch also had a rough day after making his 700th career start, which broke a tie with Hall of Famer Buddy Baker for No. 16 on the series career list. After starting second, his hopes for winning one of the Cup's crown jewels faded with an early pit stop mistake.

NASCAR's weather problems also continued, this time with the start delayed 55 minutes for lightning.

But once the race started, it was clean sailing for Harvick. He led for most of the first stage before giving way to William Byron, who chose not to pit with nine laps to go, and then won the second stage before earning the big prize.

""We weren't going to get by him (Hamlin) unless he made a huge mistake and obviously his tire was wearing out,"" Harvick said. ""His car was a little better than me on the long run. We were better on the restarts so we would have needed a caution we couldn't have beaten him on a green.""",[]

That message was said before the race, too, when all drivers wore that T-shirt. World champion Lewis Hamilton, the only black driver in F1, had Black Lives Matter on the front and End Racism on the back of his.

But six did not join Hamilton and 13 others in taking the knee: Kimi Raikkonen, Max Verstappen, Daniil Kvyat, Antonio Giovinazzi, Carlos Sainz Jr. and Charles Leclerc -- who finished in second place.

Hamilton, who knelt alongside Sebastian Vettel, at one point bowed his head pensively while Kvyat pointed to the anti-racism message on his T-shirt.

Hamilton has spoken widely about racism in recent weeks following the death in Minneapolis of George Floyd -- a handcuffed and unarmed Black man -- after a police officer pressed his knee on Floyd's neck for nearly eight minutes in May. Hamilton attended a Black Lives Matter march in London and is setting up a commission to increase diversity in motorsport.

Soccer players on fields in England and Germany have taken the knee together simultaneously before games in support of the Black Lives Matter movement, and F1 drivers discussed what they should do during a drivers' briefing on Friday evening.

Leclerc and Verstappen wrote on Twitter before the race why they chose not to kneel.

""I believe that what matters are facts and behaviours in our daily life rather than formal gestures that could be seen as controversial in some countries,"" Leclerc said. ""I will not take the knee but this does not mean at all that I am less committed than others in the fight against racism.""

Verstappen explained his choice.

""I am very committed to equality and the fight against racism. But I believe everyone has the right to express themselves at a time and in a way that suits them,"" the Dutch driver said. ""I will not take the knee today but respect and support the personal choices every driver makes.""

Hamilton called out other F1 teams on Thursday for not doing enough to combat racism and said the sport still needs to push for more diversity. Mercedes is competing in an all-black car instead of the usual silver, while Hamilton and Bottas have ""End Racism"" written on the car's halo.

Hamilton praised some drivers for speaking out against racism, but he still feels others need to do more and he raised that in their briefing.

""Silence is generally complicit. There still is some silence in some cases,"" he said on Saturday. ""There are people who still don't fully understand exactly what is happening and what (is) the reason for these protests.""

The N700S -- the 'S' stands for 'Supreme' -- entered into service July 1 and serves the Tokaido Shinkansen line, which links Tokyo Station and Shin-Osaka Station in Osaka.

It can run up to 360 kilometres per hour, a new record set during a test run in 2019, making it one of the fastest trains in the world. The operating speed, however, will be capped at 285 kilometers per hour.

It's the first new bullet train model to be added to the Tokaido Shinkansen line by the Central Japan Railway (JR Central) in 13 years, a launch that was originally timed to coincide with the Tokyo Olympics in 2020 -- now postponed to 2021.

Coincidentally, Japan inaugurated the Tokaido Shinkansen line in 1964, connecting Tokyo and Osaka, just in time for the Summer Olympics in Tokyo that same year. It was the world's first high speed railway line.

CUTTING-EDGE TECHNOLOGY

Appearance-wise, the N700S doesn't look too different from the older N700 or N700A models, apart from its elegant golden logo.

But look closer and you'll see the brand-new train has a more angular nose, chubbier ""cheeks"" and sleeker headlight design.

On the inside, newly designed seats allow passengers to recline further, offering more comfort, especially for long-haul riders. Each seat has an individual power outlet.

Interior lighting has been designed to create a softer, more relaxing atmosphere. The overhead baggage racks will be lit up at each stop to remind passengers of their belongings.

More reservation-only storage areas for extra-large luggage have been added to this model as well.

The actual ride will be a lot quieter and smoother, too, thanks to a new active suspension system that helps absorb train movements.

In addition to a focus on increased comfort, designers behind the new model put great emphasis on safety.

The train has an upgraded automatic control and braking system that allows it to halt faster in case of an emergency.

It's also fitted with lithium-ion battery self-propulsion system -- the first of its kind in the world. This system allows the train to run for a short distance on its own during a power outage and will make it possible for it to move to a safer location at low speed if stranded in a high-risk area -- on a bridge or in a tunnel, for example -- during an earthquake.

More cameras have also been installed inside car compartments -- an increase from two cameras to up to six in each train car.

The upgraded components will take up less space under the train floor compared to the old model, making it possible for a more flexible configuration, from four to 16 cars. This also decreases energy consumption while speeding up production times, making it a more appealing option for operators internationally.

""By making the mechanisms under the floor of the N700S lighter and more compact, we created a new standard,"" Masayuki Ueno, deputy head of JR Central's bullet train business department, told Japanese broadcaster NHK in an interview in 2019.

""This new standard will also help when it comes to expanding our business overseas.""",[]

Rowe'],2020-07-11 18:11:00-04:00,"MONTREAL -- Few people had as unique a view of the Oka Crisis in 1990 as the officers at the Kahnawake Peacekeepers.

Retired Peacekeeper (PK) Warren White said that the summer of 1990 was incredibly tough, but it helped make the community’s police force what it is today.

“Today you have a well-educated police department,” said White. “They’re very well trained, they’re very community oriented and they believe in their community.”

White joined the force in 1979 and retired in 2013.

Leading up to 1990, White said the relationship with surrounding municipalities and populations was always tense.

“Our relationships with our surrounding communities was always very, very fragile because the governments kept telling the people that we weren’t a police department and they shouldn’t recognize us,” said White.

Kahnawake, unlike Kanesatake where the SQ patrolled the community in 1990, had a local police force in place. When Kahnawake’s warriors joined in solidarity with those in Kanesatake under siege by blocking the Mercier Bridge and highways cutting through the community, the eight-man force maintained patrols.

“We were caught up in a situation that we had no control over,” said White. “Yes, we were a police department, but there were eight of us. How was eight policemen going to control something that was already out of control.”

Current PK Clint Jacobs was watching from across the river in Montreal’s West Island, and seeing his fellow community members suffer helped his decision to apply for the job in 1991.

“There was all this turmoil in Kahnawake and stress, and out there (on the West Island), it didn’t affect them one bit,” he said. “They didn’t quite understand. People were saying, ‘Why do you want to live there? Why don’t you just leave?’ They don’t understand that it’s your home.”

Jacobs ran supplies into the community and helped those who needed transport to a hospital.

“That’s kind of why I became a Peacekeeper because I was too separated from my community, and I never felt more separated than at that time,” said Jacobs.

Peacekeepers helped transport food in to the community that was donated from community groups in the surrounding area, and escorted elders, women and children off the territory.

White was with the caravan that went through the infamous Whiskey Trench where cars full of women and children were pelted with rocks as police officers in LaSalle watched.

“It was terrible to see,” said White. “It wasn’t us that created that incident there. It was the lack of the police departments in LaSalle, in Montreal, the SQ, RCMP from in fact doing anything. They just stood there and watched.”

White remembers being on a boat escorting people across the water when an SQ helicopter stopped him with guns drawn.

“What was ironic about it was the officer who was pointing a gun at me, I knew who he was because I met him before, and I blatantly said to him, ‘what are you doing’ and the officer was shocked,” said White. “He put the firearm away and just flew off, but still… He was in shock that that thing happened.”

Though frustrated, White sympathized with officers on the other side.

“I believe some of them were sensitized through their training to deal with Native people – maybe not as much as what’s being done today – but these are people that over those years, prior to 1990, when we needed expertise, we called them,” said White. “It was the higher ups that were telling them what to do,” said White.

When the standoff ended, Peacekeepers continued to do their job patrolling the community, often having to pull over residents from off the territory for traffic violations and other offences. White and Jacobs said it took years to get non-Indigenous people to respect their authority.

“It was very hard,” said White. “Every time we tried to stop a vehicle that committed a traffic violation, they would flee and we ended up in chases out of our territory. And everybody challenged our authority.”

“As Peacekeepers we kind of got stuck in the middle,” said Jacobs. “You had outside forces that were encroaching, they wanted to extend their jurisdiction on our territory, (and) obviously there were issues with people’s relationship with outside departments was not good at all, and we got stuck in the middle.”

White said things started to change in the late '90s, highlighted by the Mohawk Council of Kahnawake and Quebec government signing the Agreement on Police Services Between Quebec and Kahnawake in March 1999.

It happened in the area of Jane Street and Woolner Avenue, north of St. Clair Avenue West, just before 10:20 p.m.

In a video obtained by CTV News Toronto from a nearby business, it shows a dark-coloured vehicle driving into the parking lot where dozens of people, including a child, have gathered.

A few seconds later, as the vehicle drives by and out of the camera's view, people were seen suddenly scrambling for cover. Police said that was the moment the suspects began ""indiscriminately"" firing shots at the crowd.

The vehicle was then seen speeding away.

""A car drove up and opened fire into a group of people,"" Deputy Police Chief Shawna Coxon said Saturday at the scene. ""The reason this is so concerning is it's a brazen shooting.""

""We have had more than a dozen rounds recovered at this time.""

Coxon said the gunmen opened fire into the group and that ""innocent bystanders were at risk.""

""It could have been much worse.""

When officers arrived, three people were located suffering from gunshot wounds, police said, adding two more victims then walked into hospital.

One victim, a 21-year-old man, remains in a life-threatening condition, while the four others are expected to survive, police said.

The suspects were last seen travelling east on Woolner Avenue in a grey or silver sedan.

Police have not released any suspect descriptions at this time.

It has been a violent 24 hours in Toronto, with more than six shootings reported.

Police said investigators are working to determine if there is a link between any of the shootings, but call the violence ""concerning.""",[]

Shortly after 1 p.m., emergency crews were called to the area of Plains Road East and King Road for reports of a shooting.

Upon arrival at the scene, officers said they located two male victims suffering from gunshot wounds. One victim was pronounced dead at the scene and the other was transported to hospital with serious injuries.

A third male victim was located at the scene with unknown injuries. Officers said he was not shot.

The deceased male has since been identified by police as Pat. He was 52 years old.

Pat was a well-known fixture of Ontario’s organized crime scene for many years.

Pat and his brother Angelo were charged with first-degree murder in the 1997 deaths of Hamilton mob boss Johnny “Pops” Papalia and his underboss Carmen Barillaro. The hitman who pleaded guilty in both shootings said the Musitano brothers had ordered the killings. The brothers pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder in Barillaro’s death as part of a plea deal and the charges relating to Papalia’s death were withdrawn.

The brothers were sentenced to 10 years behind bars in 2000 and were released from prison in 2006.

On May 2, 2017, Angelo was fatally gunned down while sitting in his vehicle in the driveway of his home in Hamilton, Ont.’s Waterdown neighbourhood. He was 39 years old.

One man was arrested in connection with Angelo’s death and two other suspects are wanted on Canada-wide warrants.

Meanwhile, Pat’s vehicle was torched in his driveway back in 2015 and a month after Angelo was killed Pat’s home was sprayed with bullets.

Pat was targeted once again last year. He was shot on April 25, 2019 in a Mississauga, Ont. parking lot while leaving his lawyer’s office at around 7 a.m.

The family’s patriarch, Pat and Angelo’s uncle, Tony Musitano died of natural causes at the age of 72 in April 2019. He was described as a former mobster.

No threat to public safety, police say

In the aftermath of the Burlington, Ont. shooting, Halton Regional Police said there is no ongoing or immediate threat to public safety.

Speaking at the scene of the shooting just before 4 p.m., Const. Ryan Anderson with Halton Regional Police told reporters officers are searching for a male suspect who fled the area westbound on Plains Road East in a newer model grey four-door sedan with a sunroof, similar to an Infiniti Q50.

According to investigators, the suspect vehicle would have “fresh damage to the driver’s side in the area of the doors.”

No further suspect description has been provided by officials thus far.

“Our investigators are going to be doing an extensive investigation,” Anderson said. “We are going to be canvassing the area for evidence, cameras, those sorts of things. It requires a large road closure at this point and a large scene.”

“We do have some witnesses and we would love to hear from anyone else who may have seen something, who may have been driving in the area, who has a dashcam from the approximate time of 1 p.m. on Plains Road East in Burlington.”

SHOOTING - BURLINGTON



We have responded to a shooting at 484 Plains Rd. E in Burlington. Two people have been shot.



At least one suspect is outstanding, who has since fled the scene.

The incident was posted on Twitter and shows a woman walking by a lone man while describing him on the phone to a 911 operator.

The man who posted the video said it was taken by his brother, 21-year-old Ntwali Bashizi, and said the woman called police because his brother wasn't two metres away from her while they crossed a bridge.

""I do believe it was racialized - there was no reason to stop me,"" Bashizi told CTV News on Friday. ""Even if I got off the bridge, we would have been the same distance.""

In the video, the woman turns the call on to speakerphone and the operator talks directly to the Bashizi to tell him he's intimidating the woman.

“Sir... do we really need to send a police officer just for you let this girl by?"" the operator asks.

""I'm not stopping her from coming by,"" Bashizi said before being interrupted.

""You're intimidating her, sir, okay, can you just stand to the side,"" the operator says, as he replies that he's already standing to the side.

Bashizi remains at a distance from the woman throughout the video and she eventually walks away while still on the phone.

He said he started recording the interaction when the woman started taking photos of him with her phone. His full video of the entire interaction is about nine minutes long, he said.

""How do I sound intimidating?"" he told CTV News Ottawa. ""I'm not doing anything. She approached me. She actually could have left me alone and I wouldn't have said anything to her.""

Ottawa Police say they are fully reviewing the incident and have offered Bashizi a full apology.

""At this point it is clear that this was not an appropriate use of the 911 system and the Service did not act appropriately in handling the call,"" police said on Twitter.

CTV News has not been able to identify the woman in the video.

The man's lawyer, Michael Spratt, told Newstalk 580 CFRA that the incident is an example of ""the weaponization of 911.""

""This is exactly the type of situation that can lead to dangerous and deadly encounters with the police that disproportionately impact racialized individuals and Black men,"" he said.

Ottawa Police Acting Deputy Chief Mark Ford said the incident was a misuse of the 911 system. He said the woman mentioned the man's race twice on the phone call. The police force is reviewing whether it should have sent officers to the scene, he said.

“We’ve got to make sure that we fully understand and appreciate both sides of the story when we’re delaing with a dispute like this,"" Ford told Newstalk 580 CFRA. Police are planning to speak with all parties, he added.

Police said no charges have been applied related to the incident at this time. Ford said it's premature to ask whether the 911 operator will be disciplined.

The incident comes months after a video in New York's Central Park showed a white woman calling police after a Black man requested she leash her dog.

In that video, she told the man that she'd call police and tell them he was threatening her.

She then called police and told the operator that the man was threatening as he stood at a distance from her.

The woman, who was since identified as Amy Cooper, has been charged with filing a false police report and was fired from her job over the May incident.

Cooper has since apologized and said she reacted emotionally and made false assumptions about the man's intentions.

A few dozen demonstrators gathered in downtown Montreal in the pouring rain Saturday morning, then went to Saint-Agathe-des-Monts, in front of the minister's constituency office.

Girault unveiled a third version of the reform on Thursday.

Members of the Quebec Liberal Party and Québec Solidaire Gaétan Barrette and Andrés Fontecilla echoed the protesters and addressed the small crowd gathered in Place de la Paix.

They urged foreign students and workers not to give up.

The government has the power to change at any time,” said Barrette.

Fontecilla underlined his disappointment with Girault, who recently succeeded Simon Jolin-Barrette at the head of the Ministry of Immigration.

“We expected a change in tone,” he said.

Jolin-Barrette presented a second version of the program at the end of May, after the muddle that had forced the François Legault government to apologize last fall and return to the drawing board.

The Quebec Experience Program (PEQ) allows international students and temporary foreign workers already established in the province to quickly obtain a Quebec selection certificate, in order to gain permanent residence.

The reforms make the rules more stringent in terms of required work experience and fluency in French, among other changes. The processing time for requests will be considerably extended.

In addition to obtaining their diploma - which was previously enough to qualify the program - international students will now have to acquire 12 to 18 months of full-time work experience.

As for foreign workers, the requirement goes from one to two years and can only be fulfilled in certain areas, which excludes less qualified workers.

ACQUIRED RIGHTS

Under the changes presented on Thursday, foreign students who graduate before the end of the year will finally be able to access the PEQ according to the criteria that was in place before the reform, which is scheduled to come into force on July 22.

However, those who will finish their studies next year will still have to go through the new program, even if they did not arrive in Quebec under these terms.

This is the case of Cristina Falconi. The Franco-Peruvian student was due to graduate in IT support next December. But with the COVID-19 pandemic, it was impossible for her to complete her studies before March 2021.

“It is unfair that for two or three months, we are not entitled to this acquired right. It really kills our morale,” she said.

The young woman is now thinking of leaving the country, but not all her classmates have this freedom. Some have invested too much money and even moved their small family counting on the PEQ fast track, she said.

Xiang Wang, who studies computer graphics, also saw his graduation postponed by the health crisis.

“We would like to apply the old law to the PEQ for all students who have already started their studies in Quebec,” argued the Chinese student. “A promise is a promise.”

At the very least, the Liberal Party and Québec Solidaire are calling for the addition of a grandfather clause.

“The future of these people is seriously compromised,” said Fontecilla. “Everything stems from the arbitrary and demagogic decision, in my opinion, to lower the immigration thresholds.”

Barrette believes that the reform is “indefensible” and “based exclusively on ideology.”

“We are sleeping in Quebec. It damages our reputation. We are harming our academic network,” he said.

The Immigration Department maintains that a reform was necessary to “ensure a better adequacy with the labour needs of Quebec and to achieve a balance with our immigration programs.”

The initial report from the Canadian Press said one, but another tragedy was added.

The first drowning occurred around 8:45 p.m. in Sorel-Tracy, about an hour east of Montreal.

“Emergency services were called on rue de Ramezay in Sorel-Tracy after a 2.5-year-old toddler was found underwater in a swimming pool, behind a private residence,” said Surete du Quebec (SQ) spokesperson Anik Lamirande.

First responders tried to resuscitate the child, before he was transported to the hospital where he was pronounced dead.

Another child, almost the same age, was discovered in similar circumstances in Lanaudière.

Emergency services were called at around 6 p.m. to Georges Road in Saint-Paul, after a 2-year-old toddler was found unconscious in another residential swimming pool.

Again, resuscitation manoeuvres were performed on the young victim, but to no avail. Her death was pronounced in hospital.

The SQ is conducting two separate investigations to clarify the circumstances of these two tragedies.

As of July 10, the Lifesaving Society has reported 42 drownings in Quebec in 2020, ten more than the same date last year.

Friday’s victims are the third and fourth toddlers reported in the past month.

Some 30 years ago, he was one of the Mohawks barricaded in the Pines, the stretch of Kanesatake adjacent to the Town of Oka’s public golf course. One night that sticks in his memory is Sept. 8, 1990.

""And it was getting late at night, and I didn’t think anything was going to happen,"" he said. He was in a foxhole designed as a defence mechanism from the Canadian Forces. ""So I get in my sleeping bag, and the next thing you know, there was about four of them and they started clubbing me.""

He said the beating he took from four soldiers who had slipped into the Pines blinded him in one eye for a time. Now 30 years on, he reflects on how Oka could have been handled differently.

""Well they (the provincial police and army) could have talked more,"" he said. ""You know, discussed it more instead of action. You know, what they did over at the rail blockade.""

CTV News repeatedly requested comment from both the SQ and Canadian Forces. Neither party would discuss the Oka Crisis.

This past winter, the Kahnawake Mohawks blocked off the railroad tracks running through the territory. They joined similar actions nationwide in solidarity of the Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs, who were blocking the construction of a pipeline through their territory in British Columbia. After governments negotiated with the Wet'suwet'en, the situation was defused, an outcome some point to as a positive change from the days of 78-day standoffs.

""I'd like to think that's a structural change,"" said Marc Miller, the federal Indigenous services minister. ""I'd like to think there are parts of that where it does take individuals to stand up and say we're not going to use force against our brothers and sisters.”

""Prior to ‘90, it was quite common for the government to pay no attention with what was going on with Native communities,"" said Kenneth McComber, a Mohawk who lives in Kahnawake. ""Nobody would resist. After ‘90, people realized that they're not going take it anymore.""

But when asking what was learned from the Oka Crisis, the answer heavily depends on whom one asks.

""There were only losers on the 11th of July,"" said Geoff Kelley, who served as a longtime Indigenous affairs minister at the provincial level. ""No one came out of the Oka Crisis a winner.""

There will likely be a commemoration of the Oka Crisis on July 11th.

""To me personally, it's not something to celebrate,” said Kanesatake Grand Chief Serge Simon. ""There are parts of it, yes, that were a benefit to many First Nations. It changed the rules of the game politically speaking.""

During the winter rail blockade, Mohawks did drive onto the bridge waving flags to slow traffic, but they did not block the bridge.

Some Mohawks wonder if blockades are the answer.

""It gets the message out there but it also hurts us,"" said Louis Stacey, a Mohawk of Kanesatake. ""Because it’s the citizens of the province, or the citizens of Canada, who are paying the price for their government’s lack of initiative.""

Simultaneously, other Mohawks warn that many of the underlying issues that led to the Oka Crisis still exist. Land claims are still outstanding between Kanesatake and Oka, and some say that governments need to be wary of incursions on Indigenous territories.

""I guarantee if push came to shove,"" said Kahsennenhawe Sky-Deer, a Kahnawake Mohawk councillor. ""And any other attempt was ever tried again, it wouldn’t be pretty.""",[]

Here's what Montrealers should do,[],2020-07-10 20:38:00-04:00,"MONTREAL -- Some Montrealers have a tough balance to strike this week.

Many are in quarantine after exposure to a COVID-19 case, because they’ve been travelling, or even if they’ve tested positive themselves.

But of course, there’s a heat wave on. And only about 70 per cent of Montrealers have air conditioning.

That means that some of the people who need to escape the heat at home for their own health are the same people who aren’t supposed to leave home for other people’s health.

“Anybody who can possibly stay at home and respect [quarantine] at home should do it,” said Dr. David Kaiser of Montreal public health.

“But heat is a killer, and so people who are in hot apartments, where they’ve been exposed to extreme heat for three to four days now… their immediate health is at risk.”

For those people, he said, “my message to them is, you can get out of that hot apartment.”

With temperatures as hot as those in this week’s heat wave, the risk of heat stroke and heat exhaustion is real, said public health authorities.

But they ask everybody who’s in quarantine to take every possible precaution if they leave: they should wear a mask and find a cool spot outdoors.

If that’s impossible, they’re asked to call 811 to find out where they can find a safe indoor cooling zone, which is often in a health-care facility.

“All of the [regional health boards] have been working together to make sure that we offer zones for those vulnerable people according to their COVID status,” said Caroline Dusablon of the Centre-South health district.

Public health has also deployed teams to check on people who may need help, especially those suffering from a variety of health conditions.

COVID-19 aside, they’re also asking all Montrealers to help out by thinking of friends, family or neighbours who may be at risk from the heat and checking in on them.",[]

""My grandfather had bought a boat and he had been going across the water to go get groceries,"" she said. ""It hits harder when you hear it from your family, and people who experienced it firsthand.""

She’s one of about 50 students who graduated from the Kahnawake Survival School (KSS) this spring. The school was built in 1978 as a response to Bill 101 and is one of the only schools in the province where the community decides on the curriculum.

""For my generation, everyone finds it inspiring because we stood up for what we wanted,"" she said.

The Oka Crisis plays an integral role in history, social studies and learning how Indigenous people and government interact.

On top of that, one day each year is completely devoted to the Crisis. Speakers from Kahnawake and Kanesatake speak to the students about their experience with different aspects of the Crisis.

""When we first started talking about it, we approached it from all different angles,"" said KSS graduate Jennifer Kanerahtoronkwas Paul. ""We approached it politically to see how the Mohawk Council was dealing with it. We looked at it traditionally to see how the longhouses were dealing with it. We looked at the economics of it, the voice of the people,"" she added.

TEACHERS WHO WERE THERE

At the tip of Tekakwitha Island, Louis Delisle can point out where the Canadian Armed Forces landed in a failed raid of Kahnawake.

He pointed out some of the landmarks along the St-Lawrence Seaway, and at the bridge where community members faced off against the soldiers.

""They had a huge warship come up here (through the seaway),""he said. ""I really don’t know what they were trying to prove.""

Delisle is one of the teachers at KSS. He said the staff is uniquely qualified to teach about the events of 1990.

""I feel at KSS we can give a true account of what happened because we lived it,"" he said.

IDENTITY AND EDUCATION

Delisle tries to impart on his students that learning about the Crisis is a way to strengthen their Kanien'kehà:ka identity.

""People have been robbed of their culture, robbed of their language. Eventually enough is enough. Fortunately in Kahnawake, we're fighting back with our schools,"" said Delisle. ""Through education, keeping a strong identity, regaining our language is a way not to let ourselves be steamrolled by the juggernaut of the government.""

""It bonded our community,"" added Paul. ""We came out stronger.""

QUEBEC EDUCATION CURRICULUM

At Westmount High School, history teacher Robert Green makes a point of discussing the Oka Crisis with his students.

The Truth and Reconciliation Commission recommended there be education curriculum covering Indigenous Peoples. It is still not a requirement in Quebec.

The provincial textbook devotes two paragraphs and a few photos to the Oka Crisis and according to Green, students have no questions on it in the ministry exam.

He points out even the language of the textbook puts the onus of the Crisis on the Mohawks. ""It says the Crisis began when the people of Kanesatake built a barricade, not with the proposed expansion of the golf course,"" he said.

Former KSS students say their non-Indigenous friends get a totally different version of events.

""Our non-Native friends said the education system only taught them the biased, white version of it,"" said Kale Rahkerenhá:wi Phillips.

""Over here it's our history,""added Diabo. ""For them it's just a chapter in a history book, for us it's a whole book.""",[]

On the afternoon of Aug. 28, 1990 she was huddled in the back of a car headed into LaSalle’s Whisky Trench.

It was a month into the 78-day standoff in Kanesatake. On Montreal’s South Shore, community members in Kahnawake blocked the Mercier Bridge as an act of solidarity.

Her family, along with many others, decided to leave the reserve for fears of violence.

Police forced nearly 70 cars to wait on the bridge for hours in the baking heat.

On the other side, a crowd gathered and grew increasingly angry.

""I was in the second vehicle so right away the windows smash,"" she recalled. ""There's glass all over me. You can hear the yelling and at that point you go into survival mode. I braced my head and took cover.""

Sitting next to her, Sky-Deer’s grandmother started crying, which made her cry in fear.

""You could see the people holding signs calling us 'savages.' I never really experienced or understood what racism was until the events of 1990.""

She was 10 years old.

IGNITION POINT

Before the barricades went up in the Pines, Ellen Gabriel remembers going to meetings to discuss the controversial expansion of the course at Oka Golf Club.

She recalls feeling threatened because of prevailing attitudes at the time.

""My maternal side grew up in the village. And they experienced a lot of racism … being called 'savages,' laughed at when they spoke our language,"" she said.

At the Highway 138 barricades near Chateauguay, effigies of Indigenous people and Premier Robert Bourassa were hung and burned.

Kanesatake Council Grand Chief Serge Simon said during the 78-day standoff, the LaSalle rock throwing incident was one of the most shocking acts he witnessed.

""To see them pelted the way they were. There was nothing more blatantly racist than that,"" he said.

Both Oka Mayor Pascal Quevillon and Quebec’s Indigenous Affairs Minister Sylvie D'Amours contend the Crisis was not about race, it was about land.

Many who were involved in the crisis say the land is where the conflict started, but it became fuelled by racism.

RECONCILIATION

For Gabriel, racist attitudes are still present, but take another form.

She points to the lack of clean drinking water in Indigenous reserves across Canada as an example.

Since the Liberals were elected in 2015, 87 long-term water advisories in Indigenous communities have been lifted across Canada.

Another 56 remain, and the Liberals have promised to eliminate all long-term boil water advisories by 2021.

Gabriel said until the basic needs of Indigenous people in Canada are met, Justin Trudeau’s pledge of reconciliation is just a facade.

""He (Trudeau) needs to be taught what reconciliation means. There's a notion the government will decide as always,"" she said.

She added that the government will only negotiate with band councils, which were established under the Indian Act, and not the traditional longhouses.

EXPERIENCES TODAY

Growing up, Jennifer Kanerahtoronkwas Paul attended school in Kahnawake. She spent one year at a Montreal private school, an experience she said opened her eyes to how she is viewed by others.

""Children experience racism at a really young age,"" she said. Many get their first taste in sports and schools in Montreal.

""When I'd show up to school I'd say my name is Kanerahtoronkwas and they'd look at me funny and not understand the importance of my name. They’d ask questions like 'Do you actually live in a house and not a teepee?'""

Still today as a student at Bishops University, she has to play the role of educator to explain why certain comments were racist or hurtful.

Paul was born after the Oka Crisis, but said many similar tensions came back during the rail blockade in support of the Wet’suwet’en Nation.

""That was the first time we got a taste of the real racism,"" she said. ""It brought back a lot of emotion of the Oka Crisis and for many people it felt very similar.""

30 YEARS LATER

For Sky-Deer, visiting the Whiskey Trench brings all those memories back.

""I remember feeling heartache and heartbreak, wondering why do people hate us so much,"" she said.

Over the last 30 years, she said attitudes haven’t changed much. Experiencing the rock throwing was a first taste of racism, but it certainly wasn’t the last.

""When you're Indigenous in Canada, you know what it's like to be looked at different,"" she said.",[]

Below is the letter in full.

Mr. Premier,

Thirty years ago, Quebec entered one of its worst human, social, and political crises. The climate of violence that we witnessed from July to the end of September 1990 had dramatic consequences, including the death of a serving police officer.

Although the Oka crisis has sadly left its indelible mark in our minds, it can still serve as a reference because nothing has really changed in thirty years. However, the social and political divide between First Nations and part of the Quebec population is the result of decades of injustice and forced measures. It is obvious that subjecting an entire population to such actions can only leave wounds that are still open today. Quebec is no exception in this regard; examples abound around the world.

The AFNQL is addressing you today, publicly, first to respectfully acknowledge the memory of the summer of 1990 and to share with you, as Premier of Quebec, ways to prevent history from repeating itself.

The COVID-19 pandemic, police misconduct of a racist nature, a sad thirtieth anniversary, it is in this sensitive context that the debate on racism and discrimination is resurfacing in Quebec, to which the systemic nature is added, whether we like it or not.

Systemic racism and discrimination are not just concepts or theoretical notions. Rather, they are a set of facts and behaviors and we should not be afraid to name and denounce them if we are genuinely willing to correct them.

From the point of view of the AFNQL, when a people denies the fundamental rights of another on the basis of its race, we are in the presence of racism. When this denial is formally and systematically exercised by a State, we are in the presence of systemic racism and discrimination. Again, let us not be afraid of words. They help us face reality.

We must be reminded that the United Nations adopted the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples more than ten years ago, with the aim of breaking with such behavior and proposing viable solutions to States to redefine their relations with Indigenous peoples on a respectful basis. Moreover, the Declaration called for minimal standards to ensure the survival, the dignity and wellbeing of Indigenous peoples. In our view, the political decisions that led to the Oka crisis are a perfect example of actions to be prohibited under the Declaration.

The lesson could easily have been learned.

Against all odds, through recent court actions, your government is today challenging the fundamental right of First Nations to be self-governing, our right to take charge of our own services for our families and children.

Must we remind the premier that denying our right to self-determination will only make us redouble our collective efforts to ensure that Indigenous peoples get the respect they deserve? Putting so much energy and resources into impeding First Nations' desire to better serve their populations will only exacerbate systemic racism and discrimination.

It is difficult to be optimistic in the search for constructive solutions when the wounds of the relationship that should unite us are still contaminated by contempt.

We need to learn from the past and act to move in the right direction, one that will ensure that there is no turning back on mutually agreed principles. As leaders, we share the duty to find a path that is respectful and beneficial to our respective peoples. It is a matter, Mr. Premier, of willingness.

In Peace and Friendship,

Ghislain Picard, Chief from the Assembly of First Nations Quebec-Labrador",[]

If I'm feeling it I know others are feeling it as well.

So, I felt it’s time to share some of the good news that can come out of a bad news scenario given the global pandemic has impacted so many Canadians.

RBC, Canada's largest bank has started to highlight weekly Canadians who have been doing selfless acts of kindness to help family, friends, even strangers while giving back to their communities. The project is being called Random Acts of Canadian and is being rolled out on a national basis.

I love this.

A program like this profiles how resilient we are as Canadians as we all struggle to cope with the ongoing stress of living through a global pandemic. People of all ages and from all walks of life are sharing their stories and doing great things.

My daughter Jane knows I love to be active and keep on the move so she shared with me the story of Guy Aiello who is about to turn 100. He wants to give back to his local hospital, PRHC Foundation, and hopes to raise $42,200 by beginning his journey on July 1 to conquer a 42.2K marathon, taking it one step at a time.

The Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB) shares that almost half of Canadians know a business that has had to close and 8 out of 10 people say they wish they could do more. The fact is, only half of small businesses are fully open and those that are open only one in three are back to pre-pandemic staffing levels and one in five is back to normal sales.

But we can do more and here is how: the CFIB has launched SmallBusinessEveryDay.ca and hopes Canadians will walk to a local business maybe buy a treat for a neighbour or purchases goods and services for themselves. In other words look for ways to support independent business everyday. Let's work to make #SmallBusinessEveryDay become a trend.

Even the Canadian government is getting in on the bandwagon to give back with the launching of the Canada Student Service Grant, which will allow post-secondary and recent grads to gain valuable experience while contributing to their communities. If a student decides to volunteer this summer they could receive a grant of between $1,000 and $5,000 depending on how many hours worked they have completed. Check out the Government of Canada website's ""I Want To Help"" portal.

The point here is that giving back shows no boundaries. It isn't age-restricted, gender-specific and crosses social barriers. Let's share some of the good that has come out such a bad situation.",[]

But with this 2020 hindsight, the first half of this year from hell’s assessment is severely abnormal, warped by pandemic aftershocks, anti-racism protests, Indigenous blockades and the deadliest mass murder in Canadian history.

And yet, politics has rarely mattered more as emergency government programs aim to ease COVID-19 suffering amid the biggest health care crisis and worst economic meltdown of our lives.

So how are the leaders doing when this country needs leadership more than ever? Well, after consulting with some favorite oracles of political insight, we have sized up key leaders and graded them accordingly.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau:

Now numbering almost 90 pandemic news conferences and counting, you can’t deride the prime minister for a failure to communicate. It would’ve taken Stephen Harper 90 years to match that level of media availability. But it’s become a very expensive list of daily announcements and there’s scant attention on paying off a tab the next two generations might not be able to afford. His early investments in testing technology, protective equipment procurement and vaccine development were commendable, but he was slow to order border closings and airport arrival screening. His handling of China has been a mission impossible, but sticking to the legal process in the push to swap Meng Wanzhou for two imprisoned Canadians is the right thing to do.

Grade: B+

Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland:

Overshadowed by the daily television spotlight on her boss doesn’t mean the deputy prime minister isn’t having a big impact. Freeland initiated the closure of the border with the U.S. and will face the daunting challenge of keeping it that way until the new American surge is suppressed. She managed to resolve the international mask controversy and is the key contact in keeping the feds on the same policy page as the premiers. While Trudeau is the big guy in front of the cameras, I’m told she remains the powerhouse behind the scenes.

A-

Finance Minister Bill Morneau:

An overnight recession plus a tripling of unemployment in a matter of weeks equals any finance minister’s worse nightmare and greatest fiscal test. Morneau oversaw emergency relief programs which rolled out quickly and blanketed the vast majority of Canadians needing help. Still, an unsustainable $250 billion deficit? And growing? And no roadmap where we’re headed or how to get out of it? To postpone a budget indefinitely and delay any fiscal update until July when nobody is watching, while remaining largely invisible except to business leaders, suggests he has not excelled as a crisis finance minister.

Grade: C+

Health Minister Patty Hajdu:

My original high expectations of this as Hajdu’s moment to shine have not materialized. She’s strangely low profile for a pandemic health minister, but perhaps that’s because her boss and public health officers steal the spotlight. Even so, her comments dismissing China’s low-balling of COVID-19 cases, her statement that border closings are ineffective and some inconsistent messaging on coping with the pandemic early in the outbreak have been underwhelming, although I’m told she’s actively engaged behind the scenes with her provincial counterparts.

Grade: C

Ontario Premier Doug Ford:

When the pandemic began, Ford was a one-term wonder in the making. Everything has changed now. His severely tone-deaf behavior has turned into a premier delivering exemplary textbook crisis communications. His erring on the side of caution has produced a reopening schedule which seems to be working so far. Even so, the largest province was late to the lockdown, slow on testing and Ford’s outrage at the scandalous death count in long term care fatalities cries out for emergency action he has yet to deliver.

Grade: B

Quebec Premier Francois Legault:

Being premier of the country’s coronavirus epicentre has severely tested Legault’s above-average communications skills. Faced with a horrific death spiral in long term care residents, he did the right thing to asked the military for help. He’s invested more money per capita in coping with the virus than any other province, but the caseload and death count remain atrociously high as he moves too quickly to reopen. He has wisely cancelled plans to withhold the infection and fatality numbers from the public, which would’ve been an irresponsible coverup, and that keeps him from a lower grade.

Grade: B-

Official Opposition Leader Andrew Scheer:

The thrill is long gone, there’s no obvious desire to carry on for the nearly-departed Conservative leader. His fixation with continuing the parliamentary process is not a public priority, but he asks reasonable questions even though they rarely elicit answers from the Trudeau side of the House. Still it’s a tough job to critique a prime minister throwing tens of billions at a besieged economy that badly needs it. I’m sure Scheer can’t wait to be replaced as he limps into the history books as a trivia quiz answer. Another nice guy finishing last.

Grade: C-",[]

Rowe'],2020-07-10 11:16:00-04:00,"MONTREAL -- With recent COVID-19 outbreaks on the South Shore causing bumps in positive cases, thousands more people are lining up for testing in Quebec.

According to Quebec public health authorities, a total of 11,454 samples were analyzed July 8, which is 2,176 more than the 9,278 analyzed July 7. (Quebec releases testing information two days prior to the daily updates).

Authorities announced that 100 more people have tested positive for the virus in the past 24 hours with the majority of the cases in Montreal (33) and Monteregie (31).

Thirty-two of those cases were in Montreal, which had the largest bump, but Monteregie's 31 new cases means the region is increasing at a higher rate. Montreal has reported 27,529 positive cases since the start of the pandemic, while the Monteregie is at 8,088.

The total number of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 in Quebec is now 56,316.

Of the three deaths reported, two were recorded in the past 24 hours, while one occured before July 2, according to Quebec.

The number of hospitalizations increased Friday with nine more people receiving treatment in Quebec hospitals for a total of 317. Of those, 24 people are in the intensive care ward, a decrease of three.

Fifty-nine more people are reported to have recovered from the virus for a total of 25,675.",[]

Horacio Arruda said there was ""sufficient data"" to conclude the outbreak is linked to two private parties that took place at the end of June, as well as to a bar that some of the attendees later visited.

""That means there was community transmission at the parties, then there was more at the bar by people who were contaminated in the parties who didn't have symptoms, or who had mild symptoms,"" he told reporters in Gatineau, Que.

The outbreak prompted one of the affected communities to order mandatory mask-wearing inside all commercial businesses as of Friday.

Health officials said they believe the house party in the municipality of Saint-Chrysostome, located about 50 kilometres south of Montreal, is connected to a series of infections that forced several businesses to close in the nearby town of Mercier.

Montreal has already announced it intends to bring in a bylaw making mask-wearing mandatory in public indoor places by the end of July.

Arruda said provincial officials continue to seriously discuss whether to implement similar rules across the province, but said it's easier said than done. ""Making things mandatory is easy to say, applying it, now, there are a lot of logistics,"" he said.

He said it will take time for cities to figure out how to provide masks to those who can't afford them, how to enforce the rules, and what penalties to impose on people who break the rules.

The province tightened restrictions on bar owners earlier this week out of concern some weren't following physical distancing rules.

As of Friday, bars and nightclubs can no longer sell alcohol after midnight and are limited to 50 per cent of their legal customer capacity -- something Arruda said is necessary to limit crowding and reduced inhibitions brought on by alcohol.

He said it's up to bar owners and patrons to respect the rules and avoid new closures. ""We're trying to keep a sector of the economy open because people want to have a drink with others, but they can't have a drink like before,"" he said.

Premier Francois Legault was asked on Friday whether the recent uptick in cases were indicative of a second wave of COVID-19 infection.

Although he said he didn't believe public health officials think so, he said, ""there is a risk.""

""The last thing we want is to reconfine so wear a mask, especially in closed public places, and keep a two-metre distance between people, it's very, very important -- more than ever.""

Rowe'],2020-07-10 12:06:00-04:00,"MONTREAL -- Quebec provincial police (SQ) arrested a woman Thursday afternoon after she allegedly left her two children in the car with the engine off during a record-breaking heat wave.

According to the SQ, two children under 10 years old were left in the car around noon in front of a medical clinic for about an hour on Larocque St. (about an hour west of Montreal) while their mother from Salaberry-de-Valleyfield in Monteregie went for a doctor’s appointment.

The temperatures at the time were pushing above 35 degrees Celsius.

A concerned citizen called 911, and SQ officers arrived on the scene to find the keys in the ignition but the car’s engine off. One of the rear windows was lowered.

The two children did not suffer heat stroke.

The officers questioned the mother, arrested and released her on a promise to appear in court.

The file will now be forwarded to Crown prosecutors who will decide whether or not to press charges. Charges could include child abandonment.

Youth protection authorities were also notified and will investigate.

The hottest spot Thursday was recorded in Saint-Anicet, not far from Salaberry-de-Valleyfield, which peaked at 35.6 Celsius, breaking a 1955 heat record of 34.4.

In an open letter published this week in a journal, two scientists from Australia and the U.S. wrote that studies have shown ""beyond any reasonable doubt that viruses are released during exhalation, talking and coughing in microdroplets small enough to remain aloft in the air.""

The researchers, along with more than 200 others, appealed for national and international authorities, including WHO, to adopt more stringent protective measures.

WHO has long dismissed the possibility that the coronavirus is spread in the air except for certain risky medical procedures, such as when patients are first put on breathing machines.

In a change to its previous thinking, WHO noted on Thursday that studies evaluating COVID-19 outbreaks in restaurants, choir practices and fitness classes suggested the virus might have been spread in the air.

Airborne spread ""particularly in specific indoor locations, such as crowded and inadequately ventilated spaces over a prolonged period of time with infected persons cannot be ruled out,"" WHO said.

Still, officials also pointed out that other modes of transmission -- like contaminated surfaces or close contacts between people in such indoor environments -- might also have explained the disease's spread.

WHO's stance also recognized the importance of people spreading COVID-19 without symptoms, a phenomenon the organization has long downplayed.

WHO has repeatedly said such transmission is ""rare"" despite a growing consensus among scientists globally that asymptomatic spread likely accounts for a significant amount of transmission. The agency said that most spread is via droplets from infected people who cough or sneeze, but added that people without symptoms are also capable of transmitting the disease.

""The extent of truly asymptomatic infection in the community remains unknown,"" WHO said.

In an open letter addressed to Public Safety Minister Bill Blair, 29 bipartisan members of Congress called on the Canadian government to plan a phased reopening of the Canada-U.S. border and to consider easing existing measures.

""We are asking that the United States and Canada immediately craft a comprehensive framework for phased reopening of the border based on objective metrics and accounting for the varied circumstances across border regions,"" read the letter, which was published on Western New York Congressman Brian Higgins' website on July 3.

The members of Congress, who represent the northern states along the border, also implored the Canadian government to consider easing restrictions on family members and property owners impeded by the border closure.

""We understand the importance of prioritizing the safety of our communities as we all navigate the complex calculation of minimizing public health risks and resuming economic activity. However, the social and economic partnership between our two nations necessitates a clear pathway forward,"" the letter read.

They crafted the letter following the latest joint Canada-U.S. agreement to extend the current border closure until July 21. This is the third time the agreement to maintain the border closure has been extended.

Despite the United States' plea, a spokesperson for Canada’s Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland told CTVNews.ca in a Friday statement that the health and safety of Canadians is ""absolutely priority.""

""Decisions about Canada's border are made by Canadians, for Canadians,"" said Freeland's spokesperson, Katherine Cuplinskas, in the statement.

""Since the beginning of this global pandemic, we have been having friendly ongoing conversations with our American partners about our shared border. Both sides agree that the current measures in place, which are set to expire on July 21st, have worked well in restricting non-essential travel while allowing essential crossings to continue unimpeded.""

Freeland's office wasn’t alone in pushing back against the call. Higgins posted the open letter in full on his Twitter page and he was swiftly met with backlash on the social media platform.

One comment, which had three times as many likes as Higgins' original post, slammed the call.

""No thank you...clean up your backyard before you attempt to enter ours..sincerely Canada,"" wrote a user who goes by the name @MichelletypoQ.

Another user, @rachelinTO, wrote that ""most of our earliest cases came from the U.S. So...... that's a firm 'no'. Sorry, eh.""

Other users called the request ""disastrous"" and multiple accounts said they’d only be comfortable easing restrictions after seeing improvement in the number of COVID-19 cases in the U.S.

The United States reached a macabre milestone at the end of June when it became home to the world’s highest number of reported infections: more than 2.2 million. It also has the highest death toll in the world, with 120,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.

Shortly after the news broke about the soaring cases in the United States, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the government was considering next steps for the looming deadline of the current border closure.

Speaking in a press conference on June 29, with just over three weeks until the agreement expires, he said the government will continue to assess the situation at our shared border.

""We have extended the border measures with the United States until July 21. We will continue to assess the situation and work with the Americans on what steps need to be taken into the month of August,"" Trudeau said.

And as COVID-19 continues to affect countries around the world, Trudeau said the health of Canadians remains the top priority when considering the loosening of any border restrictions.

""We are going to be very, very careful about when and how we start reopening international borders,"" Trudeau said.",[]

An animal health expert and an epidemiologist will meet Chinese counterparts in Beijing to set the ""scope and terms of reference"" for a WHO-led international mission aimed at learning how the virus jumped from animals to humans, a WHO statement said.

Scientists believe the virus may have originated in bats and was transmitted to another mammal such as a civet cat or an armadillo-like pangolin before being passed on to people.

A cluster of infections late last year focused initial attention on a fresh food market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, but the discovery of earlier cases suggests the animal-to-human jump may have happened elsewhere.

In an effort to block future outbreaks, China has cracked down on the trade in wildlife and closed some markets, while enforcing strict containment measures that appear to have virtually stopped new local infections.

The WHO mission is politically sensitive, with the U.S. -- the top funder of the UN body -- moving to cut ties with it over allegations it mishandled the outbreak and is biased toward China.

""China took the lead in inviting WHO experts to investigate and discuss scientific virus tracing,"" Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said Friday.

In contrast, he said, the U.S. ""not only announced its withdrawal from the World Health Organization, but also politicized the anti-epidemic issue and played a buck-passing game to shift responsibilities.""

More than 120 nations called for an investigation into the origins of the virus at the World Health Assembly in May. China has insisted that WHO lead the investigation and for it to wait until the pandemic is brought under control. The U.S., Brazil and India are continuing to see an increasing number of cases.

The last WHO coronavirus-specific mission to China was in February, after which the team's leader, Canadian doctor Bruce Aylward, praised China's containment efforts and information sharing. Canadian and American officials have since criticized him as being too lenient on China.

An Associated Press investigation showed that in January, WHO officials were privately frustrated over the lack of transparency and access in China, according to internal audio recordings. Their complaints included that China delayed releasing the genetic map, or genome, of the virus for more than a week after three different government labs had fully decoded the information.

Privately, top WHO leaders complained in meetings in the week of Jan. 6 that China was not sharing enough data to assess how effectively the virus spread between people or what risk it posed to the rest of the world, costing valuable time.",[]

Here's a look at how much Canadian cities spend on policing,[],2020-07-10 07:30:00-04:00,"TORONTO -- An analysis by CTVNews.ca of 18 of Canada’s largest cities, regions and provincial capitals found more than half allocated 15 per cent or more of their 2020 operating budget to policing, with cities in Western Canada budgeting 20 per cent or more.

Coast-to-coast, from Vancouver to Charlottetown, P.E.I., Canadian cities are spending 15 to 20 per cent or more of their budget on law enforcement, the bulk of it coming from municipal taxes. Cities that do not have a municipal force were excluded from the analysis.

Cries to defund the police have rung out in protests across the United States, sparked by the death of George Floyd, seen in a video pleading and gasping for air as a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee against his neck -- long after he had already gone silent.

Around the world and in Canada, cities are also facing public pressure to reduce their law enforcement budgets to reallocate funds to other areas including mental health and community social support services.

It is a contentious issue, however. Ontario Premier Doug Ford has already dismissed the idea for the Ontario Provincial Police, saying he believes in strengthening policing through better community involvement.

In recent months, several deaths that followed “wellness checks” by Canadian police have sparked further discussion over whether police officers are properly trained or even the appropriate authority to deal with someone having a mental health crisis, in particular those who are Black, Indigenous, or a person of colour.

In June, 62-year-old Ejaz Choudry was killed in his home by police in Mississauga, Ont., after the family said it called a non-emergency helpline because he was having a mental health episode. Paramedics who arrived called the police after Choudry was seen with a knife in his hand. Earlier in the month, Chantel Moore, an Indigenous woman, was shot and killed by police in New Brunswick during another wellness check, while Regis Korchinski-Paquet, a Black, Indigenous woman, fell from her apartment balcony in Toronto last month while police officers were in her home.

BIGGEST POLICE BUDGET IN CANADA

At the end of June, Toronto city council rejected a 10 per cent cut to the police budget, about $107 million, and instead passed a motion on police reform that includes implementing body cameras and overhauling the way Canada’s largest municipal police force responds to people in crisis.

A 10 per cent reduction would have meant cutting about 1,000 police officers, according to the Canadian Press, a move that could take years to implement due to collective bargaining agreements with the union.

The Toronto Police Service operating budget for 2020 is $1.22 billion, about 9 per cent of the city’s $13.53 billion operational budget for 2020. More than $3 billion is distributed for various social support and development programs including employment, social assistance, child-care, long-term care services, helping under-resourced neighbourhoods, housing and shelter support.

In early June, the Vancouver Police Board rejected a motion by city council calling for a 1 per cent cut to the police’s $339 million budget, about 21 per cent of the city’s $1.62 billion operating budget for 2020.

Meanwhile, Edmonton city council approved a motion in early July that included cutting the police service’s budget by $11 million over the next two years amid weeks of debate around police reform.

South of the border, the city of Los Angeles voted on July 1 to cut police department hiring, slashing the LAPD’s budget by US$150 million. The cut brings the department’s staffing down to its lowest level in 12 years, the Los Angeles Times reported. The city said the money would eventually be reallocated into services like hiring programs and summer youth jobs for Black, Latino and other marginalized communities.

BIGGEST LINE ITEM ON THE BUDGET

For cities in Western Canada including Victoria, Vancouver, Saskatoon, Regina, Winnipeg, policing accounts for at least 20 per cent of their 2020 operating budgets. Among them, all but Vancouver have policing as the city’s biggest expenditure. (Utilities is listed as Vancouver’s biggest operating expenditure in its 2020 budget, though annual financial reports show that police is the city’s biggest expense.)

In Victoria, the police force accounts for roughly 23 per cent of the city’s total operating expenses for 2020. For Vancouver, Saskatoon and Regina, it’s just over 20 per cent. Edmonton and Calgary are the exceptions.

The Winnipeg Police Service is getting $304.1 million this year, or 26.6 per cent of the city’s $1.14 billion tax-supported operating expenditures. It is the largest percentage among the cities examined by CTVNews.ca. By comparison, community services in Winnipeg are getting $115 million, or 10 per cent of the budget.

As in many other cities, a petition has been circulating calling for change and defunding the Winnipeg police. Chief Danny Smyth said in June that it was too early to “just say defund the police and forward that all to social services” but added there was room for conversation on what such a move could look like.

Even places with modest budgets, like Charlottetown, P.E.I., which has a budget of $59.7 million, allocates more than 16 per cent to police. In Fredericton, N.B., more than 14 per cent of its $124.4 million budget (including capital expenditures) goes to policing. That portion is more than 18 per cent if capital expenditures are excluded.

In larger southern Ontario, Toronto-area cities and regions including Hamilton, Waterloo, Peel, and York, hundreds of millions of dollars are spent each year on policing. Peel and York, which have similar operating budgets of approximately $2.5 billion, spend about $445.8 million and $384.2 million, respectively, or 17 and 16 per cent. The Waterloo Regional Police, which also serves Kitchener, Ont., accounts for just over 17 per cent of the region’s operating budget. Hamilton’s police budget accounts for nearly 19 per cent of the city’s net operating budget. (That portion is halved however, if calculated based on the tax and rate supported gross operating expenditure).

Nearly all cities that spend roughly 10 per cent or less on policing have operating budgets of at least $1 billion. These include Toronto, Calgary, Ottawa, Quebec City, Montreal and Halifax, which has a budget just shy of a billion.

According to Statistics Canada data, the average salary among municipal police officers was $100,962 for 2017/2018, the latest year in which data is available. And while police spending has increased, the number of police officers per 100,000 people has been shrinking, the data showed.

In the United States, data varies depending on the source, but the percentage allocated to police departments for the 10 largest cities in the country ranged from 6 per cent to 17.4 per cent based on an analysis by U.S. News & World Report. Data compiled by the Center for Popular Democracy, a progressive advocacy group, which includes other cities, showed that percentage ranged as high as 20 to 45 per cent, with such cities as Minneapolis accounting for more than 35 per cent and Milwaukee making up nearly 48 per cent.

One important caveat to note is that cities are all structured differently and may report their finances or categorize their spending differently as well, so a true apples-to-apples comparison is extremely difficult. A few cities include utilities as part of its operating expenses, for example, while many do not.The Canadian police data in this analysis was collected and calculated based on figures presented in 2020 budget proposals and reports released by each city and region. As much as possible, comparable figures were used. In general, total operating budget or expenditure budget excluding capital expenditures as presented in the budget reports were used. In some cases, for example, figures provided may be net of recoveries and/or transfers, terms for certain types of financial transactions in accounting.

Philippe Monguillot, 59, was left brain dead after the attack in the southwestern city of Bayonne on July 5. His family decided to switch off his life support on Friday, news agency Agence France-Presse reported.

""We decided to let him go. The doctors were in favour and we were as well,"" the victim's 18-year-old daughter, Marie Monguillot, told AFP.

Four men were detained and charged following the assault.

The attack occurred on Sunday around 7:15 p.m. on the 810 bus travelling to Biarritz after the bus driver checked the ticket of one of the men and asked all four to wear face masks, which are compulsory in French public transport, according to the public prosecutor's office.

On Wednesday, Monguillot's family organized a march in his honour, with all attendees wearing white.

Prime Minister Castex confirmed Monguillot's death on Twitter late Friday, writing that the case had ""touched our hearts.""

""The Republic recognizes him as an exemplary citizen and won't forget him. The law will punish the perpetrators of this despicable crime,"" he wrote, describing the attack as ""cowardly.""

French Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin also expressed his condolences to Monguillot's frends, family and colleagues.

""This heinous and cowardly act must not go unpunished. I'll be travelling to Bayonne tomorrow to make a point of safety in the city with state officials and meet with public transport drivers and unions,"" he wrote on Twitter.

The company Monguillot worked for, Keoilis, has boosted security for its employees, deploying guards on some of its bus services in the area.

The company held a minute's silence in its offices and on its transport networks on Wednesday in mourning for Monguillot.",[]

Gov. Denny Tamaki said he could say only that a ""few dozen"" cases had been found recently because the U.S. military asked that the exact figure not be released. The outbreaks occurred at Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, which is at the centre of a relocation dispute, and Camp Hansen, Tamaki said.

Local media, citing unnamed sources, said about 60 people had been infected.

""Okinawans are shocked by what we were told (by the U.S. military),"" Tamaki told a news conference. ""We now have strong doubts that the U.S. military has taken adequate disease prevention measures.""

Tamaki demanded transparency in the latest development and said he planned to request talks between the U.S. military and Okinawan officials. He said Okinawan officials also asked the Japanese government to demand that the U.S. provide details including the number of cases, seal off Futenma and Camp Hansen, and step up preventive measures on base.

Okinawan officials made similar requests to the U.S. military on Friday in order to address local residents' concerns, Tamaki said.

The Marines said in a statement Friday that the troops were taking additional protective measures to limit the spread of the coronavirus and were restricting off-base activities. The statement said measures are ""to protect our forces, our families, and the local community,"" without providing details on the infections.

The Marines did not immediately respond Saturday to an Associated Press inquiry about the latest outbreak.

Okinawa is home to more than half of about 50,000 American troops based in Japan under a bilateral security pact, and the residents are sensitive to U.S. base-related problems. Many Okinawans have long complained about pollution, noise and crime related to U.S. bases.

Okinawans also oppose a planned relocation of the Futenma air base from the current site in a densely populated area in the south to a less populated area on the east coast.

Local media reported that the Okinawan assembly adopted a resolution Friday protesting the U.S. military's lack of transparency about its outbreak on base.

Okinawa has about 150 cases of the coronavirus. In all, Japan has about 21,000 cases and 1,000 deaths, with Tokyo reporting more than 200 new cases for a third straight day Saturday.",[]

But it remained to be seen if Trump's most recent defiance of the conventions of his office to commute the sentence of political confidant Roger Stone, just four months before Election Day, would matter to voters grappling with a deadly COVID-19 surge and a national discourse on racial justice.

Shortly before heading out Saturday morning for his Virginia golf club, Trump made unfounded accusations against his political foes while taking another swipe at special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, which led to convictions for six Trump aides or advisers, including Stone, a larger-than-life political character who embraced his reputation as a dirty trickster.

“Roger Stone was targeted by an illegal Witch Hunt that never should have taken place,” Trump tweeted. “It is the other side that are criminals, including Biden and Obama, who spied on my campaign - AND GOT CAUGHT!”

Trump has long sought vengeance against the Russia investigation that helped define his first two years in office. And now that the coronavirus pandemic has imperiled his reelection chances by crushing the economy and sending his poll numbers sliding, he has taken to testing the limits of his power in order to reward loyalty and fire up his conservative base.

The decision to commute the sentence of the 67-year-old Stone, who was convicted of lying to help the president and set to report to prison on Tuesday, was loudly celebrated by some in Trump's orbit as a triumph over deep state prosecutorial overreach.

But the move announced Friday evening came over the advice of a number of the president's senior advisers, who warned him it would be politically self-destructive to reward Stone for his silence. Trump had long floated the idea of clemency for Stone - as well as for other associates in legal trouble, including his former national security adviser Michael Flynn and campaign chairman Paul Manafort - which itself was viewed by some as witness tampering by encouraging them not to co-operate with prosecutors.

The reaction from Democrats was swift and furious.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Saturday called it “an act of staggering corruption,” saying legislation is needed to prevent a president from pardoning or commuting the sentence of someone who acted to shield that president from prosecution. House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff called it “offensive to the rule of law and principles of justice.”

And Trump's Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, resurfaced a 2019 tweet in which he said that “Trump has surrounded himself with people who flout our laws - we shouldn't be surprised that he thinks he is above the law.” He added: “Still true.”

Republicans largely stayed silent on the issue Saturday, reluctant again to challenge a president who remains very popular with rank-and-file GOP voters. But one loud voice was Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, who was also the lone GOP senator to vote to convict the president during his impeachment trial earlier this year.

“Unprecedented, historic corruption: an American president commutes the sentence of a person convicted by a jury of lying to shield that very president,” Romney tweeted Saturday.

Sen. Pat Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican, signalled dismay with the commutation, saying in a statement Saturday that it was a mistake while calling the Russia investigation “badly flawed” and a source of “frustration.” He added that Stone had been duly convicted and that any objections to the conviction and trial “should be resolved through the appeals process.”

Mark Sanford, the former South Carolina congressman who made a short-lived primary challenge to Trump, wrote: “So much for the Republican Party being the party of law and order. Have we not lost our minds in not condemning as a party the president's corruption by Roger Stone.”

But most of Republicans who did speak out about the decision supported it. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Trump confidant, said Stone was convicted of a “nonviolent, first-time offence” and the president was “justified” in commuting the sentence.

Advisers who had previously talked Trump out of acting on Stone's behalf awaited the possible fallout, but they considered that Congress may be too consumed with virus relief packages while wondering if the electorate long ago tuned out any talk of the complicated Russia investigation, particularly during a pandemic.

But Trump likely could not afford more political damage. He is decidedly trailing Biden, per his campaign's own private admissions, and his effort to reboot his reelection bid took another blow when his planned rally Saturday night in New Hampshire was postponed. Campaign officials had deeply worried about low turnout. While an impending storm was blamed for the cancellation, sunny skies were seen in Portsmouth an hour before the president had been due to arrive.

By commuting Stone's sentence, Trump evoked other controversial acts of clemency by his predecessors, though his was done in the height of an election year.

President George H. W. Bush pardoned former Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger on Christmas Eve 1992, six weeks after he was defeated for reelection, prompting an uproar from Democrats and the independent counsel investigating the Iran-Contra affair. And President Bill Clinton waited until his final hours in office in 2001 to issue a raft of pardons, including of financier Marc Rich.

But one president who resisted the use of pardon was Richard Nixon, who privately discussed acts of clemency but never followed through even as many of his associates faced legal trouble during the Watergate scandal.

A few months after resigning, Nixon himself received a pardon from his successor Gerald Ford.

Stone, a former Nixon aide, told the AP he expressed his gratitude to Trump in a phone call.

“You know, he has a great sense of fairness,” Stone said. “We've been friends for many, many years, and he understands that I was targeted strictly for political reasons.”

852,ctvnews,http://ctvnews.ca/world/mueller-defends-russia-probe-says-stone-remains-a-felon-1.5020696,"Mueller defends Russia probe, says Stone remains a felon",['Eric Tucker'],2020-07-11 19:22:00-04:00,"WASHINGTON -- Former special counsel Robert Mueller sharply defended his investigation into ties between Russia and Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, writing in a newspaper opinion piece Saturday that the probe was of “paramount importance” and asserting that a Trump ally, Roger Stone, “remains a convicted felon, and rightly so” despite the president's decision to commute his prison sentence.

The op-ed in The Washington Post marked Mueller's first public statement on his investigation since his congressional appearance last July. It represented his firmest defence of the two-year probe whose results have come under attack and even been partially undone by the Trump administration, including the president's extraordinary move Friday evening to grant clemency to Stone just days before he was due to report to prison.

Mueller said that though he had intended for his 448-page report on the investigation to speak for itself, he felt compelled to “respond both to broad claims that our investigation was illegitimate and our motives were improper, and to specific claims that Roger Stone was a victim of our office.

“The Russia investigation was of paramount importance. Stone was prosecuted and convicted because he committed federal crimes. He remains a convicted felon, and rightly so,” Mueller wrote.

Mueller did not specify who was making the claims, but it appeared to be an obvious reference to Trump, who as recently as Saturday derided the investigation as this “whole political witch hunt and the Mueller scam.”

The mere publication of the op-ed was striking in itself for a former FBI director who was tight-lipped during the investigation, refusing to respond to attacks by the president or his allies or to even make public appearances explaining or justifying his work. In his first public statement after the conclusion of his investigation, Mueller had said that he had hoped his report would speak for itself. When he later testified to House lawmakers, he was similarly careful not to stray beyond the report's findings or offer new evidence.

But that buttoned-up approach created a void for others, including at the Justice Department, to place their own stamp on his work. Even before the report was released Attorney General William Barr issued a four-page summary document that Mueller privately complained did not adequately capture the gravity of his team's findings.

In the months since, Barr assigned a U.S. attorney to investigate the origins of the Russia probe, and the Justice Department moved to dismiss the criminal case against former Trump administration national security adviser Michael Flynn even though Flynn had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about contacts with the Russian ambassador during the presidential transition period.

The op-ed traced the basis for the Stone prosecution, with Mueller recounting how Stone had not only tampered with a witness but also lied repeatedly about his efforts to gain inside information about Democratic emails that Russian intelligence operatives stole and provided to WikiLeaks, which published them in the run-up to the election.

Those efforts, including his discussions with Trump campaign associates about them, cut to the heart of Mueller's mandate to determine whether anyone tied to the campaign co-ordinated with Russia in the hacking or disclosure of the stolen Democratic emails.

Stone was particularly critical to the investigation, Mueller writes, because he claimed inside knowledge about WikiLeaks' release of the stolen emails and because he communicated during the campaign with people known to be Russian intelligence officers. He also communicated with members of the Trump campaign about the timing of the WikiLeaks releases, something that he denied.

“We did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian government in its activities,” Mueller wrote. “The investigation did, however, establish that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome. It also established that the campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts.”

Stone was found guilty last fall of witness tampering, false statements and obstructing a congressional investigation into Russian election interference. He was sentenced in February to 40 months in prison and was due to surrender on Tuesday, until the president commuted his sentence.

“Roger Stone was treated horribly. Roger Stone was treated very unfairly,” Trump told reporters on Saturday.

He was one of six former Trump associates or advisers to be convicted in the Russia investigation. In total, the investigation produced charges against 34 individuals, including 25 Russians accused either of hacking into Democratic email accounts of engaging in a covert social media campaign to divide American public opinion ahead of the election.",[]

Last week, the island nation’s prime minister, Mia Mottley, revealed that her government is looking at introducing a 12-month “Barbados Welcome Stamp.”

Mottley said the stamp would give visitors the opportunity to “come and work from here overseas, digitally so, so that persons don’t need to remain in the countries in which they are.”

According to the Barbados Government Information Service website, Mottley said the COVID-19 pandemic had made short-term travel more difficult because of requirements for testing for the virus.

As an alternative, the prime minister proposed the idea of travellers coming to Barbados for a lengthier stay, during which, they could continue to work remotely.

“You don’t need to work in Europe, or the U.S. or Latin America if you can come here and work for a couple months at a time; go back and come back,” Mottley said during a speech at the official reopening of a restaurant in the St. Lawrence Gap neighbourhood on July 1.

Even though Barbados is mulling over a one-year “welcome stamp” to visitors, the Canadian government still advises against all non-essential travel outside of Canada until further notice.

“The governments of those destinations that have opened their borders to tourists could impose strict travel restrictions suddenly, should they experience an increase in cases of COVID-19,” an advisory on the Canadian government’s website reads. “International transportation options could be reduced significantly, making it difficult for you to return to Canada.”

Barbados is set to reopen its borders to international travellers on Sunday, July 12.

According to the U.S. embassy in Barbados, the resumption of commercial flights will begin on July 12 with Air Canada, which will run flights to and from the island nation on Thursdays and Sundays.

British Airways, Jet Blue, Virgin Atlantic, and American Airlines will also operate flights to Barbados on dates after July 12.

There will be a number of new health protocols for visitors arriving to the airport in Barbados, including a PCR test for coronavirus, mandatory face mask use, and health screening. Travellers from high and moderate-risk countries, including Canada, will be monitored for the onset of symptoms for seven days.

Even before the borders reopen, Barbados has already started relaxing COVID-19 pandemic measures and lifting curfews.

On June 15, the government lifted restrictions on open hours for beaches and parks. On July 1, physical distancing requirements were reduced to a one-metre distance and all curfew restrictions were cancelled.

According to the U.S. embassy in Barbados and data compiled by John Hopkins University, the Caribbean country currently has 98 confirmed cases of COVID-19.",[]

Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom are reopening Saturday, while Epcot and Disney's Hollywood Studios will follow four days later.

“It's the chance to come back and be in the magic,” said Diane Watkins, a preschool teacher from Helena, Alabama, who visits the park about eight times a year. “Hot or not, mask or not, we're just happy to be here. I feel like everybody here is in the same frame of mind. Everybody is just so excited to be here.”

Watkins said that when she and her 16-year-old daughter walked into the Magic Kingdom on Saturday morning, then saw all the cast members lined up and clapping on Main Street, she cried.

“It was very emotional,” she said.

The reopening comes as a huge surge of Floridians have tested positive for the new coronavirus in recent weeks. On Saturday, there were about 10,000 new cases reported, according to state statistics. Many cities and counties around the state have recently reinstated restrictions that had been lifted in May, when cases seemed to drop.

All of Disney's Orlando parks closed in mid-March in an effort to stop the virus's spread. Universal Orlando and SeaWorld Orlando closed around the same time but reopened several weeks ago after instituting similar rules to protect employees and customers from the virus.

Lori Lovell of Evansville, Indiana, strolled around Frontierland on Saturday morning with friends.

“I have missed coming here. It just feels really good to be back. This is where I've made so many memories. It's kind of our second home. Not being able to come here was hard.”

Disney's new rules include mandatory masks and social distancing. Visitors will need reservations to enter a park, and they won't be allowed to hop between parks. Both visitors and employees will receive temperature checks when they enter. Fireworks shows and parades have been suspended to prevent drawing too many people together.

Park-goers say that nearly everyone in sight wore masks on Saturday morning. Capacity is nowhere near where it is under normal circumstances, they said.

“I've been here on spring breaks where you can barely walk around. The walkways are very wide open,” said Lovell.

There were lots of hand sanitizer stations around, and people were respecting the physical distancing cues and guidelines. Since the park is at lower capacity, there was only a five-minute wait for the popular Buzz Lightyear ride - normally it's about 90 minutes, Watkins said.

Some attractions and dining areas aren't yet open. Another change: visitors can't hug and greet the costumed Disney characters. Instead, the characters are in “cavalcades,” or motorcades, as they make their way through the park.

Disney has been opening its parks back up around the globe for the past two months. In May, the company opened Disney Springs, a complex of shops, restaurants and entertainment venues in Lake Buena Vista.

But the couple came together for a special Friday edition of her ""Red Table Talk"" show on Facebook to share their side of the controversy surrounding her relationship with singer August Alsina.

According to the superstar couple they ""were going through a very difficult time"" and had broken up when Pinkett Smith started a romantic relationship with the 27-year-old singer.

During their ""Red Table Talk"" chat Smith pushed his wife to be clear about what her relationship had been with Alsina.

""I got into an entanglement with August,"" Pinkett Smith said.

In a recent interview with radio host Angela Yee, Alsina said he had been involved in a romantic relationship with Pinkett Smith, who has been married to Smith since 1997.

""I actually sat down with Will and had a conversation,"" Alsina said during the interview. ""Due to the transformation from their marriage to (a) life partnership that they have spoken on several times, and not involving romanticism, he gave me his blessing.""

Alsina said he had lost money and relationships because of rumours he had been involved with Pinkett Smith, 48.

The actress and her 51-year-old husband have long been the subject of rumours that they have an open marriage.

The couple has denied this, but says their marriage is not traditional and that they have a ""life partnership.""

On Friday's episode the pair said they felt compelled to speak out because there was so much speculation after Alsina's interview.

""We specifically never said anything,"" Will Smith said. ""Coming to the table was like we just felt like it got to the point where you gotta say something.""

Pinkett Smith said she began a friendship with Alsina about four and a half years ago and that became more once she and her husband hit a rough patch.

She also said she wanted to clear up Alsina having said her husband had given permission for the affair, though she added that she understood why the young singer may have believed that to be the case.

""The only person that can give permission in that particular circumstance is myself,"" she said. ""I could actually see how he would perceive it as permission because we were separated amicably and I think he also wanted to make it clear that he's also not a homewrecker. Which he's not.""

The actress said she was ""in a lot of pain"" and ""broken"" during the relationship.

She and Will tried ""everything we could to get away from each other only to realize that wasn't possible.""

Pinkett Smith said her relationship with Alsina ended, the Smiths reconciled, and she said she has not spoken to the singer in years.

She said she and her husband have now gotten to a place of ""unconditional love.""

Smith said he had been unsure as to whether he would ever speak to Pinkett Smith again when they were having problems, but he reminded her of their commitment.

The combination of forced closures, decreased consumer spending and limited rent relief measures has left some retailers unable to maintain their existing operations.

Here is a look at some of the major retail closures announced in Canada in 2020, both before and during the pandemic.

Scholar’s Choice: The educational toys and teaching materials retailer announced on July 10 it was closing 13 stores across the country. Only three stores will remain open – London, Ont., Winnipeg and Moncton – and act as regional sales and distribution centres. Scholar’s Choice also filed for creditor protection through a notice of intention to propose a reorganization plan to restructure the company.

DavidsTea: The Montreal-based beverage retailer announced on July 9 that it was closing 82 of its locations in Canada and all 42 of its U.S. stores to focus more on its e-commerce business and supplying grocery stores and pharmacies. The company, which also filed for creditor protection, said it was closing shops that were unprofitable and that it hoped to negotiate more favourable lease terms for the 100 remaining locations in Canada. The company said COVID-19 pandemic had worsened an already challenging retail market.

Microsoft: The technology company revealed on June 26 that it would be closing nearly all of its 83 physical stores around the world as part of a “strategic change” for its retail business. Microsoft has seven stores in Canada, which will all be closing. Only four locations in London, New York City, Sydney, and Redmond, Wash. will remain as “reimagined” physical spaces.

GNC: Health and nutrition retailer GNC announced June 23 that it has filed for bankruptcy in the U.S. and says it will close at least 29 stores in Canada as part of its restructuring.

The Children's Place: Approximately 200 locations of child clothing store The Children's Place will close this year and 100 more next year in Canada and the U.S., company executives said June 11 on an earnings call.

Starbucks: Filings with U.S. regulators dated June 10 show that Starbucks plans to close 200 Canadian locations as part of a new two-year business plan.

Sail: Outdoor retailer Sail said June 4 that it will close four stores in Quebec and two in Ontario, leaving it with a total of 12 outlets remaining open in the two provinces.

Bestseller Canada: The company that operates Jack & Jones and Vero Moda filed for creditor protection June 2. Retail Insider reported in February that the Canadian subsidiary of the Danish company was shutting five of its Bestseller branded stores. It reported this month that sources indicated all nine Vero Moda locations would be closed and 13 of the 51 Jack and Jones stores would also close.

Thyme Maternity and Addition Elle: Financial woes at Reitmans left the company seeking creditor protection and announcing plans to close all stores under its Thyme Maternity and Addition Elle banners, as was announced June 1.

Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works: L Brands announced May 20 that it will close 13 of the 38 Victoria's Secret stores in Canada, as well as one Bath & Body Works location, as part of a larger restructuring that also affects the company's American operations.

Army & Navy: The 101-year-old Western Canadian department store chain announced in May that it was closing its doors permanently. CEO Jacqui Cohen cited the “unsurmountable” challenges caused by the pandemic. Touted as the country’s first discount department store, the company said it would be closing its five remaining locations in Vancouver, New Westminster, B.C., Langley, B.C., Calgary and Edmonton.

Henry’s: Cranbrook Glen Enterprises Ltd, the parent company of the Toronto-based camera and accessories chain, filed a NOI (Notice of Intention) in May. The company said it plans to close seven of its 29 store locations once COVID-19-related measures were loosened.

Aldo: Montreal-based The Aldo Group said May 7 that it was entering creditor protection. Although the footwear retailer said it will gradually reopen its stores as public health guidelines permit, legal filings reportedly state that an unspecified number of stores are not expected to ever reopen.

Ronsons: The Vancouver-based shoe retailer announced on April 8 that it was in receivership and closing its 18 stores, all of which are located in British Columbia. The company was founded 32 years ago by CEO Tony Aronson and his father.

Pier 1: Home decor chain Pier 1 announced Feb. 17 that it will close all of its stores in Canada, as the retailer began bankruptcy proceedings in the United States.

Carlton Cards and Papyrus: On Jan. 22, the owner of greeting card retailers including Carlton Cards and Papyrus announced it was closing all of its stores in North America, including 76 Canadian locations.

Bench: The owner of apparel store Bench's Canadian operations confirmed to BNN Bloomberg on Jan. 22 that all 24 locations will be closed.

Ten Thousand Villages: On Jan. 21, fair-trade retailer Ten Thousand Villages announced its plans to shutter many of its stores.

Bose: U.S.-based audio equipment retailer Bose will shutter its 24 remaining Canadian stores as part of the chain’s closure of 119 locations around the world, according to online publication Retail Insider reported in early January.

Things Engraved: On Jan. 14, the head of Kitchener, Ont.-based retailer Things Engraved announced plans to shut all of its 73 stores. CEO Shawn Black told CTVNews.ca the company had been unprofitable for several years.

Links of London: Luxury brand Links of London had planned a major Canadian expansion as recently as 2016, but only ever opened five stores in the country and announced Jan. 10 that all stores will be closed, according to Retail Insider.

He also said the couple's tempestuous marriage broke down for good after an incident in which he accused Heard or one of her friends of defecating in the couple's bed.

He said he thought it was an oddly fitting end to the relationship.

Depp was concluding almost four days of evidence in his libel case against a British tabloid newspaper that accused him of physically abusing Heard.

The Hollywood star is suing News Group Newspapers, publisher of The Sun, and the paper's executive editor, Dan Wootton, over an April 2018 article that called him a ""wife-beater.""

In the High Court witness box, Depp has described a volatile relationship with Heard that descended into screaming matches which sometimes turned physical.

But he has strongly denied hitting Heard and accused her of compiling a dossier of fake claims against him as an ""insurance policy.""

Depp, 57, and Heard, 34, met on the set of the 2011 comedy ""The Rum Diary"" and married in Los Angeles in February 2015.

Heard, a model and actress, filed for divorce the following year and obtained a restraining order against Depp on the grounds of domestic abuse.

The divorce was finalized in 2017.

The Sun's defence relies on a total of 14 allegations by Heard of Depp's violence between 2013 and 2016, in settings including his private island in the Bahamas, a rented house in Australia and a private jet.

He strongly denies all of them.",[]

859,ctvnews,http://ctvnews.ca/sports/nhl-nhlpa-announce-toronto-edmonton-as-hubs-and-cba-extension-1.5019889,"NHL/NHLPA announce Toronto, Edmonton as hubs, and CBA extension",['Joshua Clipperton'],2020-07-10 19:38:00-04:00,"TORONTO -- The NHL remains on course to resume its pandemic-delayed season north of the 49th parallel later this summer, and now has the labour peace needed to ride out the unprecedented economic storm brought on by COVID-19.

The league and NHL Players' Association announced Friday the return-to-play protocols - featuring Toronto and Edmonton as hub cities - and a four-year extension to the current collective bargaining agreement have been ratified.

The NHL board of governors and the union's full membership gave the documents, which were tied together in an all-or-nothing bundle, the thumbs up in separate votes.

“It was pretty civil,” Vancouver Canucks captain Bo Horvat said of negotiations on the deal that was tentatively agreed to Monday. “We're happy to get things going.”

Bringing the hubs to Canada, where coronavirus infection rates are largely under control, proved to be the logical choice after a significant spike in cases across the United States in recent weeks.

“While we have all worked very hard to try to address the risks of COVID-19, we know that health and safety are and will continue to be our priorities,” NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said in a statement. “We know that all of our fans are excited about our return to the ice.”

Training camps for the 24 teams primed to compete in the league's restart to a 2019-20 campaign that was suspended March 12 are scheduled to begin Monday - also the deadline for players to opt out of participating with no penalty - in each franchise's home market.

The plan will then see Eastern Conference clubs report to Toronto on July 26, while those from the Western Conference head to Edmonton before the games resume Aug. 1. The conference finals and Stanley Cup will be held in Edmonton as part of a first-of-its-kind NHL Final Four that could stretch all the way to Oct. 4 and result in next season being pushed into December or early January.

Once in Canada's largest city and Alberta's capital, players are set to be kept away from the general public in so-called “bubbles” that include strict health measures, daily testing, and mostly confine teams to hotels and empty arenas.

The extension of the current CBA, which was slated to expire in September 2022 and now runs through at least the 2025-26 season, provides both players and owners clarity on a number of challenging financial realities caused by COVID-19.

It also give the green light for negotiations with the International Olympic Committee and the International Ice Hockey Federation on participation at the 2022 and 2026 Winter Games. The NHL skipped the 2018 Olympics after taking part in five straight between 1998 and 2014.

The salary cap's upper limit will remain at US$81.5 million in 2020-21 and stay there until hockey-related revenue returns to $4.8 billion - this season's projected total prior to the pandemic. Players have agreed to defer 10 per cent of next year's salaries, and have owners pay that back over three consecutive seasons starting in 2022-23.

“This agreement is a meaningful step forward for the players and owners, and for our game, in a difficult and uncertain time,” NHLPA executive director Don Fehr said. “We are pleased to be able to bring NHL hockey back.”

Escrow payments, a consistent thorn in the side of players that guarantees a 50/50 split of HRR with owners, will be capped at 20 per cent in 2020-21, and decrease throughout the deal. If teams are still owed money following the 2025-26 campaign, the CBA will be extended another season.

The agreement marks the first time in Bettman's 27-year tenure as commissioner the NHL has bridged two CBAs without a work stoppage. Both the 1994-95 and 2012-13 seasons were cut to 48 games because of lockouts, while the 2004-05 campaign was cancelled.

Alberta Premier Jason Kenney was the most outspoken politician with regards to having his province host one of the hubs, pointing to a low infection rate and Edmonton's facilities.

He also penned a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in hopes of securing a waiver for the NHL when it came to Canada's mandatory 14-day quarantine for anyone arriving in the country. The federal government approved the league's proposal of a cohort quarantine last month, granting an exception that paved the way for Toronto and Edmonton to get the nod as hubs.

Speaking outside Rogers Place, Kenney said Friday's news will create jobs and millions of dollars in economic activity.

“The Stanley Cup is coming back to Edmonton, to Alberta,” Kenney said in a video posted to Twitter as he stood next to a statue of Wayne Gretzky. “We are going to get an unbelievable amount of free advertising across North America and around the world that will set us up well for the future relaunch of our tourism industry when travel comes back post-COVID.”

The Cup was last awarded in Edmonton when Gretzky hoisted it over his head for a fourth and final time on May 26, 1988.

Each team will be permitted to bring a maximum of 52 people into the bubbles, including a maximum of 31 players.

Meanwhile, it was also announced the NHL draft lottery's second phase has been tabbed for Aug. 10. The eight losing teams from the qualifying round will have an equal shot at the first pick in the draft, which is tentatively scheduled for Oct. 9-10.

Much like Kenney, Ontario Premier Doug Ford and Toronto Mayor John Tory supported their city's hub potential.

“There is no better place for the NHL season to continue,” Tory said. “We will make sure we put on a great show for the game of hockey ... while following all proper health and safety protocols.”

Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist at Toronto General Hospital, said choosing to hold the NHL's restart in Canada reduces the overall risk, but it's far from a fool-proof endeavour.

“We'd be blind to think that there isn't COVID-19 in Canada, there's just significantly less of it here compared to parts of the U.S.,” he said. “Everyone has to pay close attention to COVID-19 because even with the best laid plans, there still can be small weaknesses that might be exploited by this virus.”

Vancouver was the other Canadian city originally in the running to host, along with seven American markets, before the provincial government expressed concerns about the NHL's health and safety protocols.

Ford was asked prior to Friday's announcement why the plan worked for his province when it didn't for British Columbia.

“They have very stringent rules and regulations for their players,” Ford said of the NHL. “When they told me (players are) getting tested every single day, I'm no medical professional, but I don't think they need testing every day.”

The 24-team format - which includes every Canadian franchise, save for Ottawa - will see the top-4 clubs from both the East and West play mini-tournaments to determine playoff seeding, while the other 16 will battle in a never-before-seen qualifying round.

Boston, Tampa Bay, Washington and Philadelphia are set to compete for the No. 1 slot in the East, while defending champions St. Louis, Colorado, Vegas and Dallas will do the same out West.

The East's best-of-five qualifying series include Pittsburgh vs. Montreal, Carolina vs. New York Rangers, New York Islanders vs. Florida and Toronto vs. Columbus. In the West, the matchups are Edmonton vs. Chicago, Nashville vs. Arizona, Vancouver vs. Minnesota and Calgary vs. Winnipeg.

In all, there will be as many as 52 games played over the first nine days before the teams get a break on Aug. 10.

The four winners of the best-of-five series in each conference will then be pitted against the top-4 seeds to fill out the usual 16-team playoff bracket.

There could, however, still be choppy waters before the 2019-20 season can actually resume.

Players won't be quarantined during training camp, but instead asked to practise physical distancing when not at the rink in hopes isolation and testing will be enough to avoid any outbreaks.

Of the 396 NHLers tested at team facilities between June 8 and Monday during voluntary workouts, 23 results came back positive. The league said it's also aware of 12 other positive tests for players not taking part in those optional sessions.

The Stanley Cup has been awarded every year since 1893, except for 1919 because of the Spanish flu outbreak and in 2005 when the lockout scratched the entire season.

There's now a firm plan in place to - hopefully - see it handed out this fall.

860,ctvnews,http://ctvnews.ca/world/trump-lags-biden-on-people-of-colour-in-top-campaign-ranks-1.5020347,Trump lags Biden on people of colour in top campaign ranks,['Darlene Superville'],2020-07-11 12:01:00-04:00,"WASHINGTON -- Amid a summer of racial unrest and calls for more diversity in leadership, President Donald Trump lags Democratic rival Joe Biden in the percentage of people of colour on their campaign staffs, according to data the campaigns provided to The Associated Press.

Twenty-five per cent of the Republican president's senior staff are nonwhite, compared to 36% of Biden's senior staff. Biden's overall campaign team is 35% nonwhite; Trump's campaign did not provide a comparable number.

And neither campaign provided racial breakdowns for their nonwhite staff, nor the total number of staffers who are on their payrolls, including senior staff.

Advocates for minority groups say staff diversity is necessary to ensure political candidates hear a full range of voices and viewpoints to help them understand the concerns of various communities and interest groups -- especially at a time when racial injustice is front and centre in the national conversation. And while Biden has an edge on Trump, there is plenty more to be done in presidential campaigns overall.

Jennifer Lawless, commonwealth professor of politics at the University of Virginia, said ""there are still a lot of milestones that haven't been hit"" by political campaigns, such as a Black man or woman directing -- and winning -- a presidential campaign. And she said having diverse staff at lower levels in campaigns can help increase the pool of future managers, finance chairs and others.

""It's all part of the pipeline,"" Lawless said.

Trump's campaign makeup got a double-take in June when Vice-President Mike Pence tweeted -- and later deleted -- a photo from his visit to campaign headquarters. The photo at first drew attention for the lack of social distancing and use of face masks among the staff. But it also was notable for the sea of mostly white faces.

Eric Rodriguez, senior vice-president of policy and advocacy at UnidosUS, said the Biden team had more Latinos in senior positions than Trump.

""You need people from those communities to be able to make those connections,"" said Rodriguez, whose organization used to be called the National Council of La Raza.

The rival campaigns fared better -- and are about even --- on employing women, with females filling more than half of all jobs overall, and more than half of all senior positions.

The president's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, who is white, former White House aide Mercedes Schlapp, who is Cuban American, and Katrina Pierson, who is Black and worked on Trump's 2016 campaign, are among the highest-profile senior female staffers working to help reelect him.

Others include former Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle, now a top campaign fundraiser and the girlfriend of Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., and Hannah Castillo, the campaign's coalitions director. Guilfoyle's late mother was from Puerto Rico. Castillo is Mexican American.

Biden senior adviser Symone Sanders, who is Black, is the campaign's highest-ranking person of colour and, at 30, is the youngest member of his inner circle. The candidate also recently brought on several African Americans who worked for President Barack Obama, including Karine Jean-Pierre, formerly an NBC News and MSNBC political analyst.

Jamal Brown, a spokesperson for Biden, said the former vice-president's campaign reflects the ""diversity, breadth and promise of America.""

""He believes our democracy is strongest when people see themselves reflected in their government,"" added Brown, who is Black.

The killing in May of George Floyd, who was Black, by a white Minneapolis police officer sparked nationwide protests against racial injustice and calls for greater minority representation across the board in society that brought fresh scrutiny to the presidential campaigns.

Biden had faced questions earlier in the campaign about the lack of diversity on his staff. Along with adding more people of colour to his campaign, Biden has promised an administration that ""looks like America"" if he is elected on Nov. 3.

The U.S. population is about 60% white, 19% Latino and 13% Black, according to Census Bureau estimates.

Trump has not made a similar pledge about a potential second term. His campaign declined to discuss minority representation on the campaign staff.

Four women currently serve in Trump's Cabinet: CIA Director Gina Haspel and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, both of whom are white; Jovita Carranza, a Latina who leads the Small Business Administration; and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, who was born in Taiwan.

Housing Secretary Ben Carson is the only Black member of the Cabinet.

Rodriguez summed up the Biden campaign strategy as focused on winning support from a diverse pool of voters, especially in battleground states where large numbers of Latino and Black voters live. He characterized Trump's strategy as being ""really all about the base"" and attempting to replicate his successful 2016 campaign playbook, which used immigration as a wedge issue.

""The strategy is to run on racial division,"" Rodriguez said of the president, who has begun to use the racial tensions that surfaced after Floyd's killing in his reelection pitch.

Still, Trump and his campaign make regular appeals to Black and Latino voters.

The president regularly cites employment gains for these groups before the coronavirus pandemic struck, and he continues to showcase legislation he signed to overhaul criminal sentencing procedures and provide permanent funding for historically Black colleges and universities.

This week, Trump was surrounded by Latino American leaders as he announced a new advisory commission to help Hispanic Americans with economic and educational opportunities.

But the event also highlighted how far Trump has to go in winning support from people of colour. Critics of Trump's record with Hispanics called for a boycott of the Goya food company after its president praised Trump at the event.

The president does have strong support among some people of Cuban and Venezuelan descent, though, because of his tough stance against authoritarian leaders in those countries.

The Biden campaign said LGBTQ staff and staff of colour hold such positions as senior advisers, deputy campaign managers, national coalitions director, chief financial officer, chief operating officer and national press secretary, among others.

Trump's campaign defined its senior staff as ""senior leaders who meet regularly to make decisions. People with authority,"" and did not elaborate.",[]
861,ctvnews,http://ctvnews.ca/world/video-calls-separate-bedrooms-bolsonaro-s-first-covid-week-1.5020444,"Video calls, separate bedrooms: Bolsonaro's first COVID week",['Daniel Carvalho'],2020-07-11 14:44:00-04:00,"BRASILIA, BRAZIL -- After months in which Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro downplayed COVID-19 by flouting social distancing recommendations and mostly shunning masks, both coronavirus precautions became part of his cloistered life this week at the official residence in capital Brasilia.

Bolsonaro, 65, announced on Tuesday that he tested positive for the virus and had experienced fever, aches and malaise. He scrapped a trip he had planned to northeastern Piaui state, and all his meetings for the week were converted to video calls.

One was with former congressman Roberto Jefferson, president of the conservative PTB party. Jefferson told The Associated Press that he went to the presidential Planalto Palace and sat in front of a large television where he could see Bolsonaro in a makeshift office at his residence.

""I found the president well, flushed, willing. In very good health,"" Jefferson said Saturday. ""I only saw him cough once, when I made a joke.""

Since his diagnosis, Bolsonaro has held virtual meetings almost every day with Jorge Oliveira, secretary-general of government, to sign official documents. According to Oliveira's office, a protocol was created so work could be carried out digitally.

This was also how Bolsonaro interviewed candidates to head the education ministry, he said on Facebook on Thursday. The following day, he named to the post Milton Ribeiro, a former deputy dean of Mackenzie University in Sao Paulo who preaches at a Presbyterian church in Santos, outside the metropolis.

Only a few aides who were previously infected by the new coronavirus could get close to Bolsonaro during the week, one of them said on Tuesday. The person declined to be named, citing lack of authorization to speak with journalists. Bolsonaro also spent some time in the afternoons in front of the palace with photojournalists 400 yards away, on the other side of a garden. He had met his supporters by that garden until his diagnosis, but no longer.

The new routine marks a stark change for Bolsonaro, who spent months attending rallies with his fans, heading out to bakeries and food trucks to mix and mingle. He sometimes declined to wear a mask. He has scoffed at the restrictions mayors and governors implemented to contain the spread of the virus, arguing their economic impacts would cause more suffering than the virus, which he repeatedly called ""a little flu.""

Bolsonaro took hydroxychloroquine pills for five days, Monday through Friday, according to a member of the presidential medical team who asked to not be identified, citing patient confidentiality and because the person isn't authorized to speak publicly. The drug has no proven effect on the treatment of COVID-19 and can cause side effects such as cardiac arrhythmia, according to medical studies. As a result, Bolsonaro was subjected to electrocardiograms and blood tests, the person said.

Brazil's presidential press office said in a statement that the president has experienced no medical problems with his treatment.

The aide who spoke on condition of anonymity said Bolsonaro slept in a different bedroom to keep the first lady, Michelle Bolsonaro, safe. He lives with her, his daughter and step-daughter.

On Saturday, the first lady shared a photo of her COVID-19 test results showing she was not infected.

""My daughters and I tested negative for COVID-19,"" she wrote in the post on her verified Instagram account. ""I appreciate the prayers.""

On Thursday, Jair Bolsonaro held his weekly live broadcast on Facebook. This time, he was not accompanied by a minister or a sign language interpreter, as usual. Despite saying he felt well, he said he should still be isolated next week, so as to avoid contaminating anyone.

""I'm sorry I can't interact with you here. Not even next week will it be possible, because I think I will not yet be completely free of the virus, so I will not have anyone on my side here,"" Bolsonaro said on the broadcast.

During the broadcast, he wasn't wearing a mask. But the aide said Bolsonaro now regularly wears the equipment to protect both his family and the more than 100 employees who work at the residence.",[]

The unanimous decision by the Chama cha Mapinduzi party to back Magufuli came as no surprise.

The president, nicknamed ""The Bulldozer"" for his relentless work ethic and populist approach, has unsettled critics and some in the international community as his government clamps down on opposition gatherings, arrests opposition leaders and punishes dissent.

His administration's approach to the coronavirus pandemic -- not announcing case numbers since April, questioning face masks and declaring COVID-19 defeated -- has caused further alarm.

Former President Ali Hassan Mwinyi and members of the ruling party have urged Magufuli to try to stay in power after 2025 despite Tanzania's two-term limit. But he has said he won't seek an extension after two terms.

Opposition parties have not declared their official candidate, and they have expressed skepticism with the electoral commission, demanding amendments to ensure the upcoming vote is free and fair.

Ruling party secretary-general Bashiru Ali told the gathering that the National Executive Committee nominated Magufuli because of his commitment to social and economic development and fighting corruption.

Magufuli said he was surprised by the support. ""I never imagined I could get 100%,"" he said. ""This, however, should not mean winning the election by 100% as we have more work to do as a party.""",[]

""We're presuming that an accident happened and we're presuming she drowned in the lake,"" Deputy Chris Dyer said at a news conference Thursday.

Search and rescue efforts for the actress have now shifted to a recovery operation, Dyer said.

""The goal is still to bring Miss Rivera home to her family,"" he said.

Rivera, 33, vanished from Lake Piru on Wednesday evening. She went to the lake that afternoon and rented a pontoon boat with her 4-year-old son, according to authorities.

Dyer said Thursday that the boat was overdue for return around 4 p.m. local time. A rental employee found the boat on the north end of Lake Piru.

Rivera's son was on the boat, but she was nowhere to be found, Dyer said. One life jacket was found on the boat and the boy was wearing another. Investigators found Rivera's purse and her identification, but no other clues on the boat.

Search efforts began immediately and continued until about 10 p.m. Wednesday. The search resumed Thursday morning and will continue until sunset and resume at daybreak if necessary, the sheriff's office said.

Video from the dock shows Rivera and her son as the only two people getting on the boat, Ventura County Sheriff's Sgt. Kevin Donoghue said at a separate news conference.

Detectives have spoken to Rivera's son and as a result of that conversation do not believe Rivera made it to shore, he said.

The boat was not anchored, and was not near the shore when found, the sheriff's office said. The area in which it was found is approximately 30 feet deep.

The lake has very low visibility with numerous plants and trees in the search area, making it unsafe for divers and a more complicated search, according to Donoghue.

""If the body is entangled in something beneath the water, it may never come back up,"" Donoghue said.

Another spokesman for the Ventura County Sheriff's Office, Capt. Eric Buschow, previously said that the child and his mother went swimming and that she did not get back on the boat.

The child is healthy and with family, Dyer said Thursday morning. CNN has reached out to Rivera's representatives for more details.

Rivera's son is ""doing as well as can be expected,"" according to Donoghue. ""Our hearts and our prayers and thoughts go out to the Rivera family. This is a terrible tragedy for all of them and we hope to bring closure for that family,"" he said.

The lake has been closed during the operation, which involves more than 100 people, Donoghue said.

Specialized dive teams from the nearby counties of Tulare, San Luis Obispo, and Los Angeles are also searching the lake. Others are using helicopters, boats and personal watercraft to look for clues.

Searchers are using sonar and other technology to assist in the recovery. For now, the search is focused on the north end of the lake.

""We don't think it would have traveled the whole distance of the lake,"" Donoghue said, explaining that they are looking where the boat was initially found and working their way outward from there.

""I think it's too early to say what happened here. We're still investigating and just still trying to find out what happened,"" he said, noting that Rivera had been to this lake before.

Rivera played Santana Lopez on the Fox show for six years from 2009, and appeared in nearly every episode of the musical-comedy-drama. She was also on the CBS sitcom ""The Royal Family"" and in the comedy film ""The Master of Disguise.""

Fellow celebrities, including her ""Glee"" co-star Harry Shum Jr., shared their concern on social media.

Actress Jackée Harry tweeted a scene she shared with Rivera on ""The Royal Family,"" which was Rivera's first acting job at the age of 4.

Zack Teperman, who described himself as Rivera's former publicist, said he was shocked by the news of her disappearance.

""I still can't believe what I'm hearing and hoping it isn't true,"" he posted on social media. ""I'm just sad. Naya Rivera was one of the first people I had the honor of working with back in 2009 when I got into public relations and moved to Hollywood.

""We're targeting August, maybe early September,"" he said in a recent interview.

""I was even shocked when (the doctor) told me. I met him last week and I asked him for a ballpark time frame. And he said August, and I said 'Oh, OK.' I wasn't quite ready for that.""

Thompson moved to Ontario from British Columbia in April to prepare for the surgery in London. It involves medical and psychological tests, as well as finding a donor.

If things go as planned, Thompson will be Canada's first double-hand transplant patient.

Thompson had all of his limbs amputated after contracting bacterial meningitis and septic shock in 2015.

He left work early one day in May, after feeling like he was coming down with the flu, and decided to sleep it off. A few hours later, he woke up to get a drink of water.

""But when I stood up my feet were like on fire. I could barely walk. I made it downstairs to where my wife Rita was watching TV. And that's pretty well the last thing I remember. I just collapsed on the floor.""

He woke up six weeks later in intensive care, confronted with the choice of dying in palliative care or amputation.

""If I wanted to survive, I would need all four limbs amputated,"" he said.

""In the end, the will to live is stronger than anything else.""

After 8 1/2 hours of surgery, doctors had amputated his limbs.

""That was a difficult time, obviously, because you know, you wake up as a different person. You look down and all you see is bandages ... where your hands used to be or where your legs and feet used to be,"" he said.

""The first thing that came to my mind was, what did I just do?""

After learning about hand transplants two years ago, Thompson met with a team of doctors in Ontario to assess whether he would make a suitable candidate.

""It's life changing,"" he said.

""Being able to shake someone's hand, being able to pick up a cup of coffee with one hand, write your name with a pen, open a door, you know, just the things that we take for granted every day.""

Dr. Steven McCabe, who performed Canada's first hand transplant, may participate in the surgery. He is a hand surgeon at Toronto Western Hospital and an associate professor at the University of Toronto.

The surgery can take 10 to 12 hours with four teams of surgeons. Each team consists of six to 10 people.

While operating on both hands makes the surgery logistically harder because it involves more people, McCabe said it is ""logical"" to do the two transplants at the same time.

""When you transplant, you're introducing this different tissue,"" he explained. ""And the theory behind that is that you don't want to introduce two different donor tissues.""

A person who undergoes a transplant has to take immunosuppressants, so the body doesn't reject the new organ or limb, and it's easier when surgery is done all at once, he said.

""So if you transplanted one limb, and then three months or a year later, the other one, you'd have to go through that again. The idea is to get that all over with one donor.""

But there's also another reason.

""Having one hand when you have none is a huge benefit,"" McCabe said.

""But if you're going to have that type of surgery, and it seems logical to transplant both hands, part of the sense of wholeness is restored. It seems to be very important for patients.""

There are risks associated with the surgery, including infections and the possibility of blood loss. But McCabe said the benefits outweigh the risks, and limb transplants have low rejection rates.

After the surgery, transplant patients face a long recovery, he added.

""If you transplant the limb near the elbow, it will take a few months for the muscles to start to work again, and maybe up to a year or more for the nerves to get down to the fingers to have some feeling,"" McCabe said. ""So, I think we would say, you can't judge whether it's really helped or not for at least a couple years.""

Thompson said unlike most organ transplants, a hand transplant is visible.

""It's physically there. So getting over the mental challenge is going to be the hardest one, because you know they belonged to someone else at one point and now they're on your body,"" Thompson said.

""You have to look at it as a gift ... (the donor) family has decided to give you this gift. And it's a gift I'm not going to waste.""

“That revelation raises need for the police to take a look at it,” Conservative MP and ethics critic Michael Barrett said during a press conference on Friday.

The Conservatives are suggesting there could be criminal implications, but they aren’t sure and want police to investigate. The party has published an “open letter” to RCMP Commissioner Brenda Lucki asking the national police force to determine whether the matter runs afoul of the Criminal Code section on government fraud.

“On the question of if it is criminal, that's for the RCMP to decide,” said Barrett, who authored the letter.

“Federal government proactive disclosures show that the Canada Student Service Grant is not the beginning of WE Charity’s dealings with the federal government. Government records confirm that, since 2017, WE Charity has received seven grants or contributions totalling about $5.2 million, plus another five contracts,” writes Barrett.

“I encourage the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to investigate the possibility of criminal offences arising from these disturbing facts. You and the very able members of the national police force possess the necessary skills, expertise and tools to get to the bottom of this,” he writes.

Bloc Quebecois Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet has called on the prime minister to ""step aside"" until the completion of the ethics commissioner investigation that is already underway, though the Conservatives are stopping short of demanding the same.

Barrett said he wants to wait and see whether a criminal investigation is launched.

“We're not looking to bring down the government on this issue. We're looking to get the truth,” he said.

The Conservatives are calling for all documents related to the contract to be made public, and already MPs have taken steps to dig into the issue using the parliamentary tools available to them, launching two separate studies into the sole-sourced contract with the intent, in part, of calling cabinet ministers to testify.

In an interview on CTV News Channel, Conservative MP and leadership candidate Erin O’Toole said he agrees with his caucus colleagues that “an examination by law enforcement is warranted.”

Fellow leadership hopeful Peter MacKay sent an email to supporters saying he was “deeply troubled” by the story and said Trudeau’s conduct is “part of a pattern as a serial ethical offender,” and potentially “far more” than an ethics breach. He said he supports the police looking into the matter.

“Justin Trudeau has yet to display any sense of contrition, guilt or humility in the face of all of the morally questionable and outright offensive actions he has committed throughout his adult and political life. The list is long, and it's growing,” he said.

WE CHARITY PAID PM'S FAMILY

On Friday, CTV News confirmed that WE Charity paid Trudeau’s mother Margaret Trudeau’s expenses to send her to Kenya in July 2019 to appear at the opening of “WE College.” The costs associated with the trip are estimated at $10,000. Former prime minister Kim Campbell was also in attendance.

On Thursday, WE Charity revealed that Trudeau's mother, Margaret Trudeau, spoke at approximately 28 events and was paid $250,000 in speaking honorariums between 2016 and 2020. The prime minister’s brother, Alexandre Trudeau, spoke at eight events from 2017 to 2018 and was paid a total of approximately $32,000.

More than $60,000 of that money, which WE Charity said is usually administered by corporate sponsors, was paid directly to Margaret Trudeau by the charity as the result of what WE Charity referred to as an ""error"" in billing and payment that was discovered through an “internal review.”

In addition to this, Trudeau's wife, Sophie Gregoire Trudeau — who is an ambassador with the organization and hosts a mental health podcast under its name — received a ""one-time speaking honorarium"" of $1,400 for participating in a youth event in 2012, before Trudeau became leader of the Liberal Party.

The organization said all her other time spent participating in WE events and hosting a podcast series for the charity was ""donated.""

WE Charity said neither they nor ME to WE Social Enterprise have ever paid Justin Trudeau — who has spoken at a number of WE events — for any speeches or other matters.

In an emailed statement sent Thursday, Chantal Gagnon, a spokesperson for the Prime Minister's Office, said Trudeau's relatives ""engage with a variety of organizations and support many personal causes on their own accord.""

Facing questions about what he knew as a member at the cabinet table, Industry Minister Navdeep Bains restated the government position that the advice to go ahead with WE Charities came from the public service.

“Clearly we are going in a different direction right now, but make no mistake, our government and our prime minister are absolutely committed to supporting students,” Bains said.

ETHICS PROBE UNDERWAY

Prior to the family payments being confirmed, Trudeau had already become the subject of an ethics investigation over the matter. The ethics commissioner is investigating a potential conflict of interest over his government's now-cancelled decision to have WE Charity manage a $900-million federal program to set up placements and administer grants to students and new graduates for their volunteer work this summer.

""The Canada Student Service Grant program is about giving young people opportunities to contribute to their communities, not about benefits to anyone else,"" said the PMO in Thursday’s statement.

With the program halted, thousands of students are now in limbo without summer jobs and, for now, no chance for volunteer grants to help cover costs like fall tuition.

The grant to post-secondary students and recent graduates would provide one-time payments of up to $5,000 for volunteering in pandemic-related programs, depending on the number of hours worked. For every 100 hours spent, a student will receive $1,000.

While the charity backed out of the management of the program following days of controversy, Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion said, when confirming the probe, that the Conservatives’ request for an investigation ""satisfies the requirements"" laid out in the Conflict of Interest Act.

The Conservatives have alleged that Trudeau violated a provision in the Act that ""prohibits public office holders from making any decision or participating in the making of a decision that furthers their private interests or improperly furthers the private interests of another person.""

Opposition parties have said that Trudeau had a duty to recuse himself from any discussion or decision relating to the WE Charity, given the prime minister's close ties to the organization and his wife’s involvement, and that Trudeau violated the Act when he announced that WE Charity would administer the Canada Student Service Grant.

Trudeau confirmed on Wednesday that he did not recuse himself from the cabinet discussion on outsourcing the large government program. Asked why, Trudeau said he has “long worked on youth issues” before getting into politics.

He has previously said that the public service told his government that the WE Charity organization was the only group capable of administering the student program.

'A PATTERN OF BEHAVIOUR'

In a statement NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said Friday that the hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments to the trio of Trudeau’s family members is “more than disturbing,” and illustrates a “pattern of behaviour.”

Singh pointed to the fact that this is now the third ethics investigation Trudeau has been subjected to since he became prime minister, with the two previous times resulting in findings that Trudeau had breached federal ethics law.

In December 2017 then-commissioner Mary Dawson found Trudeau broke the federal ethics act when he vacationed at the Aga Khan’s private island over the 2016 Christmas holidays with friends and family. And then in August 2019, Trudeau was found to have broken the federal Conflict of Interest Act in relation to the SNC-Lavalin scandal, by seeking to influence former justice minister and attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould in ""many ways.""

In that report, Dion concluded after months of reviewing ""troubling"" evidence and relevant legal and constitutional principles, that Trudeau contravened section nine of the Act, which states that public office holders are prohibited from using their position to seek to influence a decision that furthers the interest of a private third party.

“The PM, his office and cabinet need to co-operate fully with the ethics commissioner and must waive cabinet confidentiality so the commissioner can truly get to the bottom of this,” Singh said.

“Canadians deserve to know the truth and need to know this won't happen again.""

In an interview on CTV News Channel, Liberal MP Nate Erskine-Smith said that while the contract was eyebrow-raising, he doesn’t think that Trudeau should step aside while the investigation is underway.

“The government rightly listened and walked the program back, now I think the question is squarely focused on this conflict question and that's for the ethics commissioner to pursue… I will follow it closely,” he said.

Now, the NDP are calling for an ethics investigation.

In a statement to CTV News, Morneau’s office said that there is “absolutely no link” between his daughters’ involvements with the charity and “any work that WE does with the Government of Canada.”

The statement confirmed what website Canadaland first reported: that the finance minister’s daughter Clare has spoken at WE events, and his daughter Grace is currently employed by WE Charity.

“Clare has spoken at WE events, as well as many other public events, in the context of the release of her book on young refugee girls. She has never been compensated for that work,” said Maeva Proteau, press secretary for Morneau.

As well, Morneau’s daughter Grace is a “contractual employee of WE in an administrative role in the travel department,” a job she has had since 2019 following her internship, according to Morneau’s office.

“She got this position on her own merits. There is absolutely no link between her employment and any work that WE does with the Government of Canada,” Proteau said.

Proteau confirmed that Morneau did not recuse himself from the discussions about the decision to offload the program meant to administer grants to students and new graduates for their volunteer work this summer.

NDP WANT INVESTIGATION

In light of Morneau’s statement, the New Democrats are calling for Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion to investigate Morneau. In a letter to the commissioner obtained by CTV News, NDP MP and ethics critic Charlie Angus says he thinks the finance minister’s decision to not recuse himself from conversations about outsourcing the program to We Charity merits more scrutiny.

“The Act has clear stipulations that prevent public office holders from making or participating in a decision related to the exercise of an official power, duty or function if the public office holder knows or reasonably should know that, in the making of the decision, he or she would be in a conflict of interest,” writes Angus.

“It would seem apparent that Minister Morneau would recognize that the fact that his family member was an employee of this organization necessitated him to recuse himself regarding this extraordinary decision to outsource nearly billion-dollar commitment of public funds in a single source contract,” Angus writes.

With the program halted, thousands of students are now in limbo without summer jobs and, for now, no chance for volunteer grants to help cover costs like fall tuition. The grant to post-secondary students and recent graduates was set to provide payments that amount to less than minimum wage for volunteering in pandemic-related programs, depending on the number of hours worked. For every 100 hours spent, a student would receive $1,000.

“The recommendation to have WE administer the program came from the public service,” Morneau’s office said.

APPEARED 'TOO CLOSE': LIBERAL MP

With Dion already looking into Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s ties to WE Charity and his decision to not recuse himself from the contract discussions, the Conservatives are now calling for an RCMP probe, and for a full accounting of what all cabinet ministers knew about the extent of the Trudeau family’s connections to the charities. Trudeau’s wife, mother and brother were paid a range of amounts to speak at WE events over the years.

In an interview on CTV News Channel, Liberal MP Nate Erskine-Smith said that while he can’t speak for the state of mind either Trudeau or Morneau were in, he was “skeptical” about how the project was announced.

“I was glad to see the government reverse course in response to feedback… The prime minister and the finance minister appeared to me to be too close to this as far as decision-making goes, but ultimately this is in the hands of the ethics commissioner,” he said.",[]

Current leader Andrew Scheer is in his final weeks in the job.

Party members are now voting for his replacement with the winner to be announced in late August.

Meanwhile, the issue is not going away.

The ethics commissioner has been called in to see if Trudeau broke conflict-of-interest law in awarding a multimillion-dollar contract to the WE organization, given Trudeau's long-standing family ties to the organization.

The commissioner is also being asked to probe Finance Minister Bill Morneau's ties as well -- one of the minister's daughters works for the organization.

The Liberals, and WE, have said there is no direct link between the awarding of the contract to run the $900 million Canada Student Services Grant program and the organization's connections to the Trudeaus.

The Conservatives also say that revelations Trudeau family members have been paid by WE for speaking engagements in the past elevates the seriousness of the matter. The party says the police should investigate for possible fraud.

Trudeau himself was never paid.

Both ethics and criminal investigations take time.

The investigation by the ethics commissioner into the SNC-Lavalin affair was requested in February 2019 and completed in August of that year.

The Senate expenses scandal first broke in 2012 and it took two years for criminal charges related to fraud to surface in that case. Former Conservative senator Mike Duffy was acquitted on all of them in April 2016.

So, given that the Opposition Conservatives will have a new boss while the WE story likely continues to percolate, how will Scheer's replacement seek to proceed?

The Canadian Press asked all four leadership candidates how they would deal with the scandal.

Leslyn Lewis:

The Toronto lawyer said the ethics commissioner has proven himself capable in the past of getting to the bottom of Trudeau's scandals and she trusts him to do that job here as well.

""The problem is that every time the ethics commissioner proves Trudeau has broken the rules, he just shrugs and moves on,"" Lewis said in a statement.

""The only way to hold Justin Trudeau accountable is for voters to vote him out. I look forward to leading the charge and replacing him with an honest and ethical government.""

Lewis does not have a seat in the House of Commons. If she wins, she would have to appoint someone to be the parliamentary leader until she could get elected.

Peter MacKay:

MacKay's wife, Nazanin Afshin Jam, a human rights activist, has spoken at WE events. His campaign says she has never taken money from the organization.

In an interview, MacKay said the WE controversy raises questions about the need to broaden and strengthen the power of the ethics commissioner, so if there's a finding a politician broke conflict of interest law, they could actually be penalized.

He also suggested that a stronger ethics screen might be required for whomever is prime minister to ensure there can be no blurring of lines between a prime minister's private life and public role.

In the meantime, MacKay, a former justice minister, said he thinks a criminal investigation into the WE contract could be warranted under Section 122 of the Criminal Code, which is breach of trust involving government officials.

The purpose of the section is to ensure government officials do not abuse their authority or their office, MacKay said.

By being in the cabinet room when the decision was made, knowing their family connection to WE, is a very serious thing, MacKay said.

""It's essential we keep confidence in public office holders,"" MacKay said. ""This undermines that.""

While it is the kind of issue that could result in a motion of non-confidence in the Liberal government, it's not that simple, MacKay said.

""We can't lose sight of the bigger picture here which is the economic and health crisis that still rages on as a result of COVID-19,"" he said.

""This is going to undermine severely the prime minister's legitimacy and ability to govern throughout this period.""

MacKay also does not have a seat in the House of Commons. What levers of parliamentary power he might want pulled would have to be done by someone else.

Erin O'Toole:

O'Toole has suggested the scandal brings with it the threat of a fall election.

When his campaign was asked whether he would seek to topple the government over it, a spokesperson did not directly answer the question, repeating only that they think the chances of a fall election are higher.

O'Toole supports his party's call for a criminal investigation. In an email, campaign spokesperson Melanie Paradis said that given O'Toole already has a seat in the House of Commons, he would be ready take on Trudeau on this issue from ""day one.""

""As leader, Erin will stand up for Canadians and get to the bottom of this corruption,"" she said. His campaign did not say how he would do that.

O'Toole's children have also attended WE events and he has spoken at one in his riding. His campaign said his family has never financially benefited from WE.

Derek Sloan:

Sloan is also a sitting MP. His campaign did not return two requests for comment on what he would do to address the issue.

The WMO said there was a 20 per cent chance that it will exceed 1.5 C above 1850 to 1900 average levels in at least one year, according to its annual climate predictions for the coming five years.

The last five-year period has been the warmest five years on record, said the Geneva-based United Nations agency, which counts 193 member states.

Temperatures over the next five years, 2020 to 2024, are very likely to be within the range of 0.91 C to 1.59 C above pre-industrial levels.

Almost all regions, except parts of the southern oceans, are likely to be warmer than the recent past, which is defined as 1981 to 2010.

""This study shows -- with a high level of scientific skill -- the enormous challenge ahead in meeting the Paris Agreement on Climate Change target of keeping a global temperature rise this century well below 2 C above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 C,"" said WMO secretary-general Petteri Taalas.

The 2015 Paris accord seeks to limit global temperature rises through sweeping cuts in greenhouse gas emissions.

WETTER SAHEL

The WMO forecasts do not take into account changes in greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions due to the shutdown of economic and industrial activity triggered by the coronavirus crisis.

""Due to the very long lifetime of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the impact of the drop in emissions this year is not expected to lead to a reduction of CO2 atmospheric concentrations which are driving global temperature increases,"" Taalas said.

The planet's average temperature is already more than 1.0 C warmer than the pre-industrial period, the WMO said.

Looking at the five-year period 2020 to 2024, the organisation said there was a 70 per cent chance that at least one month would be 1.5 C warmer than pre-industrial levels.

However, there is only a three per cent chance that the entire period would be 1.5 C warmer than that baseline level.

The northern North Atlantic region could have stronger westerly winds, leading to more storms in western Europe over the next five years.

High latitude regions and the Sahel are likely to be wetter than the recent past, the organisation predicted.

The WMO also said that in 2020 alone, many parts of South America, southern Africa and Australia are likely to be drier than the recent past.

Meanwhile, the Arctic is likely to have warmed by more than twice as much as the global mean.

Statistics Canada's labour force survey released Friday showed 953,000 jobs were added last month, including 488,000 full-time and 465,000 part-time positions. The unemployment rate fell to 12.3 per cent after hitting a record-high of 13.7 per cent in May.

As in May, even though more people found jobs, more people also looked for work as the labour force grew by about 786,000 after a gain of 491,000 in May, bringing it to within 443,000 of its pre-pandemic level.

Statistics Canada said the unemployment rate would have been 16.3 per cent had it included in unemployment counts those who wanted to work, but did not look for a job.

Job gains were made in every province, including by 378,000 in Ontario, marking the first increase since the COVID-19 shutdown, Statistics Canada said. It didn't include any gains in Toronto as restrictions in that city loosened after the survey week.

Despite the good news, economist Jim Stanford said there remains a historic crisis in the job market with high unemployment and hundreds of thousands who have left the labour force altogether.

Also, gains nationally were not shared equally among groups, with women, youth and low-wage workers still slower to rebound, which Stanford said could be problematic if those jobs don't ever come back.

""I worry about a coming second round of layoffs motivated not by health restrictions, but by companies deciding their businesses are going to be permanently smaller. So that would be qualitatively different and in a way worse,"" said Stanford, director of the Centre for Future Work in Vancouver.

""We aren't remotely out of the woods yet, but this was a really encouraging step forward.""

Some three million jobs were lost over March and April due to the pandemic, and 2.5 million more had their hours and earnings slashed. By last month, some 3.1 million were affected by the pandemic, including 1.4 million who weren't at work due to COVID-19.

Brendon Bernard, an economist at Indeed Canada, said recapturing jobs at the same pace in the coming months will be tougher.

""A lot of areas of the economy still aren't running at full capacity,"" Bernard said. ""So while doors may be open and customers might be coming in, business hasn't come back to normal.""

Despite the overall improvement, the oil and gas industry continues to struggle.

The PetroLMI Division of Energy Safety Canada says direct oil and gas employment fell by more than 6,700 positions in June compared with May, with about 70 per cent of the net job losses in Alberta.

Compared with a year earlier, employment in the oil and employment sector was down 17 per cent.

The overall job losses were unprecedented in speed and depth compared with previous recessions, Statistics Canada said, and the rebound to date sharper than previous downturns.

Ottawa's response has been equally unprecedented: a deficit of at least $343.2 billion this fiscal year as the Trudeau Liberals dole out some $230 billion in emergency aid.

In June, 28.3 per cent of Canadians aged 15 to 69 reported receiving some form of federal aid since mid-March, Statistics Canada said. Meanwhile, the proportion of households reporting difficulty paying the bills dropped to 20.1 per cent in June from 22.5 per cent in May.

""Without the federal government being there to support Canadian workers, Canadian businesses and the Canadian provinces and territories, we would be in a bigger mess in this country right now,"" Hassan Yussuff, president of the Canadian Labour Congress said in an interview this week.

The Bank of Canada and federal government believe the worst of the economic pain from the pandemic is behind the country, but Canada will face high unemployment and low growth until 2021.

In a statement, federal Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough touted the overall jobs numbers as a sign the government's plan was working, before adding many Canadians still ""face real challenges during this time.""

She and other ministers are now reshaping programs so fewer workers stay on the $80-billion emergency benefit, and more get tied to jobs through the $82-billion wage subsidy program.

""We understand the need for those emergency programs. We also understand as we reopen and recover, we have to move away from emergency programs and into stimulus and recovery,"" said Leah Nord, senior director of workforce strategies for the Canadian Chamber of Commerce.

She said there are other issues to resolve around health and safety in the workplace, transit, and child care to help more Canadians get back to work.

In provinces where daycares reopened for children five and under, employment levels returned to pre-pandemic levels for fathers in June, but not for mothers. Similarly, mothers with children under 18 were more likely than fathers to work less than half their usual hours in June, Statistics Canada said.

Job gains have come at a faster clip for men. Their unemployment rate hit 12.1 per cent in June compared to 12.7 per cent for women. And the underutilization rate -- which counts those who are unemployed, those who want a job but didn't look for one, and those working less than half their usual hours -- was 28.3 for women and 25.5 per cent for men.

Economist Armine Yalnizyan said the numbers underscore the need to provide child care as well as options for schooling in the fall so mothers can work.

The alternative, she said, could pull back any economic gains.

""It means that even if there are jobs, some women won't be able to take them because there's no way they can leave their kids,"" said Yalnizyan, a fellow on the future of workers at the Atkinson Foundation.

""So we are looking at the potential for an economic depression instead of talking about paces of recovery and pivoting to building to better.""

Ltd. made their decision to end “pandemic pay” independently of each other, even as the decision was based in part on being aware of what some of their competitors were planning, the chief executives for the companies told the members of Parliament on Friday.

Executives for Canada’s three main grocery chains defended their decision to halt their temporary $2-an-hour wage increase last month, telling a House of Commons committee that there was no “collusion” and that the decision was based on employee workload, the economy re-opening, other retailers opening again, a return to more “normal” business conditions, and lower business volumes.

Lawmakers grilled the executives, questioning the “courtesy” calls and emails that were made and sent between them. This included an email Loblaw president Sarah Davis sent on June 11 to Metro, Empire, and others including Walmart, letting them know the company was planning to end its temporary pay hikes two days later. Metro decided to end theirs on the same day.

Davis had sent a similar email earlier when Loblaw, which owns No Frills, T&T and Valu-Mart as well, decided to initiate a wage increase for its workers.

Eric LaFleche, chief executive at Metro, which operates 950 food stores including Food Basic and Super C, said he did not send emails to any colleagues or competitors regarding the decision to end the temporary wage hike, but he had previously spoken to Davis and Empire CEO Michael Medline on the phone, in compliance with the Competition Act, to ask about their intentions with respect to the temporary bonuses. Both said at the time they were undecided. Medline added that a lawyer was present during his call with LaFleche and that he had declined to discuss the issue further.

“I don’t accept your premise that this was co-ordination, collusion or anything untowards. Everything was above board, within legal boundaries, I can say that wholeheartedly. I have no issue with what we did and what information we got and how we got it,” said LaFleche, who said the calls were to help inform his decisions for the company and its employees, and not any kind of tacit agreement on staff pay.

“We make our own decision based on the information we have, and the more information we have, the more clarity in our decision. When we made our decision, it was our own.”

LaFleche’s comments echoed Medline’s, who said in his opening statement to the committee that he wanted to be “absolutely clear” they did not co-ordinate their decisions. Medline told committee members that the company’s decision to stop the pay premium came before he received Davis’s email, though he did hear Loblaw was considering it. Empire operates Sobeys and Safeway among other banners.

The executives told lawmakers that they also consulted with corporate counsel to ensure that no laws were being violated.

In a series of tense exchanges during the two-hour session, committee members questioned the executives’ decision to halt the pay premium, particularly as dozens of retail and warehouse workers continued to be sick with COVID-19, and a new report that another two grocery store workers tested positive in southern Ontario.

Earlier this week, union leaders representing thousands of grocery employees, told the same committee that the pandemic was not over, and therefore the temporary premiums should also continue.

During questioning, Medline indicated that going forward, if a region were to go into lockdown again, they would offer “hero pay” again, and that he would look into retroactive compensation as well.

In Friday’s meeting, executives -- criticized for their own salary compensations and dividend payouts to shareholders -- said decisions like the installation of plexi-glass barriers in stores were made without consideration to costs and that tens of millions of dollars had been invested to ensure the safety of their store workers during the pandemic.",[]
872,ctvnews,http://ctvnews.ca/business/pattie-lovett-reid-we-may-see-a-v-shaped-recovery-1.5019440,Pattie Lovett-Reid: We may see a V-shaped recovery,[],2020-07-10 15:31:00-04:00,"TORONTO -- Maybe, just maybe, we are going to get a V-shaped recovery.

If there is a word to describe how I feel about the pandemic it is ""sad."" I feel so sad for people who have lost their lives to this horrible disease, people who lost their job, small business owners who have had to close up shop, for those who have had their life savings evaporate and -- when it comes down to it -- anyone who has been impacted in any way.

When the fiscal update highlighted our deficit would run north of $343 billion I didn't panic. I know for now as a country we can afford it. This low interest rate environment helps, the Bank of Canada buying up bonds to provide liquidity helps and Canada continues to fare better than other countries around the globe.

My focus is always on the average Canadian trying to make ends meet and especially those who may have been struggling before the pandemic struck.

Canadians can't take on more debt. They are tapped out. The government can and did and as the PM said, ""we took on debt so Canadians didn't have to"". In my opinion that was a good thing to do. We don't have a playbook when it comes to shutting down the whole economy. In past recessions the money may have stopped but the people didn't.

The challenge is, we aren't through the pandemic and I fear more jobs losses are on the horizon. From a financial perspective, what I worry about most are jobs. As the CERB comes into question come the fall, families will be faced with harsh reality their lives have changed and like any challenging period of time some will be impacted more than others. Some companies will make it and some won't. Some families will rally and others won't.

However, the June jobs report showed a hint of encouragement with almost 1 million jobs created leading me to maybe just maybe believe we could see the ""V"" shaped economy that so many are hoping for. And while the job number surprised to the upside after 3 million jobs were lost in March and April it is still a little too soon to declare a roaring victory. There are 1 3/4 million people still unemployed. Yet, other signs of improvement point to recovery. Areas such as the real estate market in terms of sales and housing starts while vehicle sales exploded higher as well.

The analogy I will use: The patient who has a heart attack, or in this the case the economy that stopped in a heartbeat, is starting to shows signs of stabilizing. But that isn't enough. Like the patient, the economy needs a long-term recovery plan to ensure good health is sustainable.

I'm looking for long-term growth plans to get people back working. Some of the jobs losses will never come back. In my perfect world we would see money going toward new initiatives with new jobs created, supported with training, so families and business can begin to plan again.

In the meantime, I tend to confront the brutal facts while remaining cautiously optimistic we will get through this.

It was the Mercedes driver's record-extending 89th career pole and particularly impressive as he first beat Red Bull driver Max Verstappen's mark and then his own leading mark on his final lap.

""That was awesome,"" Hamilton said after placing 1.216 seconds ahead of Verstappen and 1.398 clear of McLaren driver Carlos Sainz Jr.

""I definitely had my heart in my mouth, but I was able to improve,"" Hamilton said. ""Honestly it was a fantastic lap, that lap was as close to perfect as I could get it in those conditions.""

Verstappen swerved a little on his final lap.

""It could have been better but I don't think it was enough to beat Lewis,"" the Dutch driver said. ""You can't see a thing, it is hard to see the braking zones but that is the same for everyone.""

It was the best career result in qualifying for Sainz -- underlining how McLaren is improving after Lando Norris finished last weekend's race in third place.

""It feels amazing, especially that qualifying was one of the toughest I have done. There was so much aquaplaning it was crazy,"" the Spanish driver said. ""We're completely blind in the car, we don't see what's at the front, what's at the back.""

Hamilton's Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas could only qualify in fourth place after taking pole position and winning last Sunday's Austrian GP.

It was another dismal day for Ferrari, with Sebastian Vettel 10th and Charles Leclerc 11th.

""The main problem was we were just not quick enough,"" Leclerc said. ""We're just too slow.""

Driving rain washed out the third and final practice session at midday and threatened qualifying altogether. But the cars managed to finally get out onto the Red Bull Ring at around 3:45 p.m. local time (1345 GMT) even though rain was still lashing down.

In the event of a complete washout, qualifying would have been moved to Sunday morning.

With drivers told the rain would soon get heavier, they were advised to post a solid time quickly in order to get into the second part of qualifying.

Verstappen said ""I can't see a thing"" and Romain Grosjean slid off track into gravel.

Some unexpected names popped up at the top of the leaderboard, before order was restored as Hamilton, Bottas and Verstappen swapped leading times.

""Leave me to it,"" Hamilton said over radio, trying to keep his concentration with water spraying everywhere in front and around him.

With two minutes left in Q1, Italian driver Antonio Giovinazzi lost control of his Alfa Romeo and it swerved sideways and then backward into a crash barrier. His car had to be lifted off the track.

The rain fell so heavily throughout the morning that firefighters had to remove excess water from the roof of one empty hospitality building. The race is being held without fans because of the coronavirus pandemic.

The race is changing names from last week but is still being held at the same track in Spielberg, which is surrounded by the Styrian mountains.",[]

The Los Angeles Lakers superstar won't wear one of the NBA-approved social justice messages on the back of his jersey when the NBA resumes competition later this month in the Orlando bubble.

""It was no disrespect to the list that was handed down to all the players,"" James said Saturday in a confernece call from Florida. ""I commend anyone that decides to put something on the back of their jersey. It's just something that didn't seriously resonate with my mission, with my goal.""

As part of the NBA's recognition of the nationwide invigoration of the social justice movement sparked by the death of George Floyd, NBA players are allowed to choose from a lengthy list of possible messages for their jerseys during the league's restart. James is among just a few who declined to choose one of the messages, he said.

""I would have loved to have a say-so on what would have went on the back of my jersey,"" James said. ""I had a couple of things in mind, but I wasn't part of that process, which is OK. ... Everything that I do has a purpose, has a meaning. I don't need to have something on the back of my jersey for people to understand my mission or know what I'm about and what I'm here to do.""

The 35-year-old superstar has a long history of social involvement and advocacy for progressive causes. James speaks frequently of what he feels is a responsibility to campaign for positive social change from his powerful position in sports and pop culture.

""This is the mission I've been on for a long time now,"" James said. ""It's great that a lot of people's ears are opening. A lot of people are understanding, a lot of people are recognizing. A lot of people still don't get it, and a lot of people are still afraid to talk about the racism that goes on in America, especially for our people. ... But we have some ears, and we will continue to push the envelope and let everyone know that we are human as well. We don't want to be just be used for our God-given abilities.""

JaVale McGee, the Lakers' veteran centre, said he will wear ""Respect Us"" on his jersey in Orlando.

""It's a blessing to have this platform,"" said McGee, whose asthma has him being particularly cautious during the pandemic. ""We have way more of a voice playing basketball ΓÇª Our fans are basketball fans over anything. This is the biggest platform we can speak about social injustices. That's the best time to talk about it.""

James also said he didn't consider not playing in the NBA's restart, believing the league can be a positive force through its visibility and competition. He expressed no concerns for his health inside the bubble.

""I believe the NBA and (Commissioner) Adam Silver, they took all precautionary measure to make sure that we as a league are as safe as we can be,"" James said. ""Obviously, in anything that you do, there can be things that can happen, so we will cross that line if it happens. But we're doing everything to make sure everyone stays safe during this pandemic. Adam Silver has given me no reason to not believe him since he took over. I have no concerns. I'm here 100% and in great health.""",[]
876,ctvnews,http://ctvnews.ca/sports/nhl-players-take-collaborative-approach-in-bid-to-resume-1.5020612,"NHL, players take collaborative approach in bid to resume",['John Wawrow'],2020-07-11 18:47:00-04:00,"Collaboration or bust.

Given the gravity of the new coronavirus pandemic and the abrupt decision to place the NHL season on pause in March, it didn't take commissioner Gary Bettman and union chief Don Fehr long to realize they were going to have to work together if play was to resume any time soon.

Nearly four months to the day since the last puck dropped, the two sides put aside past differences to have a return-to-play plan in place, and the assurance of labour peace through September 2026 to go with it.

“When we got to March 12 and decided to take the pause, that began a period of perhaps unprecedented collaboration and problem solving,” Bettman said during a Zoom conference call with reporters Saturday, a day after the league and players ratified a 24-team expanded playoff, set to begin Aug. 1, and a four-year extension of the collective bargaining agreement.

“It was a recognition by both sides that we were being confronted with an incredibly difficult, a novel, unprecedented situation. I believed we would get to this point because it was the right thing to do for the game and for everybody involved in the game.”

Fehr, the NHL Players' Association executive director, not only agreed with Bettman, but went out of his way to credit the owners for the approach

“I was persuaded well before the end of March that not only was this different, but it was being approached in a fundamentally different way. I always thought we would find a way to reach an agreement,” Fehr said.

The bond established between the two was apparent during the 55-minute session, with Fehr agreeing with Bettman and then acknowledging how unusual that was by by saying: “I think that indicates something about the approach that was taken in these talks.”

Training camps are set to open Monday, which also represents the deadline for players to determine whether to opt out without penalty. If all goes as planned, teams will depart for their two respective hub cities, Toronto and Edmonton, Alberta, on July 26 to open a two-month playoff leading to the awarding of the Stanley Cup.

Many uncertainties remain, with Bettman and Fehr unable to provide definitive answers.

While acknowledging the likelihood of players testing positive for COVID-19, deputy commissioner Bill Daly was unable to say how many players would have to do so for the league to postpone or cancel the playoffs altogether.

Though conference playoffs and Stanley Cup Final are scheduled to be held in Edmonton, a person with direct knowledge of the plans told The Associated Press the site might change if the pandemic spikes in Alberta's capital. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because it is an alternate plan that's not been discussed publicly.

Bettman and Daly, who are based in New York, weren't even sure if or when they could cross the border to personally attend games because those entering Canada are required to self-isolate for a 14-day period.

The only certainty is the NHL became North America's latest professional sport to forge a path back to playing, but minus the public hiccups experienced by its counterparts.

Major League Baseball's season was nearly scuttled before the two sides agreed to a 60-game format. Less than three weeks before NFL training camps are set to open, the league is experiencing push-back from its players on whether to play preseason games next month. Major League Soccer has had two teams already withdrawing from competition because of the number of players testing positive for the coronavirus.

And not only is hockey on the verge of returning, the CBA extension assures 12 straight years of labour peace, the NHL's longest stretch since Bettman took over in 1993. During that time, play has been halted three times by lockouts, the last in 2012-13, when the season was shortened to 48 games.

“I think Don and I both recognize labour peace was something we couldn't even quantify how important it was,” Bettman said. “But we both knew that for the business of the game to come back strong, there was enough disruption going on in the world that we didn't have to add to it.”

Fehr said the months-long talks to reach a solution were a matter of perseverance.

“This is a very bad analogy, but you have to sort of navigate the kayak in a storm until the storm's over, and then make sure the kayak isn't full of holes so that you can go on and sail it in calmer seas,” Fehr said in a separate interview with The AP. “Or to put it another way there was never any pretense that this was business as usual.”

Owners benefit because they can generate much-needed revenue through sponsorships and advertising, even though games will be played in empty arenas.

Though players will likely lose a portion of their salaries for seasons to come to make up for 50-50 split of revenue, they benefit from a CBA that includes the possibility of returning to the Olympics, after the NHL opted out from the 2018 Winter Games in South Korea. The new labour agreement also addressed players' demands to gain a post-career subsidy for health care.

877,ctvnews,http://ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/have-you-visited-these-unesco-sites-some-say-aliens-have-1.5017091,Have you visited these UNESCO sites? Some say aliens have,['Jen Rose Smith'],2020-07-09 08:57:00-04:00,"Erich von Däniken dried his sweaty palms with granite dust as he scaled the Great Pyramid of Giza, crawling block by block up the nearly 4,000-year-old monument.

It was 1954, when you could still climb the pyramids. Von Däniken, a 19-year-old with a Catholic education and a passion for flying saucers, was captivated. Fourteen years later, he published an influential book called ""Chariots of the Gods,"" arguing that extraterrestrials influenced ancient sites, the pyramids included.

The magnificent Giza Pyramids are among the world's most famous ancient places, part of a sprawling UNESCO World Heritage Site that brings travelers to Egypt from across the globe.

Visitors come to explore hidden burial chambers, go eye-to-eye with the mysterious Sphinx and take in the sheer scale of Egypt's grandest monuments.

Von Däniken proposed that aliens offered technological help in building them.

WHAT THE SCIENTISTS SAY ABOUT THESE FAMOUS PLACES

Mainstream archeologists disagree with Von Däniken, retorting that ancient Egyptians developed their remarkable building tradition with no help from extraterrestrials.

But while scientists are generally united in rejecting the aliens idea, sometimes known as ""ancient astronaut theory,"" Von Däniken's ideas have endured.

He went on to write 32 additional volumes, selling more than 63 million copies. Penguin Random House, his publisher, claims Von Däniken is ""arguably the most widely read and most-copied nonfiction author in the world.""

And the pyramids aren't the only UNESCO site swept up in his theories, or in those of people he's inspired.

Some speculate that the UNESCO site of Teotihuacan, where the Aztec kings once ruled near modern-day Mexico City, could have been a space port, pointing to mica and liquid mercury found among the ruins that they say are anachronistic.

For travellers, Teotihuacan is a glimpse into an ancient, mysterious empire. Researchers believe the city predates even the Aztecs, who were living there when Europeans first arrived in Mexico.

Archeologists, who have carried out painstaking excavations here for centuries, see it as the crowning achievement of a little-known -- but earthbound -- civilization.

Instead of peering up toward space, they dig into the ground. Archaeologists have spent years excavating a tunnel at Teotihuacan, which leads to chambers full of ritual offerings that some believe symbolize the underworld.

Nearly 3,000 miles away is another enigmatic UNESCO site that draws travellers, researchers and alien enthusiasts alike.

At the Nazca Lines geoglyphs in Peru, visitors take sightseeing flights to view earthen shapes that are too massive to appreciate from ground level. For decades, some have conjectured that the shapes are some sort of ancient airport.

Peruvian scientists agree that the Nazca Lines are mysterious, but believe they are linked instead to rituals and water.

In recent years, researchers have used satellite imagery to discover more than 140 additional geoglyphs, carefully poring over data to find patterns in the landscape.

""They were not drawn by aliens, that's for sure,"" expert Javier Puente told CNN.

TEACHING AN ALTERNATIVE TO ANCIENT ASTRONAUTS

Archeologist Sarah Parcak teaches a seminar on debunking archeological myths and hoaxes at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.

In the class, she pushes back on theories about ancient aliens like those proposed by Von Däniken. She sees it as important work.

""The belief that aliens built the pyramids, or in fact any ancient monument, is deeply racist,"" Parcak says. It's no coincidence that alien theories focus on places home to black, brown and Indigenous people, she notes.

Not only that, Parcak thinks that aliens are a distraction from the real wonders of archaeology. ""It's not a mystery, it's a puzzle. And puzzles take time to put together,"" says Parcak.

One example of Parcak's step-by-step detective work is the city of Itjtawy in Egypt. It was missing for thousands of years, but Parcak found it by analyzing satellite images and NASA topography data.

Sometimes, piecing together archeological puzzles feels personal.

At Parcak's very first excavation, in the Egyptian Delta site of Mendes, she made a discovery that's fresh in her mind more than 20 years later.

""I found an intact pot that was kind of mashed, but we put it back together,"" she recalls. On the handle, Parcak could make out a clear fingerprint left behind in once-wet clay.

""In that moment, I could imagine the person who made it,"" she says. ""It kind of helps us to bridge the divide between past and present and create a sense of empathy.""

Parcak's work offers a personal contact with the past, but you don't need an archeology degree to connect with the ancient world.

On UNESCO-listed Easter Island, travelers can learn how ancient islanders cooked in earthen ovens and built stone-walled gardens. (Easter Island is a favorite with alien theorists, too. Archaeologists chalk up the island's remarkable stonework to Polynesian ingenuity.)

At the temple of Dendera, part of a sprawling UNESCO site in Upper Egypt, visitors follow vivid stories and myths on brilliant wall paintings. (Dendera? Also popular with alien theorists, who interpret one wall painting as proof the ancient Egyptians had electric light bulbs. Researchers say the painting is of a pillar and a lotus flower.)

WHY LEARNING ABOUT ANCIENT HUMANS MATTERS

Learning about ancient humans is fun, but Parcak says it's important, too. For travellers and researchers alike, exploring the ancient world can shed light on the present day -- and maybe the future.

In early April, Parcak was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship to write a book about collapse and resilience in the ancient world. Coronavirus, she says, has lent a new urgency and relevance to the work.

""It's like everything we study is happening in real time,"" she says. Now, she hears echoes of ancient strife whenever she turns on the news. ""The headlines we're seeing, it's like they could be archeology articles.""

For Parcak, though, visiting these ancient sites can be a source of hope. Itjtawy, the ancient city Parcak discovered using satellite imagery, is an example.

It became the capital of the Egypt after a period of widespread political instability, civil war and drought. The Old Kingdom, whose rulers built some of the greatest pyramids, had fallen.

But as power structures shifted, greater economic equality emerged. And from tomb decor to storytelling, Parcak says the area she studies represents a flourishing after chaos.

""I'm not saying it's always rosy,"" she cautions. ""But the site itself is a real symbol of what can happen after great turmoil.""",[]

Golf Canada reports that there were 17 per cent more scores registered with the national sport body this June compared to the same month last year.

A total of 1,483,506 scores were submitted to Golf Canada's handicap calculator last month compared to 1,271,782 in June 2019.

That ended a streak of three months when recreational rounds played in Canada dropped precipitously due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

As restrictions were lifted across the country in May, the number of scores registered increased.

In May, 165,026 people registered their scores between the 1st and the 15th but 265,480 submitted scores in the final two weeks of that month.

The May 1-15 numbers are a nearly 40 per cent drop from the same period in 2019 (211,809) but the May 16-30 numbers are just five per cent lower than last year (269,266).

The upward trend comes even as Golf Canada had to cancel all of its amateur and professional championships due to travel restrictions put in place to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.

A shift in how scores are registered has also been seen, with most recreational players entering their scores online instead of in the course's clubhouse or pro shop, which have largely been closed this summer because of physical distancing protocols.

Golf Canada plans to launch an updated version of its scoring app later this month, helping to keep players physically distant and improve their game.

“We knew it was going to be busy,” said SARCAN communications coordinator Nolan Hubbard-Richards.

“We knew that people were going to be accumulating more containers than normal. But, we were completely blown away with the reception of our reopening and how many people showed up on that opening day and continue to show up.”

Some customers have seen wait times up to two hours long at locations across Regina. Zena Bear waited outside of the Rochdale location.

“I’ve got five [bags], but I’ve got another six or seven in the car and they said, ‘just what we can carry,’ so I have another day of this.”

SARCAN continues its COVID-19 practices at all locations and customers are seeing them as a success.

“Everybody just kept their distance and did their own thing. So it was all good,” said Bear.

Hubbard-Richards says there is no way for SARCAN to be able to predict what days or times they will be busy. But, it does look like the long lines will continue to be the norm for the foreseeable future.",[]

Lorelei Cornell and Rick Bathgate have been dealing with the grasshoppers for a few weeks on their farm near the hamlet of Fairy Hill.

“They’re eating all the crops in the area,” Lorelei Cornell said. “Our front lawn is gone and they’re eating our pasture, so all the grass for our horses is slowly disappearing.”

Dr. James Tansey, the Province’s entomologist, said these insects are a part of a high-density localized outbreak of clear-winged and two-striped grasshoppers.

“We are starting to see adults which are starting to speed along pretty quickly,” Tansey said. “We usually don’t see adults until later in July, typically late July.”

Tansey said the hot and dry condition in the Fairy Hill area have allowed these insects to thrive. He is encouraging producers in the region should start monitoring their grasshopper populations.

“Numbers can be very high.” Tansey said. “It really is a numbers game. Broad acceptability of different host plants and they can cause a lot of damage in a hurry.”

Along with the concerns of running out of pasture for their horses, the large amount of the insects are also a nuisance.

“They’re covering the house so you have to scoop them away to get in the house,” Cornell said. “You have grasshoppers all over in the house. They fill up the water troughs for the horse’s drinking water so you have to clean those and scoop them out.”",[]

""Why can't we spend a normal day together?!""

That's the stage of Summer we're at weather wise. Storm season has just begun and it's already been really active, days will feature normal parts but they'll rarely stay that way.

During the course of the storm season in Saskatchewan we get an average of 13 tornados, last weekend we had three in one day! On Saturday, July 4 during the afternoon and evening a cyclical tornadic supercell thunderstorm moved through Southern Saskatchewan. This big baddie of a storm not only produced three separate tornadic events but also threw softball sized hail from the sky. Surprisingly the reported damage from these storms was minimal

The first tornado touched down near Glenbain, Sask. around 4:30 in the afternoon, no damage was reported from this event. Number two happened just 10 minutes later at 4:40 near Kincaid. This time it stayed on the ground for approximately 40 minutes and moved Eastward towards Woodrow. Damage to a home and farm property was reported and investigated from this event. The storm continued on towards Assiniboia and near that community another touchdown occurred, around 6:23. Once again no damage was reported.

DID YOU KNOW

On Sunday, June 30,1912 the deadliest tornado in Canadian history hit the city of Regina. The Regina Cyclone started to develop at about 4:50 p.m., green funnel clouds formed and touched down South of the city. It tore through the residential area between Wascana Lake and Victoria Avenue, continuing through the downtown business district, rail yards, warehouse district and Northern residential area. There were a total of 28 fatalities.

Photos sourced from the Provincial Archives of Saskatchewan.

After things from the weekend settled down they ramped back up on Tuesday, July 7. A large line of storms from around the Swift Current area to Southern Montana moved across Southern Saskatchewan. This line of intense storms brought severe wind gusts, large hail and heavy rain. The Southwestern corner took the brunt of these storms once again.

Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) recorded the top wind gust at 141 km per hour at the Mankota station. Two other stations were in triple digits, Coronach at 139 km per hour and Val Marie at 117 km per hour. Nickel sized hail was reported in the Golden Prairie area and reports of trees being snapped came in from near Hazenmore.

Once this line of storms subsided a large area of low pressure developed and moved slowly through Central Saskatchewan. The Northwest side of this system dropped large amounts of rain and a good portion of that also slide through the Southwestern corner of the Province. The 24 hour accumulated precipitation, as of 11 a.m. Wednesday July 9, for North Battleford was 133.8 mm or around 5 inches. Localized flooding happened in North Battleford and Swift Current as city drains couldn't keep up to the downpours. The average rainfall for the whole month of July in North Battleford is 74 mm or 3 inches, they recieved almost double in 24 hours!

As we continue to move through the month of July we'll stay unsettled for the next couple of weeks. Now that moisture has blanketed the Province daytime heating will continue to produce the risk of thunderstorms on an almost daily basis.

Moisture breeds more moisture. If you're looking for a consistent nice day this weekend it will be Saturday. Temperatures will be seasonal and the sun will stick around all day.

Sunday afternoon the trouble starts to bubble up once again and we'll watch for more thunderstorms scattered through the Province.

A report published by CBC News alleges Harmony Builders failed to pay several sub contractors for completed work. Some of those sub-contractors have placed liens on properties and field lawsuits against Harmony Builders.

“We had first heard from some of our members that are creditors of Harmony Builders that they had received notification that Harmony was essentially offering them 20 cents on the dollar,” said Stu Niebergall, from the Regina Home Builders’ Association.

Similar complaints have appeared on Harmony Builders Facebook Page.

A former customer who spoke with CTV News said they moved into a Harmony built home in 2018. They said they are still waiting for the builder to address leaking windows, cracked stairs and interior flooring.

CTV News contacted Harmony Builders but did not receive a response to our request for an interview.

PROMPT PAY

The Provincial Government passed prompt pay legislation for building contractors in 2019, but it is still not enacted.

“It’s brought to the foreground, a lot of the emotions that we’ve been going over for the past two years about getting this legislation enacted,” said Jason Duke, from Certa Pro Painters.

The legislation comes into effect in 2021. Duke hopes the law will tighten up inefficiencies in the current construction system, offering protection for sub-trades and home owners.

“You’re actually out the cost on that project, in most cases, 90 plus days, so I can see how sub contractors and contractors are always in a conundrum because basically it’s always their good customers that are always paying for their bad customers,” said Duke.

The Saskatchewan Construction Association is lobbying the government to withhold any exemptions for residential builders under the prompt pay legislation.

“It’s not uncommon for us to get calls from leaders of construction companies where they are in tears, wondering how they are going to pay their employees, keep their business alive,” said Mark Cooper, from the Saskatchewan Construction Association.

“We believe that every contractor has the right to be paid in a timely manner and the right to defend themselves if they haven’t been paid in a timely manner and we don’t see why that legislation shouldn’t apply across the board.”

Cooper advises homeowners to choose a contractor you trust and ask questions. He said it is important to talk to everyone on-site to make sure they’re being paid, and ask for proof.",[]

Cody Peters is a 24-year-old linebacker who was looking forward to his final season with the University of Regina Rams.

After COVID-19 forced the cancellation of the 2020 season, Peters hoped he, and other 24-year old players, would be granted another year of eligibility. However, U Sports has upheld its rule, meaning his career with the Rams is likely finished.

“I thought I would at least get my last season or they would have tried to accommodate us with everything that’s going on,” said Peters. “Feels like we’re getting blamed for it, or we’re taking all the punishment for something that’s out of our control.”

When the Canada West conference and U Sports decided to cancel a handful of 2020 varsity seasons, including football, University of Regina’s Director of Sport Lisa Robertson hoped the league would review the age cap.

Many felt the Board would explore the possibility of a one year exemption, but the Board voted to retain the current U Sports policy.

“I am surprised by the ruling and I’m really disappointed frankly,” said Robertson. “I’m disappointed for these young men across the country.”

The age cap was implemented in 2014 on the basis of “student health and safety”.

“[We are] certainly sympathetic towards those student-athletes who will exceed the age cap prior to the 2021 football season, the rational of health and safety was ultimately determined to be too important of a factor to provide an exemption,” the Board said in an email statement.

The rule was introduced so older and more mature players would not pose a threat to younger players on a team if there was a large age discrepancy on rosters.

“We are in unprecedented times and a one year relief of this rule, to allow a 26 year old to play, I am comfortable from a safety perspective,” said Robertson, who added she is not naïve to the rule.

“The reality is the number of 18 and 19-year-old men that make the playing roster and get on the field is frankly the exception and not the rule. Our coaches are professionals and they know that they have to build these young men up in order to play at this level of football.”

Before making a decision, the U Sports Board requested feedback from multiple sources, including the 27 football institutions, as well as the Men’s Football Sport Technical Sub-Committee before presenting a recommendation to the U Sports Board of Directors.

However, the Board is facing criticism as only half of the voting members have football programs.

“This is a freak of nature situation that we’re in” said Peters. “I would want to tell them to put themselves in my shoes.”

Peters was named the CJFL’S Defensive Player of the Year with the Hilltops in 2018 before joining the Rams. That same year, he was also invited to the Saskatchewan Roughriders training camp. He’s worried this decision could threaten any future professional football opportunities.

“That was always my dream, my goal, to get to there and be given another opportunity to show what I have,” says Peters, who was released after the training camp. “But with everything that’s going on I feel like that was just taken away from me.”

The age cap rule will affect six current members of the Rams.

“I will be highly supportive of compassionately appealing this on their behalf come the 2021 season,” said Robertson.

All members of varsity sports at the University of Regina, including the older football players, are still eligible to train and receive athletic scholarships in 2020.",[]
