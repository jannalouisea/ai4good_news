The cost of rental housing has dipped in the wake of a global pandemic, according to a website that lists apartments for rent.

Padmapper concluded that one-bedroom units are 5.9 percent less expensive in Vancouver than a year ago, whereas two-bedroom units are down 10.3 percent.

There were also declines in Toronto.

There, Padmapper stated that rents are 8.3 percent lower for a one-bedroom and 5.3 percent less for a two-bedroom, compared to a year ago.

In the past, however, media outlets have come under criticism for relying on Padmapper for rental information.

Vancouver data analyst Jens von Bergmann, for instance, has tweeted that a better approach would be to look at listings on Craigslist or Kijiji, which are the most commonly used platforms in B.C.

The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. provides annual reports on rents in purpose-built apartments. These statistics usually report far lower rental rates than those provided by Padmapper.

Padmapper states on its blog that it aggregates data from hundreds of thousands of active listings before publishing ""median asking rents for around the top 25 cities by population"".

In its recent report, it claims that rents have risen in some suburbs, reflecting a desire for less expensive housing than what's available in urban cores.

For example, in Burnaby, the website states that rents jumped 7.6 percent in a year.

""Renters are now prioritizing affordability and space over paying more for big city amenities, most of which they can’t use currently,"" wrote Crystal Chen on Padmapper's blog.",[]

Although the number of daily new cases dipped to 13 yesterday (July 14), the number rebounded today above 20 cases, where it had been for five consecutive days over the past week.

Daily update: July 15

B.C. provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix issued a joint statement today (July 15) for the daily B.C. COVID-19 update instead of holding a news briefing.

They announced that there are 21 new cases in the province, which includes two epi-linked cases.

The cumulative total over the duration of the pandemic so far is now 3,149 cases. That includes 1,023 cases in Vancouver Coastal Health, 1,659 in Fraser Health, 135 in Island Health, 216 in Interior Health, 65 in Northern Health, and 51 cases of people who reside outside of Canada.

Currently, there are 207 active cases, including 14 people in hospital. (Five of those patients are in intensive-care units.)

B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix Province of British Columbia

The good news is that there are no new deaths, leaving the total fatalities at 189.

In addition, there are no new health-care outbreaks. Two long-term care facilities and one acute-care facility have remaining active outbreaks.

The outbreak at the Krazy Cherry Fruit Co. farm in Oliver remains active, in addition to community-exposure incidents in Kelowna.

Yesterday, Dr. Henry explained that most of the new cases are part of an outbreak at Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility in Vancouver. She added that the most crucial element is that they are aware of the sources of all reported cases.

Nonetheless, she did express nervousness when case numbers reach 25, and today Dr. Henry and Dix expressed concerns about the overall rise in new cases, which reflects how the coroanvirus continues to “silently circulate in our communities” in B.C.

""While early on, many of our long-term care and assisted living facilities were impacted, most of the new cases are in the broader community,” they stated.

A total of 2,753 people (88 percent) have now recovered.

Canada update

Canada’s deputy chief public health officer Dr. Howard Njoo, who is filling in for Dr. Theresa Tam while she is away, stated today that there have been 108,486 cases in Canada, which includes 8,798 deaths.

Dr. Njoo also expressed concern about increasing numbers of young adults contracting the virus at parties, nightclubs, bars, and other locations across the country.

“Although severe illness due to COVID-19 is not common among younger age groups, there have been several reports of severe illness among even young and active adults,” he stated. Singing, mingling and dancing in close contact with others, in closed spaces and crowded places, is not the way to party this summer.”

Despite the exposure incident involving individuals in their 20s and 30s at two parties in Kelowna, Dr. Henry stated yesterday that B.C. has not seen the same large surges of cases in this age group that some other jurisdictions, such as Alberta and Ontario, have.

Overdose crisis

While the pandemic continues, it is also exacerbating B.C.’s other ongoing health emergency: the overdose crisis.

Dr. Henry explained on June 12, in response to the B.C. Coroners Service reporting a new record number of overdose deaths, that because of pandemic restrictions and health measures, illegal drug supply chains have been disrupted, resulting in the increased toxicity of drugs being created and more individuals using drugs alone, which heightens risk of overdoses.

Today, the federal government announced that approximately $2 million in funding will be allocated for a four-year pilot project in B.C.’s Island Health region.

This project will use pharmaceutical-grade medication as an alternative to toxic drug supplies for select patients in Cowichan Valley who haven’t responded to other treatments.

At-risk individuals will be able to access hydromorphone tablets from a licensed prescriber and receive other services, including peer support, medical care, mental-health support, and a personal support plan.

The project will help to provide evidence for developing safer supply programs.",[]

This is the fourth in a series of articles looking at the culture of sexual harassment and intimidation within Canadian police forces.

There are so many allegations of sexual harassment and abuse by police against police that it's hard to keep track.

Here's some awful highlights from Canada over the last few years.

Horse abuse and harassment allegations at RCMP Musical Ride

The RCMP's ""Musical Ride"" is supposed to be a fun showcase of equestrian skill.

Instead, it's a centre for animal abuse and alleged intense sexual harassment.

In 2017, it was found that RCMP riding master Sgt.-Maj. Marc Godue, instructor with the famed RCMP ""Musical Ride"", had been abusing the horses for many years.

Godue had been made riding master in 2014, despite previous allegations stretching over years of his fits of rage, punching horses, purposefully riding a horse into wall, and beating a horse with a riding crop until its belly was bleeding.

CTV News reported that 10 people involved with the Musical Ride refused to appear on camera for fear of reprisals if they spoke out against the horse abuse.

A year before he was named riding master, Godue was one of 13 people named in a lawsuit by RCMP Staff Sgt. Caroline O'Farrell. O'Farrell claims she was sexually assaulted and harassed while she worked as a constable with the Musical Ride.

The allegations were never proven in court. O'Farrell reached a settlement in April 2017.

O'Farrell described it this way to CBC broadcaster Carol Off before the case was settled: ""They gang up on you. They grab you. They hold you above a concrete floor by your limbs, they hose you down and then they drag you—face down—through the riding school, which is full of horse urine and feces. Then, they kick the shavings on your face. This happened to me several times. They also pulled down the zipper of the coveralls and poured cold water on my white T-shirt, wearing a bra, and said, 'let's see your high beams come out.' ""

""It was a deliberate campaign of harassment, discrimination, abuse, sabotage of my equipment, heckling. No matter what I did, it just got worse and worse and worse,"" O'Farrell continued. ""They locked me in a room. They made a mock trial. Two or three men stood in front of the door. They demanded I give them my underwear. When I refused, they gave me another 'shit troughing'. They did so many, so many things to me. I could go on and on.""

Fellow officers allegedly openly took bets on when she would commit suicide, according to CBC News. On the lounge chalkboard, officers allegedly wrote ""one loaded gun wanted, one Mack truck wanted."" The ""Mack truck"" was a callous reference to another Musical Ride officer who had jumped in front of a Mack truck after similar harassment.

Officer suicides

Last column we looked at the tragic suicide of VPD officer Nicole Chan, which occurred after months of delays in her complaint against two senior officers. Her death was followed by allegations from another female officer that her colleagues had told her to ""just eat a gun"" when she complained of ongoing sexual harassment.

Const. Chan's suicide in January 2019 came one year after the suicide of former B.C. RCMP officer Krista Carle. Carle was one of several officers who went public in 2011 about sexual harassment from their superiors.

Carle worked for the RCMP for 19 years. According to the Globe and Mail, she said that within weeks of starting her job, she found graphic pornography “in my desk, in my training manual, in all my investigational files, in my briefcase"". She claimed male officers also often asked her lewd questions, touched her inappropriately, and that she was assaulted by a coworker in her apartment.

In 2011, Carle told the Globe and Mail that she had spoken to numerous police officers grappling with harassment, some of whom were fighting suicidal thoughts. “You try to help as many people as you can, but there are so many of them. And some of them aren’t going to make it.”

Ottawa sexual harassment claims

Meanwhile, 14 women working for the Ottawa Police Service have come forward with complaints of being sexually harassed or assaulted by police officers.

Plus, Ottawa's deputy police chief, Uday Jaswal, is personally facing six disciplinary charges for allegedly sexually harassing two female Ottawa police officers and allegedly sexually harassing and assaulting a civilian employee.

The Ottawa Police Association says there are more women with allegations against Jaswal, but they're reluctant to come forward out of fear of reprisals.

None of the allegations have been proven in court.

Waterloo harassment lawsuit dismissed

A group of female and male officers was trying to sue the Waterloo Regional Police Service for decades of alleged sexual harassment.

The harassment includes claims of being driven to remote areas and asked to perform oral sex, having safety equipment removed from their police vehicles, lewd text messages in the middle of the night, and a female officer being dragged into a men's change room by male colleagues.

None of the allegations have been proven in court.

Lower courts dismissed their civil lawsuit, saying the plaintiffs should instead use the union grievance process or go to a human rights tribunal. Last year, the Supreme Court declined to hear their appeal.

Next column, we'll talk about how the RCMP is in the middle of paying out hundreds of millions of dollars to cover hundreds of claims of severe harassment abuse, while also facing a billion-dollar class-action lawsuit from tens of thousands of employees, contractors, and volunteers with similar claims against officers.",[]

An NDP MLA from Vancouver is calling for a Liberal MLA to be removed from the B.C Liberal caucus due to concerns about LGBT issues.

Today (July 15), West End–Coal Harbour MLA Spencer Chandra Herbert sent a letter to B.C. Liberal leader Andrew Wilkinson, which he also posted online.

Chandra Herbert, who is openly gay and advocates for LGBT rights, referred to a report by Press Progress on June 30 that revealed that B.C. Liberals over $1,7000 on advertisements in the Christian publication Light Magazine, which has published anti–LGBT perspectives.

He noted how Wilkinson issued a statement on June 30, in response to the news, in which he said that “there is no room in the B.C. Liberal Party for homophobia, transphobia, or any other form of discrimination”.

Yet while some B.C. Liberal MLAs apologized for these ads, others did not. MLA Marvin Hunt’s advertisements appeared in the July issue of the magazine but were later removed.

In addition, Chilliwack-Kent MLA Laurie Throness, the B.C. Liberal critic for the Ministry of Children and Families, told CTV News on July 3 that he would continue to advertise in the publication because it reflects his own values and to reach his constituents.

He also defended an article in the magazine that raised concerns about a bill proposing a ban on conversion therapy, which has been deemed a discredited, pseudoscientific, and potentially traumatic attempt to change a person’s sexual orientation. In June 2018, Vancouver became the first Canadian city to ban conversion therapy and Canada has tabled legislation to prohibit it as well.

“Sit with that for a second,” Chandra Herbert stated in his letter to Wilkinson. “the MLA you’ve put in charge of child care and supporting vulnerable children believes there is a place for conversion therapy.”

Chandra Herbert also listed Thorness’ previous anti-LGBT stances, including not supporting the addition of gender identity or expression in the B.C. Human Rights Code; criticizing B.C.’s LGBT school resource SOGI 123; and defending Chilliwack school trustee Barry Neufeld, who has a history of expressing controversial anti-LGBT views.

When B.C. Education Minister Rob Fleming was asked about the B.C. Liberal advertisements in Light Magazine, he stated on July 9 that it is a concern to him.

“We started the Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity [SOGI] initiative some years ago and have continued that partnership knowing that LGBTQ students are vulnerable to bullying, are vulnerable to mental-health issues, are vulnerable to dropping out of school, and that we had to get the entire school system to be a safe and welcoming place for all students,” he said. “And this magazine seems to promote an agenda that that needs to be attacked and by using tax dollars from MLAs’ constituency offices. It’s reprehensible in my view.”

Chandra Herbert stated that he wants Wilkinson to remove Throness from the B.C. Liberal caucus or at least remove him from his role as opposition critic for the Ministry of Children and Families.",[]

During her daily B.C. COVID-19 briefings, B.C. provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry has often credited British Columbians with helping to avert a major health disaster. Our ability to wrangle the pandemic under control has been admired by many, including the New York Times.

Yet the recent resurgence in Australia and news of American states reentering lockdowns demonstrate that mismanagement, complacency, or reopening too fast and too soon can undermine progress.

To help counterbalance the troubling news of the past few months, here’s a look at what B.C. did right in the effort to stem the spread of COVID-19—with an eye on what needs to be dealt with to sustain this effort over the long term.

B.C. provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix

Pacific Rim proximity

With our trans-Pacific travel routes, population demographics, and nearness to Asia and Washington state, many experts anticipated the pandemic would hit B.C. hard.

University of Ottawa health sciences associate professor Raywat Deonandan was among those who believed so, based on those reasons plus the opioid epidemic and what B.C. physicians had told him.

What happened in B.C. defied many expectations, however.

“The rate at which it got under control was a little shocking to me,” Deonandan said by phone from Ottawa.

Likewise, some of the earliest-hit locations close to China—including Taiwan, Vietnam, Thailand, Australia, and New Zealand—responded more effectively than some farther-flung places: Iran, Italy, Spain, Ontario and Quebec in Canada, and New York and Florida in the U.S.

While the great mask debate rages stateside, Metro Vancouver citizens may have benefited from being well-acquainted with seeing Asian people customarily wearing them and stores selling them. In addition, Chinese Canadians, taking cues from and paying attention to China’s situation, became an advance-warning system in the Lower Mainland by taking precautions such as vacating restaurants and malls—a foreshadowing of what was to come.

University of Ottawa associate professor Raywat Deonandan was shocked at how fast B.C. got COVID-19 under control.

Timing and testing

Many experts, including Henry, have partly credited B.C.’s success to timing and luck.

B.C.’s school spring break, from March 15 to 26, took place later or lasted longer than those of Quebec (March 2 to 9) and Ontario (March 16 to 20). Prior to spring break, Henry had approved of people visiting outdoor-oriented locales, such as Whistler. However, Dix said that the large numbers of infected travellers returning to Quebec from abroad prompted B.C.'s warning not to travel.

Deonandan credits B.C. with testing quickly, with effective data-sharing (B.C. used its own test, whereas other provinces had to await federal confirmation), and—after health-care staff working at multiple long-term care or assisted-living facilities were found to be virus transmitters—with faster implementation of a single-site strategy for workers than Ontario and Quebec.

On the line with the Georgia Straight, B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix pointed out the Interior and Northern health regions didn’t have care-home resident cases (there were two staff cases), while there weren’t any care-home cases at all on Vancouver Island.

However, Deonandan feels that all regions failed in hunting cases down as they arose, and that B.C. was slow to start that process.

“Given that it’s an asymptomatic pandemic, you can’t just rely upon symptomatic people to present themselves—you’ve got to go out and find the asymptomatic ones,” he said.

However, Dix said the early testing in B.C. was “essential” in breaking transmission chains and slowing virus spread, such as identifying the so-called Case 6 from Iran and those from Washington state, which recognized new sources of incoming cases not from China.

Dix said that within this province, the places closest to the I-5 transportation corridor and Metro Vancouver struggled the most. Consequently, being early advocates for the closure of the Canada–U.S. border, he said, proved crucial. (Premier Horgan has also asked deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland to address the issue of U.S citizens travelling through B.C to Alaska.)

Another critical factor was amassing enough personal protective equipment (PPE) for health-care workers before shortages affected their ability to treat patients.

Although Dix said that B.C. already had a “fairly good stockpile of PPE” before the pandemic took root, the usage rate increased “exponentially in February and March”. As supply chains from traditional sources like 3M collapsed because of demand, Dix said B.C. had to seek out nontraditional sources, independent of the federal government.

He added that this will remain an issue, as the province has to continue to build up supplies for both the coming period and the long term, increase capacity for testing and contact tracing, and establish a plan for influenza season.

Overall, Dix also credits the leadership of Henry, deputy health minister Stephen Brown, and “outstanding [regional] medical health officers” such as Vancouver Coastal Health’s Patricia Daly, as well as Premier Horgan for not intervening as much as other premiers.

Dix had also previously stated at a briefing that he thinks B.C.’s health authorities—five regional health authorities, the First Nations Health Authority, and the Provincial Health Services Authority—worked effectively together on a coordinated response, whereas Ontario has to work with a much greater number of health jurisdictions.

In addition, B.C.’s population (5.1 million) is smaller than those of Ontario (14.7 million) and Quebec (8.6 million) and distributed differently. Also, B.C. only has one major metropolitan centre, compared with a few in Ontario, as Deonandan pointed out.

Although Dix acknowledged that B.C. didn’t always get everything right, he said he believes that the province’s willingness to adapt is a strength.

While Deonandan noted how Dr. Henry has previous pandemic experience, including SARS, to draw upon, he said he admires how she responds to and incorporates new developments.

Both Henry and Canada’s chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, previously didn’t recommend masks, but they changed their advice after increased understanding of the virus. And Henry remained consistent in advising that masks protect others, not the wearer, which Deonandan said is accurate, whereas in the U.S. mask-wearing is portrayed as protecting oneself.

In addition, B.C. proved to be innovative as well. Dix said that the self-isolation system for returning travellers was unique in Canada, and B.C. also implemented a system for quarantining temporary foreign workers (24 of whom tested positive while in quarantine).

Needless to say, Henry’s communication abilities have been widely lauded.

“Enough can’t be said around the singularity of the vision and consistency in messaging and the sobriety of that messaging,” Deonandan said of Henry. “She answers questions quickly and always in a consistent voice and a nonpolitical voice at the same time.”

UBC psychiatry professor and The Psychology of Pandemics author Steven Taylor also approved of Dr. Henry and Dix's briefings, stating that they have established themselves to be “trustworthy sources” and consistent, in contrast to unreliable or non-science-based political figures.

“They’ve been straightforward; they don’t sensationalize things; they acknowledge uncertainties; their advice is generally sound and practical,” he said by phone.

When asked why Henry was allowed to take centre stage rather than the government (as in some other provinces), Dix explained that Henry led daily briefings from the outset because he thought medical announcements should come from medical professionals.

“I personally felt it was important to not have…too many spokespeople,” he said, “that we had to give clear messages, that they always had to come from the same place at the same time.”

Dix opted to cover “system announcements”, such as surgeries and strategies, and backed up Dr. Henry, often providing stronger stances on political issues including border control and anti-Asian attacks. He explained that their on-camera presentations reflect their organizational structure behind the scenes.

In contrast, Deonandan pointed out how Ontario's COVID-19 presentations made things unnecessarily complicated, had inconsistent messaging, were unclear about who was in charge, and focused on message management more than message transparency.

“We made so many mistakes that we’ll be rewriting the textbook on how to manage this in the future,” he said of Ontario, “but it looks like the B.C. playbook will be one of the positive ones that we will look to rewrite that textbook.”

Nevertheless, he believes that all of public health can learn how to improve messaging and conduct it in a more nuanced and strategic manner as we continue into new stages of the pandemic, with new challenges to face.

Meanwhile, Dix expressed gratitude for the collective effort by British Columbians.

“It’s one thing to provide public-health information, as Dr. Henry did—it’s another thing when people follow it and you can see the action in terms of flattening the curve from what people did,” Dix said. “It’s beyond moving.”",[]

Not too long ago, it was a bit dicey to talk about things like having a bug-out location in case things went sideways.

That could get one dismissed as a wacko.

It was more fashionable to chat about having a lakeside cabin for vacations with family and friends.

A recreational property is a status symbol.

A waterfront cottage is a marker that one has made it in life.

Then the COVID-19 pandemic happened and made almost everyone an amateur survivalist.

Now having a place in the country to escape the city is serious talk among folks who have spare change lying around.

This partially explains why realtor Richard Osborne’s days have been hectic of late.

“I haven’t been this busy since 2005,” Osborne told the Georgia Straight in a phone interview.

Osborne is the cofounder and president of LandQuest Realty Corporation, a New Westminster-based company that specializes in rural properties.

According to him, people are looking for properties outside urban areas because of uncertainties.

“I’ve heard people say that. I’ve also heard people say that…having the cash in the bank is not a good idea in times like this, or in times of, you know, looking towards future recessions, depressions, hyperinflation, whatever is coming,” Osborne said.

“I mean, people are worried,” he continued. “It’s crazy, and there’s so much uncertainty. But they want a place to go.”

In addition to simple relaxation, people typically want rural properties because of the many recreational activities they can access. Hiking, fishing, and hunting are among the most popular.

The coronavirus pandemic gives yet another reason to consider buying a tract of land outside the city.

“Certainly, the ability to have a place to get to out of the city is a big one,” Osborne said.

Recreational properties cover a wide range and can include farms and ranches.

“They don’t actually have to be a farmer to have the enjoyment of the property, and they can make some income from the sale of hay or grazing cattle on their ranch, so that certainly qualifies,” Osborne explained.

When Osborne granted the interview, he was at his family’s cabin in Sidney, a town on the southeastern tip of Vancouver Island.

“I spent the first two months of COVID here, and it was absolutely wonderful,” he said. “Then we had to go back home, but we’re back over here and it’s amazing.”

Among Osborne’s recent deals was a 259-hectare property in Rock Creek, a former gold- and silver-mining town in the South Okanagan region.

The property was listed on April 1, 2020, and it generated the most calls Osborne ever had on a single listing.

It sold full price for $995,000 less than a month later.

A brochure described the property as a “wildlife masterpiece” and a “habitat for the elk, whitetail deer, mule deer, moose, bears, bobcats, lynx, cougars and blue grouse that inhabit the property”.

It has a 914-square-foot two-storey cabin with four bedrooms.

Osborne also noted that visitors to LandQuest’s website have almost doubled since the pandemic started.

“That’s a direct COVID response,” Osborne said, noting that there’s “all these captive audiences at home on their computers, and they’re not spending their time driving.

“They’re shopping for real estate or looking at real estate and also buying it. So it’s fascinating, and it’s absolutely COVID-related.”

There’s also another thing happening that Osborne hasn’t seen before.

“We’ve had multiple offers on numerous places, which is very unusual for our world,” he said. “You know, it’s not like the city, where you get a whole bunch of people lined up to buy a house. [Yet] we’ve had multiple offers for ranches.”

A check with LandQuest’s site shows that one doesn’t have to travel half a day or more from Vancouver to get a recreational property.

As of Monday (July 13), there was a listing for a half-hectare oceanfront lot up Indian Arm. It’s seven kilometres from Deep Cove in the District of North Vancouver and can be accessed by boat only. It’s selling for $315,000.",[]

Diversity is strength. That’s true in nature and human affairs.

But recent painful events have shown society has yet to grasp this. The appalling deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Toronto’s Regis Korchinski-Paquet, Chantel Moore from Tla-o-qui-aht First Nation, and many others—all at the hands of those tasked to serve and protect—have ignited awareness of the intense, often violent racial discrimination that continues to oppress Black, Indigenous, and people of colour in Canada and the U.S.

The overwhelming call to end race-based discrimination demands we take stock and action. This needs to include an examination of how environmental harm disproportionately affects vulnerable populations and marginalized communities.

Canada’s main pollution-prevention law, the 269-page Canadian Environmental Protection Act, doesn’t include one mention of environmental justice, human rights, or vulnerable populations.

Yet, in urban areas, 25 percent of the lowest socio-economic status neighbourhoods are within a kilometre of a major polluting industrial facility compared to just seven percent of the wealthiest. Income inequality in Canada also has a racial dimension. A 2019 analysis found racialized men earned 78 cents for every dollar that nonracialized men earned, while racialized women earned 59 cents (nonracialized women earned 67 cents for every dollar that nonracialized men earned).

About 40 percent of Canada’s petrochemical industry operates within a few kilometres of Sarnia and the Aamjiwnaang First Nation, exposing community members to a range of harmful pollutants. Inuit in Canada’s North are at greater risk of economic losses and poor health as a result of climate change, with rapid Arctic warming jeopardizing hunting and many other activities.

Marginalized communities can also be more susceptible to insidious toxic exposures. For example, endocrine-disrupting chemicals, even at low levels, can interfere with hormone functioning. We’re all exposed to them in myriad ways, from food pesticide residues and personal-care product ingredients to textile treatments, product packaging, and industrial air pollution. American researchers identified higher exposure levels in ethnic minorities and a corresponding higher disease burden. They hypothesize that cultural behaviours, consumption patterns, and proximity of industrial facilities and waste sites could contribute to these disparities.

These are just a few examples. Unresponsive environmental policies systematically result in concentration of pollution risks—and inadequate access to environmental benefits—in disadvantaged Canadian communities.

This year, MP Lenore Zann introduced Bill C-230, the National Strategy to Redress Environmental Racism Act. It begins by recognizing that “a disproportionate number of people who live in environmentally hazardous areas are members of an Indigenous or racialized community.” The bill would require the environment minister to examine the link between race, socioeconomic status, and environmental risk; develop a strategy to redress environmental racism; and report regularly on progress.

Canada should recognize the human right to a healthy environment in law, as most countries do, and legislate requirements to protect vulnerable communities from pollution and toxic substances.

Human-rights impact assessment offers one approach to operationalizing environmental rights. It involves a process to identify, understand, and address potential discriminatory effects of a proposed action, and a commitment to prevent adverse human-rights impacts. Often this begins with something as basic as gathering data to better understand racial dimensions of potential effects.

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development recommends it in its Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct for corporations operating abroad. Last year the UN Human Rights Council adopted guiding principles for human-rights impact assessment for economic-reform policies. A parallel process for environmental regulation could ensure everyone benefits from environmental-protection measures.

In their mandate letters, Canada’s ministers of health and environment were tasked with “better [protecting] people and the environment from toxins and other pollution, including by strengthening the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999”. In 2020, strengthening environmental legislation must incorporate human rights.

A human-rights lens would remove a blind spot and hardwire into the decision-making process a commitment to ensuring a healthy environment for all. It would help prevent environmental racism, while MP Zann’s bill aims to redress harm already done.

When Parliament resumes, MPs should prioritize passing Zann’s bill and amendments to strengthen the Environmental Protection Act, including environmental-rights provisions. The unequal effects of environmental harm must be part of the reflection on systemic racism. But more is needed. Integrating a human-rights lens into environmental decision-making is long overdue.",[]

1 of 1 2 of 1

By Pamela Palmater

One year ago, the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls found Canada guilty of both historic and ongoing genocide. Federal and provincial laws, policies, and practices governing Indigenous child welfare in Canada have created a humanitarian crisis.

But despite the concerns raised by both the United Nations and the Organization of American States, Canada has yet to develop a national action plan to end the genocide. Government officials have barely blinked since this release of the final report.

A “historic” memorandum of understanding (MOU) to talk about the implementation of legislation on Indigenous child welfare was announced this week by Indigenous Services Minister Marc Miller and Assembly of First Nations (AFN) National Chief Perry Bellegarde. The document is referred to as a protocol on C-92, An Act Respecting First Nations, Inuit and Metis Children, Youth and Families, but it’s not legally binding. One has to wonder whether there’s any intention at all of addressing this critical part of genocide against Indigenous children and families.

Indigenous children paying the biggest price

Canada’s genocide against Indigenous peoples requires a massive response. But even renewed demands for action have been met with excuses related to the pandemic – another issue which poses a greater risk to Indigenous peoples because of Canada’s historic neglect of First Nations.

Various United Nations officials have called on countries to ensure that the pandemic is not used to ignore issues facing Indigenous peoples, yet this is precisely what’s happening and it’s First Nations children that are paying the biggest price.

Indigenous children make up seven percent of the youth population in Canada but represent approximately 50 percent of those in foster care. In provinces like Manitoba, those numbers jump to an astounding 90 percent.

Similarly, half of all youth in juvenile corrections in Canada are Indigenous.

In provinces like Saskatchewan, their numbers can be as high as 92 percent for Indigenous boys and 98 percent for Indigenous girls.

The former Indigenous services minister, Jane Philpott, called the situation a “humanitarian crisis”. Yet, there has been no corresponding response to begin to remedy the situation.

This is especially troubling since the majority of First Nations children behind bars are being incarcerated for reasons associated with poverty, not violent crime. We also know that two-thirds of Indigenous peoples in prisons have at one time or another been affected by the child welfare system.

The national inquiry already determined that Canada has demonstrated “ample evidence of a genocidal policy [and] a manifest pattern of similar conduct which reflects an intention to destroy Indigenous peoples” physically, biologically, and as social units. This humanitarian crisis of First Nations children in foster care is a core part of the ongoing genocide of Indigenous peoples. No memorandum of understanding is going to solve that.

MOUs between Canada and the AFN are neither historic nor unique. They’ve been primarily used in the past as public relations documents meant to make it look like the federal government is taking concrete action to address the many injustices facing First Nations. They contain lots of flowery language about making important changes.

But they have little force in law. Ultimately, they are part of the instruments used to justify more roundtables to engage in dialogue.

The AFN has received millions in funding related to various MOUs over the years. The agreements do little more than entrench the status quo when it comes to politics between Canada and First Nations. They rarely end in concrete commitments—other than committing to meet and talk about possible processes and developing a greater understanding between one another.

In 2016, the AFN signed an MOU with Indigenous Affairs that committed to meeting to developing processes to review the fiscal relationship between Canada and Indigenous peoples. In the same year, the AFN signed an MOU with the RCMP to meet twice a year and ensure that the AFN was the primary contact on policing issues.

It’s very clear given recent events that the AFN MOU with the RCMP did little more than prop up the RCMP, while Indigenous peoples continue to suffer racialized violence at the hands of the RCMP.

Canada and the AFN signed another MOU in 2017 intended to establish a “process” to deal with policing and socioeconomic conditions in First Nations. Yet, the situation on both fronts has only become worse.

Now, we have Canada-AFN MOU on child welfare that talks about the critical funding that Canada promised would be attached to C-92, but was excluded.

This MOU includes promises of a joint working group, subcommittees on various issues, and another fiscal table all designed for discussions to “explore processes” on issues related to the implementation of child-welfare legislation.

Funding is not needed for more AFN engagement on this legislation. Federal funding is needed to fully comply with the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal decisions that have ordered Canada to stop discriminating against First Nations children and to compensate them for years of discrimination.

Federal funding is also needed to support the actual First Nations governments with their governing jurisdictions and mandates over child and family matters for their citizens, as well as for education, training, supports, and infrastructure to both improve current systems and create new ones.

The AFN does not engage in the management of child welfare nor is it a government with any jurisdiction to make any operative decisions on child welfare governance in First Nations.

While the MOU purports not to limit the autonomy of First Nations, past MOUs between Canada and the AFN seem to do just that.

Instead of working with First Nation governments to respect their rights and provide the funding that is owed for child welfare, Canada continues to dance around the edges.

We need international intervention from OAS and the UN to oversee an Indigenous-led national action plan to urgently transition Canada out of genocide and end the ongoing theft of our children. You can bet MOUs won’t be part of the plan.",[]

The good news is that the number of new cases today (July 14) dropped from the levels reported over the past few days.

B.C. provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix responded to questions about whether the recent numbers of cases over the past few days are cause for concern, and about the U.S.–Canada border and travel.

Daily update: July 14

At today’s briefing, Dr. Henry announced there are 13 new cases, which brings the cumulative provincial total to 3,128 cases over the duration of the pandemic. That includes 1,015 Vancouver Coastal Health; 1,649 in Fraser Health; 135 in Island Health, 212 in Interior Health; 65 in Northern Health; and 52 cases among people who live outside Canada.

At the moment, there are 209 active cases. There are 14 people in hospital (including five patients in intensive care units) and Dix stated that nine of those people are in Fraser Health with the remaining five in Vancouver Coastal Health.

There aren’t any new healthcare outbreaks. Accordingly, there remain three active outbreaks in healthcare: two in longterm care facilities and one in an acute care unit.

However, there were three new cases in healthcare, bringing the totals to 399 residents and 252 staff who have tested positive.

There aren’t any new community outbreaks.

However, more details were revealed about the exposure events in Kelowna from June 25 to July 6.

While the number of individuals involved were reported as increasing from eight to 13 people, Dr. Henry said that the number is now at 17 people from the regions of Interior Health, Vancouver Coastal Health, and Fraser Health.

She said what they understand so far from the investigation, which remains ongoing, is that a group of people who knew each other from Interior B.C., the Lower Mainland, and Alberta met in Kelowna. Dix had previously said that the individuals are in their 20s and 30s.

Although there is an outbreak at the Krazy Cherry Fruit Co. farm (as previously announced on July 13) in Oliver, B.C., Dr. Henry stated that there isn’t evidence that the virus is spread by food and that there isn’t any risk from cherries from the Krazy Cherry Fruit farm.

However, she reminded people to still wash all food carefully before eating it.

Dr. Henry reminded those who may have been exposed to not only monitor their symptoms for 14 days but to also limit their social contacts during that period. Anyone who has symptoms should call 811.

Thankfully, there aren’t any new deaths, leaving the total fatalities at 189 deaths.

There are a total of 2,730 people who have recovered.

Increase in case numbers

Although B.C. had a series of consecutive days with new cases numbering 20 or more since July 8, Dr. Henry said that around 20 remains a small number “given our population”.

While she did express some nervousness about the situation, she said it would be more “worrisome” if the new cases weren’t linked and they didn’t know where the infections were coming from.

“It was distressing for me to see, especially 25 one day—that’s way above my comfort zone—but it is not unexpected and we do know where those cases are,” she said. “That is the other piece that we’re trying to balance here—is us increasing our travel, increasing our contacts in a measured way, but us in public health being able to respond when we have clusters, where we have cases, making sure can find those links and find people who are exposed so that they can stay away from others and we stop those transmission chains.”

She said “a good portion” of the new cases are related to the ongoing outbreak in Holy Family Hospital longterm care home in Vancouver.

“We have very few people who are not linked to a known cluster or case yet,” she said.

However, Dr. Henry reiterated that we know that transmission increases as people move around more during phases of reopening, and that the recent cases, which aren’t unexpected, reflect that.

However, she said we need to ensure that contact tracing can be conducted quickly and efficiently to contain the spread of the virus.

When she was asked about what actions should be taken in the wake of several public exposure events taking place, she said she would try to avoid returning to closures.

“I don’t believe that it’s good to shut things down because that just drives things underground,” she said.

She said it’s better for public health to work with people and industries to figure out how things can be done in the safest possible way.

In addition, she said while they are seeing some young adults in 20 to 40 years old infected, B.C. is not experiencing the same spikes among this demographic group yet like parts of the U.S. and other parts of Canada, including Alberta and Ontario, are.

In addition, both she and Dix repeated the importance of continuing on with health measures to protect all involved.

“We learned that indecision is the acquaintance of COVID-19, inconsistency is its friend, and bad decisions are its closest ally,” Dix said.

Canada–U.S border and travel

The current extension of the closure of the Canada–U.S. border to nonessential travel, which was first introduced in March and since been repeatedly extended, was slated to expire on July 21.

However, Canadian and American officials have agreed to extend the border closure until August 21.

Dix said it’s “positive and necessary news” and he said it’s important that there are restrictions not only on Americans visiting Canada but also Canadians visiting the U.S., as he has previously explained it’s important to prevent the virus from being brought back with returning Canadians.

The decision was made despite an open letter dated July 3 from 29 U.S. Congress members asking the Canadian government for a phased reopening of the border.

However, a spokesperson for Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland told CTV that the health of Canadians remain a priority and that decisions about the border are made by Canadians for Canadians.

Meanwhile, as both domestic and international flights continue in and out of the province, several flights arriving at or departing from Vancouver International Airport (YVR) over the past month have been confirmed with COVID-19 cases aboard.

Dr. Henry said that travellers arriving with symptoms cause her “great consternation”.

She said it extremely important for airlines to collect and provide appropriate contact information and so that public health teams are able to identify people within specific rows near someone who develops symptoms after a flight.

For example, none of the four recent flights with COVID-19 cases that arrived at YVR in recent days had affected rows or seats listed.

“One of the most challenging things we do is trying to get flight manifests a couple of days later when we recognize somebody who might be ill and the type of information that’s on those flight manifests is not very helpful in trying to followup people, which is also one of the reasons why we post things publicly,” she said.",[]

On September 27, 2019, I picked up my daughter from school and took her to the Global Climate Strike in Vancouver. At six years old, she is just starting to understand climate change. Although, how can she begin to comprehend the scale of the issue?

I worry about what lies ahead for her and her family and the challenges that they will face from the impacts of climate change. At the least, I wanted her to have a memory of people filling the streets to demand change, demand accountability, and demand action. And I was thankful that 120,000 people showed up to give her that memory.

Greta Thunberg’s famous question “how dare you?” is not something we can leave for our children to ask. We need to ask it firmly and directly of every CEO barrelling toward the expansion of fossil-fuel industries in Canada.

Right now, FortisBC is asking to expand its liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in Delta B.C.—a project that will mean an increase in carbon pollution equivalent to 49,000 cars on the road each year. Not to mention the carbon pollution that will be added from leaking, fracking or burning methane on either side of the project.

Also right now, the International Energy Agency is warning us that the next six months will be pivotal in avoiding the worst outcomes of climate change.

It is time for us to get real on climate change and liquefied natural gas. LNG is methane—a carbon-based fossil fuel. Any leaks of methane along the production line (from fracking to burning to shipping) means the release of a gas that is up to 86 times worse than carbon dioxide for warming our planet.

That’s right—the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that methane’s global warming potential is many many times worse than carbon dioxide in the first 20 years of release.

Methane leaks are hard to track and quantify—some studies have shown that we are under-reporting fugitive leaks of methane all along the production line of fracked gas. In 2018, the Pembina Institute noted that B.C. does not have sufficient reporting requirements for methane or adequate ways to detect fugitive leaks of this potent greenhouse gas.

This LNG expansion proposal is linked to increased fracking in northern B.C. In 2019, the Blueberry First Nation filed a lawsuit because of the cumulative impacts of industrial development on their lands. The Blueberry First Nation has a territory that is right in the centre of the Montney gas basin—what is called the ""sacrifice zone"" of gas fracking in B.C. Their treaty lands are littered with over 19,000 oil and gas wells, of which 36 percent are active and many are abandoned—with no company left to pay for the clean-up.

I have heard people say that with our environmental standards, consuming B.C.’s fossil fuels is better for the planet than in other jurisdictions. All of these arguments are a race to the bottom—and we are positioning ourselves as leaders on the way down.

For the first time in B.C.’s history, the government has legislated commitments on carbon emissions with targets for 2030, 2040, and 2050, and is laying a path to achieve these targets. The Clean B.C. plan creates an actual pathway to get to over 75 percent of the targeted reductions by 2030, with work underway to find the remaining 25 percent. These are arguably the most ambitious plans for carbon reduction in our province’s history. But, these emission targets are not just ambitious—they are necessary.

We need our government to succeed in its commitments to transition our economy and be leaders in supporting our workers to transition into the economies of the future. I am concerned that any new fossil fuel expansion projects will create an insurmountable gap in achieving our climate goals.

The fight to secure a better future is at our doorstep. In 2019, the Global Oil and Gas Network found that globally, 80 percent of the proposed fossil fuel expansion projects are poised to come from only four jurisdictions—B.C., Alberta, Texas and New Mexico.

Imagine if all us who care about action on climate change made it clear to those making the decisions that creating a path to a brighter future is not optional. We have until July 16 at midnight to submit comments to the Environmental Assessment Office. Tell them that FortisBC’s LNG expansion project is harmful to our communities and the planet.",[]

Original article:

The number of individuals who contracted the coronavirus from parties in Kelowna has increased as officials have responded with concerns about the spread of the virus in B.C.

On July 10, Interior Health issued the first of a series of public alerts about large-scale potential COVID-19 exposure in Kelowna’s downtown and waterfront areas from June 25 to July 6 that involved eight individuals, six of whom were from outside the health region.

Today (July 14), Interior Health is reported as stating that six more people connected to these events have since tested positive, raising the total number of 13 individuals.

Health minister provides details

At a news conference on July 13, B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix responded to questions about the outbreak.

He explained that the investigation, which he described as the “detective work of public health”, involves three health authorities—Fraser Health, Vancouver Coastal Health, and Interior Health.

The “main inciting incident” that caused the infections, he explained, were private parties at two resort hotels.

Interior Health identified the two hotels—Boyce Gyro Beach Lodge and Discovery Bay Resort—in addition to two additional sites—Cactus Club and Pace Spin Studio—where the infected individuals were present.

“When people come together for private parties—in this case, it’s largely people in their 20s and 30s—the risks are considerably higher,” he stated. “They tend to be in enclosed spaces; they tend to involve people coming from different places, different walks of life, who may not know each other at all; and the risk of those kinds of events are higher. It’s why we have limits on the overall sizes of gatherings, organized gatherings. But people, I think, have to show good judgement with respect to events.”

He added that the involvement of alcohol may make it more challenging to maintain health precautions such as physical distancing.

In both Canada and the U.S., several regions—including Alberta, Ontario, Arizona, Florida, and Texas—have reported that the majority of or significant increases in new cases are among people in the 20 to 40 year old age range.

Dix reminded everyone “how cautious they need to be” as travel continues on in Phase 3 of the province’s reopening plan.

“We can travel but we have to be as respectful of where we travel as our home community,” he said. He added that the responsibility is upon both those holding events as well as anyone accepting invitations.

“We have got to live with COVID-19 for the next year,” he said, emphasizing the importance of people understanding the risks involved.

“The most likely people who we’re going to transmit this virus to, if we become positive for COVID-19, are people who we love, and that should be reason to inspire us to follow the rules,” he said. “It’s possible in this incredible province to travel around and do so safely and show the same respect we would show to our family members that we show to people we’re visiting in one of the many communities that people may want to visit. So I think it’s about understanding that while we’re on vacation, we’re not on vacation from our responsibilities with regard to COVID-19.”

Kelowna mayor responds

Meanwhile, Kelowna Mayor Colin Basran issued a statement today about the outbreak.

“The province has not implemented travel restrictions within Canada, so we know people are going to come to Kelowna,” Basran stated in a news release.

He noted that if people don’t follow the health recommendations for travel by Dr. Bonnie Henry, the risk of transmission may increase.

“She [Dr. Henry] has also said that if people can’t maintain the level of responsibility that helped us have one of the best responses to limit COVID transmission in North America, then we may need to go back to the Phase 2 level of public health orders,” Basran said.

“We need to remain vigilant, because we’ve seen how quickly a few lapses in judgement can turn into a serious problem,” he added.

Other Okanagan incidents

In other Kelowna-related travel news, Air Canada flight 8421 from Kelowna to Vancouver on July 6 was identified as one of four flights arriving at Vancouver International Airport (YVR) with a minimum of one confirmed COVID-19 case.

Elsewhere in the Okanagan, Interior Health announced on July 13 that a community outbreak was identified at Krazy Cherry Fruit Co.'s farm in Oliver, B.C., involving two confirmed cases.

The Consul General of France in Vancouver, Philippe Sutter, has shared the following message on Bastille Day (July 14):

Dear friends and partners,

This year’s celebration of Bastille Day, the French national day, is very special for obvious reasons.

That’s why first and foremost, I wish to express our deepest gratitude for the way all the competent authorities, caregivers and front liners have managed the crisis. It’s not over but thanks to the right policy decisions our communities have been protected and stayed safe.

The motto of the French Republic is ""Liberté, égalité, fraternité"".

The nonprofit organization “West End Seniors’ Network”, chaired by one of my fellow citizen in Vancouver, has shown fraternity, this brotherhood, to the seniors in need for many years. To show our appreciation, in association with French companies, we have distributed gift bags to the organization dedicated staff.

Bastille Day 2020 is also for me an important opportunity to thank all our partners in many sectors, including our European partners for tremendous collaborations.

Due to the current crisis, we have changed our methods of work but not our common goals : promoting our shared values, solidarity and actions for a successful restart and recovery.

Trade and investments are absolutely necessary and will continue to benefit from the free trade agreement between the European Union and Canada.

In 2019, France was the number one most attractive country for foreign investments in Europe. These strong and solid grounds of our economy will allow us all to rebound with confidence from COVID-19.

Since July 2, you can travel to France, you can get visas if required. You are most welcomed, for pleasure, sport, culture and hiking, and also to work, to study and to invest.

We want also to share more with you especially in the field of innovation, to move forward in this common recovery : more links between science, research, companies, startups, thanks to the new digital platform In2novation, more cooperation biodiversity and clean tech, and of course in cultural and creatives industries like VR.

Be kind, be calm and be safe and let’s see each other very soon.

All the best and take care, long live France, long live Canada, and long live our friendship.",[]

Home sales and prices in British Columbia are rising in the face of the ongoing pandemic.

It’s affirming what RBC Economics observed that the housing market in the country is proving to be more resilient than expected.

In a new report, the B.C. Real Estate Association (BCREA) stated that 8,166 homes were sold in the province in June 2020.

The number represents a 16.9 percent increase from June 2019.

Also, June 2020 sales mean an 81 percent rise from May 2020 deals involving 4,518 homes.

The average price of a home in B.C. was $748,155 in June 2020.

This price is a 9.1 per cent increase from $685,968 from the same month last year.

The June 2020 average price was higher than the $728,898 average price in May this year.

The total value of home sales in June was $6.1 billion, a 27.5 percent increase over 2019.

“Sales around the province surged back to pre-COVID-19 levels in June,"" BCREA chief economist Brendon Ogmundson said in a news release Tuesday (July 14).

Year-to-date, the dollar volume of residential sales was up 0.6 percent to $24.7 billion, compared with the same period in 2019, according to the BCREA.

The BCREA also reported that unit sales year-to-date were down eight percent to 32,875 units, while the average price was up 9.4 percent to $751,722.

Ogmundson said: “While there are some temporary factors that may have pushed demand forward, we are cautiously optimistic that market activity will remain firm.""",[]

Often in politics, you have to pay close attention to the timing of significant developments.

And the timing is worth noting in connection with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's apology to Canadians this week.

Trudeau expressed regret yesterday about not recusing himself from cabinet discussions concerning a sole-source, $19.5-million contract to WE Charity to administer the Canada Student Service Grant program.

It came hours after a blistering news release from Democracy Watch, which called for a ""different"" ethics inquiry and a ""different"" RCMP investigation.

Trudeau's wife is an ambassador for WE Charity. His mother and brother have received large payments from a for-profit company, Me to WE, which generates income from WE Charity events, according to Charity Intelligence.

This week, Transportation Minister Marc Garneau's office revealed to the Globe and Mail that he was unaware of Trudeau's family members being paid prior to the contract being awarded.

It suggests that these payments were not discussed, let alone disclosed, during the cabinet deliberations about the contract.

Democracy Watch has asked RCMP Commissioner Brenda Lucki to conduct an investigation into a ""possible violation"" of the Criminal Code of Canada's section on breach of trust.

The group wants this investigation to relate to Trudeau's participation in the approval of the sole-source contract, as well as to whether officials acting on his behalf attempted to influence anyone's decision in favour of recommending this.

In its letter to the RCMP—released just hours before Trudeau's apology—Democracy Watch lays out the evidence with a series of links to various news stories. Then it argues that there's merit for a breach of trust probe, based on a five-part test established by the courts.

There are two concepts well known to criminal lawyers: mens rea and actus reus.

Mens rea is often called the ""presence of a guilty mind"" or ""criminal intent"".

Actus reus is the voluntary action of committing a crime.

In many crimes, mens rea—i.e. criminal intent—is required for a conviction.

Trudeau's apology conveyed the impression that he was unaware of the consequences of participating in the cabinet discussion.

There was no guilty mind, or so he was implying.

Furthermore, he said that he didn't know how much his mother and brother were paid.

""I deeply regret that I have brought my mother into this situation. It's unfair to her, and I should have been thoughtful enough to recuse myself from this situation,"" Trudeau said.

But did Trudeau deliberately not reveal the close ties his family had to the WE organization to cabinet members? Or how WE had boosted his political reputation over the years, including by commissioning the video below?

Video of WE ARE CANADA - PRIME MINISTER JUSTIN TRUDEAU WE Charity hired Door Knocker Media to produce this video showcasing Justin Trudeau's admiration for Canada's young people.

Was Trudeau truly unaware that he was using his office to advance the interest of a charity for which his wife is an ambassador, giving her tremendous personal satisfaction and enhancing her public reputation?

Did he even conceive that his family's private interests, including their personal satisfaction, may have been at stake, given the impact that a global pandemic could have on an organization that's reliant on public events to generate income for its for-profit arm?

And could that have been a factor in the decision to award a sole-source contract to WE Charity?

Was there any intent in all of this to ensure that WE Charity could survive in extremely tough circumstances by marshalling the full power of the federal government to come to its assistance?

The optics aren't good.

But the apology might help Trudeau on the mens rea front, particularly if a special prosecutor ever has to make a decision whether there's a substantial likelihood of conviction by proceeding with a criminal charge.

It really doesn't matter if Trudeau is found guilty of violating the Conflict of Interest Act a third time. He can just apologize and carry on as prime minister.

Ethics commissioner Mario Dion can't send Trudeau to jail, let alone boot him out of office.

Being prosecuted for criminal breach of trust, however, is a far more serious matter. But it's far less likely to happen if there was no mens rea—no presence of a guilty mind, no criminal intent—in the eyes of a judge or a jury.",[]

In the wake of 25 new cases confirmed on July 10, the number of new cases have remained consistent over the weekend.

Meanwhile, a new community outbreak has taken place in the Okanagan and several cases have been identified on flights that arrived at Vancouver International Airport (YVR) from elsewhere in Canada as well as the U.S.

Daily update: July 13

B.C. provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix released a joint statement for today’s B.C. COVID-19 update that provided information about the past three time periods since the last update on July 10.

From July 10 to 11, there were 21 new cases; from July 11 to 12, there were 20 new cases; and from July 12 to 13, there were 21 new cases, for a total of 62 new cases over the past three days and a cumulative provincial total of 3,115 cases over the course of the pandemic.

That cumulative total includes 1,012 cases in Vancouver Coastal Health, 1,643 in Fraser Health, 135 in Island Health, 209 in Interior Health, 65 in Northern Health, and 51 cases of people who reside outside Canada.

Currently, there are 208 active cases (14 individuals are hospitalized, with five of those in intensive care).

As there aren’t any new healthcare outbreaks, there remain two longterm care facilities and one acute-care facility with active outbreaks.

However, there is a new community outbreak in the B.C. Interior.

Today, Interior Health issued an isolation order for Krazy Cherry Fruit Co. in Oliver due to two cases associated with this farm.

One case is isolating at home while the other, who is a temporary foreign worker, is isolating in a location off the farm. A connection between the two cases has not yet been determined. Interior Health stated that both cases are presumed to be contracted within B.C., as all temporary foreign workers underwent the 14-day quarantine period upon arriving in Canada.

Public health teams have restricted 36 temporary foreign workers and nine other individuals at the farm to limit transmission. Access to the farm is restricted to essential deliveries. The risk to the general public is considered low, according to Interior Health.

Over the weekend, Interior Health also issued public health alerts about potential community exposure events in Kelowna’s downtown and waterfront areas from June 25 to July 9, with four specific locations which have since been identified. (For more information, see this article. Further details were revealed as of July 14.)

Unfortunately, there have been two new deaths (both in Vancouver Coastal Health), which brings the total fatalities to 189 people who have died.

Meanwhile, a total of 2,718 people (87 percent of the cumulative total) have now recovered.

Air travel

More flights have been identified as being connected to positive cases.

At least two of them were on international flights.

American Airlines flight 1270 from Dallas to Vancouver on July 6 had at least one case. Affected seats were not identified.

United Airlines flight 375 from San Francisco to Vancouver on July 7 also had at least one case. Similarly, affected seats also weren’t specified.

Among domestic flights, two more flights were identified.

One was Air Canada flight 8421 from Kelowna to Vancouver on July 6.

The second was Air Canada flight 311 from Montreal to Vancouver on July 8.

Affected seats weren’t listed for either of these two flights.

Anyone who was on these flights should monitor themselves for symptoms for a minimum of 14 days after the flights took place. Anyone who develops symptoms should immediately self-isolate and call 811 to arrange for testing.",[]

My wife asked me to write to you about our situation. We’ve been married for 15 years. I am 50 years old and my wife is a decade younger. We are a heterosexual couple with kids. I am a submissive male and I like to play with my ass using different-sized dildos. I enormously enjoy being penetrated with sex toys. A few years ago, I introduced the idea of a FLR—female-led relationship—to my wife and she accepted it. We are a happy couple! My wife is more on the traditional side of sex, and I respect that. We have PIV sex twice a week and I try to give her pleasure as much as I can. Looks like everything is okay, right? But recently she complained that I have stopped ejaculating when we have sex. And it’s true: when we engage in vaginal penetration, I no longer ejaculate. I like it this way because I don’t lose my sex drive and I can continue. But she doesn’t like it. For her, my ejaculate is the “cherry on top” of the sex and my coming during sex is important for her pleasure and satisfaction. My wife thinks that I stopped ejaculating because I developed the habit of pleasuring myself with dildos and butt plugs in the shower. My wife thinks the toys are distracting me. Do you think it’s true? If that’s the case, what should we do? I love my wife, but I also love my butt plugs and dildos.

- Spouse Unpleased By Husband’s Un Blasts

You should come in your wife.

If your wife is in charge—you proposed a “female-led relationship” and she accepted—then she gets to give the orders and you’re supposed to do what she says. (Within reason, of course.) So when she says, “Come in me,” you should say, “How high up your vaginal canal would you like me to come?” Even if you weren’t in a female-led relationship, SUBHUB, refusing to come in your wife when you know feeling you come inside her is important to her pleasure is a weirdly literal kind of withholding behaviour—and considering how GGG your wife has been, SUBHUB, refusing to come in her so you can “continue”, presumably without her, isn’t something a loving submissive would do. It’s something a selfish asshole does.

Your wife doubtless suspects the same thing I do: you aren’t coming in her because you’d rather blow your load in the shower. She sees you when you slip out of bed to go cram sex toys in your ass and blow your load down the drain instead of finishing in her. And if that’s what you’re doing—and I’m pretty sure that’s what you’re doing—then you’re treating PIV sex with your wife as foreplay and the time you spend alone with your ass toys as the main event. If I were your wife, SUBHUB, I would find that annoying too. And however much you love your plugs and dildos, I would hope you love your wife more. At any rate, you aren’t submissive to your plugs and dildos—you’re submissive to your wife, who isn’t made of silicone and who has needs and feelings that have to be taken into account.

At the very least, SUBHUB, your wife’s pleasure should be your first priority during PIV sex—and it’s not like you can’t combine PIV with a little butt play. You can always shove one of your beloved plugs in your ass before you have PIV sex with the wife. And if you didn’t refrain from ejaculating every single time you had PIV, SUBHUB, if it was something you were allowed to do once in a while with your wife’s permission, she might be willing to accommodate your desire every 10th time you have PIV.

I am a 53-year-old guy. Since I’ve been struggling with depression and anxiety all my life, I’ve never been in a situation where sex was a possibility. I’m really dying to know what it’s like. I’ve gotten much better over the years and the women who know me think the world of me. But they aren’t in a position to help me out. Other women seem to want someone much more outgoing and confident than I am or ever will be. Confidence comes from experience and I don’t have any. My one girlfriend could not hide the fact that my inexperience offended her. Other people on blogs and such have recommended a prostitute. But that’s not really what I’m looking for. It’s about more than sex. I want someone to care for me as I am. Is there hope for me? Or has the world just left me behind?

- Very Inexperienced Relationship Guy In Need

I know it’s not what you want to hear, VIRGIN, but I agree with other blogs and such: I think you should find a sex worker. Find a nice, patient woman who does sex work and be completely upfront about why you’re seeing her: you’re so painfully self-conscious about your sexual inexperience that you find it hard to date. It may take some searching, VIRGIN, but there are sex workers who want to help their clients grow and heal. “Many people have the stereotypical misconception that all sex workers are disconnected, uncaring, and only there for the money,” said Ruby Ryder, a sex worker and sex educator. “While money is indeed a part of it, many of us understand that human beings need touch, connection, and acceptance. We provide an opportunity for clients to be vulnerable, whether it’s fulfilling their kinky fantasies or simply having sex.” And while the relationship you have with a sex worker you might see regularly for a year or two is certainly transactional, VIRGIN, it’s still a relationship and about more than sex.

I’m not suggesting you see sex workers exclusively for the rest of your life (even if I’m not not suggesting that either), VIRGIN, I’m only suggesting you see a sex worker to find out what sex is like, gain a little self-confidence, and maybe feel a little more hopeful for your future.

I’m a long-time reader who’s never had a question that your archives couldn’t answer. But there is something I wanted to share with you and your readers! My wife and I have incorporated virtual reality (VR) goggles into our sex life with great success, Dan, and they could be the answer to a range of questions that you get at the column. They’re so useful, in fact, that your failure to mention them is starting to look like a glaring omission! Because let’s say someone writes in who wants to open their relationship or explore a cuckold fantasy (like one of last week’s letter writers!) but they’re worried about the emotions involved, potential STIs, or COVID-19? VR goggles! While the offerings for female POV VR porn are pretty paltry, I’ve never seen my wife come harder than she did with me inside her and a pair of goggles on her face giving her the perspective of a man getting fucked by a beautiful trans woman. I love the idea that this turns her on and I actually think she looks hot with goggles on! Besides the cost of a subscription to a VR porn site, the financial barrier is really pretty low—most people can use their smartphone and a $20 headset to get started, which is much cheaper than seeing a sex worker and much less time-consuming than engineering a consenting affair. And there’s no risk of STIs or COVID-19! Just wanted you to consider VR as a possibly overlooked tool for your otherwise always outstanding advice in the future!

(This story is written in partnership with .)

Having a child is stressful but even more so when they have a severe food allergy. The most common allergens for young children are peanuts, dairy, tree nuts, or shellfish—and the proteins found in these foods can trigger a harmful reaction.

As a parent, it’s important that you understand how to quickly treat your child’s potentially life-threatening allergic reactions. These four tips provided by can help you effectively manage them.





Be able to recognize the symptoms

Allergy symptoms can present differently depending on the child and the severity of the reaction. Mild indications include a tingling sensation in the mouth, hives, itchy eyes, and swelling of the lips or other parts of the face. Symptoms of a more serious allergic reaction include difficulty breathing and swallowing, lightheadedness with potential of losing consciousness, severe hives, abdominal cramping, vomiting, and diarrhea.

According to iMD Health, a drop in blood pressure and fainting can be a telltale sign of an anaphylactic reaction, which requires immediate emergency medical attention. For a simple diagram that can help you remember these common symptoms of anaphylaxis, visit .





Pay close attention to what your child is eating

Until your child is able to decipher the tiny paragraph of ingredients on food labels, you’ll have to read through it on their behalf. iMD Health offers resources to help you identify the important parts of food labels, ensuring that you’re purchasing allergy-friendly items. When it comes to visiting restaurants, inform the server that your child has an allergy and don’t be afraid to mention the severity—servers would rather deal with a stern customer over a medical emergency.

If your child is heading to a birthday party or play date, try to pack specific snacks that are safe for them to eat. iMD Health also notes that parents should teach their children that it’s important to ask for help if they start feeling any allergy symptoms.





Get familiar with using an EpiPen

An EpiPen is an auto-injector filled with epinephrine, a strong antihistamine that needs to be administered if someone is experiencing an anaphylactic reaction. If your child requires an EpiPen, make sure that you are comfortable administering the medication. An EpiPen should be used when the patient is sitting or lying down and it’s crucial that the medication is not expired as that can interfere with potency.

According to iMD Health, parents of a child with food allergies should educate other family members, babysitters, and teachers, on how to use an EpiPen. If your child requires an epinephrine, talk to their doctor about getting a medical alert bracelet that indicates an anaphylactic allergy. This can save your child’s life in the event that they lose consciousness when you are not around.

Epinephrine is a safe medication and should be administered quickly. Once the EpiPen is used, the child should be immediately taken to the nearest hospital in case the allergic reaction worsens. Visit for more information on how to handle an anaphylactic emergency.





Be mindful of cross-contamination

When cooking for the family, make sure that you’re washing utensils and surfaces in hot soapy water. Purchase a set of utensils and a cutting board that can be used for preparing allergy-free foods only.

If you’re fixing multiple foods for the family, make the allergen-free meal first so that there is less chance of cross-contact. For more information on how to avoid cross-contamination, visit the Lifestyle section of .

1 of 4 2 of 4

A bright comet is now in the evening sky, and you can see it without a telescope.

Comet C/2020 F3 (NEOWISE) has been a fantastic object in the early morning predawn sky, but it will be well placed below the Big Dipper to see and photograph over the next couple of weeks and, hopefully, into August.

I have been following and imaging this comet since the first week of July and could see it even without binoculars (with the naked eye).

Gary Boyle

The comet was discovered on March 27, 2020, by the Near Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (thus, NEOWISE) space telescope as it looked for near-Earth objects that could potentially impact our planet. Measuring a little more than half the height of Mount Everest, this object falls into the category of a “once in a decade"" comet.

Comet NEOWISE Gary Boyle

Every year, astronomers both amateur and professional observe five to 10 comets with telescopes. In most cases, they show a green nucleus, which comes from the sublimation of frozen chemicals such as ammonia and others. The extremely faint tail is usually seen when photographed, but all comets are different in composition and appearance (and Neowise does not appear green).

The last bright comet that was visible to the naked eye for the whole world to see was Comet Hale-Bopp in 1997. Like NEOWISE, it had a blue ion, or gas, tail and a fan-shaped dust tail that is created when comets go around the sun, as this one did on July 3 at a ""close"" distance of 43 million kilometres.

NEOWISE will be closest to Earth on its way out of the solar system, on July 22, at a safe distance of 103 million kilometres. It will be starting to fade, with a shortening tail, as it retreats from the sun's heat and back to the icy depths of space.

Gary Boyle

Comet NEOWISE originates from the Oort Cloud, where long-period comets reside, and it will return in about 6,800 years. (Halley’s comet, by comparison, is a short-period comet—returning to our solar system approximately every 75 years—originating from the Kuiper Belt.)

1 of 1 2 of 1

Queer dating apps are leaking data that can be used by anti-gay and anti-trans governments to oppress LGBTQIA+ people around the world, a new report has found.

In a report released Tuesday, cybersecurity firm Recorded Future outlines the security holes in a number of popular dating apps, details how governments and agencies around the world are targeting LGBTQIA+ people, and offers advice for users seeking to protect themselves.

Recorded Future analyzed five popular gay dating apps catering either largely or exclusively to the queer community. Of these, they said, Scruff “is doing the most proactive work to secure the data of its users”.

Scruff’s current security policies include including randomizing location data, issuing alerts when users travel to countries with anti-gay policies, cutting ties with brokers that sell location data, and creating internal advertising and analytics operations to avoid sharing customer data with outside parties.

“By contrast, OKCupid, Grindr, and Tinder have been found to collect user data—including users’ exact location, sexual orientation, religious beliefs, political beliefs, drug use, and more—and share that data with at least 135 different third-party entities,” they wrote.

The report also offers number of examples of both law enforcement and criminals using dating apps to entrap members of the LGBTQIA+ community.

In the future, the authors write, data exposures—such as those that hit Grindr and Jack’d in recent years—are likely to occur again, worsening the problem further.

“These apps will almost certainly continue to share data with third parties and only user pressure, or a substantial fine for breaching data privacy laws, is likely to make these apps reconsider,” they add.

Meanwhile, other developers are using app-based platforms to enhance the safety and security of LGBTQ people worldwide. Dandarah, an app co-developed by a Toronto professor, was created to help trans women in Brazil avoid dangerous situations and connect with mental health support.

Despite a brief COVID-induced bear market earlier this year, it’s been a profitable year for investors in many U.S. tech giants.

As of July 13, Microsoft shares were up 29 percent and Apple shares were up 27 percent since January 2.

But that was nothing compared to Amazon stock, which shot up 64 percent over the same period to cross the US$3,100 threshold.

Each of these three of these companies are worth more than US$1.5 trillion. That will likely exceed Canada’s gross domestic product this year.

Over the same period, Netflix stock jumped 59 percent, Facebook rose 14 percent, and Alphabet (parent of Google) increased by 10 percent.

That doesn’t take into account the U.S. dollar’s five percent appreciation from January 2 to July 13 in comparison to the Canadian dollar.

This means that if any readers bought those U.S. tech stocks at the start of the year, they would be a whole lot richer today—particularly if they loaded up on Amazon or Netflix.

B.C. has a few big gainers

But what about publicly traded B.C. tech companies?

The bctechnology.com website keeps tabs on what it calls the T-Net 20 Stock Index. It’s updated quarterly and includes the 20 largest publicly traded tech companies in B.C.

The shares in these companies have, for the most part, not fared nearly as well this year as the U.S. tech stocks listed above. But there have been two standouts.

Burnaby-based Ballard Power Systems share price have risen a whopping 139 percent between January 2 and July 13, when it closed at $24.83 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. That was actually a down day—it fell by 10.91 percent, bringing its market capitalization down to $6.05 billion.

Ballard develops and manufacturers proton-exchange membrane fuel cells, announcing a $7.7-million purchase order earlier this month from a company in China in which it holds 10 percent ownership interest.

Another big gainer in the T-Net 20 Stock Index has been Vancouver-based Absolute Software Corp. It specializes in endpoint security, which is in even more demand with so many people working from home.

Its share price closed at $14.55 on the Toronto Stock Exchange on July 13, up 62 percent since January 2. That's lifted its market capitalization to $618.28 million.

Absolute Software is a finalist in two categories in the 2020 Technology Impact Awards: tech culture of the year and company of the year - anchor success.

Three other Vancouver tech companies outside of the T-Net 20 Stock Index have also seen impressive gains in their share prices this year.

XPhyto Therapeutics Corp., which is working with a German partner on a COVID-19 test, is up 177 percent.

Legend Power Systems Inc., which developed a power-management program, has seen its stock rise 110 percent since January 2.

And electric-vehicle manufacturer ElectraMeccanica is up 61 percent.

The pros often say that past performance is no guarantee of future results.

There's are good reasons for people to fear the arrival of artificial intelligence in the workplace.

An expert in this field, computer scientist Kai-Fu Lee, told CBS 60 Minutes last year that 40 percent of all jobs will be replaced by robots.

And in a video (see below) for the World Economic Forum, Lee said that the Internet giants are clearly leading the way.

Google is the leader, according to Lee, followed by Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, and the Chinese companies Baidu, Tencent, and Alibaba.

""These people have the most data—and data is fuel for AI,"" Lee said. ""By collecting so much data, their AI gets better, their user base increases, they make more money, then they hire more scientists. They buy more machines and the virtual cycle continues.""

The B.C. Institute of Technology's School of Business + Media is adapting to these monumental developments by launching an Artificial Intelligence Management option in its Business Information Technology Management program.

According to BCIT, this two-year diploma is the only program of its kind in Canada.

“We created the Artificial Intelligence Management option curriculum to train entry-level AI management knowledge workers,” BITMAN program head Malcolm Ferrier says on the school's website. “These job-ready business AI analysts will be prepared to help an organization design and implement artificial intelligence, machine learning, and business intelligence solutions.”

One of the hottest investment plays these days is psychedelics.

There have been several publicly traded startup companies formed since author Michael Pollan wrote his best-selling 2018 book, How to Change Your Mind: What the New Science of Psychedelics Teaches Us About Consciousness, Dying, Addiction, Depression, and Transcendence. Now, a Vancouver-based company, Core One Labs Inc., plans to ""develop its product offerings through research and development"" in walk-in health clinics in Vancouver and West Vancouver.

This R&D will include ""the integration of intellectual property related to psychedelic treatments and novel drug therapies"", Core One stated in a July 10 news release.

The walk-in clinics were previously owned by Rejuva Alternative Medicine Research Centre Inc. and Shahcor Health Services Inc. Together, they maintained a database of more than 200,000 patients, according to the news release.

Core One announced the purchase of the two privately owned companies in June in an exchange of shares and a one-time $400,000 cash payment of to Shahcor shareholders. The deal was completed this month.

""The Company will aim to prove increased efficacy and bioavailability of existing and novel drugs, including psilocybin, with its proprietary delivery methods currently utilized by its CannaStrip technology,"" Core One stated. ""Bioavailability of cannabis constituents in the Company’s CannaStrips infused strip allow for more efficient absorption of the active ingredients, which is an optimum delivery system for microdosing.""

On June 16, the B.C. Securities Commission issued a management cease-trade order because it had not filed audited financial statements, certification of annual filings, or annual management's discussion and analysis for the year ending December 31. Shreholers who were not insiders or a ""control person"" can continue to buy and sell the company's securities.

On July 3, Joel Shacker became CEO after Brad Eckenweiler resigned. Shacker is also the president of Mota Ventures, which is Vancouver-based Canadian Securities Exchange–listed company aiming to use ecommerce to deliver CBD directly to consumers.

On July 9, Core One consolidated its shares on a two-for-one basis.

1 of 1 2 of 1

Remember those pre-COVID-19 days of hanging out at your friends’ places and watching TV shows or movies together? Well, unless they’re in your social bubble, that’s not happening anymore. But you can approximate it with Netflix Party. Better yet, you can do it with friends who don’t even live in the same town as you—as long as everyone has a Netflix account.

Netflix Party is an extension on the Chrome browser that lets you start and stop Netflix shows together, all while chatting about the show—or whatever else is on your mind—in a separate area beside the screen. Didn’t catch a character’s name, or miss a joke? Ask someone in chat, or rewind if you all missed it. Have a theory about where the plot’s going? Throw it out there. Love a particular line of dialogue? Simply write: “Nice.”

My friend Rachel and I binged most of Better Call Saul that way, and it was a lot more fun than simply watching alone. Sometimes, we’d go for a long time without chatting, engrossed in the series’ slow-burn drama and character building. At other times, we’d send bitchy messages back and forth, often about lawyer Kim Wexler’s perky ponytail. I think Rachel had an issue with her earrings, which didn’t bother me. During particularly tense moments involving Eduardo “Lalo” Salamanca, the dangerously unstable nephew of Don Hector and a particularly nasty member of the Juárez drug cartel, one of us might simply write: “Noooo!”

Netflix Party isn’t really good for deep-dive analyses; it’s better suited to pithy statements: “So-and-so is looking puffy,” for instance, or “Was that character in Breaking Bad?” And so on. I remember at one point we both simultaneously praised the evolution of the character of Mrs Nguyen, the woman who owns the nail salon that houses Jimmy McGill’s crappy, early law office.

If something especially important happened, usually at the end of a key episode, we sometimes paused the show and switched to phone to discuss the matter at length.

Rachel admitted that watching the show this way made her pay more attention to it. Because we were “watching it together,” she said she was less likely to fiddle around with her phone or check out social media.

The downsides? If you’re watching a series, you need to make sure the other person has as much free time as you have. Four months into quarantine, life can be busy with work, video conferencing and chores. So make sure you have a good idea of your schedules before you start to determine if you’ll be able to keep up with each others’ viewing paces. It’s not really binging if you have to stop and start your Netflix Party watching.

Then again, you could just watch a comedy—or a silly reality show—together. Those things tend to work well with Netflix Party. We watched an episode of the reality series Dating Around, and it was great fun, especially pausing before the big reveal to guess which contestant would get the second date.

Other ways of watching together

It’s easy enough to watch regular TV together while talking on the phone, much like Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan did in that high-maintenance scene from Rob Reiner’s When Harry Met Sally…

With other streaming services, it’s hard to achieve perfect in-synch viewings of shows that lend themselves to group chat, like RuPaul’s Drag Race; often you’ll have to put up with annoying echoes while you talk to each other.

You could also try synching up exercise videos to do with others. Since April, another friend and I have picked equipment-free YouTube exercise videos to do at home. While keeping our phones on speakerphone, we’ve done a countdown to press play, and then completed each workout together. Having the other person on the line motivates you to keep going, complete with groans of protestation.

Since we both live alone, it’s a way of checking in with each other during a difficult time. I doubt I would do the exercises by myself. The only question we’re both wondering is: When are we going to get six-pack abs?",[]

Shareholders have reaped a windfall from a Vancouver company aiming to market a three-wheeled electric vehicle to North American consumers.

Today, the share price of ElectricaMeccanica shot up 64.54 percent on NASDAQ to close at US$5.15.

Its newest vehicle, the Solo, is a one-seater with a suggested manufacturer's sale price of $18,500.

It could be a desirable alternative in the COVID-19 era for those looking to bypass public transportation. That's because of the Solo's low operating costs.

According to ElectricaMeccanica, the vehicle reaches 128 kilometres per hour and travels 160 kilometres without needing a battery recharge.

On June 29, the company's shares opened at US$1.88, marking a 174 percent rise in just five days of trading. (U.S. markets were not open on July 3.)

The surge follows Roth Capital Partners closing the sale last month of 10 million common shares at US$2 each, generating gross proceeds of US$20 million.

This prototype of the Solo was recently spotted in Vancouver. Charlie Smith

Today, more than 172 million shares were traded. That followed a slightly less heavy day on July 2 when nearly 130 million shares were exchanged.

A Vancouver-based biotech company says that its exclusive German partner has validated a rapid prototype that could lead to an easy-to-use oral screening test for COVID-19.

XPhyto Therapeutics Corp. is aiming to develop a pipeline of potential biosensor screening products.

Today, it announced that its German partner, 3a-Diagnostic GmbH, ""has confirmed successful function of its novel and proprietary COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA probes and its universal coronavirus RNA probes in prototype lateral flow assay (the 'LFA') testing"".

Visual confirmation occurred within five to seven minutes from tests of saliva. The research took place in 3a's laboratory in Baden-Württemberg.

""We believe that a low-cost, portable and easy to use screening tool that provides rapid on-the-spot results would be a disruptive tool in the fight against pandemic threats,"" XPhyto CEO Hugh Rogers said in a news release. ""We see an enormous global market opportunity that includes individual households, schools, hospitals, public transportation, airports and border services as well as many private employers.""

RNA is an acronym for ribonucleic acid, which exists in all living cells. In coronaviruses, RNA carries genetic information.

According to XPhyto, 3a's LFA screening tests run a liquid sample ""across a matrix that contains one or more reactive compounds that provide a visual indication of a positive or negative result"".

""3a refers to their approach as 'anywhere' (no power or additional equipment required), 'anytime' (decentralized and rapidly deployable), and 'anyone' (no specialized training required),"" XPhyto stated.

The next step will be to design and manufacture tests for use in clinical evaluation.

XPhyto stated that within 30 to 60 days, 3a plans a pilot study using human saliva from health and COVID-19-infected humans.

Nature magazine describes RNA probes as ""stretches of single-stranded RNA used to detect the presence of complementary nucleic acid sequences (target sequences) by hybridization"".

""RNA probes are usually labelled, for example, with radioisotopes, epitopes, biotin or fluorophores to enable their detection,"" Nature stated.

A paper published in the peer-reviewed journal Diseases in 2016 pointed out that RNA serves as a ""template for replication and transcription"" in human coronaviruses.

""Under the electron microscope, the CoV virions appear to be roughly spherical or moderately pleomorphic, with distinct 'club-like' projections formed by the spike (S) protein,"" the researchers wrote. ""Within the virion interior lies a helically symmetrical nucleocapsid that encloses a single-stranded and positive sense RNA viral genome of an extraordinarily large size of about 26 to 32 kilobases.""

XPhyto stated that 3a has designed, engineered, and tested two RNA probes: one that's COVID-19 specific and the other that detects a universal coronavirus RNA sequence shared by all known members of this family.

""As per the screening test design and the positive prototype test results, patients infected with COVID-19 are expected to activate the COVID-19 probes and the universal coronavirus probes,"" XPhyto stated. ""Patients infected with an alternate coronavirus strain or a highly mutated form of COVID-19 are expected to activate only the universal coronavirus probes. These patients could be selected for further investigation.""

On July 3, XPhyto Therapeutics Corp.'s shares closed at $3.00 on the Canadian Securities Exchange. The company's market capitalization is $166.74 million.

An unmanned-aerial-vehicle company founded in Vancouver more than two decades ago has made some significant moves.

On July 3, Scott Larson, cofounder of Helios Wire, became the interim president of Draganfly Inc. which is now based in Saskatoon.

""Scott brings deep financial, executional and operational knowledge to the team,"" Draganfly CEO Cameron Chell said in a company news release. ""We have great confidence in Scott’s leadership and track record of excellence.”

Larson is former CEO of Kater Technologies Inc., which developed a ride-hailing app. In January, however, the Passenger Transportation Board denied its application for a licence.

Larson has had been Draganfly's lead independent director since April.

According to the company's website, its products and services are contracted in five broad areas: agriculture, public safety, military and government, environmental and energy, and insurance.

Former Bush administration officials on the board

Larson's appointment as interim president came two weeks after the company appointed a former general counsel of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, John M. Mitnick, to its board.

With Homeland Security during the George W. Bush administration, Mitnick supervised 2,500 lawyers.

From 2007 to 2013, Mitnick was vice president, general counsel, and secretary of a division of Raytheon, a large military contractor and manufacturer of missiles, air defence systems, drones, and other aerospace products.

Mitnick has been advising Draganfly since last November.

Also on Draganfly's board is Andrew Hill Card Jr., who was chief of staff to U.S. president George W. Bush from 2001 to 2006.

Card was also secretary of transportation in the administration of George H.W. Bush from 1992 to 1993, and president and CEO of the American Automobile Manufacturers Association from 1993 to 1998.

In 2018, he was elected chairman of the National Endowment for Democracy, a U.S. government-funded organization that promotes ""democratization"" in many countries.

""A lot of what we do today was done covertly 25 years ago by the CIA,"" NED founder Allan Weinstein told the Washington Post in 1991.

Draganfly director Andrew Card is chairman of the National Endowment for Democracy.

In early June, Draganfly formed a partnership with MicaSense as it announced the launch of the Draganflyer Commander Ag-Pro Package. This unmanned aerial vehicle will help in the monitoring of agricultural crops.

“We're excited about bringing this affordable new multispectral option to market” Cory Baker, Draganfly’s production manager said in a news release. “We have been working with the MicaSense lineup of cameras for several years and have been very pleased with their seamless integration support and high-quality data outputs. Our skilled engineers can incorporate any of the powerful sensors from the MicaSense portfolio onto our UAV’s.""

Also last month, Draganfly also announced a partnership with Enderby Entertainment on ""Safe Set Solutions"" to help the Beverly Hills production company resume film production.

Draganfly says its ground-based health and respiratory measurement technology can pre-screen TV and movie crews for elevated body temperatures and offer a digital display of social distancing.

“Partnering with Enderby to bring Safe Set Solutions to the film industry is a significant step to help Hollywood and the global film industry safely ramp up production,"" Chell said. ""Film industry investors, insurance companies, unions and guilds are all seeking this type of solution to protect their investments and keep workers safe.”

Draganfly shares closed at $0.64 on July 3 on the Canadian Securities Exchange. Its 52-week high has been $1.46 and it's 52-week low was $0.26.

In the first three months of 2020, Draganfly generated $497,057 in revenue, which was a 235 percent increase over the same period in 2019.

However, the company's comprehensive quarterly loss of $1.09 million was 221 percent higher than its comprehensive loss in the first quarter of 2019.",[]

This week, the Buy Shares website reported that the six top video companies have enjoyed a tremendous spike in valuations this year.

According to writer Jastra Ilic, their market capitalizations collectively rose by an eye-popping $354.5 billion.

I didn't know if I could believe that, having never heard of the Buy Shares website. So I did my own math, based on data from Y Charts.

I found that the increase from December 31 to July 2 was $569.93 billion.

It's as clear a sign as possible that video games have taken off in this year of COVID-19. And some large companies are reaping a windfall.

Keep in mind that my figures incorporate the increasing market capitalizations of three big players in the video game industry that make vast amounts of money in other areas—Microsoft, Sony, and Tencent.

Tencent isn't yet a household name in North America, but it should be: the publicly traded Chinese conglomerate is the world's largest producer of video games.

It's also one of the world's biggest social media companies through WeChat, and it's a monstrously huge venture capital player.

Tencent is based in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen in Guandong and it's listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

It achieved the highest percentage increase in market value, as shown by the chart below. All figures are in U.S. dollars.

Major League Baseball has, at times, had an uncomfortable relationship with the gambling industry through its history.

More than a century ago, in 1919, eight players with the Chicago White Sox were banned for life, including the legendary Shoeless Joe Jackson, for allegedly throwing the World Series for $5,000 each.

They were not reinstated despite being acquitted in court. Jackson set a record in the 1919 World Series with 12 base hits and he did not commit any errors.

Then there was Pete Rose, who remains the all-time leader in base hits, who was banned from the game in 1989 after Sports Illustrated revealed that he had bet on games. Charlie Hustle, as he was called, is still not eligible for the Hall of Fame.

In spite of that history, Major League Baseball has made an about-face on gambling.

Today, Toronto-based Score Media and Gaming Inc. announced a multiyear deal to become an authorized gaming operator for the league.

This means it will join six other authorized sports-betting providers in having access to Major League Baseballs' data, league marks, and logos for its mobile sports-betting app, theScore Bet.

""We're thrilled to work with MLB, helping bring our fans an even deeper experience as we begin our multistate expansion of theScore Bet,"" CEO and founder John Levy said in a company statement. ""We know our fans are eager to watch and bet on America's pastime, and we'll be ready to bring them a best-in-class integrated media and betting offering when play resumes and for seasons to come.""

The league and theScore say they will collaborate ""to protect the integrity of MLB games"".

Score Media and Gaming Inc. is traded on the TSX Venture Exchange, closing at $0.74 on June 29.

Through the first two quarters of this fiscal year, the company posted revenues of $15.9 million and a loss of $13.5 million before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.

As of February 29, 2020, it had cash and cash equivalents of $21.5 million.",[]

The former chief operating officer of a California software company will move into the top position at one of Vancouver's best-known tech firms.

On July 6, Tom Keiser will replace company founder Ryan Holmes as CEO. Holmes will remain chairman of the board.

During Keiser's four-year tenure at Zendesk, annual revenues climbed from $200 million to nearly $1 billion.

“Hootsuite is the pioneer in social media management software, and continues to lead the pack—I couldn’t be more excited and proud to join the company at this pivotal point in its journey,” Keiser said in a company news release. “I have tremendous respect for the global brand and enterprise Ryan and the team have built for over a decade while maintaining a strong company culture.

""Throughout my career I’ve learned how impactful a passionate and aligned culture, product, and team can be. I look forward to building off the momentum created here at Hootsuite to help lead the company into its next stage of growth.”

Prior to being employed at Zendesk, Keiser was executive vice president of global product operations for Gap Inc., which owns Gap, Old Navy, and Banana Republic stores.

Zendesk and Gap Inc. are both public companies traded on the New York Stock Exchange.

“Tom stood out from the start as a rare leader who has been successful in building high-performance teams that lift each other up while improving the customer experience and increasing the speed of value delivery,” Holmes said. “It’s with pride and confidence that I hand over the reins to Tom and watch excitedly from a new seat as Hootsuite drives into its next era of growth and potential.”

Several years ago, then Vancouver mayor Gregor Robertson (right) joined Hootsuite CEO Ryan Holmes to celebrate after company secured new headquarters from the City of Vancouver in Mount Pleasant.

Holmes revealed last November that he planned to step down as CEO. In an interview with the Financial Post, he also said that there were no plans to take the company public.

Hootsuite describes itself as the world's most widely used platform for managing social media, with more than 18 million users.

It was founded in 2008 and was valued at $750 million in 2019. A few months later, Hootsuite laid off dozens of staff ""to drive greater alignment with our growing company's strategic priorities"".",[]

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's attempt to curb a growing advertiser backlash hasn't halted the number of companies taking a 30-day timeout.

Three Metro Vancouver companies—technical apparel manufacturers and retailers Arc'teryx and lululemon athletica, and outdoor retailer MEC—have joined the Stop Hate for Profit campaign.

On June 17, Color of Change, the NCAAP, the Anti-Defamation League, Sleeping Giants, Free Press, and Common Sense Media came together to ask advertisers not to market themselves on Facebook in July.

The movement is in response to Facebook allowing hate speech against people demonstrating for justice for police killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and others.

""From the monetization of hate speech to discrimination in their algorithms to the proliferation of voter suppression to the silencing of Black voices, Facebook has refused to take responsibility for hate, bias, and discrimination growing on their platforms,"" Color of Change said in a news release.

Stop Hate for Profit coalition has identified 10 things that advertisers should ask Facebook to do, including updating algorithms to stop recommending people to join hate groups.

Another demand is for Facebook to ""prohibit political ads that make bald-faced lies"".

As of this writing, Facebook shares have risen 1.73 percent this morning on NASDAQ to US$217.86.

That came after a double-digit percent drop on Friday (June 26), including in after-hours trading, following Coca-Cola's decision to take a 30-day timeout on social-media advertising.

Honda and Levi's are two other big names that have made this decision. The complete list is available here.",[]

The news keeps getting worse for one of the world's most powerful social-media platforms.

Today, Facebook shares declined by 8.3 percent to US$216.08 at the closing bell today.

But in after-hours trading—often engaged in by institutional investors—the price has fallen another 1.7 percent to US$212.50.

The drop in the after-hours market occurred after Coca-Cola announced that it's taking a time-out from advertising on social-media platforms.

“There is no place for racism in the world and there is no place for racism on social media,"" Coca-Cola chairman and CEO Janes Quincey said. ""The Coca-Cola Company will pause paid advertising on all social media platforms globally for at least 30 days. We will take this time to reassess our advertising policies to determine whether revisions are needed. We also expect greater accountability and transparency from our social media partners.”

The Stop Hate for Profit movement was launched on June 17. Since then, persuaded several other companies to stop advertising on Facebook in July for allowing users to incite violence against demonstrators seeking racial justice in America following police killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and others.

Those engaging in one-month boycotts of Facebook include Unilever, Verizon, Patagonia, Ben and Jerry's, North Face, Eileen Fisher, and Viber.

Among its objections, Stop Hate for Profit blames Facebook for turning a ""blind eye to blatant voter suppression"".

""Could they protect and support Black users? Could they call out Holocaust denial as hate? Could they help get out the vote?"" the campaign asks on its website. ""They absolutely could. But they are actively choosing not to do so. 99% of Facebook’s $70 billion is made through advertising.""

The Anti-Defamation League, the NAACP Sleeping Giants, Color of Change, Free Press, and Common Sense are partners in the campaign.

Today, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg issued a statement that the platform will provide ""authoritative information on voting during the pandemic"".

This includes the creation of a Voting Information Center to share information and preventing new forms of suppressing turnout.

""For example, if someone says on Election Day that a city has been identified as a Covid hotspot, is that voter suppression or simply sharing health information?"" he wrote. ""Because of the difficulty of judging this at scale, we are adopting a policy of attaching a link to our Voting Information Center for posts that discuss voting, including from politicians. This isn't a judgment of whether the posts themselves are accurate, but we want people to have access to authoritative information either way.""

Zuckerberg also pledged a higher standard for weeding out hateful content in ads.

""We've invested heavily in both AI systems and human review teams so that now we identify almost 90% of the hate speech we remove before anyone even reports it to us,"" he noted. ""We've also set the standard in our industry by publishing regular transparency reports so people can hold us accountable for progress. We will continue investing in this work and will commit whatever resources are necessary to improve our enforcement.""

In addition, Facebook will start labelling newsworthy content from politicians and others.

""We'll allow people to share this content to condemn it, just like we do with other problematic content, because this is an important part of how we discuss what's acceptable in our society—but we'll add a prompt to tell people that the content they're sharing may violate our policies.""

The Stop Hate for Profit campaign characterized this response as ""a small number of small changes"".

It's called on Facebook to ""establish and empower permanent civil rights infrastructure including C-suite level executive with civil rights expertise to evaluate products and policies for discrimination, bias, and hate"".

In addition, the campaign wants Facebook to submit to ""regular third-party, independent audits of identity-based hate and misinformation with summary results published on a publicly accessible website"".

""We simply can no longer trust Facebook’s own claims on what they are or are not doing. A 'transparency report' is only as good as its author is independent.""

That's not all. Stop Hate for Profit is also seeking refunds for advertisers whose messages appear next to content that was removed for violating Facebook's terms of service.

And there are calls for finding and removing public and private groups focused on white supremacy, militia, antisemitism, violent conspiracies, Holocaust denial, vaccine misinformation and climate denialism.

""Stop recommending or otherwise amplifying groups or content from groups associated with hate, misinformation or conspiracies to users,"" the campaign states. ""Create an internal mechanism to automatically flag hateful content in private groups for human review. Private groups are not small gatherings of friends—but can be hundreds of thousands of people large, which many hateful groups are.""",[]

Absolute Software Corporation's ""2020 State of Endpoint Resilience Report"" includes new research re-emphasizing that ""the number of agents piling up on enterprise endpoint devices—up on average—is hindering IT and Security's ability to maintain foundational security hygiene practices, such as patching critical vulnerabilities, which may actually weaken endpoint security defenses"".

According to the report, virtual private networks, as well as encryption and antivirus agents, are prone to decay.

""It is time for enterprises to increase the rigor around measuring the effectiveness for the investments they've made,"" Absolute president and CEO Christy Wyatt said in a news release.

The company bills itself as the leader in ""Endpoint Resilience"".

""With the rise of remote work environments in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, as of May 2020, one in three enterprise devices is now being used heavily (more than 8 hours per day),"" the company stated. ""The data also shows a 176 percent increase in the number of enterprise devices with collaboration apps installed as of May 2020, versus pre-COVID-19. This means the average attack surface, and potential vulnerabilities, has expanded significantly across enterprises.""

The report notes that there are 10.2 security controls installed on the average endpoint. It also states that Windows 10 devices are, on average, 95 days behind on patching.

A while ago, I blogged about some of the silver linings in this terrible COVID-19 pandemic. One of the pluses I haven’t mentioned is the increased use of video communications, like Zoom or Jitsi Meet, for conferencing, webinars and more.

In my law practice, we’re now doing all examinations for discovery by Zoom. A discovery is a step in a lawsuit in which the lawyer acting for one client questions, under oath, the opposing client. For instance, in one of my files, I act on behalf an elderly gentleman who took a bad tumble when descending a stairway at the rear of a building where he’d gone on business. At the bottom, the stairs were uneven in height.

Yesterday, the lawyer for the defendant questioned my client under oath using Zoom. My client was in the comfort of his home. He had access to his kitchen during the lunch recess. Defence counsel was also in his home, and could enjoy the same comforts. The defendant’s counsel has a summer student, and she attended the conference via Zoom from her home.

I also attended the discovery using Zoom, and what an incredible time saver it was for me. It eliminated the need for my taxi ride to and from the discovery, which normally would have been held in the court reporter’s office in downtown Vancouver. But in this case, the court reporter was also able to attend the discovery from her home.

My partner, Penny, and I are very lucky to have a beautiful south-facing deck at our house. If it had been sunny yesterday, I could even have attended the discovery on my back deck, sun tanning!

Zoom discoveries are becoming so popular that I wonder if lawyers will return to in-person discoveries when the pandemic ends. In this case, not only did the five of us perform our required duties comfortably and efficiently, we also didn’t use any transportation, so we really reduced our impact on the environment.

But the applications don’t stop there.

My partner, Penny, and I are actually having dinner parties with friends more frequently now, using Zoom, that were in-person before the pandemic. Every Saturday we have a Zoom “dinner party” with a different couple.

The other evening, I attended an international Zoom conference at which the American actor, Danny Glover, interviewed the Cuban ambassador to the United States for over an hour about Cuba’s international health-care initiatives. This fascinating event was enjoyed by more than 700 Zoom attendees around the world. (If you missed it, you can watch it here.)

These are just a few examples of how people in a variety of settings are finding new ways of conducting business, organizing conferences, and just enjoying each other’s company.

Overall, for those of us lucky enough to be able to access these technologies, it seems to be working. At the same time, we’re definitely having a big, environmental effect—lowering pollution levels and carbon emissions.

The question, post-pandemic, is: will we resort to old habits or embrace new ways that will ensure these positive impacts are long-lasting?

During the serene rain-or-shine stroll through Stanley Park, guides might talk about spiritual practices, medicinal uses of plants, traditional foods (such as salal berries and licorice fern), mythology, lore, and more. Talaysay also offers tours in other parts of the region, all centred on story, spiritual perspectives, and respect for the land.

Until recently, no one would have described the stretch of East Hastings Street from, say, the 600 to 900 blocks as “lively”. Situated between the hustle (of entirely the wrong kind) of the Downtown Eastside and the bustle (of the commercial kind) of Hastings Sunrise, this particular strip of Strathcona has long been something of a dead zone. With new residential buildings and an influx of fledgling businesses, however, the area is due for a renaissance. Signs of life include the recent opening of VV Tapas Lounge, a low-key spot with an impressive by-the-glass wine list. At 957 East Hastings, VV is located in Strathcona Village—an unmistakable housing development that looks like a stack of red and orange shipping containers. Java lovers now have choices beyond gas-station swill, with the verdant and cozy Garden (868 East Hastings) almost directly across from newcomer Prototype Coffee (883 East Hastings), where they roast their own beans. Meanwhile, Strathcona Beer Company (895 East Hastings) is fast becoming a Yeast Van institution, while the comparatively venerable Heatley (696 East Hastings) is the go-to for lovers of live music and also boasts an early mural by local art-world star Ola Volo behind the bar. The strip is poised to get a lot more life thanks to the proposed Ray-Cam Renew project, which would see the construction of a brand-new community centre, a health clinic, childcare facilities, cultural spaces including a media lab and a theatre, mixed housing, and a retail promenade along the south side of the 900 block.

Weirdest use for hair while on transit

If you thought clipping nails on the bus or SkyTrain was weird, a Georgia Straight staffer witnessed a woman riding a TransLink bus pull a hair off her head and use it as dental floss. That makes us worry about what she used for toothpaste. Yeesh.

Best proof Vancouverites have their own rules when it comes to driving

Vancouverites have a bad reputation for not knowing how to drive. But maybe it’s because we’re simply inventive and edgy drivers? After all, trundling your car down the outdoor stairway at the Sheraton Wall Centre in downtown Vancouver, as a driver did in July, is dangerously original, as is driving along a pedestrian path at Sunset Beach, as one driver did in August. Then again, maybe that kind of creativity is best left at home.

Best case for mudflaps

Every late spring, the seawall between Science World and Granville Island is a bustling breeding ground for Canada geese, with the small armies of impossibly cute goslings a major attraction for tourists, amateur photographers, and nitwits who fancy themselves the second coming of Steve Irwin. Then, as spring turns to summer, said goslings sprout up and start turning the False Creek seawall into an endless carpet of bird shit. We’re talking a goose-log adorned minefield that rivals the famously dog-dung smeared streets of Paris. Wearing white Chuck Taylors for an evening stroll is a recipe for tears. Riding the seawall behind a cyclist with no rear fender, meanwhile, can leave you looking like you just finished a motocross race. The reason for the mess? That would be the fact that geese crap an average of once every seven minutes, which means you can either wait things out until the November rains arrive or do your cycling on 2nd Avenue.

Best way to pretend you’re British

There are few things more quintessentially British than a ride around London on one of the city’s iconic double-decker buses. The AEC Routemaster bus became a symbol of U.K. progress after it first appeared on London streets in 1956. Today, however, it’s harder to catch a ride on a red Routemaster than one might think. The model was withdrawn from regular service in 2005 and only continues to operate in London on one route that’s marked with a heritage designation. But more than 60 years after double-decker buses arrived in London, Vancouver residents can soon enjoy the charm of a double-decker bus ride. TransLink piloted a couple of its own blue double-decker buses in 2017 and subsequently ordered 32 of the vehicles. They’re expected to hit Lower Mainland streets before the end of 2019. Grab a bowler hat and a cup of tea and climb onboard.

Best use of a drone

The proliferation of recreational unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has led to plenty of situations in which drones are nothing more than a nuisance. In recent years, the flying video cameras have been spotted peeking into downtown Vancouver apartments. Their surprisingly loud buzz has also become a common irritant for backcountry hikers on B.C. mountain trails. And in July 2018, the B.C. government actually had to ask people to refrain from flying drones near wildfires: while more than half a dozen major blazes burned across southern B.C. that month, drone hobbyists interfered with authorities’ attempts to contain the flames. Drones are proving to be a pain. But this past summer, London Drugs did something with a drone that could benefit remote settlements around the world. On August 19, the Vancouver-based pharmacy chain partnered with InDro Robotics and Canada Post to use an unmanned aerial vehicle to transport an Epi pen and the overdose-reversal drug naloxone from Duncan, B.C., to the Country Grocer on Salt Spring Island. The 27.4-kilometre drive from Duncan to Salt Spring takes more than an hour by car and even longer than that if you don’t time your arrival at the ferry just right. The London Drugs drone made its six-kilometre flight in just 11 minutes.

Best argument against flushing disposable wipes

Wipes are convenient. They’re used for personal hygiene, baby care, facial cleaning, and other scrubbing purposes. Many are labelled “flushable”, but Linda Parkinson, a manager with the liquid-waste services of the Metro Vancouver Regional District, says don’t do it. That’s because it costs the region at least $100,000 a year to unclog regional waste pump stations of these materials. Yes, $100K! Metro Vancouver also spends hundreds of thousands of dollars to replace equipment damaged by the material.

Best way to keep art afloat

The Blue Cabin Floating Artist Residency

At the Plaza of Nations Aquabus/False Creek Ferries dock

The Blue Cabin sailed into Vancouver this summer, and what a journey it had getting there. Built in 1932, the funky structure with the red shutters was off Cates Park in North Vancouver, first as a home to maritime labourers and families, and then, from the late ’60s, as the studio for Vancouver artists Al Neil and Carole Itter. Slated for demolition in 2014, it has been rescued to become home to the Blue Cabin Floating Artist Residency, a dream realized by grunt gallery, Other Sights for Artists’ Projects, and Creative Cultural Collaborations. They saw it as a chance to counter the loss of artists and their work to the real-estate crisis; giving artists the space and time for live/work residencies has become almost out of reach here. The project is finally launching this month, with open houses, talks, and workshops. The first program is Skeins: Weaving on the Foreshore, featuring weavers from the three local First Nations—Debra Sparrow (Musqueam), Janice George and Buddy Joseph (Squamish), and Angela George (Squamish/ Tsleil-Waututh)—plus a residency by Australian Indigenous artist and activist Vicki Couzens.

Most bromantic urinals

While men tend to zip in and out of washrooms, here’s one waste-removal configuration that will challenge even the speediest of males. In the basement washroom at East Vancouver’s Heritage Hall, a pair of urinals, which are angled toward each other, force users to stare each other in the eyes as they relieve themselves. It’s featured in the book 111 Places in Vancouver That You Must Not Miss, by Dave Doroghy and Graeme Menzies. According to a September 22 story by CBC News, the twin urinal has been there since the building opened as a post office in 1916 and was designed by Scottish plumber John Shanks. It’s certainly one place where men are bound to get pissed off.

Best recovery from pier pressure

A severe windstorm on December 20, 2018, battered the White Rock Pier, causing boats to smash into it and a portion of it to break off, stranding a man who had to be rescued by helicopter. With repair costs estimated at $14 million, the City of White Rock managed to rebuild the pier (with funds that included donations and $1 million from the B.C. government) and officially reopened “Canada’s longest pier” on September 21.

Best place to take a quick snooze outside of your home

Not all of us have the luxury of being able to catch some quick ZZZs at work (we’re looking at you, fancy tech startups with the fancy nap pods.) But if your office is anywhere near Kitsilano’s new Casper Sleep Shop (2294 West 4th Avenue), you can book a nap in one of its miniature houses decked out with mattresses, pillows, and whimsical décor. You may find yourself in such a deep slumber on its ultracozy mattresses that you either miss the alarm to get back to work or end up walking out with one of themattresses in a box. We take no responsibility for either outcome.

Best neighbourhood in which to trick-or-treat

They say big houses in well-to-do suburban areas give out the best candy: full-size Kit Kat and Coffee Crisp bars, no less. However, after many years of roaming through various neighbourhoods to scout out the best places to trick-or-treat, we’ve determined that East Van is the most magical place to knock on random people’s doors for sugary loot on Halloween. The spooky spirit is felt in waves as you walk through the kid-infested streets, often coming face to face with ghosts, witches, zombies, and the latest Marvel character. In Grandview-Woodland and Hastings-Sunrise, some residents go all out with the haunted décor: mummified skulls, fog machines, animatronics, perfectly carved pumpkins, and neon-hued lights that flicker as you walk up steps to utter the three golden words. We hear that West Side kids sometimes get dropped off for a couple hours just to experience the fun on October 31.

Best rainbow rebound

Vancouver may have unveiled Canada’s first rainbow crosswalks back in 2013, and many Lower Mainland municipalities may have followed suit, but it remains a controversial topic. A case in point was when Chilliwack city council voted against installing an LGBT–inclusive rainbow crosswalk on September 3, with only one councillor in favour. It was deemed too political and divisive. But on September 17, the Chilliwack Board of Education debated the idea of painting a rainbow crosswalk in its parking lot. After a heated debate, the motion was narrowly passed in a 4-3 vote. Accordingly, there will be sunshine through the rain after all.

Best rainbow resilience

Ladner United Church raised a rainbow flag to participate in the United Church of Canada’s inaugural Pride Sunday on June 2. But the next day, staff found the flag had been vandalized with black spray paint. The church ordered a replacement and also allowed attendees to write inclusive and supportive messages on the marred flag to “change the narrative” from hate to love. But that’s not all. Delta mayor George V. Harvie ordered the rainbow flag to be raised at City Hall for the first time, with the Delta Police Department and Delta firefighters in attendance. Delta police also included a rainbow flag on their social media. Not stopping there, the Delta School District raised two rainbow flags, one at the school board office and another at an education centre. Unfortunately, Ladner United Church’s replacement flag was also vandalized. In response, Delta Secondary School students covered the steps and sidewalk with rainbow colours and messages of inclusion. Sometimes it takes a village to raise a rainbow.

Best rainbow resistance

Surrey RCMP raised the rainbow flag on June 24 at its detachment, and the social-conservative group Culture Guard showed up to protest the event. But the flag remained aloft as Surrey RCMP honoured LGBT Pride and commemorated the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots in New York City, which led to the LGBT rights movement in North America.

Best rainbow money

Canadian bills may be colourful, but a Canadian coin has outdone them. On April 23, the Royal Canadian Mint released a limited-mintage $1 coin that commemorated the 50th anniversary of the decriminalization of homosexuality in Canada. The coin features the work of none other than Vancouver artist Joe Average, whose career has been devoted to supporting LGBT and HIV communities. The Royal Canadian Mint released three million Equality coins, while a special collector’s edition in pure silver with the design in full colour was also made available in limited mintage for $49.95.

Charlie Smith

Best mural to keep memories of the past alive

In an alley east of Quebec Street between East 10th Avenue and East Broadway stands a stunning new depiction of the historic bonds between local First Nations and the city’s South Asian community. On the rear of a federal building that used to be named after a racist former Vancouver MP, artists Alicia Point, Cyler Sparrow-Point, and Keerat Kaur painted a magnificent mural representing how local First Nations delivered provisions to more than 350 South Asians kept aboard the Komagata Maru in Vancouver’s harbour for two months in 1914. The MP, Harry Stevens, and local immigration officials ensured that these passengers could not set foot in Canada, citing discriminatory continuous-journey legislation crafted to keep South Asians from moving here. Eventually, authorities ordered the ship to return to India, where 18 of the passengers were shot by British troops following an uprising in what is now West Bengal.

Best way to feel like you’re inside an anime

Best place to find rats

B.C. SPCA

1205 East 7th Avenue

The easy answer is, in no particular order, the alleys of the Downtown Eastside, any fruit tree in East Van, or a steaming bowl of soup at the dearly departed Crab Park Chowdery. But as sure as Pamela Anderson earmarks a large portion of her Baywatch residuals for PETA, it’s important to remember that one person’s pest is another’s pet. And like every pet, sometimes rats end up not being wanted. Although most folks head to the B.C. SPCA for dogs. cats, and miniature donkeys, there’s also a healthy population of rats available for adoption. We’re not talking the wild brown rats that make grown men stand on chairs and shriek when they chew their way into a house, but instead fancy rats bred to be pets. Rats have a deserved reputation as great companions that are not only curious and clean but also smart and social. Currently listed for adoption in Vancouver on the B.C. SPCA website are a variety of the often-maligned rodents, including Calliope, Claire, Emmi, Erata, and—most awesomely monikered of all—Mel. Don’t dare think about rechristening any of them Ricky, Ratso, or Ratatouille.

Best way to get a pet on the cheap

Want a pet but don’t have a lot of money to buy one? How about mice? That’s right. The City of Vancouver sells gerbils, hamsters, mice, and rats for $5 each. You can visit the city’s animal shelter at 1280 Raymur Avenue. If small rodents aren’t your thing, perhaps you’d like a small bird? Budgies and finches are $10 each.

Best new home for a war memorial

It’s a fitting location for a Vancouver memorial commemorating the Battle of Britain, which was fought in the skies against Nazi Germany. On January 28, the park board approved a plan to move the Air Force Garden of Remembrance from its location in Stanley Park to Queen Elizabeth Park, which is the highest point in the city. As park planner Emily Dunlop wrote in a report to the board, the transfer will put the memorial “closest to the sky”.

Best evidence that this city is home to some first-rate twits

In January this year, the Vancouver park board revealed that up to 50 young trees at the Langara Golf Course had been destroyed by vandals. The culprits sawed off the tops of sequoia, West Coast cedar, Douglas fir, Fraser fir, and alder trees. Earlier that month, eight trees were damaged at Spanish Banks, with their tops also cut. Some losers just need to get a life.

Best argument to define affordable housing

The City of Vancouver is subsidizing, with taxpayers’ money, private developments that supposedly offer “affordable” rents. What is considered affordable? As one example, the city’s 2018 guidelines state that $1,496 a month for a studio on the East Side of Vancouver is affordable. But as Coun. Adriane Carr pointed out in a motion, for a household to afford $1,496—which is just the starting rent at the time that council holds a public hearing on the rezoning proposal for a project—it has to have an annual income of $59,840. This is to meet the affordability threshold of housing expense as 30 percent income. The trouble is, as Carr noted, half of the households in the city earn less than $50,000 per year. They’re shit out of luck.

Best place to get stuffed

This Monkey’s Gone to Heaven

2244 East Hastings Street

This emporium of oddities teaches you taxidermy with how-to classes that include all the tools and materials you’ll need for dissecting, stuffing, and—best of all—posing your first animal. Our hands-down favourite recent offering: a beginners’ class in making a kinky mouse couple piece that reimagines a Fifty Shades of Grey fantasy with tiny, ecstatic rodents (November 17). You can also turn your deceased critter into a serial killer for Halloween (October 27). The less squeamish can check out the butterfly-pinning classes—just the thing for your Victorian curio cabinet.

Best Vancouver-made alternative to soggy sneakers

Vessifootwear.ca

It took three folks faced with the endless drizzles and puddles of Vancouver to come up with waterproof sneakers. The added bonus is that Vessi’s sleek and stylish kicks don’t just keep socks dry but breathe and are good to the Earth. The shoes are all vegan, and the trio has developed a machine-knitting process that they say cuts each pair’s manufacturing energy consumption by 600 percent.

Best city gift to boaters in False Creek

Swimming is not allowed in False Creek, which is heavily polluted with sewer overflows, storm water, and sewage from boats. But progress is being made on this front. On February 13, Vancouver city council voted to extend free sewage pump-out service for boaters in False Creek, allocating $75,000 for the program this year. The service was piloted in 2017 and renewed in 2018. Last year, 561 boats were serviced, with more than 48,000 litres of sewage collected. That’s a hell of a lot of poo.

Best embodiment of Vancouver in a single retail store that isn’t actually in Vancouver

Throw Aritzia, Saje, and any one of Vancouver’s dispensaries into a blender and you’ll get Burb: a Port Coquitlam cannabis store coated in muted hues of beige and taupe that stocks a minimalist line of casual wear alongside a curated selection of high-quality strains and artful smoking accessories. Throw in a rack of spandex and an artisan coffee bar and we’ll reach peak Vancouver.

Best local celebrity you probably wouldn’t recognize on the street

You’d be forgiven for not knowing Mimi Choi’s name. You’d also be forgiven if you happened to be one of her one-million-plus Instagram followers but failed to recognize her on the street. The locally based makeup artist works mostly behind the scenes, after all, and her trippy illusionist work means she’s often pictured online with her face disguised as a scaly fish, a black hole, or some other surreal, “how did she do that?” imagery. However, Choi was thrust into the spotlight this year when she was hired to paint a set of campy-creepy eyes on actor Ezra Miller for the Met Gala in May. Miller revealed his seven-eye look on the pink carpet in New York City by removing a mask, stealing the show, and ensuring that Choi would become a household name among makeup artists and makeup-artistry enthusiasts around the globe.

Best glass-bottomed swimming pool

Imagine what it must be like to look down 19 floors to the ground while swimming laps. That’s the reality for residents of the ARC Vancouver at the corner of Expo Boulevard and Nelson Street, thanks to a glass-bottomed pool that’s 11.6 metres long and 2.75 metres wide. Created by Walter Francl Architects and Glotman Simpson Engineers, it’s visible to anyone crossing the Cambie Bridge but only open to those who can afford to shell out well over a million for a condo. This pool is definitely not recommended for those with acrophobia.

Best proof that Vancouver’s pride and joy isn’t Seth Rogen after all

Sure, actor and comedian Seth Rogen may have won the hearts (and ears) of Vancouverites when he narrated TransLink public-service announcements last year. But the recent disappearance of a certain knife-wielding bird reveals Vancouver’s true pride and joy: Canuck the Crow. The fearless bird—who was banded by a federal registry and is known to frequent East Van—made headlines when he was reported missing in early September. Anonymous donors have even offered $10,000 for information leading to his safe return, but he has yet to be found.

Best place to pamper your pup

We’re shopping more ethically and sustainably than ever before, so isn’t it time those efforts extended to products for our four-legged pals? That’s the thinking behind Good Boy Collective, a local online pet-supply store that opened a bricks-and-mortar spot on Main Street in May. The shop carries responsibly (and, in some cases, locally) made furnishings, treats, clothes, and accessories for cats and dogs. The products are design-forward, to boot: think chic ceramic bowls, minimalist basswood beds, and adorable doughnut-shaped chew toys.

Best fruit-inspired place to refresh your face

Vancouver has no shortage of facial spots, but few are as quick and efficient as Fig (2050 West 4th Avenue). The newish Kitsilano facial bar has customers in and out within 30 minutes, during which they’re enclosed in a womb-like pod to have 95-percent-pure oxygen blown onto their face. (Sessions focused on exfoliation and lifting and toning are also available.) You’ll want to linger after your appointment: Fig’s fig-inspired interiors (picture a palette of soothing green hues and an all-pink powder room that gives a nod to the fruit’s flesh) offer an ideal place to decompress.

Best solution for keeping clothing donation bins

Following a number of deaths of people trapped inside clothing-donation bins across the Lower Mainland in the past few years, the City of Vancouver could have simply banned these containers. That would have meant depriving charities and nonprofits of money they earn from clothing (and other) donations. It would also mean more unwanted clothes going to the landfill. The city chose to amend the bylaw regulating the bins, requiring operators to submit an engineer’s certification that the box is safe.

Tammy Kwan

Best nearby getaway that doesn’t require air or boat travel

It’s enticing to book a staycation in Victoria or hop on a quick flight to Tofino, but people can forget that car travel is often the best way to explore nearby destinations. If you’re not keen on long road trips, a quick visit to Sandpiper Resort in Harrison Mills should do the trick. Although it’s located on a historic golf course, guests who travel there will enjoy its amenities even if they aren’t golfers. Accommodations range from rooms at its colonial inn (Rowena’s Inn on the River) to rustic cabins to newly built luxury cabins. Tuck into some hearty dishes at the Clubhouse Restaurant, watch wildlife at the eagle gazebo, or drive another 20 minutes to Harrison Hot Springs for a stroll through the village. Relaxing and rejuvenating is the key selling point here, and at the end of your trip, you’ll be surprised that the drive back home is only around 90 minutes.

Best argument for better bike storerooms in apartment buildings

Only a third of bicycle-owning, apartment-dwelling households use the bike-storage facilities at their building. According to a report to Metro Vancouver’s regional planning committee, there are many reasons for this. They are not confident that the storage is secure. They don’t feel safe going there. It’s crowded. In short, more developers and building owners need to give the same care and attention to the design of bike storage as they would to car parking spaces. But if they’re all cruising around in a Mercedes, they probably don’t give a hell of a lot of thought to how the hapless tenants are dealing with their two-wheelers.

Best place to feel like a kid again

Granville Island can be overcrowded at times—it is a top tourist destination in Vancouver, after all. But when you’re in the mood to escape reality and enjoy some fun and games, don’t be afraid to brave the masses and head down to its Kids Market, home to several toy emporiums, a magic shop, bumper cars, and even virtual-reality rides. You’ll need several hours to explore everything here. But its hidden gem is the Circuit Circus arcade, where you can easily spend more than a couple bucks on everything from Skee-Ball to basketball to a pirate shooting game to Whac-A-Mole. Many of the arcade games give out tickets that can be redeemed at the prize counter. Redeeming 400 tickets for a bouncy ball and some cheap candy won’t feel like anything special, but the fact that you were able to feel like a kid again, even for just a short while, will be satisfying.

Best site to launch a march for sex workers’ safety

Vancouver has a memorial for sex workers tucked away in the West End on a decorative lamppost. The plaque outside St. Paul’s Anglican Church at 1130 Jervis Street honours ladies and gentlemen of the night who were displaced from the neighbourhood in the 1980s due to a court injunction that forced them out of the West End. That fateful decision played a role in dozens of sex workers being murdered in subsequent years after they were pushed into the shadows. For the first time this year, the annual Red Umbrella march to promote the safety of sex workers began at the memorial, which the city created in partnership with the West End Sex Workers Memorial Committee. Fun historical fact: the window of the apartment that housed former sex worker Wendy King can be seen across the street from the memorial. Her explosive memoir chronicled her dalliances with former chief justice John Farris, who was forced to resign in 1978.

Best reason to call a lawyer

It’s ridiculous that a 1972 conviction for pot in Canada can prevent someone from entering the United States in 2019. But the war on drugs continues and that’s the world we live in. There has long been a method one can use to clear their record of past run-ins with the law. But the application to suspend a citizen’s prior conviction—a record suspension, as it’s known in Canada—comes with a $631 price tag. The process is also complicated enough for one to want to hire a lawyer. All that hassle and then there’s no guarantee a request will be successful. It’s discouraging, to say the least. But as of August 1, the federal government says it has made it easier and much cheaper for Canadians to obtain a pardon for a past conviction for cannabis possession. “Individuals convicted only of simple possession of cannabis can now apply to the Parole Board of Canada for a pardon through a streamlined, simplified process,” Public Safety Canada announced this summer. “The $631 fee and waiting periods associated with other pardon applications are eliminated.” With recreational cannabis finally legal in Canada, it’s about time citizens stopped paying for past infractions that are no longer a crime.

Best shout-out to the VPD

It’s fun to imagine heads turning in surprise inside Vancouver police stations when they heard their department’s name come up in a fracas involving U.S. president Donald Trump and the White House. The mess began when Kellyanne Conway, a high-profile Trump spokesperson, claimed that the dangerous synthetic opioid fentanyl was showing up in cannabis. Washington, D.C., journalists were skeptical and subsequently asked Trump officials on what basis Conway made the claim. In response, the White House said it came from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). So reporters asked NIDA where it got the idea that fentanyl had found its way into weed. “Anecdotal reports,” the organization replied. “Specifically a 2015 Vancouver police report claiming ‘fentanyl-laced marijuana’ was killing drug users.” The VPD had walked back that claim but Trump-administration officials apparently didn’t know that. Today, that VPD report includes a correction emphasizing that the force has never seen fentanyl in cannabis.

Best proof that Gen Z will save the world

It might be a little crass to say, but if you’re 65 years old, you’re going to be dead long before the worst effects of climate change are upon us. That simple fact probably has some relation to polls consistently showing that older people care a lot less about the environment than younger people. Children in Canadian schools today understand that they will be alive when the world passes a tipping point on climate change. Justifiably, they’re angry about this and, in 2019, began letting adults know it. In Vancouver, school walkouts have become a popular tactic of the youth climate movement. Last March, for example, hundreds of students gathered outside the art gallery on Georgia Street carrying signs with slogans like “The oceans are rising and so are we” and “Climate justice now”. And very recently, many thousands of mostly young people gathered outside Vancouver City Hall, from where they launched a march through downtown Vancouver demanding that governments do more to mitigate Canada’s contributions to climate change. The same week, Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old de facto leader of this movement, pulled no punches summarizing the situation. “You are failing us,” she said in a speech aimed at adults. “But the young people are starting to understand your betrayal. The eyes of all future generations are upon you.” There’s hope yet for our future, thanks to the leaders of tomorrow.

The host of the podcast Crackdown, Garth Mullins, sees himself and others on the show as war correspondents. Rob Newell

Best radio to come out of the trenches of the DTES

“For us it’s a war. And it needs to be covered like a war—by war correspondents. That’s us,” Garth Mullins says in Episode 1 of Crackdown, a new podcast based out of Vancouver. If Mullins and his team live and work in B.C., what conflict are they covering? The war on drugs, the show explains, as it plays out in the city’s Downtown Eastside, across Canada, in the United States, and around the world. Mullins is a member of the Vancouver Area Network of Drug Users (VANDU), a grassroots organization that has fought to reform drug policy in Canada since its founding in 1997. In addition to Mullins’s role as the podcast’s host, a number of VANDU members serve on the show’s editorial board. In a partnership with the UBC-based Cited Media Productions, it is conflict journalism told through the eyes of the side that’s losing. That unique perspective was recognized in June with a “silver” win at the prestigious New York Festivals Radio Awards. “We couldn’t go collect it in person at the awards gala because some of us can’t cross the border,” Mullins noted poignantly after learning of the honour. Since then, Crackdown has continued to share stories from the drug war that listeners won’t hear anywhere else.

Best imitation of a powerful politician

Kennedy Stewart has all the trappings of power. He’s the friggin’ mayor of the third-largest city in Canada, for goodness’ sake. Stewart has a huge corner office at Vancouver City Hall with a magnificent view. Citizens and city staff call him “your worship”. He chairs the police board. Reporters respond in a Pavlovian fashion any time he holds a media briefing. The prime minister and premier likely have him on speed-dial. But the reality is that without a party, the first independent mayor since Mike Harcourt can only get things done if he cobbles together enough votes from Green and/or NPA councillors. Here’s just one example: Stewart came into office on the laudable promise of reforming the electoral system. He huffed and puffed about taking the province to court, if necessary, to ditch the at-large voting system. This was his life’s work as a political scientist. He had to run for mayor to fix this, or so we were told. Nowadays, you hear zero talk of electoral reform. And anyone who feels that the at-large system is responsible for the lack of local politicians with non-Anglicized names is better off speaking to an official with real clout—like new B.C. human rights commissioner Kasari Govender—rather than a feeble mayor.

Best reason to wonder about Premier John Horgan’s commitment to equality

The city’s two loud and proud gay and lesbian NDP MLAs, Spencer Chandra Herbert and Mable Elmore, also happen to be the only two of the NDP’s eight Vancouver MLAs not in the provincial cabinet. What a coincidence. Both have been in office for more than a decade and both have diligently advocated for their constituents, yet they were passed over in favour of politicians with far less elected experience. Over to you, Mr. Horgan.

Best reason to wonder about B.C. Liberal Leader Andrew Wilkinson’s concern for tenants

Wilkinson, who represents the wealthy constituency of Vancouver-Quilchena, called being a renter a “rite of passage” in a bizarre speech in the legislature in February. “It was part of growing up and getting better,” Wilkinson declared. “We’ve all done it. It’s kind of a wacky time of life but it can be really enjoyable.” Try telling that to seniors living on fixed incomes, single parents, or anyone with a disability who’s been renovicted. Kind of fun? Maybe if you’re a doctor or a lawyer or a fat-cat politician! Like Andrew Wilkinson.

Best proof it’s the Year of the Asahi

While the historic Vancouver Asahi baseball team may have gotten the big-screen treatment in the 2014 Japanese film Bankuba no Asahi (The Vancouver Asahi), several Canadian institutions have been paying tribute to this local Japanese-Canadian sports team this year. On February 20, Historica Canada released a Heritage Minute about the team, which was filmed in Vancouver and near Hope, B.C. The minute-long vignette (released in English, French, and Japanese) tells the story of how the team rose to success in the Pacific Northwest with its strategic approach to outwit its opponents before the internment of Japanese-Canadians in 1942 during the Second World War forced it to disband. Then on April 24, Canada Post launched its Vancouver Asahi stamp at the National Nikkei Museum and Cultural Centre in Burnaby. The event was attended by the last surviving team member, 97-year-old Koichi Kay Kaminishi, members of the current Asahi Baseball Association, and Japanese-American activist and Star Trek actor George Takei. Now that's how you take a historic team back out to the ballgame.

Best outdoor acknowledgment of Indigenous people

During the observance of this year’s National Aboriginal Day on June 21, the Vancouver school board unveiled three totem poles on the grounds of its main offices at 1580 West Broadway. The centrepiece was a 13-metre reconciliation pole. On both sides of the work were welcoming poles representing male and female figures. In advance of the event, Chas Desjarlais, the district’s vice principal for Indigenous education, noted that although the board has a lot of art pieces referencing Indigenous history and heritage inside the building, the school board had nothing on the outside that speaks about this legacy. Now it does.

Best conservative dissenter

For three decades, CKNW host Charles Adler has been a conservative media titan in Canada and the United States. The son of Hungarian Jews who survived the Holocaust, Adler has never been shy about sharing stories about his parents’ sacrifices and bravery in the face of abominable discrimination during the Nazi era. But when Adler started voicing his objections to the loathsome bigotry meted out against gays and lesbians—particularly through forced conversion therapy—he suddenly became a pariah among some on the right. A self-described member of the Bernier Nation tweeted that Adler must have developed a brain tumour the size of a watermelon. Another suggested that Adler might have suffered a stroke. Yet another suspected Alzheimer’s, which was particularly galling, given that Adler’s father had this disease. But Adler soldiers on, night after night, calling out Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer for waffling over a ban on conversion therapy. Kudos to Adler for standing up for those who are often unable to defend themselves—and for honouring his parents’ legacy.

Best reason to stay angry in the face of good news

Six years into an overdose crisis that has killed thousands of people in B.C., policymakers finally saw a reason for cautious optimism this past summer. Overdose deaths declined during the first six months of 2019 compared to the same period the previous year. There were 538 illicit-drug overdose deaths in B.C. between January and June 2019, down from 763 deaths reported in the first six months of 2018. A one-third drop is significant. But from 2001 to 2010, there were an average of just 102 overdose deaths in B.C. each six months. So although 538 is “good news”, it is also more than five times the number of deaths that was once considered “normal”. The year has seen overdose deaths decline, but only to a number that was once considered unimaginable for a population the size of B.C.’s. Worse, even as fatal overdoses have declined, emergency calls for overdoses continue to rise. “The psychological trauma that is being inflicted on people is increasing as the number of overdoses go up,” Eris Nyx, a member of the Vancouver-based Coalition of Peers Dismantling the Drug War, told the Straight this summer. “Even if they are nonfatal, the absolute number of responses are increasing, and this is having very negative effects on people’s mental health.”

Best indicator why Vancouver renters cannot expect council to adopt vacancy control

Vancouver councillors had the chance to impose vacancy control on a proposed rental development on West 4th Avenue, which would have meant that rents would be tied to the units instead of the tenants. If council had chosen to do this, the landlord could not have jacked rents for a unit beyond what is allowed by the yearly increases mandated by the provincial Residential Tenancy Branch, even after a tenant moved out. Coun. Jean Swanson thought this was a good idea. And when she proposed vacancy control for the rental project, city manager Sadhu Johnston confirmed that council had the power to do so. However, Swanson’s motion at a February 26, 2019, council meeting was defeated.

Best explanation why rents are high in “for-profit affordable housing”

In the City of Vancouver’s 2019 criteria for affordable rents on the East Side, lease charges start at $1,607 per month for a studio unit; $1,869 for a one-bedroom; $2,457 for two bedrooms; and $3,235 for three bedrooms. Housing activist Sara Sagaii explained that this is because the rates are not based on average market rents in that part of the city. Rather, they’re based on a citywide average, which means West Side numbers are part of the equation. Of course, average West Side rents are higher than those on the East Side. As a result, this pulls up rents on the East Side in for-profit affordable-housing projects. Go figure.

Best reason to work harder on the recycling front

Starting in 2018, China banned several types of solid-waste imports and imposed stricter contamination standards for these types of shipments under its National Sword policy. In short, China no longer wants to be the world’s dumping ground. According to a report by Metro Vancouver environmental planner Andrew Doi in April this year, recycling companies in the Lower Mainland are having problems marketing their stockpiles abroad. This means that the region, and the country in general, need to find new solutions in dealing with plastic and paper waste.

Best examples of health benefits of walkable communities

People who live in compact and walkable neighbourhoods are 39 percent less likely to have diabetes than those in car-dependent areas. They are also 28 percent less likely to suffer hypertension. In addition, they are 23 percent less likely to develop stress. These are some of the findings of research led by Larry Frank, a UBC professor and director of the university’s Health and Community Design Lab. The results of the study, titled Where Matters: Health and Economic Impacts of Where We Live, were presented by Erin Rennie, a senior regional planner with Metro Vancouver, in a report to the district’s regional planning committee. Yes, folks, living in single-family homes in the sprawling, car-dependent suburbs can kill you.

Best reason to turn off the lights and take the bus

Vancouver’s temperate climate is the envy of cities across Canada. While Calgary, Montreal, and Toronto freeze for half the year, Vancouver residents simply throw a windbreaker over their yoga gear and continue with their weekly walks along the seawall. Or at least that’s what we’ll tell future generations. Whereas Vancouver previously had four distinct seasons, each with its own charms, it increasingly feels like we’re down to two. For eight months of the year, it rains. And for four months, a blanket of heat settles over the Lower Mainland. Residents do their best to suck sufficient oxygen from the toxic smoke that occasionally floats in from the Interior’s annual forest fires. Infants and the elderly are advised to avoid the outdoors altogether. This shift in Vancouver’s climate is—unsurprisingly, to anyone who’s been paying attention for the past 30 years—a result of climate change. In January 2019, researchers at the University of Victoria examined 2018’s smash-all-records wildfire season and determined it was no fluke. “This profound influence of climate change on forest fire extremes in B.C. will require increasing attention in forest management, public health, and infrastructure,” it reads. We were warned.

Best reason to hug someone who uses drugs

There are plenty of good reasons we should be nice to people who struggle with an addiction. For starters, it’s more productive than stigmatizing them with tough love, recent studies suggest. But if that doesn’t convince you, consider this: in 2018, people who died of a drug overdose accounted for 32 percent—roughly one-third—of all organ donors in British Columbia. The year before, that number was even higher, at 35 percent, according to statistics that Transplant B.C. shared with the Georgia Straight earlier this year. Last July, B.C. health minister Adrian Dix convened a small celebration in a rooftop garden at St. Paul’s Hospital to commemorate the province’s 5,000th person alive today who was saved by an organ transplant. “Donors are our heroes, and this incredible milestone is truly their legacy of the incredible gift of life,” he said. There’s one group of citizens that’s contributed an especially significant number of those heroes: victims of Canada’s overdose crisis.",[]

Best signs of the city’s Musqueam past weaving its way into the future

Siblings Robyn and Debra Sparrow have been using paint on concrete instead of threads to carry on the ancient weaving traditions of their ancestors. This summer, Musqueam artist Robyn designed a three-section crosswalk, on Granville Street between 68th and 70th avenues, that reflects timeworn textile hues of white, black, sonoma sand, brick red, and yellow. The public artwork is a good reminder, even as you walk through busy traffic, that the spot sits close to the ancient Musqueam village of ćsnam. Meanwhile, fellow well-known weaver Debra painted textile patterns onto two towering cement pillars of the Granville Street Bridge near the Granville Island Public Market last year.

Best film use since Deadpool of Vancouver as a city that’s not Vancouver

Vancouver may be known as Hollywood North but it rarely plays itself in films and TV. It’s taken the role of Vancouver, Washington, in the tragically popular Fifty Shades series; the fictional crime-ridden town of Riverdale in Riverdale; and, perhaps most notably, a moody New York City in Deadpool. And though it’s fun as hell to see the Georgia Viaduct ripped apart on the big screen, Netflix’s Always Be My Maybe has recently swooped in to take the “cultural product with the best, most recognizable use of Vancouver” crown away from that Marvel film. Why? For one, the Ali Wong–fronted rom-com ditches overused settings like Gastown and downtown in favour of local gems like New Town Bakery and the Biltmore Cabaret—often with hilarious results. And, really, it’s just way more fun to play “spot the distinctly Vancouver site masquerading as a fancy hotel or restaurant in San Francisco, New York, or Los Angeles” when you’re also enjoying a film that’s moving the dial forward for Asian-American representation.

Best reason to binge-watch Bates Motel

Sure, the impalings, slashings, shootings, and stabbings are great, but the real reason to watch a young Norman Bates dive into his work on Bates Motel is the backdrop town of White Pine Bay in Oregon. You’ll notice that White Pine Bay looks a lot like Metro Vancouver, which makes sense, because that’s where the Psycho-inspired, Netflix original series was shot for five seasons starting in 2013. As you work through the episodes, you’ll have no problem recognizing the 2400 Motel on Kingsway, the docks of Steveston, Via Tevere Pizzeria in East Van, and the stately Hycroft Manor off Granville Street. In what seems like a missed opportunity, no scenes were shot at House of Knives, West Coast Wigs, or Splashes Bath & Kitchen. Sadly, the built-in-Aldergrove replicas of the Bates home and motel as first seen in Alfred Hitchcock’s classic Psycho were demolished after filming wrapped for good.

Best jam space with benefits

Pandora’s Box Rehearsal Studios

1890 Pandora Street

As anyone who knows the history of the Replacements, the Murder City Devils, and Vancouver’s infamous Bludgeoned Pigs knows, nothing gets the creative juices flowing like a bathtub full of alcohol. If it hadn’t been for the magic of liquor, the world might never have seen Jim Morrison, Hank Williams, and Alice Cooper become legends. Pandora’s Box isn’t the only jam space in town, but it’s one of the best for no other reason than its location. The space features 18 rehearsal rooms for you and two, or three, or 19 friends to get together and realize your dreams of becoming the next White Stripes, Green Day, or Polyphonic Spree. Drums and bass amps are found in every room, which means saving valuable setup time, with guitar amps available for rent if you don’t own your own Fender Twin Reverb or Marshall. But the greatest thing about Pandora’s Box (founded and built by local scene vets, including members of La Chinga and Terror of Tiny Town) is its location. The space is just off Victoria Drive in the heart of booming Yeast Vancouver, which means it’s within stumbling distance of Parallel 49, the Callister Brewing Co., Odd Society Spirits, Storm Brewing, and Doan’s Craft Brewing. Loosen up with a couple of pre-practice drinks and you’ll become convinced stardom is inevitable as you launch into that industrial punk-rap reworking of “There’s a Tear in My Beer”.

Best proof Vancouver has entered the Twilight Zone

While Vancouver may be thought to be in an alternative universe for any number of reasons, ranging from the insanity of the real-estate market to weather that differs from that in the rest of Canada, we do have proof that The Twilight Zone is based in Vancouver. The new iteration, that is. The latest revival of the classic TV series that launched in 1959 was shot in Vancouver from October 2018 to March of this year. Season 1, narrated and executive-produced by Get Out filmmaker Jordan Peele, premiered on April 1 and included appearances by hometown stars Jacob Tremblay and Seth Rogen. The series has been revived twice before; the 2002-03 version was also shot in Vancouver. Perhaps visitors to Vancouver should be greeted with “You are about to enter another dimension. Next stop, the Vancouver Zone!”

Best signs movie theatres are still in demand

The decade began with the impact of technological changes being seen locally as Vancouver lost numerous long-running movie theatres, from the Ridge Theatre to the Empire Granville 7. But a number of new cinemas have seen opened up—with more developments this year. On April 3, Cineplex opened a new cinema at the Park Royal Shopping Centre in West Vancouver featuring seven traditional auditoriums and four adults-only VIP cinemas. Meanwhile, the Vancouver International Film Centre announced on September 4 that it will receive more than $1.4 million in funding from federal, provincial, and municipal governments to transform its atrium into a multi-use space. The renovations will include the creation of an approximately 40-seat microcinema, a virtual-reality and augmented-reality lounge, and an improved concession. Sometimes Netflix just can’t replace the draw of the communal moviegoing experience.

Best reason for more positive local represent-Asian

The all-Asian lead cast of Crazy Rich Asians was definitely something to celebrate, helping to counter the dearth of Asian stars in Hollywood movies. But there was still that movie title. And for Vancouver, it could not have come at a more unfortunate time. With anti-Asian sentiment at an all-time high in the city since the days of anti-Asian riots, the Chinese head tax, the Japanese-Canadian internment, and the Komagata Maru incident, and racially charged local debates over hot topics like Metro Vancouver real estate, money laundering, and immigration, Vancouver really doesn’t need any further fuel added to those fires. With a sequel planned based on the next novel in the trilogy by author Kevin Kwan, entitled China Rich Girlfriend, and most likely a third movie based on the final novel, entitled Rich People Problems, it’s not likely to end there. What may be promising is that the commercial success of these films will continue to propel the careers of their stars, who will, hopefully, appear in a variety of other roles. And let’s hope that more positive and diverse Asian-Canadian representation can find its way into local media and beyond.

Best place to hear a $250,000 piano

Orpheum Theatre

601 Smithe Street

Call it a 100th-birthday present to itself: the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra, which just celebrated its centennial, has just acquired a spankin’-new keyboard, painstakingly shipped from Hamburg. The Steinway Model D concert grand piano comes in at 3,000 pounds and had to spend a month acclimatizing at the Tom Lee Music warehouse in Richmond. Crafted for crystalline clarity and the ability to carry notes throughout the 2,700-seat Orpheum, it will play host to the fancy fingerwork of music stars from around the world.

Best way to tap your inner Mondrian or Matisse

Mobil Art School

60–268 Keefer Street

What if you didn’t have to be enrolled in university to study painting with a local art star like Etienne Zack, dig into sculpture with porcelain master Tanis Saxby, or take an art-history course with MFA educator Sean Alward? We’re talking life-drawing drop-ins, digital-camera how-tos, and even drinking-and-drawing get-togethers with local art legend Neil Wedman. Best of all, no exams. This new and inviting artist-run Chinatown space is all geared toward making quality art education accessible to the masses. True to its name, Mobil also goes out into the community, taking its talks to groups around town; check out its Instagram for some of the wicked stuff it’s inspired everyone from seniors to kids to create.

Best budget moviegoing experience

Movieland Arcade

906 Granville Street

Most of the classic theatres (Capital, Lyric, and Colonial) that once dotted Granville Street were demolished decades ago. One moviegoing spot has endured, however, even as places like the Plaza were turned into entertainment-district bars: the Movieland Arcade. As its iconic sign has promised since the ’70s, the arcade does indeed offer games and shooting—you can kill hours playing Addams Family pinball or blowing up zombies in House of the Dead. But it’s in the back that you get the real bang for your buck. Seemingly unaware that there’s a thing called inflation, Movieland still offers 8mm peepshow films for a quarter. You step up to a booth, plug in your money, and watch the time-faded action through a five-inch viewing slot. Your 25 cents gets you 60 seconds of a looped film, after which you cough up another quarter to keep watching. Movie titles—1 Guy, Two Girls and, umm, Lesbians—are written in felt pen on the booths. You might bust a nut but you won’t break the bank.

Best reason to check your grandparents’ attic

Los Angeles, New York, and London got most of the international attention when people talked about the early days of punk rock, but sleepy Vancouver also produced its share of legendary acts. Think first-wave heavyweights like D.O.A., the Pointed Sticks, Subhumans, Young Canadians, and Modernettes. Lesser-known but just as important were scene pioneers like the Dishrags, U-J3RK5, Secret Vs, No Exit, and I, Braineater. All of those bands made records, and some of them have gone on to become the most sought-after punk releases in the world. Take the Subhumans’ early and rare single “Death to the Sickoids/Oh Canaduh”: the seven-inch is currently listed at $1,381.50 on the record collectors’ trading site discogs.com. No Exit’s self-pressed eponymous 1980 debut, originally sold for $3.99 at gigs, can be yours if you’ve got $1,852.57—with a big part of the record’s value being that only 200 were ever made. The Dishrags’ Past Is Past EP is a relative bargain at $79.40. D.O.A.’s Triumph of the Ignoroids EP—the uncensored pressing on Friends Records—is going for $159.96. And your great-grandparents said that punk would never pay.

Best hidden piece of local baseball history

A grimy on-ramp may not seem like hallowed baseball ground, but looks can deceive. Under the Granville Street Bridge’s Hemlock Street entrance lies the former grandstand entrance of Athletic Park, a 5,000-seat wooden stadium built in 1913. (The approximate location of home plate is now occupied by a Minit-Tune.) Constructed by sports impresario Bob Brown for his Class B league Vancouver Beavers, the park would give White Spot founder Nat Bailey his start in the food-service business—selling peanuts—and in the 1930s, Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig would take to the field there in a barnstorming exhibition. In 1939, beer magnate Emil Sick bought the park for his minor-league Vancouver Capilanos. They’d stick around until 1951, when the city took the land for the bridge and built a replacement field (now known as Nat Bailey Stadium) on the slopes of Little Mountain.

Best way to time-travel

As recently as the late 1970s, there were seven—seven!—local drive-in movie theatres. But times change, moviegoing habits change, and now there are only three left in all of B.C. Happily, one of those is still in the Lower Mainland: the Twilight Drive-In, located on 260th Street in Aldergrove. Open Fridays and weekends until mid-November (barring extreme weather), the Twilight continues to offer all the joys of the drive-in experience and serves as a real blast from the past. Bring the kids in their PJs, grab some popcorn, crank up the sound, and party like it’s 1959.

Best way to curate a home art collection

With more than 1,000 available paintings, photographs, collages, and other mixed-media pieces, the Art Rental and Sales Program—operated by the Vancouver Art Gallery (VAG)—can transform any apartment, house, or condo into a veritable museum. Founded in 1952 by the gallery’s Ladies Auxiliary (now known as the Associates of the Vancouver Art Gallery), the service has its own thoughtfully curated collection, separate from the VAG’s permanent and visiting-exhibit pieces (which are not for rent). The program currently offers works by 121 B.C.–based artists, including Paul Wong, Kari Kristensen, Vanessa Lam, K C Hall, Gabryel Harrison, David Wilson, Rebecca Chaperon, and Kevin Boyle. Entrance to the program’s showroom at the VAG (750 Hornby Street) is free and it’s open to the public Monday through Friday. Rental fees start as low as $10 per month, with the average monthly fee around $80.

Best punk/hot dog/baseball combo

Are there two things that go together better than baseball and hot dogs? How about punk rock and hot dogs? Or punk rock and baseball? If you like all of the above or any combination thereof (and also pinball), What’s Up? Hot Dog! (2481 East Hastings Street) could quickly become your favourite punk-rock baseball hot-dog joint. What’s Up? is owned by musicians Jenna Hagarty and her husband Matt. Among other bands, Matt has done a stint in the Isotopes, the local punk outfit named after a fictional baseball team from The Simpsons. (The Isotopes are, in fact, also a real-life team in the East Van Baseball League.) If you can’t think of a better way to spend a Saturday afternoon than munching on a frank (or vegan equivalent) and watching MLB action on a big screen while the Clash and Ramones blare away in the background, this is your place. It also helps if you like pinball. And The Simpsons.

Best local-music-inspired halloween costume

It would be pretty easy to dress up as Nardwuar the Human Serviette for Halloween: just grab a microphone and don a tam-o’-shanter and you’re good to go. More creative types, however, might want to hit the October 31 party scene decked out in western-glam finery inspired by country outsider Orville Peck. A fringed mask and a Stetson hat will get you started, but for further motivation, pick up the Autumn/Winter 2019 edition of British GQ Style, which features Peck on the cover. According to the magazine’s website, the issue features a photo shoot in which the singer “wears a carousel of looks from Gucci, Bottega Veneta and Louis Vuitton, combined with iconic vintage western wear”. You, of course, can’t afford any of that, which is why thrift stores exist.

Best we-knew-her-when moment

We always knew Hannah Georgas was going places. (We even put her on our cover back in 2016 when she headlined the West 4th Avenue Khatsahlano Street Party.) We also knew that she was a fan of the National, mostly because she very publicly declared as much in her 2009 single “The National”, telling of singing along with the band at a concert. This summer, Georgas got to combine both of those things—going places and singing along with the National—when the group invited her to join them on the road as a backing vocalist. The tour kicked off, aptly enough, with a local show at Deer Lake Park on August 28. Not gonna lie, we teared up just a little.

Best nonmusical release by local musicians

Between putting out a new album, headlining a concert at Malkin Bowl, and touring the whole damn country, 2019 has been a pretty big year for Said the Whale. Alongside vinyl LPs and T-shirts at its merch table, the band has been selling a somewhat less expected item. The Cascadia Cookbook is an 80-page “culinary companion” to Said the Whale’s album of the same name, featuring recipes and drink pairings inspired by the record’s songs, plus photos by Lindsey Blane and the band’s own Jaycelyn Brown. Currently, The Cascadia Cookbook is available only at Said the Whale shows, but remaining stock (if any) will be sold online after the tour.",[]

Best budget culinary excursion

Should you win Lotto Max this weekend, your ultimate Vietnam experience will start with a sprawling breakfast buffet at Ho Chi Minh City’s colonial Hotel Majestic, followed by cocktails and appetizers at the Rex Hotel’s famous rooftop bar, and a white-tablecloth dinner at the exotic Jardin des Sens restaurant. Next stop Hanoi, where the street-food stands near the Đong Xuân Market are every bit as brilliant as the fried fish upstairs at Cha ca Lã Vong.

For a less financially ruinous culinary journey, head to the strip of budget Vietnamese restaurants dotting Victoria Drive between 33rd and 41st avenues. Making the wrong decision for lunch is pretty much impossible, which is to say the bún bò Hue at the Hoi An Cafe is every bit as worth the trip as the bánh mì sot vang at the Hanoi Old Quarter Restaurant.

But for best in show, there’s a reason the lineup is usually out the door at Bún Chá Cá Hoáng Yén. The sign promises “Vietnamese and Canadian cuisine”, but we’ve got a sneaking suspicion that might be a throwback to the ’70s—unless your idea of Canuck cuisine is the house specialty bún cha cá (fish cakes in vermicelli-noodle soup, served with a mountain of fresh basil, bean sprouts, shredded lettuce, and lemon wedges).

Not into waiting for a table, where you often sit with strangers? Head south a couple of blocks to Banh Mi Saigon, where lemongrass pork and Vietnamese-ham bahn mis are served on piping-hot, baked-on-site French bread for $5.50 and under. Both places are cash only—which, fittingly enough, will make you feel like you’re in Vietnam.

Best new initiative to elevate women in food and wine

WORTH stands for “women of recreation, tourism, and hospitality”, and the group aims to address the gender gap in those industries and connect women working within them. Founder Joanna Jagger worked as a chef, bartender, host, server, oyster shucker, and HR lead before joining Capilano University’s school of tourism and outdoor recreation as an instructor. She started WORTH to level the playing field in sectors she’s passionate about where women remain underpaid and underranked compared to their male counterparts. With events that raise funds for scholarships for young female culinary students and with workshops for women on topics like how to negotiate salary and handle sexual harassment, this is girl power at its best.

Best local boost to Belize farmers

Vancouver’s Umeeda and Nareena Switlo make Truly Turmeric—the world’s first wild-crafted whole-root turmeric paste—by partnering with hundreds of small-scale farmers in Belize. Belize has horrendously high unemployment rates. Naledo, the mother-daughter team’s social enterprise, employs people aged 19 to 32, paying them more than minimum wage while providing mentorship and entrepreneurial training. When the pair appeared on Dragons’ Den in 2018, they got offers from all six Dragons. Turmeric has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The bright-orange paste can be swapped for powdered turmeric in any recipe that calls for it. Truly Turmeric is now sold all over Canada, and the duo plan to expand and add more farmers to their family.

Best use of good-for-you fruit in a not-so-good-for-you dessert

Straight food writer Tammy Kwan regularly indulges in desserts like Japanese soufflé pancakes and salty egg-yolk cream puffs. But there’s one category of sweets she refuses to even taste: those that incorporate good-for-you fruits and vegetables. Banana bread? Nope. Carrot cake? Nah. Apple pie? Try again. But even Kwan can’t resist Billy Button Dessert Bar’s Orange, a spherical treat that looks like a mandarin—grainy skin texture, stem, and all—but is actually orange-confit marmalade housed in a solid shell of orange-coloured white-chocolate ganache. The buzzy Mount Pleasant dessert spot also makes the Mushroom, a giant fungus-shaped sweet that looks like a mushroom but is actually made of cream puffs, pana cotta, and milk-chocolate Chantilly.

Best reason to go for a drink in Vancouver

Sweet hallelujah: gone are the days of rum ’n’ Cokes and crantinis. Cocktail culture is alive and well here in Vancouver, giving new meaning to the term Wet Coast. Beyond the city’s wide variety of cool bars and array of restaurants that have drinks lists as long and as carefully curated as their food menus, we are also home to several bartenders who are killing it on the national scene. Bittered Sling cofounder Lauren Mote is a bar star, the “cocktailian” having been the first woman to win the Diageo World Class Canada Bartender of the Year competition in 2015. Kaitlyn Stewart, who is currently shaking and stirring at Elisa, took home the award in 2017. This year, the Fairmont Pacific Rim’s Botanist bartender Jeff Savage earned the title. (The Straight’s Golden Plates 2019 bartender of the year was Tableau Bar Bistro’s J S Dupuis.) These are just a few of our best bartenders, who are making us proud while making us superb and inventive drinks. Find others at a watering hole near you.

Best one-stop shop for beard wax, east van merch, and gourmet pickles

Jackson’s General

1490 Kingsway

Few stores encapsulate East Van living in quite the way the cozy new Jackson’s General does. Housed in a retro space near Kingsway and Knight Street, the space has a heritage window sign that harks back to the East Van of old. The latest brainchild of Grubwear founder Mike Jackson carries everything from eco products to food and clothing, all with a sustainable, buy-local feel. We’re talking Max fruit popsicles, Oddity kombucha, East Van Bees honey, and Kaylin & Hobbs pickles alongside Bamboo Earth true toothbrushes and Bearded Nomad or Splendid Bastard grooming products custom-made for the facial-hair-happy hipster in your life. Anchoring it all are Grubwear’s own T-shirts, like the one sporting the “Dude Chilling Park” sign and the proud and simple “East Van AF” and “Mount Pleasant” varieties.

Best social-media debate

When customers at Gastown’s now defunct Crab Park Chowdery posted a photo to Instagram of a rat allegedly found in their soup, Vancouverites were rightfully grossed out. But then came the skeptics: how does one scoop an entire dead rat into a small bowl without realizing it? Can a dead rat even fit into a standard-sized ladle? Also, why was the customer in question’s Instagram page mostly dormant before this image—which immediately went viral—was posted? Soon locals were split into two camps: those who believed Crab Park Chowdery had violated some serious food-safety regulations and those who believed the rat was planted in the soup by a disgruntled former employee or someone with a vendetta against the joint. Crab Park asserted that the incident could not have happened in its kitchen, but the restaurant ultimately couldn’t recover from the bad press and shuttered less than a month later. Like a good mystery or a decades-old cold case reexamined, maybe this one just isn’t meant to be solved.

Best reason Seth Rogen still loves Vancouver

Besides the weed culture, popular filming locations, and the fact it’s his hometown, our city has a big place in Canadian actor Seth Rogen’s heart because of its food. He’s given shout-outs to the Richmond Night Market eats (grilled squid and Little Phnom Penh’s wings, in particular) and the jelly doughnuts at Lee’s Donuts on Granville Island. He has also been seen with U.S. celebrity chef David Chang frequenting Richmond’s HK BBQ Master, a cult-favourite Chinese barbecue shop tucked away in the parking lot of a grocery store. Don’t be surprised to see him sit next to you at one of Vancouver’s ramen joints or some obscure food vendor.

Best local African vegan cuisine

When Kenyan-born Vancouver resident Asha Wheeldon shifted to a plant-based diet several years ago, she quickly came to realize that there were few vegan options around town that reflected her African heritage. She set out to change that with Kula Foods, which takes its name for the Swahili word for “eat”. Its products include sukuma stew—which is made with collard, lentils, cardamom, paprika, cinnamon, ginger, fenugreek, and more—and mandazi, a.k.a. Swahili doughnuts. Find them at farmers markets and select retailers, including Vegan Supply and the Juice Truck. At Kula’s heart is Wheeldon’s desire to create community through food; her slogan is “Let’s kula together!”

Best local effort to improve the lives of women in Africa

Vancouver resident Oumar Barou Togola was born in Mali, and now he’s making regular trips to the landlocked African nation to help bring about positive change in the lives of hundreds of female farmers in several villages through direct trade with Farafena, his social enterprise. The product? African superfoods: fonio (drought-resistant, it’s known as the next quinoa), moringa leaf powder, and baobab fruit powder. Abundant in nutrients, the foods have garnered interest from the Bill Gates Foundation and are found in grocery stores across Canada. The partnership boosts the well-being of entire villages and supports traditional farming practices. By being paid directly for the crops they harvest, the women are able to start microbusinesses, build homes for their families, and educate their kids.

Best large disappearing brewery

The Molson Brewery has been a fixture on the south side of the Burrard Bridge for six decades, but now the parent company prefers to create its suds at a sprawling and spanking-new facility in Chilliwack. That means the Concord Pacific–owned site on the city’s West Side is about to become a hot real-estate play. Our prediction? A master-planned community will eventually replace those stinky tanks.

Best lunch spot to load up on free refills

There’s no free lunch in life, but there can be perks. Vancouver’s popular Japanese eatery Saku specializes in tonkatsu (fried pork cutlet) set meals served in a modern and minimalist setting. Guests can choose from items ranging from deep-fried and breaded pork loin to deep-fried and breaded aged mozzarella wrapped with thinly sliced pork. But the best part is that each katsu (cutlet) set is served with unlimited rice, tonjiru (pork-and-veggie miso soup), and shredded cabbage, which tastes amazing when topped with Saku’s sesame dressing. The protein may seem like a modest portion when you’re starving, but the free refills will definitely keep you stuffed for a few hours.

Best birthday party to host when you want to sail the seven seas

Adult birthday parties usually consist of a nice dinner out with friends, drinks at a trendy watering hole, or a combo of both. If you’re looking for something a little out of the ordinary, check out Granville Island’s Pirate Adventures. This local company offers interactive pirate cruises aboard the Black Spirit, which sails through False Creek seasonally. Its pirate staffers will put you and your guests in proper buccaneer attire, complete with the pirate make-up you never knew you needed. (Think scars and mustaches.) Although food and drink aren’t usually included in its packages, organizing a simple potluck should be easy enough for folks who will probably spend more time on the ship singing along to pirate-themed anthems and aiming the ship’s water cannons at other boats on the water. Your inner Sinbad or Jack Sparrow will truly shine through.

Best thing to eat when you don’t have a budget

Let’s just say you received a big bonus at work or lucked out with a cash gift from your visiting aunt. The responsible thing to do with the extra money would be to invest in some mutual funds or put it in your savings account. But if you want to treat yourself to a nice meal, we suggest checking out a fancy hot-pot restaurant. Richmond’s Dolar Shop is a high-end hot-pot joint located in Lansdowne Mall. It serves individual pots and colourful mocktails in an interior that looks like it should be the home of a nice salon or confectionary shop. But we digress: splash out on menu items like premium beef or sustainable Oceanwise-certified seafood; you won’t regret it. If the seasonal deluxe seafood treasure chest happens to be available, go for it. With everything from tiger shrimp to abalone, the presentation is great for social media content. To top it off, customizable dipping sauces are available at the sauce bar, and unlimited ice cream is served at the end of the meal.

Best sign that fall had arrived even before the summer ended

When Starbucks announced August 27 as the first day of fall because it was the official return of its pumpkin-spice latte. The global coffee chain angered a lot of people who were still trying to hold on to the sunny days of summer, but the announcement also pleased those who couldn’t be happier about the return of sweater weather and all things cozy and nice. Remember when signs of fall were the leaves changing colours and temperatures dropping below 15 degrees? Those days are long gone",[]

There were many inspiring anecdotes shared and revelations had as I travelled through South African wine country a few weeks back. Although it’s not the same as the 30-plus hours of travel to set foot on the continent, much of the quality and deliciousness of the country’s finest offerings can be found by enjoying them at some of Vancouver’s best restaurants, where local sommeliers are increasingly waving the South African flag.

The first winery I visited was BLANKbottle in the Western Cape, where proprietor and winemaker Pieter Walser crafts 47 unique wines from 60 different vineyards. Part mad scientist, with a punk mindset and full of passion, Walser has a lengthy roster of wines that offer colourful, charismatic expressions of local terroir.

When sharing his red blend dubbed The Life of a Black Valentine, he spoke to a past era of South African wine a few decades back, when there were issues with making bolder wines like Cabernet Sauvignon. The small berries’ thick skin made for headaches in the winery, as having less juice to keep things moving in the pumps would cause the skins to block them up. The remedy at the time was to add another variety to ease the flow. Cinsault is a grape with thinner skin and plenty of juice, so it was often added to the mix but rarely mentioned on the label. The resulting wines were generally fresher and livelier than your average Cabernet Sauvignon, with the fruitiness of Cinsault making things a little more buoyant.

Although this workaround became largely unnecessary as winery technology and winemaking methods evolved, many of the current generation of South African winemakers are fond of that profile and increasingly turning to Cinsault to lift up their red blends.

Walser’s Black Valentine harks back to this secret addition of something quite lovely, and it’s a multivintage blend that also incorporates Syrah and Mourvèdre, making for a berry-and-plum-laden wine spiked with pepper and herbes de Provence.

Local sommelier Van Doren Chan has an affinity for the wine, proudly pouring it by the glass ($15) at Ugly Dumpling (1590 Commercial Drive), her Asian-street-food-inspired hot spot. Do stop by for a pour; I’m thinking their crispy-skin aged duck breast with yuzu kosho and baby lettuce—or pork and duck rillette with five spice, garlic scapes, and Livia sourdough—will come up a treat.

For those who find themselves captivated by the wine, Liberty Wine Merchants (1622 Commercial Drive) has a small handful of BLANKbottle selections.

Over at Hawksworth Restaurant in the Rosewood Hotel Georgia (801 West Georgia Street), wine director Bryant Mao is pouring a dynamite Chenin Blanc, which is South Africa’s most planted variety. Bellingham “Bernard Series” Chenin Blanc 2017 ($17 per glass) is composed of old-vine fruit from Cape Town, Stellenbosch, Paarl, and Darling and is aged in just enough French oak to bring a light, toasty character to vibrant tropical fruit like mango, pineapple, and papaya. The wine’s bright acidity will be a lovely accompaniment to chef David Hawksworth’s foie gras parfait with pineapple and pickled mushrooms, or his smoked-cod ravioli with fennel, buttermilk, and tarragon oil.

Brand-spanking-new in Strathcona is VV Tapas Lounge (957 East Hastings Street), brought to us by Chase McLeod and Rachelle Goudreau, formerly of (now shuttered) Mission in Kitsilano and Provence Marinaside, respectively. Fun small plates include fodder like devilled duck egg with white beans, crispy andouille and croutons, and lamb scrapple with Brussels sprouts and dehydrated tomato. There are a couple South African gems on the list here. Protea Chenin Blanc 2018 ($10 per glass) is an easy sipper with elevated aromatics of jasmine and lemon blossom, then waves of mineral citrus fruit on the palate. Those who are wanting to go big can opt for Anthonij Rupert Optima 2013 ($22 per glass), from Franschhoek. The wine is a blend of 50 percent Cabernet Franc, 30 percent Merlot, 17 percent Cabernet Sauvignon, and three percent Malbec, and winemaker Dawie Botha oversaw double sorting of the grapes before a cold soak, a 20-day fermentation, and a couple years’ aging in both oak and steel tanks. This wine is just hitting its stride with dark berry flavours, dusty cocoa, and well-integrated tannins.

Finally, for a dead-simple South African wine experience on the cheap, pick up a bottle of Protea Cabernet Sauvignon 2017 (Western Cape; $14.99, B.C. Liquor Stores), and then swing by African Breese Specialty Foods (3654 West 4th Avenue) and nab some authentic biltong. The South African take on beef jerky, often incorporating coriander and mustard seed, is quite addictive and will be very enjoyable with your feet up while sipping on that currant- and spice-driven bargain of a wine.",[]

Birthday cakes are a symbol of celebration, a wish-making ritual, and, most importantly, a delicious treat to dig into on someone’s day of birth.

But it can be stressful when you’re the one tasked with choosing a birthday cake. What flavour do you go for? What style of cake will satisfy everyone at the celebration? Will it be within budget? These are all valid questions when ordering this symbolic dessert.

Here’s a short but sweet guide to some of the most popular spots to pick up birthday cakes around town.

Classic crowd-pleasers

Cadeaux Bakery (172 Powell Street) is known for its beautiful layered cakes, usually featuring a Swiss-meringue butter cream or Chantilly cream frosting. Popular flavours include London fog and dark-chocolate praline, and custom cake orders are also taken—just be sure to give one to two weeks of notice.

Soirette (1433 West Pender Street) specializes in photogenic butter pound cakes, many decorated in pretty pastel hues and topped with macarons. Flavours rotate seasonally, but signature picks include chocolate hazelnut, chocolate Earl Grey, and vanilla caramel.

Trafiq (4216 Main Street) is a busy café creating some fan-favourite cakes that are sweet and moist. Popular flavours like salted caramel, tiramisu, and carrot cake almost have a cult following. You can also order custom chocolate plaques that are brushed with gold dust and handwritten with white chocolate for a sweet birthday message.

Yan Bakery's fresh mango cake is a best-seller. Tammy Kwan

Asian-style slices

Yan Bakery (2070 East Hastings Street) is a fuss-free Chinese bakery that requires advance ordering and accepts only cash. Its unassuming storefront is plastered with laminated photos of regular customers (you’ll find some famous faces), and it’s known for Asian-style cakes featuring flavours like fresh mango, chestnut, and taro.

Saint Germain Bakery (various locations) is the largest Chinese bakery chain in Vancouver. Online ordering is available (customers can take 12 percent off online orders), and it offers creations like fresh mango, mango-passionfruit mousse, Black Forest, and more.

La Patisserie (1405–4771 McClelland Road, Richmond) creates tasty Chinese baked goods and pastries, but its cakes are also showstoppers. Go for its fresh mango, mixed fruit, chestnut, or white forest cake. It also takes orders for custom cakes, which can be made with a traditional or modern touch.

Online order creations

Buttermere has been running its online cake business for a few years but has recently opened a brick-and-mortar shop (636 Main Street). Order from its website, which features unique rotating French-style cake creations with an Asian twist, such as matcha lava, oolong peach, and strawberry devil. Custom orders are also available, and always works of art. Daily cake pickup is at Torafuku (958 Main Street).

Remi Patisserie serves mouthwatering pastries at weekly pop-ups around the city but also takes cake orders. Its cake menu changes seasonally, and flavours like matcha–black sesame and Thai iced tea are currently available. An omakase (chef’s choice) cake option is also available, whose flavour won’t be revealed until you take your first bite. Cake pickup is at Sweet Barrel Creamery (2729 Arbutus Street).

Lemonade Gluten Free Bakery's chocolate-campire cake. Tammy Kwan

Gluten-free and vegan-friendly

The Gluten Free Epicurean (633 East 15th Avenue) whips up gluten-free baked goods and cakes, with dairy-free, vegan, and nut-free options. Choose from flavours like double-chocolate raspberry, lemon lavender, London fog, and many more. The best part is they look and taste great.

Lemonade Gluten Free Bakery (3385 Cambie Street) is a neighbourhood gem, offering a menu that includes gluten-free bread, pastries, and freshly made cakes. Some of the options include lemon cheesecake, white-chocolate raspberry cheesecake, carrot cake with cream-cheese icing, and a fan-favourite: chocolate-campfire cake finished with (dairy-free) toasted Italian meringue.

Chain-store goodies

T&T Supermarket is the largest Asian grocery chain in Canada, so it should be no surprise that its bakeries create crowd-pleasing Asian-style cakes. Consistent and competitively priced, customers will find a range of flavours like fresh mango, chocolate mixed fruit, fresh chestnut, and more. Some of its more unique creations that may appeal to younger crowds feature cartoon-shaped designs, such as a hamburger, panda, and Hello Kitty.

Whole Foods is probably the last place you would think of to pick up a cake within budget, but surprisingly, its repertoire of celebratory desserts are budget-friendly and delicious. Cake availability varies at every location, but popular picks include berry chantilly, chocolate-hazelnut crunch, carrot, tiramisu, strawberry chiffon, and black and white (chocolate and vanilla). Some gluten-free and vegan options are served, and free birthday messages written in white or dark chocolate are also included.

Dairy Queen may be a fast-food company, but that doesn’t mean it can’t serve up some tasty birthday treats. They offer ice-cream logs and mini blizzards cakes, but its classic ice-cream cakes are the iconic, fail-proof options. Made with fudge, chocolate cookie crunch, and vanilla and chocolate soft-serve, you can choose to decorate it with a custom design (photos can be printed on for an additional cost), or just go with the default décor. Either way, your taste buds will be happy.",[]

Trumpism and its Canadian mutations have taken some of us by surprise.

Five years ago, who would have thought that a rising tide of xenophobia would wash over parts of the world, fuelled by populist demagogues who delight in highlighting differences to advance their political positions?

In a lecture at SFU Woodward’s earlier this year, international-affairs commentator Gwynne Dyer recited a long list of elected authoritarian leaders—Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and Hungarian prime minister Viktor Mihály Orbán among them—who exploit people’s fears over job security just as it feels like robots are taking over the workplace.

Populism has a great deal of appeal in Canada, too. A recent poll conducted by the SFU Morris J. Wosk Centre for Dialogue revealed that almost a quarter of respondents believe Canada is offering too much protection for minority rights.

In Quebec, a shocking 48 percent of respondents said they feel there is too much freedom of religion.

Fortunately, in Vancouver there are many multicultural festivals that are countering people’s lack of understanding of their fellow citizens and other countries.

For instance, when the Richmond World Festival was created in 2015, nobody ever dreamed that it would be a useful counterweight against Trumpism and bigotry.

But that’s been its effect in our community by bringing diverse cultures together from around the world for a weekend of intercultural arts, food, and music. It’s actually helping to counter xenophobia in Metro Vancouver.

The Labour Day weekend celebration of TaiwanFest in Vancouver is another event that has served as a channel to bring together diverse cultures.

This year’s 30th-anniversary event had the theme Riding the Waves With Vietnam, which saw the organizer, the Asian-Canadian Special Events Association (ACSEA), team up with the Southeast Asian Cultural Heritage Society (SEACHS). This was the fourth installment of TaiwanFest’s Dialogue With Asia series, which previously engaged communities from Hong Kong, Japan, and the Philippines.

One of TaiwanFest’s hallmarks over the years has been to educate Canadians about Indigenous peoples who lived in Taiwan throughout the centuries when it was being colonized by the Dutch, Spanish, Han Chinese, and Japanese. Another has been to educate Vancouverites about sustainability in Taiwan.

The visionary behind this festival is Charlie Wu, managing director of the ACSEA. He’s not interested in creating an ethnic silo only for Taiwanese people. Wu’s objective is to form deep and lasting bonds with people from a multitude of cultures. Wu is also the brains behind LunarFest, which is where the Straight caught up with the only Vancouver police officer of Mauritian ancestry, Const. Darren Ramdour. He’s part of the VPD’s diversity and Indigenous-relations section.

“I’m trying to spread unity,” Ramdour said at this year’s festival. “I’m trying to learn about different communities and I’m trying to spread what I learn within the communities and within the department. The more we know, the richer we are as a person.”

He and Wu are not alone in this regard.

The Indian Summer Festival also promotes tremendous cross-cultural dialogue and music, bringing together Indigenous, South Asian, and East Asian artists, comedians, and writers in a smorgasbord of events. One of its curators is Jarrett Martineau, who is Nêhiyaw (Plains Cree) and Dene Suline from Frog Lake First Nation in Alberta. He is also the host of CBC Radio’s Reclaimed and the City of Vancouver’s cultural planner for music, and he likes creating points of encounter between Indigenous and non-Indigenous artists. It’s not fusion; it’s interculturalism in which artists do not give up their identity. And it’s helping to promote an appreciation for other cultures.

Indian Summer was created nearly a decade ago by the husband and wife team of Sirish Rao and Laura Byspalko. Their goal is not only to educate people about India’s thriving arts and cultural scene but also to introduce festivalgoers to the best of what’s being offered by other performers and writers. As an example, they put on a concert at the Chan Centre for the Performing Arts this summer that brought together a Grammy-winning Jewish American classical guitarist, Sharon Isbin, and Amjad Ali Khan, an Indian Muslim and one of the world’s most celebrated classical sarod players.

Paula Murillo is the executive director of Latincouver, which puts on the annual Carnaval del Sol festival. Charlie Smith

Carnaval del Sol is yet another example of interculturalism, drawing performers, artists, and chefs from Mexico to Chile and Argentina to a memorable Latin American plaza.

The brainchild of Colombian-born Paola Murillo, executive director of Latincouver, the annual event at Concord Pacific Place reflects a region of more than 600 million people.

Like Wu, Rao, Byspalko, and the organizers of the Richmond World Festival, Murillo has ensured that the Indigenous people of Latin America haven’t been overlooked.

In fact, the Indigenous and African roots of the region occupied centre stage at several events during Latin American Week.

These Vancouver residents probably don’t think of themselves as cultural warriors taking on Trumpism.

But in a way, they’re doing their part to help Vancouver become an example to the world as a city that rejects the type of small-minded, bigoted thinking that’s become depressingly common in so many other places in 2019.",[]

It’s hard to think twice about food courts at Vancouver malls. There are chains like OPA! at Pacific Centre for Greek fast food, New York Fries at Oakridge Centre for a quick poutine, and A&W at Park Royal if you happen to be craving a Mozza burger—hardly anything spectacular to write home about.

The point is, shoppers stop by shopping-mall food courts just to fuel up with a quick bite and drink, before continuing on their hunt for the latest apparel or other spending endeavours. There’s usually nothing more and nothing less to these kinds of food spots, if we’re talking about North American–style malls.

The food courts located inside Asian shopping centres in Richmond, however, are an entirely different story.

In fact, it’s safe to say that most people seen eating at the southern suburb’s food courts planned for their visit to include a meal. Enjoying breakfast or lunch at one of these hawker-style food stalls may not appeal to some, but you’re definitely missing out if you don’t venture into these ethnic establishments, some of which command lengthy lineups even before opening hour.

Aberdeen Centre’s food court is one of the newest of its kind. When this Hong Kong–style shopping mall opened, it took a couple of years to gain traction and a steady flow of tenants and consumers. But it has blossomed into a bustling spot that attracts guests young and old in search of good food. One fan-favourite stall is Wu Fung Dessert, which despite its name specializes in crispy deep-fried chicken wings and other snacks, like curry fish ball and deep-fried squid tentacles.

Another is the Bubble Waffle Cafe, where guests tend to order noodle-soup bowls. Everything from the soup base to type of noodle to toppings can be customized, and paired with a drink and bubble waffle (Hong Kong–style egg-shaped waffle) for a special price.

“Our prices are reasonable, which is why people keep coming back,” Timus Chow, owner of the Bubble Waffle Cafe at Aberdeen Centre, told the Straight in an interview during the lunch rush hour. “We have good food and drinks, and we always have a special bubble-waffle deal. There’s also dessert, which should be appealing.”

Just across the street is Parker Place, another of Richmond’s Asian shopping centres. Its food court is not as shiny and new as Aberdeen’s, but you’ll have a hard time finding a spot to sit down even on a rainy weekday.

Its food-court stalls are mom-and-pop shops opened by no-fuss owners who couldn’t care less about taking an interview from a local English-language newspaper.

In the morning, you’ll usually find retirees and seniors chowing down on an egg-and-ham sandwich paired with a cup of Hong Kong–style milk tea. During lunch, the busiest (and most lucrative) time of day for the vendors, lineups will form at some of the more popular shops, such as barbecued meat specialists Tai Fook Noodle & Congee Shop—it serves a delicious barbecued-duck rice noodle—and Lai Taste, known for its Vietnamese-style pork-chop and fish-fillet sandwiches.

“Weekends during lunch are the busiest,” Jerry Yu, owner of Lai Taste, told the Straight in an interview at the 10-year-old food stall. “There are a lot of people who order takeout, and we have one regular customer who drives all the way from North Vancouver.”

You’ve heard of people driving up from Seattle or Portland for Metro Vancouver’s dim sum, but now there’s also evidence of city-dwellers trekking to suburban regions just for good food-court fare.

Next to Parker Place is Empire Centre, a little mall home to jewellery shops, a travel agency, and beauty salons. Its food court is small but offers chicken, bubble tea, and more. But its crown jewel is probably James Snacks, a popular joint known for its clay-pot rice—or, according to the menu, sand-pot rice.

It can take more than 20 minutes for the sand-pot rice to be ready at Empire Centre's James Snacks. Tammy Kwan

This dish is popular in Hong Kong, but patience is key. It can take more than 20 minutes for your meal to be ready, but it will be well worth the wait. Customers can choose various pots, including preserved sausage, free-range chicken with mushroom, and spare rib with black-bean sauce. Each dish is served with rice and some veggies, and guests just need to add soy sauce and mix before digging into the flavourful creation. Near the end, you’ll find pieces of compressed fried rice, crispy from the heat of the pot, which is extremely popular with young diners.

“We have been open for 15 years,” Edna Yu, co-owner of James Snacks alongside husband James, told the Straight at their food stall. “The easiest way to find out what this dish is, is to simply try it yourself.”

A little further away from the side-by-side shopping malls listed above is Yaohan Centre, home to a supermarket and other locally run shops.

Its food court is also loved by many, because it offers an expansive seating area and a wide selection of food stalls that are consistent and reasonably priced. On any given day, you’ll find a steady flow of customers at Wah Yuen Noodle House ordering congee, rice rolls, and noodle soups. At lunchtime, you’ll also find many hungry patrons huddled in front of Curry House, which has been in operation for 26 years at the shopping destination. Its Hainanese chicken and curry beef brisket with rice are bestsellers, and its customers range from Asian families to Caucasian trades workers on their lunch break.

Even though there are many other options available at the Yaohan Centre food court, Curry House’s owner, Sunny Wong, isn’t fazed.

“There’s always been competition, so it doesn’t matter,” Wong told the Straight as he was preparing an order. “As long as you make good food, then it won’t matter.”

It’s important to note that most Asian food-court stalls only accept cash, so it’s best to stock your wallet before making a visit to these food spots. It can also be pretty hectic on your first visit, but that’s part of the experience.

“People come to food courts to look for fun places to eat, where they can try something new and bring their whole family to have a nice meal out,” noted Bubble Waffle’s Chow. “It’s not as formal as dining at a restaurant, but equally delicious.”",[]

Most of us have probably enjoyed more than a handful of meals at Chinese restaurants around Metro Vancouver. From casual Hong Kong–style cafés to no-fuss Shanghainese eateries, and from popular Szechuan spots to traditional Cantonese dining establishments, there are Chinese flavours for all types of palates.

The majority of diners usually order à la carte items (especially for dim sum), or choose from set menus for convenience. Branching off from the often budget-friendly set meals, there are the Chinese banquets: multi­course Chinese meals usually found in Cantonese seafood restaurants.

This type of reserved, pre-ordered feast is usually set aside for the most festive occasions, specifically weddings, birthdays, and a newborn’s one-month or 100-day celebration (significant milestones in Asian cultures).

If you grew up in a traditional Chinese household, it’s more than likely you’ve been dragged along to a few of these underrated meals. In retrospect, these celebratory dinners are a treat, and when you know it’s going to take place at a reputable restaurant, it’s usually something to look forward to months in advance.

So, what’s the big deal about Chinese banquets?

For starters, they can range from 20 to 30 people (in a private dining area) all the way to 200 guests (which would require booking the entire restaurant). Each table can comfortably accommodate 10 to 12 guests, depending on the size of the establishment. In terms of cost, a banquet can range between $50 and $80 per person, and more if the menu includes pricier ingredients.

As for the food, Chinese banquets follow a certain structure. The meals are usually between eight and 10 courses, and dishes are served family-style. Banquets vary, as customers have the option of tailoring the menu. But for the most part, guests are happy going with the pre-arranged picks.

At Red Star Seafood Restaurant, a popular Chinese dim sum and dinner joint in Marpole, signature banquet creations include king crab, Chinese-style roast suckling pig, roast squab, and Beijing duck.

“In comparison to western restaurants, Chinese restaurant menus offer a much wider range of dishes,” Andy Cen, manager of Red Star Seafood Restaurant, told the Straight in an interview at its Granville Street location. “From specialty seafood to other veggie dishes, it’s definitely a bigger selection.”

A traditional Chinese banquet will start off with an appetizer platter, before serving up a few hot plates. A hot soup, usually shark fin, will follow shortly—but Cen acknowledges that the shark-fin ban takes effect this month, and Red Star will switch to using bird’s nest. Seafood items like crab, lobster, abalone, and sea cucumber means you’re halfway into the meal. Next come fish and/or chicken, and usually noodles and rice.

It’s important to note certain plates embody specific meanings, depending on the type of celebration.

“A suckling-pig platter signals a strong and healthy year, which is extremely popular for birthday meals. For weddings, double lobster dishes have an auspicious meaning because having a pair is promising for newlyweds,” explained Cen. “Fish and chicken dishes always signify an abundance of health and wealth.”

At Fisherman’s Terrace Seafood Restaurant in Richmond’s Aberdeen Centre, the perennially busy kitchen team has been serving banquet meals for more than two decades.

The restaurant is known for seafood items like lobster and typhoon-style fried crab, and it maintains a regular clientele because customers know dishes will be consistent here.

Its manager, David Ngan, believes Chinese banquets are a steal when it comes to multicourse meals around town.

Fisherman's Terrace Seafood Restaurant moved to its current location at Aberdeen Centre in 2004. Tammy Kwan

“I think Chinese dinners are affordable compared to its western counterparts if you were to order the same type of dishes,” Ngan told the Straight in a phone interview. “If you’re ordering seafood like lobster and crab, it will definitely be cheaper at a Chinese restaurant. The cost of a meal can be very reasonable.”

Some of the most popular banquet items, he added, are a deluxe suckling pig and barbecued meats combo, crispy chicken, and steamed rock cod.

While there’s a lengthy list of destinations for consumers to choose from when it comes to finding a place that serves Chinese banquets, that also means those restaurants are operating in a highly competitive industry. But that’s not a bad thing.

“Healthy competition is good. A single restaurant cannot handle all the business,” explained Ngan. “Without competition, if it’s a monopoly, you won’t want to better the business or want to do better. You’ll always strive to improve your standards if there is competition.”

There are many reasons why Chinese banquets are go-to meals for special occasions, but besides good food, it’s also because of good company. It can be a little noisy and the dinner might go on for longer than expected, but enjoying tasty dishes while chatting with your family and friends is something that no one could get enough of.",[]

And Dhalwala is just getting started on some of the most important work of her life.

“Careerwise and community-wise, this is my time,” Dhalwala says in a phone interview. She’s calling from Toronto, where she’s doing TV for the first time. It’s food-related, of course, but she can’t say any more than that, not even to her 20-year-old daughter, who’s studying physiology and immunology at the University of Toronto and with whom she has dinner every night after taping. (Her 23-year-old daughter recently graduated from McGill University with a degree in environmental science.) “I love my life right now.”

Two organizations in particular have Dhalwala’s attention these days, at least when she’s not in the kitchen at Vij’s or Rangoli, creating recipes, cooking, working, talking, and laughing with her team. One is UBC’s faculty of land and food systems, which develops solutions for urgent global issues related to human health and sustainable food supply. With a keen interest in the climate crisis, Dhalwala is a member of its faculty advisory board. The other is MOSAIC, a registered charity that helps immigrant, refugee, and migrant communities throughout B.C. She has joined its board of directors, knowing firsthand what it’s like to be a newcomer.

Born in India, Dhalwala moved to Washington, D.C. as a child and came to Vancouver at age 30. Her mother and father were from Lahore, the capital of Pakistan’s Punjab province. Even here in Canada, she’s routinely asked where she’s from. It’s not that she minds the question, but she admits that it can sometimes make a person feel like they don’t quite belong. Food, she says, is a springboard to connecting people.

“I’ve been thinking a lot about the role of food and cooking in terms of our personal sense of community and belonging,” Dhalwala says. “Both my parents were refugees in the 1947 War of Partition. My dad became an orphan and lived in the refugee camps of old Delhi for nine years. He and my mom were so isolated and depressed when they moved to the U.S. in 1969, but they did it because they wanted safety and all the options for their children that the U.S. was promising. The first thing my parents did when they arrived is figure out where the grocery store was for tea, milk, and sugar—chai—onion, garlic, oil, and whatever foods they could afford. Mom cooked makeshift meals for us on an electric plate. While we ate, they would suspend their fears of new arrival and laugh at how crappy yet expensive the vegetables were in America and how horrible their chapatis were—Wonder Bread.

“If there’s one thing I definitely know about immigrants, it’s that they come with the culture of their cuisine,” she adds. “There’s so much pride to it.”

Dhalwala may be just as busy as ever, but none of it feels like work, she says, because she loves what she does. On October 7, she’ll be inducted into the B.C. Restaurant Hall of Fame. She’s had to make tough decisions getting to this point. Dhalwala closed her Seattle restaurant, Shanik, after two-and-a-half years, for example, and not because it wasn’t successful; in fact, it was a semifinalist for the James Beard Award for best new restaurant in the U.S. the year after it opened. (It was staffed by Ethiopian and Indian refugees, all women.) But travelling regularly between Vancouver and Seattle after her marriage ended was simply too much, and she was miss­ing her family and community. (She and Vij remain very close friends and business partners.)

“I call myself a feminist, and if someone like myself can’t make quality-of-life decisions, who can?” she says. “My mom just died at home with me and my girls on July 31st, and I’ve been thinking a lot about her life and how she carried it as an immigrant, woman, mother, wife, and politically active citizen. She told me that ‘mother’ was her most important.”",[]

1 of 2 2 of 2

After Saschie MacLean-Magbanua lost her younger sister, Chantal Yvonne, in a fatal car accident in 2014, there wasn’t much that could get her off the couch during a dark period of grief.

That changed when she saw a friend teach a dance class to a Beyoncé song. After she’d joined a few of those sweat sessions, it was clear to MacLean-Magbanua that dancing was a great form of relief and escape, and she proceeded to organize some classes for a couple of friends.

This led to the creation of RSVP33, which evolved into the newly opened Formation Studio (16 East 5th Avenue), a dance-based group fitness studio that she runs with her husband and business partner, Roman Magbanua.

“That feeling of tranquillity, escape, and just being able to shut everything out was such an important piece of it. Wellness, no matter what your capability, requires that mental element,” MacLean-Magbanua told the Straight in an interview.

Her other half believes it’s important to have a happy state of mind to tackle things in life, and that can start off by joining something that makes you feel good internally.

“You can work out and do all these things, but if you’re not happy, it’s hard to get your goals in order,” said Magbanua. “We play probably your favourite songs and teach cool moves, so you’re getting all the good feelings from multiple sources here.”

Both still have their daytime jobs, and juggling their new project hasn’t been easy. But when you have a dream and it becomes a reality, sleepless nights and accidental meal-skipping can be worth it. Here are some of their tips and insights for those who love fitness classes and working out.

Best thing about opening a dance studio

S: Seeing how happy people are to have a space where they feel like they belong.

R: Being able to dance with everybody.

Best warm-up to do before a dance class

R: Just put on your favourite track to listen to on your way here, because we run a warm-up, and most dance classes do their own warm-up. I would just say get yourself prepared mentally as opposed to physically.

S: I agree.

Best snack to fuel up on before a fitness class

S: I would say nothing too heavy, in case you’re really exerting yourself.

R: Banana or apple. Bananas are rich in vitamins and natural sugars and give you the energy.

Marutama's tamago ramen. Tammy Kwan

Best food to eat after a great workout

S and R: Ramen. Specifically, the mild tamago ramen at Marutama, with extra-hard noodles.

Best way to mentally prepare for a sweat session

S: To know you’re going to push yourself, and wherever you end up is going to be a good place to be.

R: I tell myself it’s going to be okay. No matter the outcome, no matter where I get to.

Best spot to pick up workout attire

S: At Formation Studio, we’re going to be carrying Girlfriend Collective, which is a Seattle-based brand that uses all recyclable material for their leggings and has very size-inclusive marketing. I still have a lot of love for lululemon, RYU, and all those other good spots.

R: I love OCIN. It’s mostly swimwear, but their shorts are really great for working out.

Best song to dance to

S: It changes all the time, but my go-to is “Formation” by Beyoncé. It’s so cheesy: my studio is called Formation and I’m going to say “Formation” is my favourite song.

R: “Drogba (Joanna)” by Afro B. It makes me feel good.

Best fitness studio that isn’t Formation Studio

S: I love Ride [Cycle Club], Hustle, and Tight Club [Athletics].

R: I don’t really go anywhere, but the last place I went to was Hustle, so I’m going to say Hustle. But being part of this community, it makes me want to support and go to more studios around us.",[]

From new home stores that brazenly bust out of the minimalist-white box to local designers upending everything from lighting fixtures to office furniture, there’s a lot to celebrate on the Vancouver scene. And for those in a more pessimistic mood, there are always mugs that tell the world exactly how you’re feeling. Read on for some of the best of the city’s new furnishings and homeware.

Best way to bring East Van streets indoors

From the iconic Only Seafood neon to the monumental East Van sign or misty Lions Gate Bridge, Vancouver artist and photographer Heather Johnston’s images now adorn soft velveteen pillows. The cushions, under her label 4 Oceans Art, come in the same West Coast grey scales that her photos do. Other favourite views: the ivy façade of the Sylvia Hotel, Stanley Park’s Girl in a Wetsuit sculpture, and the old Yale Hotel sign.

WA MOGA 29’s preserved summer blooms.

Best way to capture summer in a bottle

The warm, sunny weather never lasts long here on the rainy West Coast, but WA MOGA 29 has found an artful way to keep summer blooms year-round. Each sleek bottle acts like a mini desktop garden—one you won’t have to water or prune. That’s because this Vancouver company meticulously dries its handpicked plants and then displays them in a special preserving oil. No two are exactly alike, but we love the delicately long-stemmed Dear One #9 Delphinium in purply pale blue (a flower that represents “vivacity and an open heart”) and the packed-with-blooms Flower Haze Limited in Rococo Pink (with flowers like strawflower, celosia, statice, globe amaranth, and pepper berry), the latter in stackable bottles. The line, created by Japanese-raised, Vancouver-based artisan Reiko Kata­yama, draws on the Japanese approach of wabi-sabi, or the wisdom of natural imperfection—picture a gorgeous, tiny petal that’s fallen to the bottom of a bottle.

KARE Vancouver

1275 West 6th Avenue

We seriously dig the upscale-mod Boogie Nights vibe at this new German interior-design hub, which recently found a permanent home on the bottom floor of Fairview’s Inspiration Furniture. No boring neutral tones here: the 4,000-square-foot showroom specializes in the line’s bold pieces, from throwback ’70s hanging chairs to casino-gold bar-tray tables on wheels. Signature pieces include a curving brass-gold velvet sofa with seashell-like linear quilting (we’re picturing it in front of Blue Velvet’s purply-mauve walls right now), an Elvis-worthy woven Acapulco chair, a Daliesque melting gold mirror, and a paint-splattered horse figurine straight out of a peyote dream. The vintage velvet home bars with gold accents? They’re the stuff of your Rat Pack dreams.

Concealed design creates an ethereal glow with its architectural lighting.

Best mix of the sustainable and sci-fi in lighting

Cheryl Cheng and Mario Sabljak’s concealed studio draws from crystals and other natural forms for its unearthly, geometric lighting. At last year’s Why I Design show at the Museum of Vancouver, the duo displayed standing lights crafted from paper offcuts. The backlit objects were constructed without glue or adhesive, and placed atop blocks of reclaimed cedar at different angles. Meanwhile, their custom 5.3 Architectural Panel features similar folded-paper peaks and valleys, all encased in a wood frame. Step into their ethereal world at this year’s Eastside Culture Crawl, November 14 to 17, at the ARC studios.

Look beyond the leafy installation by local vendor Celsia Florist for a sleek installation conjured by Vancouver’s Jeff Martin and Henry Norris. For sheer design genius, check out Thomas Heatherwick’s Spun, a playful creation that definitely isn’t your granny’s rocking chair: crafted from dark-purple polyethylene, the sculptural seat looks like a giant vase or spinning top and swivels when you tilt it on its side. Elsewhere, fashionistas will go ga-ga for the colourful embroidered-bee or -cat Gucci pillows, with their hand-applied braided trims and fringe tassels.

Anyone who is familiar with theatresports knows that it’s the quick-witted, fast-paced, sprint race of the comedy world—and there’s nothing about it that’s predictable. The improv format was created in Calgary by Keith Johnstone in the 1970s and has since become one of the most popular comedy art forms because it’s always high-energy, hilarious, and very entertaining.

(VTS) was one of the first improv companies in the world when it opened in 1980. It boasts some of the industry’s most famous veterans, including Colin Mochrie, Ryan Stiles, Veena Sood, Nancy Robertson, Dean Haglund, and Richard Side—to name but a few.

The company performs 11 to 13 shows per week, 52 weeks a year, in its purpose-built theatre, The Improv Centre on Granville Island (1502 Duranleau Street). There is a bar on-site so audience members are welcome to enjoy a drink before and during the performance.

Part of the magic of improv is that even seasoned attendees can always expect something different, since the actors rely on audience suggestions to move the action forward. In fact, in the world of theatre, improvisers are often considered as the daredevils of acting due its impromptu nature. To be successful, they have to write their own scripts, direct themselves, and perform in character—all in the moment.

Vancouver TheatreSports

As VTS enters its 40th year of making people laugh in 2020, it has a lot more to smile about. The theatre company just won Best Improv Troupe or Company in the Straight’s Best of Vancouver (BOV) readers’ choice awards. It will also be hosting the 2019 International Theatresports Institute’s Conference and Festival from October 14 to 20.

The event, which is put on by the International TheatreSports Institute, takes place every two years and is the biggest of its kind. In the past it has been held in Dubai and Milan, and its professional development conference attracts improv actors and companies from all over the world.

In addition to the conference, there is a festival, which is open to the public and involves 39 shows over six days in three venues. More than 100 improvisers will come to Vancouver and appear in shows alongside VTS ensemble actors.

In addition to performing improv, VTS teaches other high-level acting skills at its . There is also a corporate training division, Improv For Business, which gives tailored workshops in categories such as team building, leadership, and presentations.

The (VSO) has had a very successful year. Last season alone, more than 270,000 people attended its movies series, kids programs, school of music, and outstanding masterworks concerts, including free performances at Sunset Beach and Deer Lake.

Now, in its 101st season, and after an incredible summer, there’s another reason to celebrate. That’s because the orchestra just won Best Local Classical Music Ensemble in the Straight’s Best of Vancouver (BOV) readers’ choice awards.

The VSO relies on the support of individuals, foundations, and corporations to make classical music affordable and accessible to all. In 2020, audiences can also look forward to another exceptional season of music-making, in addition to expanded programming.

The 7th annual New Music Festival will be kicking off the year with a diverse collection of contemporary musical discovery. Then, in March, audiences can join the VSO in a celebration of 250 years of Beethoven at BeethovenFEST.

The new season will also welcome a number of special guests, including , , , , , and many more.

For those who like to get a head-start on their weekend, the VSO will be continuing its popular Thursday evening AFTERWORK series. Guests are invited to the Orpheum Theatre for happy hour at 5:30 p.m., followed by a short format, no-intermission concert sponsored by an hour later. Audiences can then take the opportunity to mingle with the VSO musicians post-performance and still have time to make their dinner reservations.

Fans of the VSO will also be delighted to hear that the second-annual Day of Music celebration will be taking place once again in 2020. The inaugural event welcomed more than 14,000 people to the Orpheum Theatre and VSO School of Music, so be sure to stay tuned for this year’s announcement.

If one thing’s for certain, 2020 will be the VSO’s biggest and best yet.

Poke, pronounced “poh-keh” is a raw fish treat hailing from Hawaii, but after arriving on Vancouver’s food scene, its popularity took the dish from an appetizer to a full meal.

It is really no surprise that was runner-up for the Best Poke in the Straight’s Best of Vancouver (BOV) readers’ choice awards. With seven locations in and around Vancouver, and a fresh chef-inspired menu, Pacific Poke is certainly capable of satisfying everyone’s desire for poke. Pacific Poke was created by a passionate team of food lovers, both motivated and inspired, to create one-of-a-kind bowls layered with a healthy rice or salad base, high-quality OceanWise fish, and flavourful toppings.

Eager to stay on top of food trends and to please Vancouver’s flourishing foodie subculture, the chefs at Pacific Poke are continually incorporating new ingredients and developing unique flavour combinations. Though Pacific Poke has mastered the preparation and the artistic display of raw fish and seafood, the restaurant also has plentiful options for those on vegan, vegetarian, or keto diets.

Hungry customers can choose between six chef-inspired creations or they can listen to their cravings while building their own poke bowl. Not only does Pacific Poke serve wild sockeye salmon, ahi tuna, and a mixture of crab and shrimp, there are also delicious ingredients like oyster mushrooms, marinated jackfruit, and tofu for those who have yet succumbed to the temptation of raw fish.

With 10 sauces to choose from, including sesame miso dressing, pacific ponzu, and mango jalapeño vinaigrette, customers can ask for just a drizzle, or request that their sliced fish floats atop tasty umami sauces.

Since Pacific Poke happily welcomes every customer, regardless of their protein or sauce preferences, the restaurant makes a fantastic spot for co-worker lunches, family dinners, or even a post-gym takeout meal. Along with providing professional service and an exciting menu, Pacific Poke has partnered with ChopValue to reduce chopstick waste. Pacific Poke also works with Ocean Wise to ensure that future generations have access to a healthy ocean—and, of course, poke.

VCC offers comprehensive programs in business, design, health sciences, hospitality, transportation, and music. To ensure that students are taught the applicable skills in demand for each industry, the college designs programs based on consultation with B.C. employers.

For those who feel happiest in the kitchen, attending the largest culinary school in Western Canada is sure to impress future employers.

Culinary students have the opportunity to contribute their creativity and expertise to culinary events such as the five-course menu at the College’s dinner series, The Chef’s Table. Students will also work alongside some of the biggest chefs in Vancouver at the annual Flourish Gala.

Similarly, fashion students provide the wardrobes for events supported by VCC, like the “Model Organisms” fashion show for Vancouver Kids Fashion Week.

Committing to a postsecondary education can be intimidating, especially if one’s “gap year” ended up lasting longer than one year. This is why VCC encourages potential students to attend one of its “Experience VCC” events. As an incentive, application fees will be waived for those applying for a program or course at these sessions.

Both full and part-time studies are available to students at the three campuses: on Broadway, in Downtown, and on Annacis Island. To make sure students are able to focus on learning, VCC offers services including counseling, disability services, free professional tutoring, and Indigenous services.

The concept of creating exceptional spaces intended for professionals is what shaped Pavilion Cowork, the city’s newest office space provider. The Vancouver-based company’s first location at 22 East 5th Avenue, in the heart of Mount Pleasant, is already creating a buzz since opening in September.

“Local companies who are starting or growing their businesses have responded enthusiastically to Pavilion,” says managing director Yosh Kasahara. “For us to win Best Startup is exciting because as we progress on our journey as a company, we are helping other companies to grow as well.”

Pavilion Cowork is making it possible for smaller ventures of all kinds to have their own head office in an upscale space with stunning modern design. With inspiration taken from boutique hotels from London and New York, the space feels like nowhere else in the city.

“Our intent with Pavilion is to be able to offer businesses of all sizes, scales, and industries the opportunity to have their own headquarters, a space they feel proud to bring their clients,” says Kasahara. “We hear about big firms like Google or Apple having their own unique headquarters, but we said, ‘Wouldn’t it be amazing if an engineering firm with two partners or an accounting group or design firm with say, 10 people, could have an HQ of their own—an upscale, professional space that supports their brand and growth?’”

The one-of-a-kind coworking space has everything that modern professionals need: lockable, private offices for three to nine people; secure, private high-speed Internet connections; access to meeting rooms with integrated tech for video conferencing; and superior soundproofing for privacy and confidentiality. There’s also a common lounge space situated away from the offices, where members can meet with each other or clients in more relaxed surroundings.

A lot of university students like to play video games.

Carleton University is starting an ESports league. The OPSE will begin this fall. OPSE stands for Ontario Post-Secondary Esports, and it will be open to postsecondary institutions across the province.

Teams will be able to compete in Rocket League, Overwatch, League of Legends, and Hearthstone. All of those games are very popular with ESports fans.

Preseason action for the OSPE gets under way at the beginning of the semester. There is no way of knowing what that semester will look like.

That is because the world is in the middle of COVID-19 pandemic. A COVID-19 lockdown in the spring led to students staying home rather than attending classes.

As a result, a decision will have to be made this fall. Maybe students will attend physical classes. Maybe they will take classes by remote. No one can predict what will happen.

The OPSE preseason starts in September. After that preseason, a regular season will begin in October. League playoffs take place in March 2021. An OPSE championship takes place at the end of that month.

Good news!

There is good news for students who might have loans to pay off. The winner of the playoffs get money. That amount has yet to be determined. Other good news is that the winning team will also get to take home a trophy.

Located in Ottawa, Carleton University is one of the biggest postsecondary institutions in Canada. It normally has a student population of approximately 32,000 students. That number might change with fall, with social distancing likely to remain a thing until a COVID-19 vaccine is found.

The Carlton Ravens will be the first team in the OPSE. Still, hopefully other teams from other universities will also join the league. A lot of university students really like to play video games like Overwatch and League of Legends.

In recognition of that, many universities across North America are now offering ESports programs as a way to attract new students.",[]

Goals will include identifying the strengths of players.

Toronto Defiant

Chris Infante is now an assistant coach with the Toronto Defiant. The team plays in the Overwatch League.

Infante’s name in ESports is “Spazzo”. Infante’s resume includes a stop with the Fusion University team. Infante was also a head coach with Talon Esports. His squad took first place in this past spring’s Overwatch Contenders 2020 Season 1: Pacific. He has been coaching since 2017.

According to a tweet from the team, Infante’s title is Assistant Coach, Strategy & Spacing. Defiant fans can expect him to have a say in scouting. Other duties include coming up with a strategy for helping the team win more. He will do that by identifying the strengths of players.

Infante will help head coach David “Lilbow” Moschetto and assistant coach Alban “Albless” de la Grange.

The Toronto Defiant is a cellar-dwelling team in the Overwatch League. Currently ranked 15th in the league’s overall standings, the team is at least doing better than the 17th-place Vancouver Titans. In early June, Defiant general manager Jaesun Won announced that he was resigning from his post with the team and retiring from ESports in general.

Penguin Books

You can’t spend 24 hours a day lobbing incendiary grenades at terrorists in CS:GO or waiting in vain for Fortnite’s long-delayed Season 3 to finally start. You’ve got to sleep, for one thing, not to mention eat—and no, chasing a fistful of Flintstones Gummies with a can of Monster Assault does not count as a meal. Reading is optional, of course, but if you can tear your eyes away from the screen for a few minutes, you’ll find that there are some pretty great books out there that even the most die-hard gamer can appreciate, covering topics from the history of video games to the bleeding edge of ESports.

This week’s pick:

The cover of the first edition of Tom Clancy’s 1998 novel Rainbow Six.

A fun fact about the 1998 video game called Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six: it was actually completed before Clancy had finished writing the novel that it was ostensibly based on, so not all of the plot elements are consistent between the two. Then again, if you’re a devotee of Rainbow Six Siege, you’re not likely to find many familiar elements or characters in the book at all. In other words, don’t go in thinking you’re going to develop any new in-game strategies; you’re reading this strictly for background—and, you, know, entertainment.

Set within the Jack Ryan universe (think Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger), Rainbow Six centres on CIA operative John Clark, who forms a secret multinational counterterrorist unit known as Rainbow.

The team must stop a mad scientist from taking over the world. Yes, really. His name is Dr. Evil.

Just kidding. His name Dr. Brightling, and he plans to infect most of the world’s population with a super-deadly strain of Ebola. Only Brightling and his “chosen few” would have the vaccine. They would inherit a new world, which they will have saved from the blight of humanity.

While it’s all very James Bond (or Austin Powers, if you prefer), it implies that extreme environmentalists are secretly plotting to exterminate the human race. This wasn’t received well in all quarters.

Sea Shepherd Conservation Society founder Paul Watson—whom some have branded an eco-terrorist—condemned Rainbow Six as “a vicious defamation of the Environmentalist Movement, embodying, amplifying and packaging all the worst stereotypes and prejudices”.

He was probably right. That, of course, didn’t stop Rainbow Six for debuting at number one on the New York Times bestseller list, or from spawning a series of video games. Coming soon: Rainbow Six: The Movie, starring Mike Myers as both John Clark and Dr. Brightling.

Just kidding. It’s set to star Michael B. Jordan as Clark and someone else as Brightling.

I’m still hoping it’s Mike Myers.

As video games go, it’s been a success of epic proportions—the crowning achievement being that PUBG has been banned in some countries for being too addictive, especially to kids.

Since its official release in December 2017, the battle royale-themed shooter has moved 70 million physical copies and racked up another 600 million downloads.

Now PUBG Mobile is getting an awards ceremony.

In a Twitter post, Tencent and PUBG Mobile announced an initiative that will allow fans to show their support for their favourite professional player. The key word there is professional, meaning the likes of RRQ D2E, BiuBiu, and BTR Zuxxy.

The words launching soon are also important: there’s been no actual date set for the PUBG Mobile Esports Awards 2020 ceremony. Also to be revealed at some point in the future is the voting process, including which categories are on the ballot.

PUBG Mobile has maintained its status as one of the most popular games in the world this year, offering up a prize pool of over US$5 million.

This year will be remembered as a time that was as awful for the world as it was great for ESports.

Jovan Doncic/iStock/Getty Images Plus

When the history books are cracked open 50 years from now, 2020 will be remembered as a time that was as awful for the world as it was great for ESports.

Millions upon millions of people were suddenly quarantined at home, looking for ways to pass the seemingly endless days. And as much as it was a good time to own a stake in Netflix or digital-book publishing, it was ESports where things went completely stratospheric.

That’s proven by new stats from the International Data Corporation and Esports Charts showing that the number of livestreaming hours spent on Twitch has doubled during the COVID-19 pandemic. With League of Legends, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, and Fortnite leading the way, 1.7 billion hours of competitive action were watched by fans in May, compared to 867 million hours watched last December.

And the landscape-shifting didn’t stop there. Here are four ways the ESports game changed as the industry adapted to make the most of a COVID-19 world.

Pivoting

The term pivoting is something we’ve seen a lot, especially during the early days of the pandemic. Seemingly overnight, traditional sports had their seasons derailed, including major-league hockey, soccer, basketball, golf, and international auto racing. The question then became how to keep fans engaged when stadiums and stands were empty and star athletes were in lockdown just like the rest of us.

The answer was to move things to the digital world. Auto racing was arguably first off the line; six days after Formula 1’s season-opening race in Melbourne was cancelled, foreshadowing the torpedoing of the season, we had the launch of a series called the F1 Esports Virtual Grand Prix. Viewers tuned into ESPN in the hundreds of thousands to watch drivers rip up the track in simulated cars.

NASCAR was next, attracting online audiences just shy of a million. The weeks that followed saw all kinds of firsts, from the NBA 2K league getting prime-time live coverage on Sportsnet, to NHL stars taking to the virtual ice for the Player Gaming Challenge, and the U.S. Ladies Professional Golf Association launching an online tournament. In all cases, the competition was every bit as fierce as it is in real life.

Betting

There’s no question that the idea of betting on ESports is difficult for some to wrap their heads around, but it shouldn’t be. If we had to make a wager, old-school thinking was that it would be easy for an ESports athlete to throw a Counter-Strike: Global Offensive match. You know—the way much of the Chicago White Sox team conspired to throw the 1919 World Series.

The 2020 cancellation of every sporting event this side of Turkish oil wrestling meant Vegas bookies had to think of new ways to pay the electrical bills. And before long, ESports gained a new audience. The dominoes started falling when the Nevada Gaming Commission approved season-long betting on CS:GO in March, followed by the green light for wagering on Overwatch League, Dota 2, and League of Legends.

The U.K. Gambling Commission reported last week that British betting on ESports hit nearly $2.6 million in March, compared with $86,000 in March 2019. You can wager your next paycheque that Vegas bookies are salivating at the thought of Pokémon Unite announcing that a world championship is coming sooner rather than later.

Marketing

Just because your grandparents have no idea what ESports are doesn’t mean that the business isn’t a huge one. How big? ESports viewership was pegged at about 335 million in 2017, hit 454 million last year, and is projected to grow to 646 million by 2023. That means that a lot of eyeballs are glued to screens, and that’s insanely attractive to corporations looking to increase brand awareness.

Knowing that there was a captive COVID-19 audience out there didn’t hurt either, which is perhaps why you now see the Mastercard and Kit Kat logos flying on banners in the background of the League of Legends kingdom. And why Marvel teamed up with Team Liquid on jerseys and hoodies that nod to both ESports and the iconic likes of the Hulk, Black Widow, and Iron Man. Even brands that don’t exactly need the money have recognized the demographically desirable power of ESports: Gucci jumped into bed with Fnatic this spring for a dive watch retailing at US$1,600.

Branding

One way to attract hi-wattage companies with boatloads of advertising cash is to recognize the importance of branding. There’s nothing wrong with selling yourself as a team in the traditional sense—that’s worked for everyone from the New York Yankees to the Los Angeles Raiders. But if you can sell yourself as a lifestyle, there’s serious money to be made in a short time. Ask Sean “Puffy” Combs, who realized that building an empire only started with rapping.

Organizations like the Los Angeles–based FaZe Clan has cleverly sold itself as more than a great way to bring gamers together. The operation’s home base in the Hollywood Hills sees vloggers, designers, and, yes, ESports athletes living under one roof, hanging out in the billiards room and spa, and kicking back in the in-house theatre. Want to feel like you’re part of the Clan? Spring for a branded T-shirt, hoodie, or pair of sweatpants.

Entertainment mogul Jimmy Iovine likened the FaZe vision to the rise of hip-hop this past spring, spearheading an investment drive to raise US$40 million for brand expansion. In announcing his involvement, he stated, “We’re at the birth of a new disruptive entertainment genre. FaZe Clan is a very powerful pipeline into gaming culture and their cultural impact reminds me of the early days of ’90s hip hop.”

“When we heard the Vancouver Aquarium needed help, we wanted to do something different to help a place that is dear in our hearts.” said Allen Diaz de Leon, one of the organizers of the festival, who met during their studies at the University of British Columbia.

World-renowned DJ Vanic will host the festival and will be joined by: DJ SODA, Brooks, TOKYO MACHINE, Poni, Hahlweg, DNMO, Grant, WEIRD GENIUSES, Cheat Codes, Nurko, and Gammer, plus a secret guest yet to be revealed.

Some of the biggest names in ESports will be playing in a live Valorant tournament during the 11-hour fundraiser. Players in the tournament will include: KUURO, JERICHO, Emong, Vincent, QuarterJade, JakenBakeLive, LIONE, JVNA, Team Liquid Mendo, SanchoWest, and Calcium, plus a secret guest yet to be revealed.

“Riding off our online festival DREAMWORLD with 5 million viewers, we’re excited to work with amazing partners like Trap Nation, Vanic, and BandsInTown for our next big festival experience with DJ sets and a whole new gaming experience we can’t wait to debut on the new digital stage,” said Abhi Mehta, CEO of We Dream Worlds in press release.

THX are also onboard as the official audio sponsor to bring top-of-the-line technical expertise to enhance the at-home clubbing experience using THX Spatial Audio for each DJ set.

“We were thrilled to hear from Vanic and the Gametheory Management team with the idea for a digital music festival,” said Lasse Gustavsson, president and CEO of Ocean Wise, the conservation organization operating the Vancouver Aquarium. “We are fighting for our long term survival and this is an example of a really innovative idea that allows us to connect with new audiences, and raise critical funds and awareness about the Vancouver Aquarium’s role as an education, conservation, animal rescue and research institution.” Gustavsson said in a press release.

Esports might very well be in the cards for new battle game

Talk about leaving all the options open, which is to say it’s possible that Pokémon Unite might be pointed towards a future in ESports, or maybe it isn’t.

Sitting down with the Japanese website Dime, the Unite development team suggested that the online multiplayer battle game’s fans will determine what direction things go in.

Industry analyst Daniel Ahmad translated portions of the interview, highlights including that “the game could become an established esports if the player base takes it in that direction”. If that happens, it’s conceivable that there would be world championships similar to the Pokken Tournament.

Developed in conjunction with Tencent, Pokémon Unite is a cross-platform League of Legends-style title featuring five-on-five action, with each team having a home base.

Players try to capture Pokémon while taking down the enemy, with characters at one’s disposal including Pikachu, Snorlax, Talonflame, Charizard, Lucario, and Gengar.

The team responsible for the game describes it like this: “Pokémon UNITE introduces a new kind of Pokémon battle—one that requires teamwork and strategy. It is simple and yet full of intricacies waiting to be unpacked.”

monkeybusinessimages/iStock/Getty Images Plus

Last week, the Gambling Commission in the U.K. published data showing the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on gambling behaviour in Great Britain. The latest figures show that the amount of money spent on ESports betting increased during the two months of full lockdown in April and May.

However, the numbers also show that betting on ESports was skyrocketing even before then. In March 2019, the total amount spent on ESports betting was £50,223 (equal to about US$63,325). By March of this year, that amount had risen to £1,517,548—an increase of a staggering 2,922 percent.

Between March and April of this year, the amount increased a further 124 percent. In May, betting on ESports totalled £4,616,610 (roughly US$5,820,968).

The number are impressive, but of course it remains to be seen if interest in ESports—and betting on ESports events—remains high even when traditional sports resume.",[]

Ninja

Cast your mind back—way, way back—to August 2019 and you might remember when Richard Tyler “Ninja” Blevins left Twitch to stream exclusively on Mixer, the Microsoft-owned platform.

Ninja was arguably the best thing that ever happened to Mixer. A few weeks ago, however, the worst thing that ever happened to Mixer occurred. Namely, Microsoft announced that it was shutting the service down on July 22, and that users would be redirected to Facebook Gaming.

If that left fans unsure about Ninja’s future, he erased all uncertainty yesterday—kind of—when he started streaming Fortnite live on his YouTube channel.

Mind you, this move didn’t exactly come as a shock. After all, Ninja’s YouTube channel has just shy of 24 million followers, which makes it the natural place for fans to find him.

Oh, and then there’s the fact that the gaming community has been speculating that this would be Ninja’s next move since a test stream leaked earlier this week:

What does it all mean? Has Blevins actually signed a streaming deal with YouTube, or is he just having fun? Only he knows, and so far he’s not telling. According to ESports insider Rod Breslau, sources say that Ninja is “in negotiations with streaming platforms and no exclusive deal has yet been signed”.

This week’s pick:

Tye Sheridan as Wade in the 2018 film adaptation of Ready Player One.

You’ve seen the movie, now read the book!

Well, I’m assuming you’ve seen the movie. Steven Spielberg’s 2018 adaptation of Ready Player One was delirious eye candy for gamers and pop-culture trainspotters of all stripes. It earned a nomination for a visual-effects Oscar and won the Saturn award for best science-fiction film.

It’s a great popcorn flick, so chock-a-block with CGI action scenes and loaded with Easter eggs that on first viewing you could be forgiven for failing to notice that there’s actually a story to go along with it.

Ernest Cline set his novel in a dystopian future (the year 2045, to be precise) in which the masses use electronic gaming to escape the dreariness of real life. Does that sound more like the dystopian present? In Cline’s vision, people aren’t just playing video games or watching ESports pros’ Twitch streams to keep themselves distracted. Instead, they are plugging themselves—or at least their avatars—into a fully immersive virtual world complete with its own currency.

That world is called the OASIS, and when Ready Player One opens, its creator, James Halliday, has recently died. In his will, Halliday left a series of clues that would lead astute users to a series of locked gates within the OASIS, ultimately leading to an Easter egg. Whoever finds the egg would get not only Halliday’s fortune, but also control of the OASIS itself.

This is where slum-dwelling teenager Wade Watts (avatar name: Parzival) comes in. Wade has been studying the video games, music, and movies of the 1980s—Halliday had a known obsession with the decade—in hopes of finding the keys that would lead him to the egg.

Super Smash Bros. publisher says ""We stand with the victims.""

Nintendo

Last week, the fighting-game community was rocked by allegations of sexual misconduct against Evolution Championship Series CEO Joey Cuellar. Evo announced that it was placing Cuellar on administrative leave pending a third-party investigation.

Several game publishers then announced that they were pulling their games from the event, including NetherRealm (Mortal Kombat 11) and Capcom (Street Fighter V).

Evo subsequently revealed that this year’s tournament—which had previously been moved to an online format in response to COVID-19—had been cancelled altogether.

In a tweet, event organizers said that Cuellar’s role will now be filled by Tony Cannon, and that Cuellar “will no longer be involved in Evo in any capacity. We are currently working towards his complete separation from the company and have relieved him of all his responsibilities.”

It was a rough week for the fighting-game scene in general, but the Super Smash Bros. scene was hit particularly hard, with allegations surfacing that named a number of people, including one well-known commentator.

In response, Super Smash Bros. publisher Nintendo issued a statement to IGN late last week that read:

At Nintendo, we are deeply disturbed by the allegations raised against certain members of the competitive gaming community. They are absolutely impermissible. We want to make it clear that we condemn all acts of violence, harassment, and exploitation against anyone and that we stand with the victims.

Some large companies are reaping a windfall.

This week, the Buy Shares website reported that the six top video game companies have enjoyed a tremendous spike in valuations this year.

According to writer Jastra Ilic, their market capitalizations collectively rose by an eye-popping $354.5 billion.

I didn’t know if I could believe that, having never heard of the Buy Shares website. So I did my own math, based on data from Y Charts.

I found that the increase from December 31 to July 2 was $569.93 billion.

It’s as clear a sign as possible that video games have taken off in this year of COVID-19. And some large companies are reaping a windfall.

Keep in mind that my figures incorporate the increasing market capitalizations of three big players in the video game industry that make vast amounts of money in other areas—Microsoft, Sony, and Tencent.

Tencent isn’t yet a household name in North America, but it should be: the publicly traded Chinese conglomerate is the world’s largest producer of video games.

It’s also one of the world’s biggest social media companies through WeChat, and it’s a monstrously huge venture capital player.

Tencent is based in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen in Guandong and it’s listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

It achieved the highest percentage increase in market value, as shown by the chart below. All figures are in U.S. dollars.

The Bill Reid Gallery of Northwest Coast Art has reopened its doors just in time to mark the centennial of its namesake, whose legacy lives on not only in his own timeless works, but in those of a new generation.

To celebrate, the gallery is ready to open a multifaceted new show curated by Reid’s last apprentice, Gwaai Edenshaw. The massive exploration of his life and work illustrates vividly that the Haida-art icon’s influence carries on through today’s Northwest Coast artists—and far beyond.

Edenshaw has worked for the past year to put together a tribute that shows all the complexity of Reid as a goldsmith, sculptor, activist, radio personality, and mentor—a man of mixed Haida and Scottish-German roots who, at 23, travelled to Haida Gwaii and began a lifelong exploration of his Indigenous identity.

The resulting exhibit, To Speak With a Golden Voice, spans early sketches through to key pieces from Reid, as well as works from colleagues such as Robert Davidson and Beau Dick. It also includes a new work by contemporary Haida artist Cori Savard and a sound installation that integrates Reid’s voice by singer-songwriter Kinnie Starr. (The show follows strict social-distancing protocols.)

“I think the complexity will shine through—certainly the multidimensionality of who he was, the good the bad and the ugly, but also the humanity,” Edenshaw tells the Straight. “Bill is such a giant in our imaginations—even for those of us who knew him well. It can be easy to just look at his accomplishments and forget his humanity.”

Gwaai Edenshaw is considered Bill Reid's last apprentice.

The Haida artist and filmmaker, raised on Haida Gwaii, met Reid as a baby, when his father, Guujaaw (Gary Edenshaw), served as Reid’s assistant in the raising of the Dogfish Pole in Skidegate.

“I actually walked for the first time on the day they put up the pole,” Edenshaw relates.

Edenshaw was 16 when Reid asked the budding artist to apprentice with him.

“He arranged for me to go down and live with him and I was pulled out of school,” Edenshaw recounts. “When I went into his apartment-studio, you know, it was pretty awe-inspiring to see all this different work and the pieces of his that were already iconic to me—some just kind of lying around in a pen drawer.

“He would set me on projects and assignments,” Edenshaw adds, agreeing Reid had a larger-than-life personality. “It was quite a bit of classical training, where he would have me do copies of different pieces that he thought would enrich my understanding of form, then he would edit and critique them.”

Edenshaw has gone on to work on everything from the dramatic film Edge of the Knife to comic books and totem poles, often creating gold, silver, and argillite jewellery. He says disentangling Reid’s specific influences on his artworks is a complex task, training as he did under his own father (who himself worked under Reid), taking drawing classes with Robert Davidson, and studying other masters. But one Reid quote has guided much of his approach.

“There was one statement that Bill made to me that has stuck with me forever,” Edenshaw says. “He told me that Haida art, when it’s done right, should look like an explosion that’s about to happen, rather than one that’s already happened. That refers to the tension in the line. That is the sensation you should feel if you stand in front of a piece of Haida art.”

Reid’s life’s work also helped paved the way for artists like Edenshaw and countless others to build careers—to find galleries and buyers to collect their creations.

“I don’t really know what compelled him in his time to pursue the art in itself, because the market as it existed was pretty limited and the understanding of it as ‘Indian craft’ by so much of the world,” Edenshaw reflects. “There were a few little pockets that recognized the value—anthropologists, mostly, and surrealists seeking to collect Northwest Coast stuff. But Bill and Robert and others, they developed a market. One thing they managed to do is articulate the complexity and the science behind the art and share that with the world, and once people were able to articulate how the art came together, that was a means for new people to get into it.”

As To Speak With a Golden Voice shows, Reid’s lasting impact goes far beyond the artists who knew and worked with him directly.

Painter and carver Savard says living on Haida Gwaii has allowed her a special connection to his art and its influences. “I think that the body of work that Bill produced set a high bar for what can be achieved through the art, across every medium,” says the artist from Skidegate. “Living on Haida Gwaii, we get to study a few of his works in person. The Haida Gwaii Museum houses a totem pole and a war canoe [Loo Taa], both carved by Bill—monumental examples that I feel are crucial for the next generation to study.”

In the new painting she’s created for the exhibit, she draws from her memories of seeing Reid’s famous canoe sculpture The Spirit of Haida Gwaii—and the connection to it she has through her mother, who introduced her to his artwork when she was young.

“It’s a reflection on some experiences I had as a child, growing up away from my community on Haida Gwaii,” Savard, who grew up in Quebec and Ontario, hints of the painting she’ll unveil at To Speak With a Golden Voice. “The Shark crest is a sub-crest of my clan; I chose it to represent my mother. She taught me about what it meant to be Haida, and what she knew about the art using what was available to her—in this case, the collection of Northwest Coast art, in the Grand Hall of the Canadian Museum of History.” The museum was a place Savard frequently visited growing up, Reid’s work acting as one of her beacons.

For singer-songwriter Starr, who has Mohawk, Dutch, German, and Irish roots, Reid’s journey mirrors some of her own questions of identity and mixed heritage. Working on the show’s sound installation has helped her build what feels like an intimate emotional bond with an artist she never met.

Soon after moving here in the early ’90s, she says, a counsellor at the Vancouver Aboriginal Friendship Centre suggested she study “mixed-blood artists who had a difficulty understanding their place and position in society at large and the art world”.

“I just had a feeling I didn’t belong anywhere, and then I was introduced to Northwest Coast art,” the artist explains. “I found a lot of encouragement in his story, in the fact that his mother had relocated her kids to Victoria because she wanted Bill to have a fighting chance at a time when being part Native was not okay. I found a lot of resilience in his story, and that he had spent a lot of his life not identifying as a Haida.

“He never referred to himself in the first person as Haida,” she continues. “For me, I see that as a lot of mixed-blood people never feel like they are able to claim their identity and be themselves. So for me it’s heartbreaking.”

Starr has combed through extensive vocal archives of Reid’s career to create her commissioned sound-based artwork. Reid had a career as a CBC announcer, and there are extensive recordings of his thoughts on Northwest Coast art. All of it is recounted in his mellifluous, radio-friendly voice—the one that led to Reid’s Haida name Kihlguulins (“Golden Voice”).

You’ll hear an artful collage of those sound bites hidden in different spots in the gallery, activated by motion detectors. Starr says she wants it to feel like Reid is whispering to you as you look at the works.

“I’m trying to do an ode to his sense of humour,” Starr adds. “One thing I know is that, outside of Indigenous society, a lot of people consider Indigenous nations to be broken and upset. But inside the Indigenous communities, humour is everywhere. In a lot of these [clips] he sounds like he was quite eccentric and funny.”

Hearing his voice has brought her closer to the influential icon—a goal of the overall exhibit as well.

“I feel like I know him better, and that feels like a rich opportunity because he was so important to me at a distance as a young woman,” Starr says.

A new one-stop virtual hub for Indigenous performance called Virtual Feast is launching July 24.

The project is created by the Lytton-based 2 Rivers Remix Society (the three-day, Nlaka’pamux-hosted ‘Q’emcin 2 Rivers Remix known as 2RMX), along with Vancouver arts forces Full Circle: First Nations Performance, Savage Production Society, and the eco-oriented Vines Art Festival.

Virtual Feast is set to stream concerts for the rest of the summer. The First Peoples’ Cultural Council is lending streaming support to a project created in response to COVID lockdown, when many festivals and venues are shut down.

It's already lined up 40 Indigenous artists across genres that range from folk to hip-hop. The roster so far includes singer-songwriter Kinnie Starr and rap icons Snotty Nose Rez Kids.

Virtual Feast kicks off with a live stream at 7 p.m. on July 24 with a Full Circle presentation of singer-songwriter Lola Parks.

Other programming includes 2 Rivers' Decolonise 2.0 on July 31. Commemorating the 110th anniversary of the Declaration of Interior Tribes (the unification of the Nlaka’pamux, Secwepemc, and Syilx Nations to resist the B.C. government over unceded land), it features Secwepemc/Nlaka’pamux the Melawmen Collective perform their folk-rock-hip-hop fusion from a stunning canyon location where the declaration was signed in 1910 and a set from 2-Spirit DJ O Show.

And Vancouver's Vines fest will stream its Resilient Roots performances on August 15th.

The content will go far beyond concerts, with interviews and educational workshops. For example, Mimi O’Bonsawin explores the subjects of stories in an interactive song creation in a workshop at 6 p.m. on July 28.",[]

The Vancouver Symphony Orchestra is joining forces with the the Vancouver Pride Society to present Symphonic PRIDE, a virtual concert performance celebrating BIPOC LGBTQ performers, composers, and dancers.

VSO assistant conductor Andrew Crust will curate the program, which is to be hosted by Old Soul Rebel's Chelsea Johnson.

Other performers include nonbinary drag artists the Darlings, spoken-word artist and poet Rabbit Richards, and dancer Ralph Escamillan.

The program will span music from ABBA, Lizzo, the Righteous Brothers, Nina Simone, and Franz Schubert, as well as the brief History of Queer Musicians in a medley of music from Frederucj Handel to Freddie Mercury and Janelle Monáe.

Dancer Ralph Escamillan performs in the concert streaming from the Cultch.

“This will be a celebration that highlights queer musicians and allies throughout history, many of whom were forced to hide their true nature during their lifetimes, and also celebrate BIPOC LGBTQ artists, who for far too long have been underrepresented or excluded from our stages,"" Crust said in the announcement today. ""These two themes come together perfectly in Symphonic PRIDE. I have invited some of the most creative and daring artists in Vancouver to come and share the stage with the exceptional musicians of the Vancouver Symphony. It’s going to be a great night of music and art.”

The concert is being filmed at the Cultch Historic Theatre and will be presented for free through the VSO and Vancouver Pride social media channels on July 31 at 7 p.m.",[]

Today, the Vancouver Writers Fest revealed a roster of more than 65 authors, poets, and spoken-word artists slated to appear at this year’s COVID-modified edition of the city’s biggest annual literary event.

Like so many cultural mainstays coping with new health protocols, the October-focused festival is going digital this time round, taking an online format based on live-streaming and podcasts as an opportunity to invite luminaries who may not have been available otherwise to join the West Coast happening.

Among the international headliners this year will be such acclaimed talents as Ayad Akhtar, Yaa Gyasi, David Mitchell, Megha Majumdar, and Marilynne Robinson. Alongside will be renowned names from across the country, like Thomas King, Margaret MacMillan, and Leanne Betasamosake Simpson, as well as a sparkling contingent from B.C.’s scene, including Ivan Coyote, Jillian Christmas, Sheena Kamal, Wade Davis, and Nancy Lee, to name only a few.

Top it off with an event featuring indie-rock icons Tegan and Sara Quin, and you’ve got a literary gathering with enough of VWF’s trademark range and flair to tide you over to the day down the road when the festival can return to its traditional Granville Island venues.

At the Firehall Arts Centre from July 3 to 11. No remaining performances

The just-wrapped Dancing on the Edge festival was taxed with navigating the pandemic’s Phase 3 distancing rules, and the result was programming that offered some real moments of revelation.

The 32nd annual event mixed small-scale courtyard and theatre events with a wide assortment of mixed-bill programming online.

The fest was well situated for the shift to digital (though that in no way should diminish the huge effort that went into rebuilding its plans). Its contemporary artists are used to experimentation, its shows usually taking an intimate scale that lends itself to the kind of short films that featured here.

The mostly Vancouver-based performers revealed new sides to themselves in cinematic work that felt surprisingly polished for the short turnaround. And several of the pieces, in a way that only dance can, poignantly expressed this moment of isolation and dissociation in ways that went beyond the confines of words.

Still, there was a bittersweet sensation watching artists like Josh Martin, Ziyian Kwan, and Jeanette Kotowich show their stuff online, instead of at the Firehall, where it's easy for audiences and dancers to make direct connections.

That said, the venue went out of its way to make you feel like you were there, opening each digital segment with video taking you by the iconic neon sign, through the red doors, up the carpeted staircase, and into your theatre seat. Then fest producer Donna Spencer appeared, just as she would at the venue, to personally welcome you to the show.

A standout was the intense solo Brimming, by Company 605’s Josh Martin. Shot by David Cooper, it was a polished dance film that played with editing and built to an emotional whallop. Martin revealed dark new corners in himself exploring the idea of the body as a container, invisible forces pushing out from beneath the skin.

In a work set in what felt like an eerie, sepia-lit plywood box, lighting designer James Proudfoot added to the atmosphere with rows of dangling bare light bulbs. At moments, Martin sat on a chair, pulsing to the music, at others jerking robotically or rocking hypnotically when he came to his feet. Brimming made time feel like it was standing still, the dancer-choreographer embodying a gnawing, disquieting limbo we can all relate to.

As the forces started to “brim” over and his container opened, Martin pulled into a silent scream that seemed to express the collective, Edvard Munch-like howl we all need to let loose right now.

It was a nice foil to Rachel Meyer’s work-in-progress on the Edge 6 program, the Ballet BC alumna's piece all liquid bodies rolling and curling in on themselves.

Shay Kuebler’s M.O.I.—Moment of Isolation was another highlight. The only offering performed live in a socially-distanced Firehall theatre was also streamed in a shoot by Cooper.

The Radical System Art show opened with a wonderfully playful—and timely—intro video by Keiran Bohay (shot by Justin Lopes), who began the work by adjusting his suit jacket and tie in his living room, Zoom-meeting-ready. The camera panned out to reveal he was only wearing his boxers and socks on his bottom half (a running COVID joke).

Moving to swishy electro-jazz, the dancer went on to pull off an incredibly physical piece, complete with street-influenced floor skills, despite his apartment's furnished confines. Fun stuff, energetically edited.

What followed, in the theatre, was a chain of six more solos choreographed by the performers and Kuebler, each exploring isolation in a different mood that was underscored by soundtracks that ranged from the haunting noise art of God Speed You! Black Emperor to the transcendant rhythms of Lhasa de Sela. Calder White and Isak Enquist expressed confinement in enclosed squares of light, or by throwing long shadows against the wall; Sarah Hutton joined a mesmerizing duet with a projection of Odile-Amélie Peters dancing in her living room, never quite synchronizing and speaking to that disconnect and ennui that's universal in these pandemic times.

Jeanette Kotowich moves on rooftops.

Other streamed work took diverse form. Tara Cheyenne and Alison Beda’s short Stuck and Emotional Houdini proved video as a perfect format for Cheyenne’s one-of-a-kind slapstick and warped humour. Jeanette Kotowich used editing and movement to build a ritualistic, meditative space in Kâ- Nîmihitot Atayohkan and resonance. The title of the former means “She who dances the Spirit” in Cree, and the artist offset that ancient inspiration by performing on urban rooftops. In resonance, she communed with the nature of Pacific Spirit Park, from the rippling water to the long beach grass, to serene effect.

Overall, the fest danced its way smoothly to a digital platform, suggesting that streamed work may find a lasting place at the Edge--long past the pandemic and beyond the overriding theme of solitude.",[]

Jocelyn Wong's bright ""All Together Now"" message beautified the boarded-up Anthopologie storefront on Granville Street as the city sat in lockdown this spring.

The project was one of the most short-lived murals during the pandemic: it took four days to create, then stood just four days before the shop reopened and it was taken down.

But now the artwork is getting a second life on 40,000 Jones Soda bottles.

Less than two weeks after Carousel Theatre for Young People issued a statement about dismantling systemic oppression, there's been a major change at the top of the organization.

The Granville Island theatre company's board said in a statement that it has ""mutually agreed to part ways"" with its artistic and managing director, Carole Higgins.

""Over the past week, we at Carousel Theatre Society have received many responses to our earlier statement on racism and oppression, including workplace environment, in our organization,"" the board said. ""It is clear from those responses that there are problems with our organization that are having a negative impact on our community. We recognize that change needs to happen.""

This followed an online petition alleging that the theatre company had a toxic workplace.

""The majority of those who have been affected by Carousel have remained silent due to being traumatized, and being afraid how it may affect their career going forward,"" the petition claimed. ""A whisper network has been in place for years, full of individuals who have been negatively impacted by the experiences at CTYP.""

The directors stated that they want their organization ""to be a place we can all be proud of"". No replacement for Higgins has been named.

""We will be working to rebuild a theatre that is inclusive, creates opportunity, and provides a safe place for everyone,"" the board stated. ""We are consulting with labour relations specialists to help us reach that goal. Real change takes time, thought, and commitment, and we need to take that time to ensure we are conducting this process properly.""

Carousel Theatre was launched in 1974 by Elizabeth Ball, who later served three terms on Vancouver city council.

Higgins became the company's third artistic director in 2006, winning a Jessie Award that year for outstanding artistic creation (direction) for The Big League. She won another Jessie in 2011 for outstanding artistic creation, theatre for young audiences, for Bird Brain.",[]

Noam Gagnon intended to dance for only one year after his completion of art school at Concordia University but life never goes as planned. Instead, he’s spent the last 39 years travelling the world with dance companies and teaching others how to express themselves through movement.

Gagnon will be performing his latest piece, This Crazy Show, at this year’s virtual Queer Arts Festival (QAF), which takes place from July 16 to 26. The inclusive festival features thought-provoking visual and performance art, workshops, panels, artist talks, and screenings, and will be accessible online this year because of the pandemic. Festival attendees have two opportunities to view his fascinating performance: July 25 at 7 p.m. and July 26 at 2 p.m. All events at the QAF are by donation and people can .

This will be Gagnon’s second time performing at QAF with his dance company, though the story told through This Crazy Show differs greatly from his previous performances. “This show is about using the power of imagination as a source of survival,” says Gagnon. “This Crazy Show tells a story about the past in order to understand the present and I feel that the male character in this story uses his imagination in a way to survive.”

Within the emotionally charged show that he choreographed himself, Gagnon will explore different gender roles and how the imaginations of children go on to shape their identities. According to him, this childlike curiosity and gender exploration is something that needs to be better accepted within our society.

“Through This Crazy Show, I wanted to create an experience for the viewer that will help them use their imagination to travel with me in this wild world that I find completely compelling and entertaining—it has many colours,” says Gagnon. Those who tune into the livestream performance can expect unique gender-bending costumes, lively music, and an impressive 16 disco balls.

Noam Gagnon

During a phone interview with Gagnon, it became remarkably clear that he grows as an artist by thinking outside of the box and challenging himself in new ways. He attributed his fiery motivation behind This Crazy Show to a quote by Albert Einstein:

“The true sign of intelligence is not knowledge but imagination.”

Through exploring his emotions, physicality, and inner psyche, Gagnon was able to create dance sequences that encourage viewers to challenge their pre-existing beliefs and feelings. “I find that as we get older, we have this black and white preconceived idea of right and wrong, and how the world should be,” says Gagnon. “But what we really remember are the experiences we’ve had that sparked emotion and sensation, and who we shared those experiences with.”

He hopes that viewers will leave the livestream feeling emotionally charged, inspired, and eager to discuss the storyline of the show with others. This social discussion can help people challenge their traditional beliefs and values, which will ultimately foster a more accepting and inclusive society. “There are many young people who were just like me at one point and they need to see themselves represented in a way that is positive and possible for them,” says Gagnon. “I am constantly pushing to create an element of visibility and I feel blessed that I’m able to educate others and challenge their strong preconceptions of what they think the world should look like.”

Despite his passion for performing, Gagnon believes that it’s time for younger generations of talented dancers to shine, which is why he will be taking a step back from the spotlight. “The last few pieces that I’ve done were created with 10 young phenomenal dancers,” he says. “Being able to use my 35 years of knowledge and share it with newer generations of dancers is incredibly exciting and perhaps even more rewarding than performing.”

But he refuses to call his QAF performance his “swan song” as he can’t promise that an enticing opportunity won’t arise in the future.

Gagnon chose the QAF livestream for what could be his last public performance for a multitude of reasons. “I feel that the QAF and Pride in Art Society fight such powerful battles for all of us, queer or not,” he says. “The organization works to make all of our lives a better place, a place where love exists.”

From the outset of pandemic lockdown, the Queer Arts Festival’s SD Holman decided that cancelling the event was not an option, and neither was laying off staff.

“I’m used to fighting. The whole queer community’s used to fighting,” the event’s artistic director tells the Straight. “If I had given up, it [the festival’s launch] wouldn’t have happened 12 years ago. And we’re nimble because of all that.”

The result is a 12th-annual multidisciplinary celebration that includes everything from streamed art tours and online performances to real-world art installations and a free zine.

The team flew into action to come up with a fest that could adhere to social-distancing measures in its own unique ways.

Jumping online was not straightforward for a festival in which some of the performers (including the nonbinary drag troupe the Darlings) have recently come up against censorship on streaming channels like Facebook.

“We’re always flagged right away, because queer is right in our name,” Holman says.

Instead, the fest has taken the huge leap of building its own streaming platform from its website (as well as broadcasting via traditional channels like Facebook). Programming like The Darlings, Uncensored and Too Spirited, by the Indigenous burlesquers of Virago Nation, will hit the airwaves.

So will Vancouver’s Vision Impure dance legend Noam Gagnon, with a retooled version at his gender-playing This Crazy Show (July 25 and 26)—a solo that the Holy Body Tattoo member has said will be his “swan song”.

Originally intended to be performed live, the audacious, identity-shifting work now converts to video, complete with its wild, flailing platinum wig and high heels. Holman says the show plays well into QAF’s “Wicked” theme this year, a topic that pushes back against the mainstreaming of LGBTQ existence and homonormativity as both erasure and commodification.

“Queers have reached this place where it’s okay if it’s palatable,” Holman explains. “ ‘Wicked’ is all about that: when we get this acceptance, who is accepting us? And what is it contingent upon?”

Holman, a photographer, felt strongly the fest should have some tactile elements as well. Enter art installations everywhere from bus shelters to community arts screens, as well as an artful zine program guide that will go out to festivalgoers.

On opening night (next Thursday [July 16] from 5 to 7 p.m.), visual-arts curator Jonny Sopotiuk will head up an artists’ discussion and virtual tour of an art exhibit that will live on QAF’s digital hub for the run of the festival. He’ll be joined by participating local artists Tom Hsu and Tajliya Jamal and New York City forces Avram Finkelstein and Elektra KB.

Colombian-born Brooklynite Elektra KB brings their interactive “stateless, genderless passports” to the fest, converting its usual gallery installation “checkpoint” to a digital rendition.

Wicked: Curated Visual Arts Exhibition, curated by Jonny Sopotiuk, runs from July 16 to 26 Elektra KB

Sopotiuk tells the Straight that people can go online and remove associations with any nation states and the art, i.e. the physical ‘passports’, will be mailed to them. “This is a physical object that requires people to truly engage with our own complicity within these systems, and bringing this checkpoint online is really starting to tease out where is public space and how are systems of oppression taking place there now, especially online.”

Sopotiuk is equally excited about Finkelstein’s piece in the exhibit, a drawing he was working on when Sopotiuk went on a scouting trip to New York and met with him.

“He had had a stroke and was learning how to draw again,” he recalls of the renowned artist and AIDS activist who was a founding member of the Silence=Death and Gran Fury collectives, and who has work in the permanent collections of MoMA and the Whitney. “It’s a huge wall-sized piece, and Avram was in tears when he made it because he was in so much pain. Avram has been defined by his work with collectives, and to see him return to his personal art practice is so important on an individual and community level. I love that piece—it’s one of my favourite pieces ever.”

Xandra Ibarra

Finkelstein is also convening one of his “Flash Collectives” here—political interventions in public places he’s overseen around the world. For this COVID-ready rendition, he’s been bringing together his first-ever digital collective of nine local artists, meeting online; Sopotiuk hints the final work will take the form of an animation that aims to “recode the word queer”.

For the opening art party, Sopotiuk looks forward to talking more about their works and connecting QAF artists and audiences despite the enforced isolation of the pandemic. “I’m excited to be able to have a conversation with the four artists and talk about the world we’re living in,” he says, “We’ll look at work, talk about work, and really share those intimate pieces about their practice.”

117,straight,https://www.straight.com/arts/detroits-decaying-opulence-lives-on-in-upcoming-photo-book-by-vancouvers-philip-jarmain,Detroit's decaying opulence lives on in upcoming photo book by Vancouver's Philip Jarmain,[],2020-07-02 18:44:03-07:00,"1 of 4 2 of 4

The opulence is in the decayed details of Vancouver photographer Philip Jarmain’s ghostly images of Detroit’s abandoned architectural marvels—some of them torn down within weeks or months of him shooting them. These include the Eastown Theatre’s gilded, recessed-dome ceiling; the Michigan Theatre’s towering Renaissance-style marble arches; and the scrollwork of the ornate tiles trimming the Lee Plaza luxury apartments’ now-blocked palladium windows.

“The craftsmanship—we’ve lost that all now,” he tells the Straight.

Since 2010, Jarmain has made more than a dozen trips to lens the historically significant spaces of a city once known as the Paris of the Midwest. And now he’s putting together an art book called American Beauty that tells the stories behind the images, some of which are the last large-format testaments to Detroit’s lost Art Deco and Neoclassical beauties.

Taking advantage of the downtime that’s come with COVID lockdown, he’s launched a Kickstarter campaign to complete the book he’s dreamed of making since showing the work in exhibits—including at Vancouver’s Kostuik Gallery, which represents him. It ends July 9 with the goal being to compile 58 art photos in a book bound in a textured black cloth and printed by Hemlock Press.

Jarmain, who was born near London, Ontario, has a personal connection to the fate of the Motor City, with family roots on his mother’s side. “My great-grandfather lived through those opulent times and played for the Detroit symphony,” he says.

The artist started his project in the wake of the 2008-09 recession, when the city’s factories were shuttered and homes were foreclosed—a financial disaster that he knew would bring the wrecking ball for Motown's fading pre-Depression architectural wonders. Eventually, it would also force the city to declare bankruptcy, in 2013.

The Lee Plaza exterior Philip Jarmain

Jarmain captured most of the buildings he wanted to document—shot at elevation, so that you feel like you’ve stepped into the dilapidated and often graffiti-marred marvels. One of the only exceptions was the elusive structure that inspired the title of the book, which comes out in September. It’s named after 1908’s American Beauty Electric Iron Building, located in the New Amsterdam Historic District and designed by architect Albert Kahn. Crews tore it down unexpectedly just two weeks before Jarmain was to head back east to photograph it.

Embraced by local historians and community members in Detroit, Jarmain learned the complex series of events that led to the Motor City witnessing the ruination of some of the most important turn-of-the-last-century buildings in North America. The Great Depression hammered its famous car industry. But another big factor had to do with racial and economic disparity—issues that feel more than pertinent to the Black Lives Matter protests Jarmain is seeing on the news these days.

“One of the reasons the buildings are the way they are is the so-called ‘white flight’,” he explains. “Detroit is a huge city, 130 square miles, and when the white people moved to the suburbs from the city, it became quite segregated. The buildings in the core ended up being in the ghettos.”

The effects of that segregation would blow up in Detroit’s race riots of the 1960s. And the lasting impacts can be seen directly in Jarmain’s photos. One of his favourites is Mackenzie High School, a wide shot of an abandoned gymnasium with wood floors warping up like waves, graffiti marring its bright yellow-brick walls, and the faded image of a stag mascot staring out sternly from centre court.

Mackenzie High School Philip Jarmain

“Definitely, the schools were sad,” he says. “They closed 120 public schools in the centre of Detroit—you could see the changes in the allocation of resources.

“The hallways had been lined with marble,” he adds, “and being from Canada, I couldn’t fathom that—just the opulence of even the schools! But it was a sign of what's happening now, and the lack of money going into education.”

The artist has travelled to some dangerous places in the world for his work as a commercial photographer. But he was constantly on guard shooting American Beauty’s meticulously rendered images, slipping into the spaces with local history buffs and carrying police radios to let local law enforcement know where they were.

At the time, Detroit had one of the highest murder rates in America, he says of the years he spent shooting: “On one New Year’s Eve you could hear the automatic-weapon fire at midnight.”

Jarmain is happy to report that Detroit has turned its fortunes around and is enjoying a renaissance that he hopes COVID-19 won’t slow down. A new generation is starting to renovate the houses and storefronts, and hip restaurants and bars are opening up in some of the historic buildings that are left.

In perhaps the clearest sign of renewal, 1904’s incredible Beaux Arts Belle Isle Aquarium, whose weird and wonderful algae-green-tiled walls and ceilings Jarmain captures in his book, has reopened with a vast collection of saltwater and freshwater fish.

As he finishes up the Kickstarter campaign, the photographer already has another architectural series in mind. And, completely unexpectedly, it has led him back to the Motor City.

“I’ve started a project on modernist work and it turns out some of the best examples of it are there—there’s a GM Technical Center, where the entire campus is built around this 20-acre reflecting pool,” he says of the Eero Saarinen masterpiece. At least he won’t be in quite the same race against the clock this time around.",[]

Last weekend, while visiting a friend's home, the discussion ventured into racism in the workplace.

I was told that when the topic of discrimination was raised—and particularly, around hiring—white people in positions of power became very defensive. They couldn't conceive of themselves engaging in racist acts.

This didn't surprise me. That's because I had read University of Washington affiliate associate education professor Robin DiAngelo's 2018 bestselling book, White Fragility: Why It's So Hard for White People to Talk About Racism.

She pointed out that this brittleness serves as a shield to maintain the racial status quo.

""I believe that white progressives cause the most daily damage to people of colour,"" DiAngelo wrote in her book.

According to her, that's because their ""defensiveness and certitude"" make it difficult for them to acknowledge when they uphold and perpetrate racism. They see racism as individual acts committed by racist people, rather than recognizing how white people are socialized to have a sense of superiority and how that leads to systemic discrimination.

In effect, they don't even know the true history of people of other cultural backgrounds—and this ignorance underscores their dealings with them.

All of this leads many white people to be prone to tuning out discussions about racism, even though it's killing people of colour. DiAngelo emphasizes in her book that this is because they're not conscious of their own ""whiteness"".

Building the video must have been a task almost as big as building a country, as the members recorded their audio and video from separate locations and then stitched it all together ahead of Canada Day celebrations.

When the Dancing on the Edge festival takes place this week, it won’t look anything like it has over its 32-year history.

That’s because, of course, COVID-19 means all performances have to adhere to social-distancing measures. But the fest is still managing to present a full roster of online and even in-person contemporary-dance works.

We reached out to three artists boldly venturing into new terrain for the event.

Company 605’s Josh Martin debuts the solo dance film Brimming, shot by David Cooper, as part of the mixed Edge 6 program (July 7 and 11on YouTube). He says it started by exploring the body as a container—“something that both shapes and holds us”.

He conjured images of a container that was becoming overfilled—“sloshing, leaking, its frame beginning to warp and bend under pressure,” he tells the Straight.

“Fittingly, when I began to approach this as a solo last year, I happened to be invited to share some research at Boombox, which is a performance space housed within a commercial container truck,” he says. “I think working in that confined space really helped me explore a sense of an interior process pushing up against an exterior wall. There is this saying of ‘Get out of yourself’ that feels relevant, imagining this rigid structure and what might spill out of it.”

Action at a Distance’s Vanessa Goodman has created the new solo video piece Solvent in collaboration with musician Scott Morgan (Loscil), premiering it as part of the Edge One program (July 3 and 6 on YouTube). She says the work overlaps with the aquatic themes of Never Still, which premiered at the Firehall in 2018 and included vivid video imagery of dancers plunging into water. “Circulatory systems, both internally and externally, are a structural inspiration,” she says.

And O.Dela Arts’ Olivia C. Davies will be premiering a live performance of Wishing Well to a small audience in the Firehall Arts Centre courtyard (which will also be live-streamed). The healing, meditative piece is an outdoor performance installation that draws from Gidaashi: The Wind That Takes Us, a duet created by Davies and Vuntut-Gwichin poet Melissa Frost, and features them with three other dancers—Rianne Svelnis, Ziyian Kwan, and Kelly McInnes. Blending poetry, movement, and storytelling, it’s about being stripped of cultural identity and the reassertion of language, protocol, and ceremony. It’s deeply connected to Davies and Frost’s experience of creating and performing Gidaashi (from the verb zaagidaashin, which means “to be tossed out of the whirlwind” in Anishinaabemowin), as well as to ideas of kinship and sisterhood.

Here’s what the artists had to say about what it was like venturing into pandemic-times performance, and the innovation and resilience it took to get there.

Was this a live work that you had to “pivot” to turn digital, and what was that like?

JM: “My original proposal to Dancing on the Edge was, of course, a work imagined for a live performance setting. But with all the uncertainty and such reduced ability to control that type of audience experience for this year’s festival, I was much more drawn to the option of contributing screen-based work. It seemed like an opportunity to exercise a different type of choreographic lens to interrogate the original impetus and movement research, which in many ways felt like starting a new creation process from scratch.

""I still very much intend to someday make the stage piece in the way I had originally envisioned, and I see this film as something else. So—I wouldn’t say that the work itself has had to pivot per se, but I have certainly felt myself pivoting, almost daily since April, grieving for the work I want to be doing while forcing myself to redirect my practice and get excited by all the other possibilities available.”

VG: “I began to experiment with videos exploring themes that Scott and I have been collaborating on for several years. Even though there’s some overlap with the live work we’ve created, this presentation at DOTE is a standalone, video-specific piece. Scott and I often work online, sending each other music and movement footage as part of our process. Time in the studio is definitely a significant component of how we work together, but this digital pivot is not a huge stretch for us.”

OD: “Gidaashi: The Wind That Takes Us would have been presented as an ensemble work with elements of close-quarter-movement and moments of skin-to-skin contact between dancers. We were working in-studio to build the foundation of the work, which includes a ‘wishing well’ choreographic score right up until mid-March, when lockdown measures came into effect. Unwilling to let the dream die, I continued to imagine different possibilities of expressing the work. I shared a drawn-out 54-minute solo from inside my living room for #nacperforms as a live Facebook feed on April 1, where I worked in a four-foot-by-four-foot frame lit with bicycle lights and did what I could to invoke the other collaborators and the work we had only just recently left behind. It was exhausting and felt so lonely. Moving into May, I recognized how an outdoor performance might be possible through the Firehall’s courtyard and approached [DOTE festival producer] Donna Spencer with my pitch to share an adapted version for a small audience.”

How do dancers or creative teams rehearse during COVID-19?

JM: “It was fortunate that this project was already a solo, and already being created for a small enclosed space. So, aside from the child-care issues, the rehearsal aspect was a relatively easy in my case. Just find a flat surface and move. But I have certainly felt the longing for more face-to-face interaction with my collaborators throughout, and the complexity of communicating artistic notions becomes when that physical, in-person transmission is absent. I am an introverted person, but I really want to feel connected when working with others, and I’m learning how simply sharing the same space makes that feeling so much more achievable.”

OD: “The original ensemble members are all working on their scores individually in their own spaces. Early on in the planning stages for this engagement, our conversations centred around sanitation and other precautions that would be taken by both the venue and O.Dela Arts to ensure the dancers and crew would be kept safe during performances. Choices to maintain safe distance between dancers throughout the piece were made as part of the artistic direction of the work.

""This is one challenge that can actually be easily managed with the specific venue of the Firehall’s courtyard—it is quite a spacious, open-air space where audience members can be distanced without losing access or sightlines to the performance space. Other ways the work is being reimagined is through the creation process itself, moving more directly into the hands of the dancers. As choreographer-director, I have provided them each with a score that was devised in our earlier creation sessions that will now be further developed on their own.

""I recognize that this is a process that requires an implicit trust in each collaborator to uphold the original vision and intention of the work and manifest their own artistry through their devising. We will all come together for the final rehearsals, and it is here where I will witness their work and make any final adjustments before we share with audiences.”

Vanessa Goodman, of Action at a Distance, in Solvent.



What are some of the biggest challenges taking dance into film or online? Have you found benefits or new opportunities for expression?

VG: “I have always enjoyed editing my work into short trailers or archival documentation—especially because the footage I am working with is usually shot by David Cooper, who is an incredibly talented videographer who always manages to capture the spirit of the work. The main challenge with this project is that the majority of the footage is self-shot, which can be a tricky way to gather footage. It’s difficult not to be able to work with all of my usual collaborators. I am filming most of this material at home with a very modest lighting setup. Since I am used to working with lights in a very interactive way with James Proudfoot, there’s a limitation doing it myself. On the other hand, the DIY approach has led to some creative results that I might not have found otherwise.”



JM: “I don’t really see it as a need to ‘take dance into film’, as though there is a conversion somewhere. I think making live dance is challenging, and I think showing dance on a screen is challenging, but they are separate problems to solve with their own opportunities, and each deserve their own choreographic intention. For me, the challenge is to just fully turn on that part of my brain—the part that sees in 16:9 and remembers a completely different palette of tools and capabilities are available. Simultaneously, I have to let go of any expectations of that kinesthetic transference I count on in live shows, which I think will never quite drift the same way through a screen. However, I really enjoy how my imagination and creative logic are accessed in a different way, and how my inexperience with the medium is actually energizing to the work.”

JM: “We’ve been involved in dance film projects here and there for over a decade, so this hasn’t been an entirely new endeavour, but I do see digital content growing into a larger portion of our future creative activity—not because of COVID-19, really, but because there is a true curiosity about what this brings to the dialogue of contemporary dance. I think this time will have lasting effects, yes. I think we are likely going to lose some would-be dance artists and audiences as the entire arts and culture sector experiences this halt in a variety of negative ways.

""I also think that any time people are confronted with limitations and obstructions, the arts community will always show how adaptive and innovative it really is, leading to new creative paths and many positive outcomes. I do worry about how the perceived value of performing arts may shift as new work flows more readily into the vast sea of online content, competing for attention in ways it never should need to, but I also have high hopes about how a return to live performance may feel novel again, like we’ve all been taking it for granted, and how this absence is hopefully making the heart grow fonder.”



VG: “A lot of my practice incorporates video work. Even though this feels like a distilled, self-reliant extension of work I have already been creating, it has put a very fine point on how much I value and appreciate collaborating face-to-face. I don’t think it will be possible to take a theatre experience with a live audience for granted after the pandemics restrictions are over. That’s hopefully a positive long-term impact of this time: appreciating aspects of our art forms that have been easy to overlook.” g

One of Quebec's most famous organization is seeking court protection from its creditors.

Cirque du Soleil Entertainment Group has been forced to cancel all shows and lay off more than 3,000 workers as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Today, the company is in the commercial division of the Superior Court of Québec seeking an order under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act.

If Cirque du Soleil succeeds, it will seek protection from creditors in the United States under Chapter 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

According to a company news release, existing shareholders TPG, Fosun, and Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec would buy ""substantially all"" of the assets through a combination of cash, debt, and equity.

The sponsors would provide US$300 million liquidity to enable the restructured business to restart.

The debt provider would be Investissement Québec, which is prepared to put up US$200 million.

If all goes according to plan, there would be two funds created, totalling US$20 million, ""to provide additional relief to impacted employees and independent contractors"".

Noises Off andThe Father led the pack last night (June 29) as the Jessie Richardson Theatre Awards celebrated virtually for the first time.

With local theatres largely shuttered, no audience or award recipients were on hand. Instead, the 38th-annual prize ceremony took place via YouTube and Facebook Live with hosts Omari Newton and Sara Vickruck, joined by musical talent Ben Elliott. Soon, the award committee will be offering curbside pickup and posting video acceptance speeches on its website.

In the large-theatre category, the Arts Club Theatre Company took home the most prizes with eight. The comedic farce Noises Off won three Jessies, including a win for outstanding production. When it debuted, we called it ""a three-part free fall into divinely crafted chaos"" in our review. Tess Degenstein won the acting prize for her comedic performance and Scott Bellis got the nod for outstanding direction.

The Arts Club's Sound of Music garnered a win for outstanding production of a musical. Acting nods went to Deena Aziz for her performance in a A Thousand Splendid Suns (in partnership with Royal Manitoba Theatre Centre) and John Ullyatt for his outstanding supporting performance in Matilda (in partnership with Citadel Theatre & Royal Manitoba Theatre Centre). Also at the Arts Club, Drew Facey took a set-design award for Cost of Living (in partnership with Citadel Theatre), and Alessandro Juliani won for outstanding sound design for The Great Leap.

The large-theatre category also gave awards to Robert Salvador for his performance in Pacific Theatre’s Best of Enemies; Gerald King for his lighting design of Vancouver Asian Canadian Theatre’s Kuroko; Cory Sincennes for costume design in Bard on the Beach Shakespeare Festival’s Shakespeare in Love; and the interactive Inheritance: a pick-the-path experience by Alley Theatre and Touchstone Theatre (in association with Vancouver Moving Theatre and community partnership with Vancouver Aboriginal Friendship Centre) for significant artistic achievement.

Jillian Fargey and Kevin McNulty scored wins for The Father. Tim Matheson

In the small-theatre category, The Father by the Search Party received the most wins, at six Jessies, including outstanding production, acting nods for both Kevin McNulty and Jillian Fargey, and Mindy Parfitt for outstanding direction. Raincity Theatre won three Jessies for its presentation of the Stephen Sondheim musical Company, including outstanding musical production and a significant artistic achievement award for its entire 14-member ensemble.

In the same category, Chris Francisque won an acting prize for his scintillating performance in Ensemble Theatre Company’s Superior Donuts, as did Elizabeth Kirkland for her supporting role in The Sea, by Slamming Door Artist Collective. Rick Colhoun took a sound-design prize for Wireless Wings Radio Ensemble’s Frankenstein: Lost in Darkness.

Touchstone Theatre’s Certified nabbed two special awards—one going to Jan Derbyshire for outstanding original script and the other care of the Critics’ Choice Innovation Award. Derek Chan’s Chicken Girl by rice & beans theatre (in partnership with Playwrights Theatre Centre) won the Sidney J. Risk Prize for outstanding original script by an emerging playwright.

The Theatre for Young Audiences category was spread between Axis Theatre Company’s, Th’owxiya: The Hungry Feast Dish, for outstanding production and a significant artistic achievement prize for Jillian Perry. Carousel Theatre for Young People’s production of Bad Hats Theatre’s Peter Pan took an acting award for Marlene Ginader’s triple-character performance. And Jay Dodge’s video design got the nod for Iron Peggy (by Vancouver International Children’s Festival and Boca del Lupo in association with red diva projects). A Jessie for outstanding artistic creation went to Ian Harmon for Love You Forever and More Munsch by Beach House Theatre.

In other awards, the Vancouver Now Representation and Inclusion Award was given to Heidi Taylor for her creating collaborative relationships and inclusive initiatives. Ken Gracie & Phillip Waddell received the Patron of the Arts Award and Connor Moore was acknowledged with the Mary Phillips Award for Behind the Scenes Achievement.

Opening with intimate park performances, the eco-activist Vines Art Festival plans to shift mostly online this year.

Running August 5 to 15, the fest won't culminate in its usual big outdoor celebration by Trout Lake for 2020. Instead, the multidisciplinary programming will stay socially distanced, streaming sonic performances in parks, outdoor contemporary dance, and even a Vogue Ball.

Opening Ceremonies will be the only in-person events, on August 5 in greenspaces including Creekside Park, CRAB Park, Strathcona Park, Hadden Park, David Lam Park, and Trout Lake Park. These ""intimate circles"" will bring together a few audience members and artists to explore the importance of land-based art, justice, and existence, Vines announced this week. Audiences wil have to register at www.vinesartfestival.com/, where you can find more info on the fest.

Then, throughout the festival, Adriana Contreras's Interactive Online Map will showcase Host Nation village sites and Indigenous flora and fauna, while also engaging the audience with the geographical history and the impact of art surrounding those parks. Each of the six greenspaces Vines is working in this year will have an accompanying downloadable Sonic Performances featuring over 50 artists.

Elsewhere amid the online offerings:

August 7: Freedom: Stories of Black Liberation, originally planned for Creekside Park in partnership with Afro Van Connect, celebrates the soul of historic Hogan’s Alley with artists including Dae Nneka, Kor Kase, Mariam Barry, Maggie Onedo, Tunji Taylor-Lewis, Jason Bempong, Pedro Chamale, Siobhan Barker, and Eddy van Wyk.

This year, Italian Day on the Drive won't be happening in a physical sense. But for all of those who love Italian culture, it will be coming to a computer screen near you.

At 9 p.m. this evening (June 26), Italian Day on The Drive for Courage will be launched with a livestream of a concert at Vancouver City Hall.

It's all part of the Italian Heritage Month Virtual Celebration and can be viewed on the Italian Day website.

""Inspired by Italy’s message of courage, delivered by uplifting music and song coming from balconies and rooftops during its COVID crisis, this performance marks the first of the virtual summer concert series, which will run throughout July and August,"" the organizers say on their website. ""Italian Day on The Drive for Courage will embrace themes of hope, courage, and love—and how ’together we can make a difference’, while spreading healing within our community.""

Singer and businessman Federico Fuoco was the 2018 Italian Canadian Man of the Year for championing Little Italy.

The Italian community is well-known for its generosity. This year, a key component of Italian Day on The Drive for Courage is raising funds for Coast Mental Health's fundraising campaign, Spread Courage, Not Fear.

Because of the pandemic, Coast Mental Health had to cancel its 22nd Courage to Come Back Awards, which is a major fundraiser.

Not surprisingly, the local Italian community is doing its part to fill the gap.

Coun. Melissa De Genova (with baby Lili) and Il Centro vice president Randy Rinaldo played key roles in Vancouver city council designating part of Commercial Drive as Little Italy.

Coast Mental Health has 11 homes in the community providing 24-hour staffing. In addition, it provides supported housing and temporary modular housing.

That's not all. The organization also provides support services to people with mental-health issues at its Mount Pleasant Clubhouse and Seymour Street Resource Centre, as well as employment, education, and street-outreach programs.

Later this year, the Italian community will hold another celebration to honour one of its most memorable members: Michael Cuccione, who embodied the concept of ""together, we can make a difference.""

He was a talented singer, author, dancer, and actor, who died at the age of 16 in 2001 following complications from cancer.

On September 19, Il Centro will host a dinner in honour of the 25th anniversary of the creation of the Michael Cuccione Foundation for childhood cancer research. If you haven't heard of Michael Cuccione, please take a few minutes and watch the video below. It will blow you away.

This summer, Vancouver's Blind Tiger Comedy is offering free courses in improv and sketch to newcomers who identify as Black, Indigenous, or persons of colour.

The initiative, called the Welcome 2020, is the latest diversity push by the program. It's offered scholarships to people of colour, LGBTQ+ students, and differently abled students in the last year, as well as POC Nights—a free improv class and jam session. The school also has extensive language banning discrimination and harrassment.

Ronald Dario and Ese Atawo are its diversity coordinators.

Last year’s Welcome saw over 70 people who identify as women, trans, and/or femme try out comedy.

All courses will be held digitally during the COVID-19 pandemic. Class information is here. Most new students will be best-suited for Intro improv course, led by Dario this summer.

By Alice Birch. Directed by Sloan Thompson. A Department of Theatre and Film at UBC production. At the Frederic Wood Theatre on Thursday, March 12. No remaining performances

What is it like for a woman living in a capitalist patriarchy? In the experimental work Revolt. She Said. Revolt Again., playwright Alice Birch creates various scenarios in which women confront the imbalances in their lives and challenge the status quo with their need for autonomy. With a progression that becomes increasingly radical in form and content over four acts and 13 vignettes, the play reaches a crescendo of revolution, rising up against systemic inequity.

The play begins with a dialogue between a man and woman (David Volpov and Ava Maria Safai) over sexual primacy, exploring the inversion of expectations as she takes control of his seduction.

Next, another couple (Pamela Carolina Martinez and Aidan LeBlanc) meditate on the concept of marriage after a botched proposal. In other segments, a woman and her employer (Shannon Poole and Drew Ogle) joust over work obligations; a shopper (Hana Cripton-Inglis) strips naked in a supermarket aisle after a sexual assault; and a woman and her daughter (Laura Grace Reynolds and Holly Collis Handford) accost the woman’s mother (Charmaine Sibanda) about her absence in their lives.

Although these are stand-alone stories, Birch’s play is a bricolage of related themes that link said narratives together around the notion of misunderstanding. In an early vignette, both man and woman misinterpret the other’s essence, as the former concocts a rigid fantasy of her and the latter skims his mere persona, neither fully representative of who they are.

Likewise, fundamental differences in the perception of social order distress those in later plots, from the value of marriage to the negotiation of workplace well-being. In many of these segments, capitalist tendencies are conflated with stability, which enforces repression, as in the case of the violated shopper, whose presence in protest is gauged only so far as her inconvenience to other consumers.

Director Sloan Thompson teases out the systemic quality of these encounters through the contributions of scenic designer Emily Dotson and costume designer Sherry Yang. Dotson’s imposing, cubelike structures are grey, nondescript, institutional—situated upstage, they resemble a metropolis, representative of the unaffectionate world such events take place in. Similarly, Yang’s costumes, composed of grey undergarments and streetwear, signal the masses from which these singular stories come. Lighting designer Jacob Wan supplements the largely monochromatic setup with expressive mood lighting at crucial points.

While it's not flawlessly executed, as transitions between stories appear more laboured than necessary, Thompson by and large delivers a staging of Birch’s bare-knuckle piece with an attentiveness to its import, steering actors into a deliberate discomfort that connotes an abrasive reality. By its penultimate act, it is clear that Revolt. She Said. Revolt Again. is not a euphonic integration of ideals, but the cacophonous stirring emblematic of vital social movements.

By Paul Lucas. Directed by Fay Nass and Cameron Mackenzie. A Frank Theatre and Zee Zee Theatre production. At the Firehall Arts Centre on Friday, March 13. No remaining performances

The air of doom surging outside the Firehall on Friday night gave extra and profound meaning to an already moving performance going on inside the 150-seat arts centre.

Before Trans Scripts, Part I: The Women, codirector Cameron Mackenzie acknowledged a valiant show-must-go-on effort by saying, “We made it!” Then someone from the audience yelled, “We survived AIDS! This shitty little virus isn’t going to get us!”

Sadly, by today it may have—indirectly, at least, with word that B.C. health officials now want all venues that hold more than 50 people immediately shuttered. (This just in: you can watch a recorded performance of the show through Zee Zee Theatre’s social media channels at 8 p.m. on Saturday night [March 21]; check its website for details.)

Still, on a Friday the 13th of travel alerts and social-distancing measures, Trans Scripts, Part I felt—all too fittingly—like an act of resilience. The play’s purpose was to bring people together, opening an entire world of transgender experience by sharing pain, secrets, and laughs.

A diverse cast of seven trans or gender-nonconforming performers gave voice to Paul Lucas’s verbatim play, culled from more than 70 interviews with trans women worldwide. And what made the work resonate was that the actors here clearly brought their own experiences and emotions to the stories being told.

Lucas knows that it’s the specific details of each story that speak the loudest. When Eden (Amy Fox) recounts the meaning, even at 42 years old, of her mum buying her an ice-cream cone after years of separation, it’s devastating.

The beauty of the curated accounts here is the way they capture diversity—from a gynecologist in her 60s to a young, politically active sex worker to someone forced to work in her dad’s auto-repair business. The approach offers a range of experience over generations. One person is told to get married and have kids to solve the problem (“It ruined both our lives”), another former boy’s mother admonishes him with “Everybody’s going to blame me if you don’t behave right.”

The voices here are refreshingly frank and bitingly funny. For those who might not have trans friends, it’s an education—on stealing hormone-boosting birth-control pills, on genital scarring, on illicit silicone pump parties, and on what it’s like to drive a car in high heels for the first time. The women don’t agree on every topic, but that’s the point: some can’t afford or don’t want sex-reassignment surgery; some care much more than others about “passing” as female.

Lucas and directors Fay Nass and Cameron Mackenzie find ways to create an arc out of all this—moments where the women listen empathetically to one another or comfort each other, or move around a set that consists of simple rows of chairs.

Perhaps the most amazing thing is the way the performers—almost all of them nonactors—own the stories they tell. They include human-rights activist, political candidate, and surprisingly natural presence Morgane Oger, who appears as a funny and brutally honest British-Australian gynecologist who transitions late in life. And mental-health worker Carolynn Dimmer plays an Aussie who skydives and hunts (“I’m about as feminine as Jabba the Hut”), while Cree Canada’s a Drag! star Quanah Style nails a street-talking Luna.

By the time the show ended, they felt like friends, confidantes, and probably the bravest people you’ve ever met. And not just because they chose to leave the house last Friday.",[]

A Radical System Art production. A Vancouver International Dance Festival presentation. At the Vancouver Playhouse on Friday, March 6. No remaining performances

Radical System Art’s new Epilogos is like a marathon for its performers—if they had to do back flips and downrock the entire distance.

It’s not just that Vancouver choreographer and performer Shay Kuebler requires his crew to master his singularly athletic mashup of martial arts, hip-hop, and contemporary dance. He also pushes them beyond what should physically be possible. The show demands near-superhuman core strength, as much for the women as the men, as they lift and swing each other around, drop to the ground and snap up again, whipsaw their arms, or flip on one hand across the floor.

Kuebler is a master of tension and release, and when the troupe “pops” out of its freezes it’s explosive. During the brief moments when the electro score pauses, all you can hear is bodies gulping for air from the stage.

The other indelible aspect of his newest show is its LED light wall, a brilliant floor-to-ceiling backdrop that conjures, by turn, old-Broadway-style stages, pixellated video, rainstorms, lightning, and ever-morphing patterns. It allows Kuebler to shift the moods of each themed section of the work, but also to tap into the glitzy commercial-billboard quality of the lights—a perfect tie-in to the show’s theme of rhetoric, salesmanship, and propaganda. On an added level, the bulbs respond to sound and movement, rippling and erupting. They’re like another character in the show.

Epilogos opens with the dancers enacting a ritual, pouring water over a bowed-down Kuebler and dressing him in a suit, tie, and pork-pie hat. Kuebler rises to suddenly become “the orator”, a sort of grand showman-politician-persuader who mobilizes the six others. He doesn’t speak, but rather moves his body with the language of rhetoric, pointing, reaching out to us, and raising his arms emphatically above his head. Choreographically, this is Kuebler’s biggest strength in this production: sampling, speeding up, and melding the gestures of dictators and politicians into adrenalized dance sequences.

Together they “sell” certain ideas—morality, duty, integrity, compassion, and other values are spelled out digitally across the lightwall to theme each vignette. The concepts are part of Bushido’s samurai moral code. Each projects a different mood: “courage” finds Kuebler darting amid a lightning storm, stopping each time a bolt cuts down the light wall; “compassion” features the dancers turning and supporting each other in sculptural lifts; “honour” starts with Kuebler’s showman pop-and-lock-posturing in a regal gold robe.

But then the power shifts and the minions turn on their leader. He tries the same shtick over and over, but things start to glitch out—in his body and across the light wall. Let’s just say everyone realizes the emperor has no clothes.

That’s when it becomes most apparent that Kuebler is talking about our world—one full of fast talkers and divisive rhetoric that sometimes backfires. Donald Trump looms large.

Epilogos continues the artist’s themes of manipulation and control from his last piece, the tap-fuelled Telemetry. He also pushes further with his group work, sending bodies rolling and scattering into elaborate formations and then freezing them before they erupt again.

There’s a lot going on in Epilogos, possibly too much; sometimes the audience needs a breather to take in some of the more oblique intellectual concepts—with wide-ranging touchstones from Aristotle to samurai culture, not to mention the high-octane dance.

But with humour, cutting-edge visuals, and truly pummelling dance, Kuebler is pushing ever-ambitiously into timely ideas. Call it a show that has brains and brawn.",[]

Created by Daniel Arnold, Darrell Dennis, and Medina Hahn. A Touchstone Theatre and Alley Theatre production, in association with Vancouver Moving Theatre and community partnership with the Vancouver Aboriginal Friendship Centre. At the Annex Theatre on Thursday, March 5. Continues to March 15

What would you do if an Indigenous nation laid claim to the land your family cabin—your “inheritance”—sits on? Would you split the territory 50-50? Hand it all over? Tell them to get off ""your"" property?

Daniel Arnold, Darrell Dennis, and Medina Hahn’s creatively ambitious new interactive production actually invites you to answer those and other questions—anonymously—and your responses will help shape the course of the story. The real question is, though: will you be honest, or choose what you perceive to be the right, progressive course of action? In its investigation of unceded land, Inheritance: a pick-the-path experience makes you consider your own actions and responsibility as our nation manoeuvres reconciliation and justice.

That may be one of the biggest achievements in what is also a pretty fun idea. When audience members enter either side of the traverse stage area, they find clickers on their seats. At certain segments of the show, they're given the chance to vote by multiple choice on the route the play should take. The onus this puts on the actors, with about 50 possible pathways, is mind-boggling, but the cast rides the shifts with apparent ease.

Sometimes the questions are simple—our first assignment is to choose the music that opens the show (will that be the Clash or A Tribe Called Red?), sometimes they are funny (one selection reads “Keep that shit to yourself”), and sometimes they tread into more political questions about property rights in our postcolonial world.

The show gets off to a strong and engaging start, with urbanites Abbey (Hahn) and Noah (Arnold) disembarking from a boat to visit her father at the remote rural cabin that's been in the family for years. But when they arrive, they only find Frank (Darrell Dennis), a local Indigenous man, staying there instead.

Dennis is adept at creating a character who can by turns seem sinister or harmless, mixing humour with more cutting gibes at the couple’s privilege—say, Noah’s fear of bears. Over time, he reveals himself an astute, politicized thinker, one with a sardonic bent; listen to the way he laughs when Noah talks about the progress of reconciliation.

Things feel a little stretched when it’s revealed Abbey’s father has set up a sort of scavenger hunt for the land’s deed. A hunting gun comes into play, and Dennis starts to list off a lot of facts about land claims and history. The book Unsettling Canada takes a role, and it seems to have inspired a lot of the writing, too. The fact that the non-Indigenous population hogs 99.8 percent of the land in this country, and the way that links to dependency and poverty, is a fact that forms the basis of Frank’s argument—timely information to emphasize in this province right now.

Those facts make the plot bog down a bit near the end, even with the fun facts (the definition of “unceded”, say) that pop up occasionally on the show’s two big screens.

Those projections also tally our votes, as well as showcase coolly expressive cabin sketches, map illustrations, and other imagery by Sammy Chien, Chimerik, and Shang-Han Chien.

Set designer Lauchlin Johnston conjures additional visual interest with a zig-zaggy stage that looks like a deconstructed 3-D map sprouting sawed-off tree stumps.

Dennis and Arnold’s characters develop a rich dynamic, the liberal-minded Noah trying to bro it up hilariously with the acerbic stranger. And the script cleverly digs into ideas of entitlement, liberalism, and privilege. At one point, Abbey and Noah try to argue they deserve the land because they’re pinched by the sky-high costs of real estate (presumably Vancouver's)—as if that would compare to centuries of mistreatment.

The play might have garnered even more layers of debate by emphasizing Hahn’s own immigrant past in a stronger way. And some of its late-stage historic explanation could have been tightened up. All of this should be qualified, however, by the fact that the show changes drastically each night due to audience choices; word-of-mouth is that it can be by turns lighter and funnier or more of an action-thriller.

Still, the creative team is definitely on to something here, using a lively mix of humour and interactive technology to work through heavy concepts. Viewers go out into the night with the knowledge that land issues will never be solved with an easy click of the button.

Fernie-based alternative folkies Shred Kelly have performed their high-energy shows at countless venues over the years.

But with the pandemic shutting down any gatherings of more than 50 people, it's crushed the live-music business and left bands scrambling to promote their latest tracks.

So today, Shred Kelly will be launching its fifth album, Like a Rising Sun, through a livestream at 10 a.m. Fans can buy tickets and see the show through the Music B.C. website.

On June 1, the B.C. government announced $7.5 million for Amplify B.C., a provincial music fund being delivered by Creative B.C. to help artists during the pandemic.

More recently, Creative B.C., the B.C. government, the City of Vancouver, and several private and corporate funders joined forces on the SoundON provincewide campaign to deliver more support to presenters, musicians, production staff, and venues.

It's expected to lead to 100 free shows being offered, though SoundON aims to encourage people to make donations.

""This is a tale of resiliency and one we’re excited to share with British Columbia,” SoundON producer Eduardo Ottoni said in the June 30 announcement. “Music and gathering are at the heart of every vibrant culture, and something that gives joy to so many people. The pandemic has not only had a devastating economic impact, but an emotional one. Our aim is to be a beacon of resilience during the pandemic and beyond.”

Applications to present shows can be made on the SoundON.ca website.

With fears of up to 90 percent of independent music venues closing in Canada in the next six months, SoundON will try to replace those lost performing opportunities by funding and streaming curated content with the help of festivals and presenters.

“The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on the once effervescent music industry in B.C.,” Music B.C. executive producer Lindsay MacPherson says on the Creative B.C. website. “It is a pain that has been felt by so many, especially those working in arts and culture.

""A group of leaders from across the industry have come together to collaborate on a way to bring back life to the sector,"" MacPherson continued. ""We have everyone from city officials, promoters, presenters, venues, production, and artists working on the project. Our aim is to be highly collaborative, in an unprecedented way, to bring our beloved industry back.”",[]

136,straight,https://www.straight.com/music/loving-reissue-of-young-canadians-hawaii-ep-raises-question-of-who-was-vancouvers-greatest,Loving reissue of the Young Canadians' Hawaii EP raises the question of who was Vancouver's greatest punk band,[],2020-05-13 15:08:36-07:00,"1 of 5 2 of 5

What’s more important from a legacy standpoint: being the greatest band, or being the band that writes the greatest songs?

The question is an important one when you’re reflecting on the Young Canadians’ place in Vancouver’s fabled first-wave punk gold rush.

During their time together between the late ’70s and early ’80s, the trio of singer-guitarist Art Bergmann, bassist Jim Bescott, and drummer Barry Taylor had no shortage of competition for the title of top band on Canada’s fertile West Coast.

For the honours in brute power, parental-advisory lyrics, and shock-and-awe live spectacles, D.O.A. and the Subhumans ran a dead-heat race. As for impeccably crafted, candied-punk pop, good luck in coming to a consensus on who did it better: the Modernettes on Teen City or Pointed Sticks with world-beating singles like “The Real Thing” and “Somebody’s Mom”.

Somewhere in the middle of all those legendary ground-breakers landed the Young Canadians, a band that was never as gloriously assaultive as D.O.A. and the Subhumans, or as fantastically flawless on record as Pointed Sticks and the Modernettes.

But looking back? It’s hard not to think that true greatness isn’t always easily quantified.

There’s a good reason to reflect on the Young Canadians’ legacy today: namely, a loving curated reissue of the group’s Hawaii EP by Los Angeles-based boutique label Porterhouse Records. It’s a meticulously detailed re-creation of the long-out-of-print cover art and liner-notes insert, topped off by the gold-star decision to press the record on orange vinyl.

Looking back, no band in the city was more talented musically. Bergmann arrived on the scene a fully formed guitar legend—one who oscillated between flame-throwing violence and art-star inventiveness. If you were learning bass in the era, you might have wanted the rock-star charisma of D.O.A.’s Randy Rampage, but the brilliantly busy Bescott was who you wanted to be as a musician. Taylor played like a man who lived on a steady diet of logger-strength coffee and black-market amphetamines, but not at the expense of knowing how to seriously swing.

As essential as its short-and-sweet catalogue might be, the band never made a perfect record during its short time together. If that sounds harsh, it’s not meant to be. It’s more of a reflection that, when the Young Canadian were great, they were fucking devastating.

Seen through that prism, the great crime of “Don’t Tell Me” and “Where Are You?”, from the B-side of the band’s debut 7-inch EP, was that “Automan” on the A-side was so insanely good it could never be matched.

Video of YOUNG CANADIANS / K-TELS - SD restored

The reality of the band’s final EP, 1980’s This Is Your Life, is that none of the songs were able to live up to the kickoff track, “Data Redux”, for apocalyptic savagery, cold-war paranoia, and nuclear-strike guitar work. Listen again and prepare to be floored, right down to what was arguably the greatest solo recorded during Vancouver punk’s first wave.

And then there was Hawaii. If “Hullabaloo Girls” is undeniably the weak link on the EP, then blame the holy trinity of “Hawaii”, “Well, Well, Well” and “No Escape” for shining so brightly.

It was “Hawaii” that immediately made the band heroes on the West Coast, largely as a result of notorious lyrics like “Let’s go to fucking Hawaii/Get drunk in the sun” and “Running from the rain, thousands on the run/Thinkin' like the rich, heading for the fun.” No one has ever written a more perfect anthem for this city, where it’s basically monsoon season nine months out of 12.

But the gold-star goodness on Hawaii didn’t stop there.

Part of the record’s magic was that it was about Vancouver—the real Vancouver, with its dark and menacing underbelly, not the shiny happy one the world would see on postcards and promo posters for Expo 86 a few years later.

“Well, Well, Well” had Bergmann—with a winning mix of amused disdain and world-weariness—singing of stepping over the great unwashed on his way to work at the Bank of B.C. at Hastings and Main. That there was no Bank of B.C. at Hastings and Main somehow made things even greater, partly because there was clearly a joke you probably weren’t cool enough to be in on.

Video of No Escape

And then there was “No Escape”, the cascading, claustrophobic closer that turned a spotlight on the fact that punk wasn’t exactly greeted with open arms by Vancouver, once you got beyond the underground.

Want to know what it was like to walk the West Coast with spiky hair and a “Young Canadians” button on your army jacket back in 1980? Proceed directly to the lyrics “Who’s always there when the fun begins/The music’s loud they walk right in/No escape from the city police/They chuck you out, you run through the streets.” And “This town’s frustrations are scrawled all over these walls/It’s a new minority and how does it feel to be so small?”

Today, one might ask of the Young Canadians “How did it feel to be so great?”

Once this whole COVID-19-lockdown thing is over, you’ll be able to go back to spending endless drunken evenings at the Railway Club, arguing over who was Vancouver greatest-ever punk band. So who was? For that, flash back, quite appropriately to the final line of ""No Escape"", where a resigned and disgusted Bergmann sneers ""There's no answer"".

The Young Canadians might not have left the same international mark as the Subhumans or D.O.A., and they never got a second act like the Modernettes or Pointed Sticks—both who still play occasional reunion shows.

Somehow that doesn't matter. Because if the Hawaii reissue offers an irrefutable argument for one thing, it's this: no band from Vancouver's first-wave scene wrote greater songs.

North Vancouver–raised musician Bryan Adams is being accused of racism as a result of two social-media posts.

Over Instagram and Twitter, he blamed the COVID-19 pandemic on ""some fucking bat eating, wet market animal selling, virus making greedy bastards"".

He delivered this message on Instagram alongside a portion of his hit song ""Cuts Like a Knife"", complaining about the postponement of three shows at Royal Albert Hall in London, England.

Adams's tirade prompted a torrent of criticism from those who feel that singer-songwriter is spreading fake news and reinforcing racial stereotypes.

Amy Guo, president of the Chinese Canadian National Council for Social Justice, told CBC News that the comments could provoke hatred of Canadians of Chinese ancestry.

She was far from alone as many others responded directly to Adams over Twitter before he deleted the tweet.

Virus evolved naturally

Adams, a long-time vegan, was reiterating a myth that the virus resulted from people eating bat soup in Wuhan, China. There's no evidence to support this.

In January, images of a Chinese travel writer eating bat soup were transmitted through mainstream and social media, but they were not filmed in China.

Wang Mengyun later revealed that she was videotaped doing this on the island of Palau in the western Pacific Ocean in 2017. The images demonstrated to her audience what local people there liked to eat.

Wang has since apologized, saying she had no idea during the filming that such a virus existed.

Earlier this year, the Scripps Research Institute reported that the most likely source of the novel coronavirus was bats.

That's because SARS-CoV-2 (the proper name) is very similar to a coronavirus in these flying mammals.

According to the researchers, led by immunology and microbiology associate professor Kristian Andersen, the novel coronavirus's spike protein became optimized to binding to human-like ACE2 receptors as a result of natural selection.

""It is possible that a progenitor of SARS-CoV-2 jumped into humans, acquiring the genomic features described above through adaptation during undetected human-to-human transmission,"" the researchers stated. ""Once acquired, these adaptations would enable the pandemic to take off and produce a sufficiently large cluster of cases to trigger the surveillance system that detected it.""

The researchers published their paper in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Medicine in March.

They noted that it's the seventh coronavirus known to have infected humans. And they ruled out that it was created in a laboratory, pointing out that its genetic makeup clearly indicates that it evolved naturally.

Update: Bryan Adams apologizes

This morning, Adams said he was sorry ""to any and all that took offence to my posting yesterday"".

""No excuse,"" he wrote on Instagram, ""I just wanted to have a rant about the horrible animal cruelty in these wet-markets being the possible source of the virus, and promote veganism.""",[]

Canadian singer Michael Bublé fulfilled the dying wish of his grandfather by gifting the man’s Vancouver home to his caregiver.

Not only did Bublé give grandfather Demetrio Santanga’s home to Minette, a Filipino woman.

With the help of home designers Drew and Jonathan Scott of the HGTV show Property Brothers, Bublé also renovated the property while the caregiver was in the Philippines for a family visit.

Bublé then surprised the woman after she came back.

This story was told in a May 4 episode on HGTV’s Celebrity IOU show.

According to HGTV, Minette has become a “special part of the family”.

“My grandfather was my best friend growing up. He was my hero,” Bublé said in the HGTV piece written by Michelle Regna.

When the man got older, he received care at the home he built.

Minette was hired to take care of Demetrio and his wife.

“I came from the Philippines working as a community health worker. Then I got hired by Michael’s family to look after grandma and grandpa at the same time,” Minette said.

According to HGTV, Minette cared for Buble’s grandparents for almost eight years.

The Filipino woman “sent almost every dollar she made back home”.

“By the end, it was safe to say that Minette had become one of grandpa Demetrio’s best friends and an honorary member of the Bublé family,” according to HGTV.",[]

Red Cat Records' second location, on East Hastings Street, has closed permanently.

The popular independent retailer, which opened at 2447 East Hastings Street in September 2016, sold new and used vinyl records and related merchandise, as well as local concert tickets.

In a notice posted on its Instagram account on May 2, the store blamed the coronavirus-pandemic closure and the end of its lease at that location for the shuttering.

""It's with a heavy heart that we have to announce our decision to close our second location at Hastings & Nanaimo,"" the note reads. ""It's been a great five years, but given current events & that our lease is ending we need to consolidate to just one store.""

Red Cat opened its original store at 4332 Main Street in 2002. The decision to open another location was a bit of a gamble at the time, as no Vancouver independent record store had ever successfully expanded since the glory days of downtown retail record sales on and around Seymour Street, known then as Record Row.

In the 1970s and '80s, Record Row was dominated by local giant A&B Sound, Toronto-based chains like Sam the Record Man and A&A Records, and smaller stores like Collectors RPM and Odyssey Imports.

Local outlets such as Neptoon Records, Quintessence Records, and then Zulu Records sprang up in Kitsilano and Mount Pleasant in those days, sometimes beginning life as independent record labels featuring punk and new wave artists.

Red Cat's expansion—timed with a resurgence of consumer interest in vinyl after decades of neglect in favour of CDs and then digital streaming—was welcome news to the Hastings-and-Nanaimo district, located at the boundary of the Grandview-Woodland and Hastings-Sunrise neighbourhoods.

The independent Horse Records had just closed months previous after two years in business at the same address, and the bustling retail stretch was undergoing a gradual reinvention as a hip location, boasting several retro cafe/diner-style restaurants, secondhand clothing shops and nearby thrift stores, a large grocery store featuring organics, and a variety of eating spots that reflected the area's diverse cultural background.

As well, new city neighbourhood plans and zoning changes were also promising to densify the district in terms of population.

Hastings-Sunrise Red Cat Records. Red Cat

Both Red Cat stores were well-known for knowledgeable staff—some of whom were local musicians—who regularly posted favourite albums and top-10 lists.

Red Cat's announcement stated that gift certificates and store credit from the Hastings location will be honoured at the Main Street store when it reopens. Concert refunds will also be processed at that time. A reopening date has not yet been determined, and online sales will continue until then.

The Instagram notice continued: ""Our original store at 4332 Main Street (Main and 27th) will remain open, and we're still doing online sales and free delivery within Vancouver. Over the next few weeks we will be consolidating stock and re-organizing the Main Street location. When we're ready, we'll start doing curbside pick-up at the Main street location too. Don't worry: if you have store credit at Hastings, it will be honoured at Main Street when we re-open. Same with gift certificates.



""We'll miss our Hastings Sunrise music lovers. If you haven't visited the Main Street location yet, we hope you will when we re-open. Take care and stay safe.""",[]

While all Canadians are facing stress and struggles because of the COVID-19 pandemic, citizens across the nation still responded generously to help hungry Canadians in need.

Food Banks Canada provided an update today (May 1), announcing that donations generated by the biggest multi-platform Canadian special Stronger Together, Tous Ensemble, broadcast on April 26, has raised over $8 million, which ranks among the biggest amounts from a charitable television special in Canada.

(By April 27, over 140,000 individuals had been reported to have already donated $6 million.)

The texting donations—$1.6 million over four days—is the highest amount raised by a text-to-donate channel in Canada.

“Although we have always known that Canadians are amongst the kindest people on earth and we hoped and planned for our neighbours’ generosity, we were brought to our knees with gratitude by the overwhelming caring of our communities across Canada,” Food Banks Canada chief executive officer Chris Hatch previously stated in a news release on April 27. “Our staff team voluntarily jumped on the phones as we were working through technical challenges. Nobody could have anticipated the numbers of generous souls inspired to give last night.”

Another record it achieved is that with over 12 million viewers (or one in three Canadians), It became the most-watched Canadian broadcast, outside of sports.

The 90-minute show involved 15 broadcasting groups, including Bell Media, CBC, Corus Entertainment, Rogers Sports and Media, and Groupe V Média, and was presented on TV, radio, streaming, and on-demand platforms.

Almost 100 famous Canadians, including singers, actors, artist, activists, athletes, and more offered stories and thanks to frontline workers.

Vancouver's Sarah McLachlan, Jason Priestley, and Michael Bublé all appeared in Stronger Together, Tous Ensemble.

Among the names linked to Vancouver or British Columbia who appeared include Bryan Adams, David Foster, David Suzuki, Eric McCormack, Jason Priestley, Michael Bublé, Rick Hansen, Ryan Reynolds, and Sarah McLachlan.

Other Canadians involved included Anne Murray, Barenaked Ladies, Céline Dion, Drake, Buffy Sainte-Marie, Jann Arden, Margaret Atwood, Rick Mercer, Mike Myers, Bianca Andreescu, Cirque du Soleil, Chris Hadfield, Shania Twain, Robbie Roberston, the cast of Schitt’s Creek, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

The show also featured the world premiere of ArtistsCAN’s multi-artist charity single, in which numerous performing artists collaborated on a group performance of “Lean on Me”.

The single was created by Tyler Shaw and Fefe Dobson to raise funds for the Canadian Red Cross, and featured Justin Bieber, Avril Lavigne, Serena Ryder, Geddy Lee, Bad Child, Walk Off the Earth, and more.

Food Banks Canada supports 3,000 food bank organizations across the nation.

Although Nova Scotia may be on the opposite coast, British Columbians have been mourning the lives lost in Canada’s largest mass shooting.

On April 18 and 19, Gabriel Wortman went on a rampage, setting fires and killing 22 people in Nova Scotia.

A number of prominent British Columbians have ties to Nova Scotia.

In her daily B.C. COVID-19 update on April 22, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry, who has been leading the province through the pandemic, said that Nova Scotia is “a place that’s very dear” to her.

“To my Nova Scotia family, wherever you are, and to my RCMP family, know that I am heaving a sigh and wish for thee, and we’ll mourn with you from afar,” she said.

While singer-songwriter Sarah McLachlan may live in Vancouver, she hails from Nova Scotia’s provincial capital of Halifax.

McLachlan took to Facebook to express her feelings about the tragedy.

“I am heartbroken by the tragic news in my home province of Nova Scotia,” McLachlan wrote on April 24. “This devastating loss of life is unfathomable and my heart goes out to the victims and their families, first responders, and the entire community that has been affected by these senseless acts of violence. While I know that no words can take away the pain, I am sending love and peace to all.”

With the post, she uploaded a video of her and her daughter, India Ann, singing her 1998 ballad “Angel”.

McLachlan also participated in the star-studded Stronger Together, Nous Ensemble fundraising show for Food Banks Canada yesterday (April 26) and sang in the group performance of “Lean on Me”, to raise funds for the Canadian Red Cross.",[]

For many Canadians, the highlight of the Stronger Together, Tous Ensemble show was a hit song by the recently deceased Bill Withers.

""Lean on Me"" featured, among many others, Justin Bieber, Sarah McLachlan, Bryan Adams, Tyler Shaw, Fefe Dobson, Michael Bublé, Avril Lavigne, and Geddy Lee.

It's a song for the ages and the 48-year-old lyrics still hold a magical power during times of crisis, like the period we're living through now.

On the grill

Joshua Wood

Who are you?

I’m the kid who found music hiding under his bed with an old AM/FM radio while the parents were fighting and God was watching. There wasn’t music around and it felt like a shameful thing in a religious home. Definitely something I address in my songs. Even now in ""Bad Way"". It seems near impossible to weed out all religious ties and it keeps poking through the fabric. ""Bad Way"" is the result of walking with my ghosts through a real tough time and learning to love myself coming out the other side. That, and a kickass band backing me! Ha ha.

First concert

I started super late on the music train, so I guess it would have been some punk band in my hometown at the Hideaway when I was 16 or so. Same spot I played my first show at probably around the same time. Hell, everyone in St. Catharines, Ontario, played there. All-ages shows pretty often, and even if it wasn’t we’d sneak in through the pool hall next door that was connected… and the food: so greasy, good, and cheap. Then they got shut down for sanitation reasons, ha ha ha. Best place a punk could ask for. It was our little skunk pit and we loved it. Anyway, it’s like a dance studio or somethin’ now.

Life-changing concert

Just last year sometime in July, I believe, I was in Vancouver at the Rickshaw and it was Kelly Finnigan and his band playing. I was with some friends and, holy hell, I couldn’t stop swaying ’n’ giggling ’n’ laughing­—just lovin’ it loudly. I was seeing the light all of a sudden and I feel it had a heavy influence on me for some time after that. It was a goddamn religious moment, ya know? Couple weeks later I found Felix Fung and Little Red Sounds studio and we cut ""Bad Way"". Who knows if Bad Way would have even happened without seeing Kelly Finnigan that night. Thanks, man!

Top three records

Holy hell, that’s impossible… But I can tell you which CDs have survived the longest in my truck stereo.

John Prine John Prine It has been in there for a good year now. It’s just too good, and when you know every word, it’s a pleasure to drive around to.

Bacil Kill Antix Unix An Indonesian hip-hop group I got to play a show and do a little collaboration with while I was over there. Rad people and super wicked tracks. Never been huge into hip-hop, but these cats turned me.

Soundgarden Badmotorfinger One of the only songs that doesn’t skip on this one is “Jesus Christ Pose” and I swear it doesn’t even matter because I could listen to that song on repeat all day.

All-time favourite video

Video of AGORIA - YOU ARE NOT ALONE

Agoria “You Are Not Alone” Directed by Hernan Corera. Super cool video. Each part of it is equal in artistic beauty and importance for the art piece as a whole. The song is trancelike and a perfect soundtrack to the amazing acting and videography. It’s unreal—a big influence when I was working out the concept and ideas around my new video for “Surrender”, my second single coming out on YouTube May 9, which was directed by Kaio Kathriner.

What’s in your fridge?

Well, I live in a “tiny home” on Gabriola Island right now, so I keep things pretty minimal.

Frozen lettuce. I got a frozen head of lettuce ’cause my little mini-fridge doesn’t do too well at separating the freezer from the fridge. Been there a while now, just sorta seems important to keep in the fridge for some reason.

Oranges. I got four oranges that have better freeze resilience than my lettuce has. I’ve had a strange thing with oranges lately where 2 in the morning comes in and it’s all I want. All the oranges. Really cold oranges.

A burrito. Oh and I got a leftover burrito, which I’m about to go eat—butter-chicken burrito from a place called the Kitchen here on the island. So damn good. Yeah, I’m gonna go do that. Cheers!

The Mission Folk Music Festival has announced the cancellation of its 2020 edition, which had been sheduled to take place from July 24-26.

As has been the case with almost everyy high-profile festival in Greater Vancouver, the decision was made after weighing safety risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

In announcing the cancellation, the Mission Falk Music Festival stated ""We know festival-goers and other participants will understand the need to make this heartrending decision, and we share their disappointment. The festival truly appreciates the longstanding support our community, funders and sponsors have shown over the last three+ decades, and looks forward to welcoming them back to the park next year.""

The good news in all of this is that all tickets purchased for the MFMF will be automatically refunded. The even better news is that fans of the long-running festival can help ensure its survival for future years by donating the value of their ticket, for which they'll receive a charitable tax reciept.

War Baby

You Are Not Here (Kingfisher Bluez)

On its third full-length, You Are Not Here, posthardcore trio War Baby sounds almost at its breaking point when it comes to the cyclical mundanities of life. If you’re a Vancouver resident, congratulations—you’ll have insider knowledge on what the band is talking about, including a song titled “Renovicted”.

Backed by an endless wall of grungy guitars on short and punchy songs that get straight to the point, frontman Jon Redditt’s voice fights through all the noise to vent the frustration of being stuck in a sort of purgatory. The band often finds a percussive phrase or musical motif, repeating it until the listener is pummelled into submission. Some of these tracks are the mantras you keep turning over in your head to convince yourself that maybe there’s the tiniest glimmer of hope in the distance. And some of them are the doubting inner voices that put you in this headspace in the first place.

War Baby went into the recording sessions with what they called “a loose set of ideas for songs that were far from complete”, and the album is likely all the better for it. The band plays around with tempo switches, disrupting the flow to pull technically impressive guitar licks out of nowhere. “Forever Heavy” uses a sudden slower, contemplative section to bridge the gap between noisy grunge and shimmering power pop. Thankfully, it all ends on a hopeful note, with the calmer acoustic track “Come to Pass” having Redditt remind himself that all things eventually do.",[]

Grimes

Miss Anthropocene (4AD)

While working for DC in the early 1970s, the iconic comic-book writer and artist Jack Kirby created an entire cosmology centred around the distant planets Apokolips—ruled by the villanous Darkseid—and New Genesis, home world of the New Gods.

If you took a quick glance at the track listing of the new Grimes album and saw that it includes such titles as ""Darkseid"" and ""New Gods"", you could be forgiven for assuming that Miss Anthropocene is a concept album inspired by Kirby's work. In fact, you could be forgiven for maintaining that notion even after listening to it, because it's almost impossible to understand any of the lyrics through the haze of studio effects—to say nothing of the fact that most of ""Darkseid"", which features Taipei-based artist 潘PAN, is actually in Chinese.

The lyrics are all available on Genius.com, though, from whence we can ascertain that one line, from ""Before the Fever"", sort of sums it all up: ""This is the sound of the end of the world.""

That's easy to believe when listening to the dense cloud of distortion and throbbing beats that is ""My Name Is Dark"", or ""So Heavy I Fell Through the Earth"", an ethereal number whose sky-watching prettiness is shot through with menacing synth buzzes like something out of Annihilation. At the opposite end of the spectrum you'll find ""Delete Forever"", which, with its acoustic-guitar strumming—and banjo!—is as close to ""rootsy"" as Grimes is ever likely to get.

Grimes (born 31 years ago in Vancouver as Claire Boucher) is always going to be a divisive figure, which is largely her own doing. After all, she doesn't have to tell interviewers that she wants to upload her consciousness into a ""humanoid vessel"" and send it to Mars (where it will presumably live happily ever after with a cyborg version of Elon Musk). Nor is she obligated to announce to the world that her new record is about ""the anthropomorphic Goddess of climate Change: A psychedelic, space-dwelling demon/ beauty-Queen who relishes the end of the world"".

In the end, what matters is the music, and Miss Anthropocene is a richly layered and occasionally frustrating but ultimately rewarding listen.",[]

Did You Die

Postcards From Paradise (Blew//Rose)

Maybe it's because I am, as the kids say, old AF, but I approve most heartily of the selection of covers on this EP by the Vancouver-spawned (but now Victoria-based) Did You Die. If you are also old and decrepit (or just an '80s alt-rock obsessive), you will feel like a kindred spirit of any band that would record its own versions of tunes originally by the Psychedelic Furs (""Love My Way""), Suzanne Vega (""Left of Center""), Peter Murphy (""Cuts You Up""), and Flesh for Lulu (""Postcards From Paradise""). I'm pretty sure each one of these songs was on a John Hughes movie soundtrack at some point.

It's not just an on-point selection of tunes that makes this EP worth hearing, though. Did You Die has always excelled at shoegazing ragers, but here the band—which these days consists of singer and multi-instrumentalist Richie Felix Alexander and vocalist Katherine Marie Kovna—proves itself equally adept at synth-driven new wave (on ""Love My Way"") and jangly goth-pop (""Cuts You Up"").

Perhaps most significantly, the whole EP was recorded, mixed and mastered by Alexander himself. (By way of contrast, consider that the last DYD full-length, Royal Unicorn, had a different person filling each role.) The results are pretty great, and they bode well for the next time Did You Die releases material that it wrote itself.",[]

Hotel restaurants sometimes get a bad rap. Granted, the quality of these dining rooms varies wildly from one to the next; just as with regular restaurants, some are exceptional and some most certainly are not. Vancouver, being the food city it is, however, is home to some fantastic hotel-based places for wining and dining.

What exactly is a hotel restaurant? We ask the question, because it seems there’s some confusion. Some, like Hawksworth and Mott 32, are in fact wholly independent businesses that just happen to be situated on hotel property (the Rosewood Hotel Georgia and Trump International Hotel and Tower, respectively). Others, like Botanist at the Fairmont Pacific Rim and Notch8 Restaurant and Lounge at the Fairmont Hotel Vancouver, are fully part of a brand’s operations. Call them what you want: the city’s top “hotel restaurants” are delivering some of Vancouver’s most sublime dining experiences.

For those working the line or the floor, being associated with a hotel has its pros and cons.

David Hawksworth loves his eponymous restaurant’s location in the heart of Vancouver. However, Rosewood Hotel Georgia employees went on strike earlier this year, picketing outside for 59 days—the longest hotel workers’ strike in the city’s history. His business took a hit, despite it not being officially affiliated with the hotel. It was a situation the chef entrepreneur (who also runs Bel Café at the same address) never anticipated.

“It was awful,” Hawksworth says during an afternoon interview with the Straight at the restaurant. “It affected business horrendously. If I was to ever get involved in a hotel again, I would know how to prepare myself businesswise. That was rough.

“But there’s so much upside to being where we are,” he’s quick to add. “We have a captive audience. Guests just have to put on their slippers and come down for dinner. That’s fantastic. And, I grew up in Vancouver, and being right on the corner of Howe and Georgia—that’s centre ice.”

When Hawksworth thinks of hotel restaurants, places like the Savoy come to mind, the luxury London institution being an establishment he aspires to emulate. At Hawksworth, you might find items prepared with modernist techniques; consider crab-and-prawn toast with celery and green apple dusted with sour cream that’s been frozen by liquid nitrogen—the ingredient ending up looking like powdery snow. But even in the Instagram age of fine dining, he attributes his success to a commitment to the basics—seasonality and provenance—and to a deeper, more personal motivation.

“Food is getting better across the globe exponentially faster than ever before,” he says. “Chefs can forget it’s maybe less about tweezers and more about real ingredients. I love working with great products.”

He's still the man—once again, Georgia Straight readers have voted for David Hawskworth as the city's chef of the year. Chris Mason Stearns

What drives him? “Fear of failing,” he says. “School was a nightmare for me. I’m dyslexic. I want to succeed. We’re highly critical of what we do. Vancouver is a tricky place to do business, but it means more to me than anything to do this in Vancouver.”

Working at a Fairmont hotel, Notch8 executive chef Dennis Peckham says he sometimes gets asked if he feels boxed in, restricted in terms of ideas in order to align with the international brand. The answer is “Not at all.”

“It’s like a painter: just because the canvas is this one size doesn’t mean that a painter can’t do his own work,” Peckham says in an interview in the lounge just as happy hour is getting under way. “We’re encouraged to be creative. It doesn’t stifle your creativity; you just find your way within the borders.”

Peckham, a Top Chef Canada finalist, describes the approach at the iconic Vancouver hotel as “approachable sophistication”. Take wagyu steak frites with red-wine jus as an example. On one hand, it’s a simple dish people can relate to. On the other, it boasts the kind of premium ingredients that so-called foodies crave. “It’s still sophisticated to keep with the brand, but it’s also accessible,” Peckham says. “Anybody staying in the hotel, no matter their culinary knowledge or experience, will find something on the menu that will satisfy them.”

Other current dishes Peckham is especially proud of include roasted duck breast with shiso-braised red cabbage, and pickled currants and beets; and sablefish with roasted Delicata squash, pickled mustard seeds, squid ink tuile, and black garlic purée. Both have depth of flavour and a stunning presentation, “but at the end of the day, they’re simple dishes,” he says. “We push ourselves creatively to build dishes that people will appreciate but not be intimidated by.”

Botanist executive chef Hector Laguna likes to say his restaurant offers ""happy food"".

Botanist is the first hotel restaurant executive chef Hector Laguna has ever worked at—and he’s loving it. Born in La Estación, a town of about 500 in the Mexican state of Hidalgo, he got his start at a small Vietnamese restaurant in San Francisco. He went on to work in Miami with Michelle Bernstein, a James Beard Foundation Award–winning chef of Jewish and Latin descent, who “took his like of cooking to a whole new level” with her enthusiasm and dazzling flavours.

Eventually, Laguna moved to Vancouver via Toronto, joining the crew at Hawksworth before getting a call from the management team at Botanist. He admits he had preconceived notions of hotel dining.

“Hotels aren’t known necessarily for their cuisine,” he says. “I came in for a chat with the GM and the executive chef at the time, and we just talked and talked about food and what we like to eat and how they wanted to run Botanist as if it was an independent restaurant. Half an hour turned into two-and-a-half hours. It was easy to say yes.”

Laguna describes the menu in terms not often heard from top chefs: “It’s happy food.”

“I cook what we think is good food,” he says. “I think of something, I play with it, I use local as much as possible; the farms here are amazing.

“They trust us,” he says of the hotel’s higher-ups. “It has to run as a business, but it doesn’t feel like a hotel restaurant.”

Mott 32's décor can match the most upscale dining establishments in Hong Kong. Mott 32

When Mott 32, the upscale Chinese restaurant run by Hong Kong–based Maximal Concepts, opened in conjunction with the Trump International Hotel and Tower in 2017, the only thing that left a bitter taste in some people’s mouths was its association with the hotel’s namesake. In February 2019, the restaurant separated completely from the hotel, and it has since been independently owned and operated. Mott 32 wine director and general manager Robert Stelmachuk says that although some people may have an issue with the hotel, they’re often quickly won over by Mott 32—particularly by the organic, expertly executed Chinese cuisine, including dim sum made fresh to order, Ocean Wise seafood, and Peking duck (Brome Lake fowl produced specifically for the restaurant), and the gluten-free, vegetarian, and vegan options, all offered with topnotch service and one of the most impressive wine and beverage programs in the city.

“I’m in the business of food and beverage, which has no politics,” Stelmachuk tells the Straight during an interview on-site. “The experiences we create here are done in this room by us. The people who dine with us are really quite amazed that this is available to them in Vancouver; there’s nothing like it. The ambiance, the décor, is world-class. The style of service we do is geared to five-star-style dining; we guide guests and explain dishes to them, we announce food when it’s placed on the table.

“We don’t just try to operate Mott 32 as a fine-dining Chinese,” he adds. “We want to be competitive as one of the best restaurants in the city, regardless of the ethnicity of the food we’re serving.”",[]

He didn’t open a new restaurant in Vancouver this past year, nor is he new to the local culinary industry, but Boulevard Kitchen and Oyster Bar’s executive chef, Roger Ma, has found himself in the limelight after recently returning home with a prestigious accolade.

The Vancouver-born-and-raised chef won gold at this year’s Canadian Culinary Championships (CCC), a two-day national cooking competition held last month in Ottawa that was the finale to its regional counterpart, the Great Kitchen Party. The invite-only gastronomic event consists of three parts (mystery wine pairing, the black box, and the grand finale), creating a rigorous mental and physical process that rewards only the most deserving chefs.

This achievement may not resonate with people outside the professional-cooking sphere, but local chefs and culinary experts who are familiar with the CCC recognize its magnitude and how challenging it can be, which is why they voted Ma chef of the year in the Georgia Straight’s annual industry-insiders survey of more than 50 chefs, food and beverage directors, and restaurant managers. (For the results, scroll to the bottom.)

They often say that being slow and steady wins the race, and those wise words can definitely be used to describe Ma’s journey to culinary success. The 38-year-old Vancouverite originally enrolled in art school, and planned to pursue a career in design.

But having grown up in a large Asian family where food was often a focal point at home and at family gatherings, Ma soon realized he wanted to try his hand at cooking for a living, and eventually attended the Dubrulle French Culinary School (the same year it was bought by the Art Institute of Vancouver).

“Food has always been a part of me. We would always end up at my grandma’s house on weekends and spend the whole day eating and cooking, and at home my mom would cook a lot of Chinese [food],” Ma told the Straight in a phone interview. “[I] haven’t looked back since deciding to go to culinary school. I really enjoy making people happy through food.”

Chef Ma grew up in a large Asian family, where food was always an integral part of family gatherings. Leila Kwok

After completing his training, he held positions at Rogers Arena, Umberto Menghi’s former high-end Italian eatery Circolo, and Fifty Two 80 Bistro & Bar at the Four Seasons Resort Whistler.

It was up at Whistler that Ma made many meaningful connections that got him to where he is today: getting connected with Thomas Haas through his chef Jason McLeod would help pave the way for six years at New York’s Michelin-starred Daniel by Daniel Boulud, and meeting chef Alex Chen (his colleague and mentor at Boulevard) through Dan Olson (Railtown Cafe and Catering) would eventually lead him to his current role.

When Ma decided to move back to Vancouver from New York, Chen reached out to him about working together.

“At that time in 2013, Boulevard was just a concept the owners were talking about. Alex wanted me to be a part of it [and] I thought it was going to be a great opportunity,” said Ma. “I was a chef de cuisine, and Alex was the executive chef. We did all the concept development, all the recipes, and setting up the restaurant.”

Ma acknowledges that Boulevard may have had a sleepy start, but it has since won various awards and become one of the most respected fine-dining establishments in Vancouver. He helped propel the restaurant to where it stands now by consistently creating dishes that cater to all kinds of palates, by drawing from his training, experiences, and travels, as well as his Asian heritage.

“For a lot of Asian food, there’s always that sweet, salty, sour element that a lot of other cuisines don’t really have. It’s nice to kind of apply that, whether it’s French, Italian, or Japanese,” explained Ma. “Having that at the back of your head makes your dishes a little more diverse and unique.”

He describes his food as thoughtful and tasty. “I always like to have a story behind whatever I make, either a historical reference or a reason for being on the plate,” said Ma, “whether it’s tradition or inspired by another dish from somewhere else or the circumstances of it.”

At the CCC, Ma’s regional qualifier and grand-finale dish was his B.C. Coastal Terroir, which features a unique marrying of flavours and textures like honey-mussel gratinée, foraged bull kelp, sea-urchin custard, Yukon Gold potato, scallion terrine, and shellfish emulsion.

One of the ingredients used in Ma's award-winning grand finale dish at the CCC was B.C. sea urchin. Leila Kwok

The inspiration behind his award-winning dish was a boat trip that he took with local seafood purveyor Fresh Ideas Start Here. “It was actually very inspiring being out on the boat and just seeing all the kelp floating in the water, and [how] you could literally pull it out and start eating it,” he recalled. The winning dish pays homage to where he’s from, and showcases the progression of his career.

Ma’s gold medal was not the first CCC win for Boulevard—Alex Chen also took home the top prize in 2018. With him following in Chen’s footsteps within and beyond the kitchen, one has to wonder if Ma has ever felt the need to break out of his colleague’s shadow.

“Him and I, it’s a pretty unique relationship we have. He looks at me as a little brother and I look at him as an older brother,” explained Ma. “For sure, he has a big shadow, but I never felt that I’m trying to make my own voice or something like that. He’s very respectful and supportive of me, so I never felt like at any point I’ve had to fight for my own spotlight.

“I just like to keep my head down and work, and focus on my food and make sure the restaurant is running well and guests are happy,” he added. “Those things are more important to me than the spotlight.”

While Ma will be busy re-creating his competition dishes for a special tasting menu running throughout March, he’ll still have love to spare for the classics in Boulevard’s food repertoire, such as the roasted sablefish (with soy-sake glaze, baby hakurei turnip, and bone-broth emulsion with marinated seaweed). “That’s all I really want to eat on my days off.”

Don’t expect the 2020 Canadian culinary champion to diverge from his current path anytime soon. He’s happy where he is, and has no far-fetched plans to open his own restaurant in the near future. But he does have ambitions to turn the establishment where he works into an institution that can survive for decades to come.

“I just want to continue to evolve Boulevard and evolve myself as a chef and see where that takes me,” said Ma. “I feel like we’re just getting started for what we can really do, and I’m pretty excited for the next few years.”

153,straight,https://www.straight.com/food/1371021/golden-plates-2020-diverse-talent-thrives-vancouvers-western-kitchens,Golden Plates 2020: Vancouver's western dining spots are fuelled by diverse talent,[],2020-03-11 11:59:00-07:00,"1 of 6 2 of 6

It’s no secret that most of Vancouver’s restaurant kitchens are diverse: local dining spots usually employ cooks from different backgrounds, regardless of race, gender, or sexual orientation.

But when you look higher up on the rosters of professional kitchens, they’re not always that inclusive. At most “western” fine-dining establishments, most of the executive chefs are male, and most of those men are white.

It’s not impossible to find ethnic minorities—some of whom are women—at the helm of such kitchens, but it’s still a rare sight. Some younger chefs who are members of visible minorities, though, believe that their background hasn’t hindered their climb to success in western kitchens.

Boulevard Kitchen and Oyster Bar's sous-chef Daniel Kim. Boulevard

Daniel Kim, 25, is the sous-chef at the upscale Boulevard Kitchen and Oyster Bar. He never went to culinary school, but had a serious passion for cooking and worked his way up.

“Being a minority in Vancouver is very hard. There are a lot of Asians; there are a lot of multicultural people,” Kim told the Straight in a phone interview. “Funnily enough, in the restaurant industry, I never thought I was a minority. Being here and being born in Canada, I didn’t feel like I was different from everyone else, except for appearance, like skin colour.”

That doesn’t mean it isn’t a hard industry in which to stay, because of long hours and low wages for those on the lower tiers. But he’s never felt like he had to work harder than his white counterparts to get to where he is now.

“Of course, there’s [the] degrading part of cooking, where you get yelled at and shouted at, and then you get stuff thrown at you,” Kim said. “But it’s not because I was different or because I was Asian. No one was discriminated because of their skin colour.”

Origo Club's pastry chef, Qing Qing An. Origo Club

Qing Qing An is the pastry chef at Origo Club in Richmond, a high-end restaurant serving contemporary French cuisine. She studied pastry at the Cordon Bleu Ottawa Culinary Arts Institute before moving to Montreal to work at a four-star hotel. She acknowledged that she may not be as proficient in English as colleagues born and raised in Canada, but she never found it hard to secure a job at an upscale restaurant because of her roots.

“In my case, every time I send my résumé out, I always get a response, have an interview, and get a job offer,” An told the Straight by phone. “I understand not everyone has had the same experience, [so] that’s why I’m saying I’m lucky.”

Like Kim, she believes that nothing else matters in the kitchen other than a passion for cooking. “The first important thing to me is you have to have the patience for what you are doing, then you have to have the right attitude. That’s more important than other stuff,” An said.

Although some chefs may have found it easy to work in kitchens where one’s skin colour and gender don’t matter, it isn’t the same for everyone across the board.

Five Sails Restaurant's chef Masa Mabuchi. Five Sails

Masa Mabuchi is the chef at the Five Sails Restaurant at the Pan Pacific Vancouver. An industry veteran, he’s worked at fine-dining establishments for decades. When he first moved to Canada from Japan after being trained in French cooking, he definitely felt like he needed to work harder than his Caucasian colleagues, especially because he spoke barely any English.

“Coming from Japan, it was not easy, and I still feel that way sometimes,” Mabuchi told the Straight. “It was challenging at first, but I am confident in my cooking and my skills.”

He acknowledges that the culinary scene for professional cooks has gotten better over the years. “As the time passed by, I opened myself to the Canadian culture,” he added. “Everyone was very welcoming, and it still is the case. I feel at home.”

His advice to culinary students who are also visible minorities who aspire to work in western kitchens is simple. “Be patient, be humble, and have a purpose. Work hard; never cease to learn,” Mabuchi said. “Always remember where you come from.”

Ancora's executive pastry chef, Rebecca Chen. Ancora

Rebecca Chen is the executive pastry chef at Ancora Waterfront Dining and Patio. She was hired immediately after graduating from Granville Island’s Pacific Institute of Culinary Arts. When asked about her experience working as a double minority—Asian and female—in a western kitchen, she said it hasn’t been easy.

“I have to say that it’s definitely an exercise in trying to overcome people’s first impressions and stereotypes,” Chen told the Straight by phone. “People are always assuming that you’re not from here. A lot of times, they’re like: ‘Oh, you’re actually Canadian and from here.’ ”

She noted that in addition to skin colour, female chefs with higher ranks in professional kitchens face challenges purely because of their gender.

“I’ve hired people that are supposed to be below me, and they’re white and male, and then I just kind of feel a little bit like, ‘Why do I have to fight so hard to earn [their] respect when they’re working for me?’ ” Chen said. “There are a lot of males I run into, sometimes they are just shocked when they discover I’m a female and I have my own opinions on how I want things run. Some people just don’t know how to deal with that.”

Chen promotes equality by investing in a wide range of people and allowing room for growth. She has hired many female pastry chefs, many of whom have gone on to even better opportunities in other cities around the world.

She believes that local restaurants are offering more recognition and opportunities to women—but that there’s still a way to go until both genders are viewed as equals.

Glowbal Restaurant's sous-chef, Karla Contreras. Glowbal

Mexico-born Karla Contreras has a similar perspective. She started out bussing tables at Glowbal Restaurant before rapidly moving up the ranks to become sous-chef. That was four years ago.

“It has been a total challenge, because when I started working there I was the only woman in the kitchen and it was pretty much only guys in the kitchen,” Contreras told the Straight by phone. Like Chen, she’s had to deal with men in the kitchen who didn’t always appreciate that she had a voice.

“Most of the cooks are male. Sometimes, having the power and authority [as a female] is not something some people are used to,” Contreras explained. “To earn their respect, you have to show you can do the things [and] show them how you do things your way. So that’s why it has been a little bit challenging.”

But when it comes to ethnic backgrounds, she believes there is equality. “Obviously, it’s an environment that is not easy. It’s hard and you have to work long hours. Most of the people think it’s only for tough, rough guys,” Contreras said. “But part of the beauty of this thing is that we, women, can show them that we can do it as well. The mindset for hiring people in the kitchen now is as long as they have the skill, then anyone can join.”",[]

Growing up in “landlocked” Nelson, B.C., Justin Witcher dreamed of seeing the world after he graduated from culinary school in Vancouver. He got a job cooking on a cruise ship and visited places in Australia, Asia, Europe, and beyond. The experience piqued his love of travel, his favourite place to go proving to be the home of tapas and sangria.

“I love Spain,” the executive chef of ¿CóMO? Taperia tells the Straight during an interview that starts off like a version of Carpool Karaoke (albeit less hilarious). I’m tagging along for the ride, recording device on, as he zips from the Mount Pleasant restaurant to a nearby bakery for fresh bread needed for bikini sandwiches for a Visa Infinite dinner. “I love the simplicity of the food. You don’t need to do much to it; the ingredients are so good they speak for themselves. There’s no better ham in the world than Iberico ham. There’s no better nut than Marcona almonds. Pair them with sherry and you’re set.

“It’s simple, but Spanish people also play with their food,” he adds. “Italy or France don’t stray from what they do too much; you don’t fuck with a spaghetti vongole. It is what it is. It’s tried and true and super good. In Spain they really experiment more. So many chefs think outside the box. It’s cool that they’re so progressive.”

With his long-standing love of all things Spanish, it’s no wonder the Vancouver Community College grad got excited when bartender Shaun Layton (previously of L’Abattoir) and Meat & Bread cofounder Frankie Harrington told him about the tapas restaurant and bar they wanted to open on Main Street.

From the moment it launched, ¿CóMO? has bedazzled diners. This year, it earned the title of Best New Restaurant in the Georgia Straight’s Golden Plates. The lively eatery was also named the second-best new restaurant in Canada last year by enRoute magazine—the only Vancouver establishment to make the list. For Witcher, the accolades have been overwhelming.

“It’s been a whirlwind,” Witcher says. “Even when I thought about it being at its absolute best, I didn’t imagine it would be like this. It’s pretty cool. Feels pretty good.

“It’s not just good food, but good drinks and good atmosphere,” he says of the team’s vision. “You can come and have a quick drink and a quick bite at the bar, have a glass of sherry and meet your friends before having dinner reservations somewhere else,” he says. “We have people who do that. Of course, we want them to have dinner here, but we really want people to talk to each other. What inspired me about restaurants in Barcelona was that within an hour, we knew everyone around us; we were eating off other people’s plates. It was so cool. ¿CóMO? is something new for Vancouver.”

Witcher got his start in the industry right after high school, when he got a job as a dishwasher at a small Mexican restaurant in his hometown. “I had to pay snowboarding bills,” he says with a laugh. He worked his way up the ranks before taking on a role at an Italian restaurant. At 20, he moved to Vancouver for his culinary training.

After his cruise-ship stint came more work and more travel, including time at Jamie Oliver’s Fifteen Melbourne, which employed marginalized youths; there, he learned patience. He had a gig at the Wedgewood Hotel, where then executive chef Lee Parsons helped unleash his creativity: “He got me thinking more outside the box.” Then it was back to Australia, where he worked with hospitality company Atlantic Group, cooking for visiting world leaders and royalty. “It was a big jump in my career,” he says. “I had so much more responsibility. It was intense.”

After three-and-a-half years, Witcher was back on the West Coast, battling it out with two other chefs vying for a position with the Clayoquot Wilderness Resort. Each had to spend a full day cooking at the luxury property to prove their chops. He won, embracing the opportunity to work with some of the best B.C. ingredients available, all sustainable and locally sourced. Eventually, a mutual friend introduced him to Layton and Harrington, who, from their own travels, share a deep appreciation for Spanish cuisine and culture and the way they’re deeply intertwined.

“We wanted it to be authentic—to make croquettes like your tavern croquettes from Spain,” Witcher says. The menu features classic items like patatas bravas, goat-cheese stuffed peppers, and bikini sandwiches with jamón and Manchego cheese. Then there are more daring dishes like arroz negro: black rice with squid ink, squid, prawn, dashi, smoked paprika tempura bits, and aioli; and a recent special of uni foam with hot smoked paprika, spot prawns, and squid-ink focaccia. The bar offers selections not easily found on this side of the Atlantic: Spanish vermouth on tap, for instance, as well as an extensive selection of Spanish beer, sherry, and cava by the glass. Of course, there’s an entire section dedicated to gin and tonics.

Witcher says people often ask if another restaurant is in the works; perhaps, he says, but the team is in no rush to expand. “We want to be true to our work here,” he says. “Maybe we’ll slowly branch out, but for now we want to continue to make people happy.""",[]
155,straight,https://www.straight.com/food/1371026/golden-plates-2020-one-vancouvers-popular-new-eateries-ugly-dumpling-not-dumpling-house,"Golden Plates 2020: One of Vancouver's popular new eateries, Ugly Dumpling, is not a dumpling house",[],2020-03-11 10:09:53-07:00,"1 of 2 2 of 2

Chef Darren Gee wants to make one thing clear: his restaurant, Ugly Dumpling, is not a dumpling house. Granted, it does serve dumplings, but the house-made comfort food is not the main focus of its menu.

It’s a common misconception that the young restaurateur is still trying to work around, but he chose the name because it’s fun and spontaneous, in a way that’s similar to the food that he makes.

“You’d be amazed how many people walk in here, look at the menu, and leave, because it’s not a dumpling house,” Gee told the Straight in an interview at his Commercial Drive eatery. “It’s not a Chinese restaurant, it’s not a Japanese restaurant. It’s whatever I feel like making that day.”

There’s a reason why Ugly Dumpling was voted the 2020 Golden Plates runner-up for best new restaurant by Georgia Straight readers—Gee makes tasty food that extends beyond the Chinese-style comfort dish in a fuss-free, neighbourhood-style setting.

After completing a six-month course at Granville Island’s Pacific Institute of Culinary Arts, he went on to work at some dining establishments around Vancouver. He held a position at Farmer’s Apprentice for a long time, which he credits as a strong influence on how he works with ingredients and creates food at his own restaurant today.

But opening his own brick-and-mortar spot wasn’t the first thing that came to his mind.

“When I was thinking about opening a place, it was not really because I wanted to, but there wasn’t really anywhere else that I wanted to cook at the time,” explained Gee. “I guess the next logical step was just to do what I wanted to do. Cook food that I wanted to eat, and hopefully other people wanted to eat it too.”

For those who want to get a better grasp of what kind of culinary creations come out of Ugly Dumpling’s kitchen, it’s simple: it depends on what ingredients get delivered to Gee daily or weekly.

“Our menu is very much ingredient-based. The most important thing about food for me is how it’s grown and where it comes from,” he explained. “We don’t have an account with GFS [Gordon Food Service] or FreshPoint. We only use small farms, we do whole-animal butchery.

“We put a lot of time and effort into our sourcing. And then when we have these great ingredients, it’s really just not to screw them up too much. So the food is very, very simple, often just, like, two or three ingredients,” added Gee.

He also built a small garden on the patio meant for more seating, which perpetuates his culinary philosophy of local, seasonal, and organic.

Since the menu changes so often, there’s no static menu page on Ugly Dumpling’s website. Instead, Gee makes sure that the daily features and specials are posted to its Instagram account.

On the day Gee spoke to the Straight, the menu consisted of duck-fat scallion pancake, house-cured ikura (salmon roe) on grated daikon, steamed ling cod and kabocha squash in black-bean sauce, B.C. uni (sea urchin) on sushi rice, and braised duck leg with mustard-soy gravy and celeriac slaw, among others.

“If we were to compress it into one statement that would be semi-accurate, I think we settled on farm-to-table Asian restaurant,” said Gee, when asked how he would categorize his cuisine.

Although Gee emphasized that he doesn’t run a dumpling house, he acknowledges that pretty much all of his guests order dumplings, which is why the flavours change every couple of days.

“There are infinite combinations of dumplings you can make. Some of them are just classics, sometimes they are just experiments,” said Gee. “Pork and cabbage, and pork and chive, come back often.”

Besides food, guests will also find a very lengthy selection of libations. “Food and drink should go hand in hand, I think. We have a very diverse bar program,” he added. “Our wine is shifting toward more farm-focused producers, so it will align more with the concept and ideology of our food—how it’s grown and the quality and care that’s taken for the planet.”

The drinks menu includes sake, craft beer, wine, cocktails, and sherry—the last of which Gee believes goes well with food that is hard to pair with wine, such as dishes with very intense, fishy, or spicy flavours.

Ugly Dumpling opened in the last quarter of 2018, and has garnered plenty of attention and recognition within and outside the province. This has helped attract a clientele that Gee wasn’t used to receiving, because his main demographic is regulars and industry folks who live in the neighbourhood.

“There were people coming here to dine as a destination that we hadn’t really seen on a large scale before. It didn’t last too long, it was a little bit of a trend,” said Gee. “We tried not to pay too much attention to it. Just keep your head down and keep working.”

If you’re wondering what drink pairs best with dumplings, Gee has some insight to share.

“Beer and dumplings is what I would go for. Champagne and dumplings is very trendy,” he said. “If we’re just talking about flavour pairings, sherry and dumplings is very good.”",[]

When it comes to bartending, women are still outnumbered by men. But female presence behind the bar in Vancouver is growing, and two women—Sabrine Dhaliwal of Juke Fried Chicken and Katie Ingram of Elisa Wood-Fired Grill—have come in second and third behind Tableau Bar Bistro’s JS Dupuis in the Golden Plates readers’ choice ballot for best bartender.

The community of female bartenders is tight-knit, supportive, and fiercely talented. As a follow-up to International Women’s Day, we connected with a few of the city’s finest. Here’s what they had to say about their work, the industry, #MeToo, and other topics.

Sabrine Dhaliwal

Juke Fried Chicken, 182 Keefer Street

Born in the Netherlands and raised on a dairy farm in Ontario, Sabrine Dhaliwal moved to Saskatchewan as a teen, then relocated to Vancouver a decade ago via Sunwapta Falls, just outside of Jasper. She was planning on becoming a dentist after completing her degree in microbiology, but the world of cocktails won her over. Today an ambassador for Belvedere Vodka and Hennessy Cognac, she gained experience working at Reflections, West Restaurant, and Pourhouse, among other places. At one point she took time off to train for the Aprons for Gloves Boxing Association’s Restaurant Rumble, a charity boxing event.

“It makes you realize you have strength in ways you didn’t know,” Dhaliwal says of being in the ring. “Your mind will quit before your body is willing to. It’s about telling your mind that you can do it. It’s the longest two minutes of your life.”

On what she loves most about her role: “There aren’t many jobs where you have instant gratification, when someone loves their drink. But it’s not just about what you’re drinking; it’s about your whole experience. The word mixologist gets thrown around a lot. Yes, I mix a drink, but I’m a bartender, and a bartender is a host. People go to restaurants to dine, but people go sit at a bar to be hosted.”

On the #MeToo movement: “I’ve stopped harassment from happening. I’ve protected both men and women by saying to someone, ‘They’re not interested in this tonight, here’s your bill and you can leave.’ I make sure everyone is safe, and I don’t drink behind the bar.”

On how the tragic passing of Anthony Bourdain helped open up the conversation on mental health: “Vancouver is very fortunate to have a program called Mind the Bar to make sure everyone knows it’s okay to not be okay, and if you’re not okay, there are people you can contact. Mind the Bar is somewhere you can go in confidence and get help. I wish there was more like it around the world. We have so much to be thankful for in Canada, and Vancouver specifically.”

Now pouring: Anyone for Tennis—a bright and refreshing drink, with Beefeater gin, Pimm’s No. 1, strawberry-rhubarb tea, lemon, Bittered Sling Plum and Rootbeer bitters, and sparkling wine.

Katie Ingram of Elisa Wood-fired Grill. Leila Kwok

Katie Ingram

Elisa Wood-Fired Grill, 1109 Hamilton Street

Coming from a large, boisterous family, Katie Ingram always wanted to work in hospitality. After university, she started working with the Donnelly Group at the Lamplighter and Clough Club and became increasingly curious about cocktails and flavours. She says she first learned what it really means to be a bartender through Lauren Mote, cofounder of Bittered Sling, a retail line of bitters and culinary extracts.

On what motivates her daily: “I love the creative and performance elements about bartending. Every day the guests are different, and it is your job to take care of them and create the best experience you can. I love that the possibilities are endless, especially at Elisa, where we have something for everyone. We have a lot of pescatarian, vegetarian, and vegan guests who keep coming back because of our varied menu options.”

On getting her start in the industry: “When I first began to bartend, it was definitely very hard to get my foot in the door. I was either always in the way, too slow, or ‘not where I was supposed to be’, but that attitude didn’t last very long. It was interesting sometimes being the only female on the floor some nights, but I think that gave me confidence—especially when you are working with a great team—to feel equal among the other bartenders.”

On the impact of the #MeToo movement on the industry: “There is a lot of change happening. Restaurants and bars are not tolerating unacceptable behaviour. This behaviour isn’t just behind closed doors, during service, or after hours either; it’s in dining rooms and bars as well. When the Dandelion Initiative [For Safer Bars and Spaces] from Toronto was here last year, Chantelle Gabino and Viktoria Belle taught a seminar on a wide range of topics to help prevent and respond to any type of sexual harassment. I’m very lucky to have always worked on teams with great managers that have always supported me or anyone on our team when they tell them about an inappropriate situation or encounter. It needs to be zero tolerance no matter who you are: boundaries need to be set, and the line drawn very clearly.

“One thing that I notice is that people feel that they can’t say anything to anyone: say something! How can anyone help you if we don’t know about something someone has said to you? Sometimes in the moment it is paralyzing, because you almost cannot believe that someone would say this to you or dare to touch you. It is important to remember: it is never your fault.”

On the state of gender equality in bartending: “I feel empowered by the International Women’s Day theme this year of Each for Equal. This isn’t a man’s industry anymore; it’s our industry. I am a bartender, and I got to where I am today by working hard, pushing the boundaries, and being my best possible self, showing everyone that I belong here, and you do too.”

Now pouring: Pomela, “a perfect little spring tipple” made with Volcan de Mi Tierra tequila, grapefruit and pomegranate cordial, lime juice, dry tonic, and Bittered Sling Kensington bitters.

Emily Vey of the Diamond.

Emily Vey

The Diamond, 6 Powell Street

Emily Vey was 19 when she got her first job in the bar industry, in a small pub in Clarenville, Newfoundland, her hometown of 4,000 people. It was a way to work at night to pay for the university schooling she was pursuing during the day.

An avid home cook, she has always enjoyed coming up with fresh recipes and flavour combinations; working with beverages as opposed to foods opened up a whole new world.

On what keeps her behind the stick: “Once I started getting comfortable in the service industry, I realized I loved chatting and interacting with people too, learning their stories, and figuring out how each guest wants to be treated to keep them happy. I love that interaction. It shows our guests that I care about what they’re saying and makes them look forward to what I’m going to put on the table in front of them.”

On whether she has encountered any obstacles along the way as a woman: “Absolutely, I think as a woman in this industry we have to work twice as hard with guests oftentimes to show we know what we’re talking about and that our opinions and recommendations are just as great as our male partners behind the bar. I have had the experience with some patrons who still have the mentality that a woman is a server and a man is the bartender. I do notice that even though guests can clearly see me behind the bar shaking drinks, I am still often told to ‘have the bartender make me something,’ referring to my barmate, or I am met with quite a tone of surprise or disbelief that I made their drinks. My coworkers and I often laugh about how a guest will sometimes ask for a second opinion or confirmation from the other bartender because they think the guy is more qualified than I am to make a drink recommendation.”

On the impact of #MeToo: “I have noticed guests seem to be more wary of how they treat and talk to me in terms of tone and respect. It wasn’t so long ago that male guests could get away with acting in ways that would never be accepted now, especially in terms of touching or grabbing your server or bartender and otherwise acting inappropriately. This movement has been part of the catalyst that makes us identifying as women feel like it’s okay to stand up for ourselves and feel comfortable calling somebody on their behaviour—whether we say it ourselves or ask a manager to intervene.

“While I’m lucky enough to work with a great team of guys who support me, I’ve also seen firsthand that, in general, it is necessary for our male coworkers to set an example to guests to show them we’re as valued behind the bar and deserve to be treated that way. We need men to show other men that everyone behind the bar at an establishment is there for a reason regardless of gender. Once you change the attitude from within, it can set a great tone for guests to pick up when they interact with us and carry forward into other experiences.”

Now pouring: Tiger Breath, a delicate blend of Hibiscus Cachça, pineapple, lime, and jalapeño honey.

Odd Society Spirits, 1725 Powell Street

Olivia Povarchook moved to Vancouver from Kelowna in 2010 to go to culinary school. After a couple of years working in pastry kitchens, she jumped over to front-of-house. Bartending was a natural progression, using her training in flavour profiles, only in a more social environment.

On what’s behind her passion for pouring: “I love that there’s always something new to learn and that every day at work is different. At Odd Society especially, there’s so much encouragement to experiment with techniques and think outside the box.”

On being a woman in an industry still largely dominated by men: “It is baffling to me that people still think circumstances of gender discrimination are uncommon. The #MeToo movement has opened up a discussion in our industry and is allowing for more open discussion about abuses of power, discrimination, and sexism in hospitality. Change is coming, but at a very slow rate. A lot of things need to change to empower women behind the bar; but ultimately, just believe women.”

Now pouring: The Gentleman’s Sour, a long-standing favourite featuring a bittersweet mixture of Wallflower gin, Bittersweet vermouth, cassis, and “other fun things” for a frothy pink drink topped with rose petals.

Osteria Savio Volpe general manager Lisa Cook loves interacting with guests.

Osteria Savio Volpe, 615 Kingsway

Lisa Cook went to culinary school 20 years ago and starting cooking straight after. She became interested in food-and-wine pairings and decided to transition from working back-of-house to front-of-house, first as a server at Joey Bentall One. She quickly became bar manager, then wine-room manager, helping develop the wine program there.

On what piqued her interest in the field: “What drew me to bartending in the first place was the similarity it had to cooking, following recipes, experimenting with different flavours, and being able to create something delicious that you are excited to share with guests. What I love about being behind the bar today is the guest interaction. Most people who sit at the bar want to engage and ask questions, and I really enjoy getting to know people.”

On whether she has noticed differences in the way men and women are treated in the industry: “When I first started in this industry as a cook, I noticed how few women there were and felt the pressure to work twice as hard while showing less emotion than my male counterparts. In the last decade I have been very fortunate to have had some incredible employers who have valued me for my work and not my gender. Sometimes I feel guests or vendors I deal with expect to see a male in my position. I get a lot of ‘May I speak to your manager if he isn’t busy?’ or ‘Can you ask your sommelier to recommend us a wine that he thinks will go with our meal?’ I think people’s perception of what a bartender looks like needs to change, but I’m not really sure how to make that happen.”

There have been many libations that have enjoyed the limelight lately: craft beers, natural wines, and locally made gins among them.

However, there’s one category on restaurant drink menus that used to get little love but is fast gaining popularity among health-conscious Vancouverites and folks who won’t (or just don’t want to) drink alcohol: mocktails.

Several local restaurants have a full mocktail menu with expertly crafted selections that go far beyond the usual orange juice and soda. Here’s a nonexhaustive list of where you can find fine zero-proof beverages around town.

The Sandbar Seafood Restaurant

102–1535 Johnston Street, Granville Island

Located on Granville Island, this popular spot has a sizable mocktail list that will satisfy all types of taste buds. Go for the New Fashioned (brewed iced tea, lemon juice, cinnamon, simple syrup) if you’re feeling trendy; stay refreshed with its Seawall Sunset (pineapple juice, orange juice, soda water, and grenadine); or keep it simple with its Spritzer (mint, cucumber, simple syrup, lemon juice, lime juice, and soda water).

Fable Diner

151 East Broadway

Pair your fare with one of Fable Diner’s nonalcoholic delights (assuming you’re not sipping on a milkshake, that is). Creative numbers like the Fabled Virgin (Bremner’s blueberry juice, Giffard pomegranate syrup, Cyoni fresh grapefruit juice, bitter envy, and soda) and Don’t Call Me Shirley (Chaser’s fresh orange, lemon, and pineapple juices, Giffard grenadine syrup, Angostura bitters, and ginger ale) are just some of the options.

Notch8 Restaurant and bar

900 West Georgia Street

Whoever said nonalcoholic drinks aren’t good probably doesn’t like desserts, either. Notch8 has some sweet spirit-free cocktails, including a Sparkling Blueberry Limade (fresh lime, blueberry syrup, and soda), Pekoe Refresher (fresh mint, handcrafted limade, and Fairmont’s Lot35 orange pekoe tea), and Mango Colada (fresh pineapple juice, mango purée, and coconut milk).

Hy’s Steakhouse and Cocktail Bar

637 Hornby Street

This classic restaurant has created several nonalcoholic refreshments on a menu named “Prohibition”. Try the Adelaide Sour (Seedlip Garden 108, aquafaba, and fresh lemon juice), Richmond Fizz (pomegranate and pineapple juices, falernum, and ginger beer), and the artisinally crafted Fentimans Botanically Brewed soft drinks (tonic water, rose lemonade, cherry cola, and ginger ale).

Botanist

1038 Canada Place

This dining establishment has won all kinds of awards for its bar program and its bartenders, so it’s a no-brainer that its mocktail list would be just as winning. Check out spirit-free libations like the Heartwood (cedar, smoked alder, and birch saps), Not Yet (carrot, golden beet, ginger, and lemon), and the Nonhattan (Seedlip distilled nonalcoholic spirit, chai, North African spice, and black walnut).

Blossom Dim Sum and Grill

808 Bute Street

To go with your siu mai, har gao, grilled meat, and sushi at this East meets West eatery, try the Chrysanthemum Honey Cooler (chrysanthemum tea, honey, and water) or the Jasmine Lemonade (jasmine tea, lemon, and ginger).

Nightingale

1017 West Hastings Street

One of the most gorgeous rooms in the city also has some beautiful zero-proof drinks. We love the Lemon Sage with lavender and cucumber as well as the Cranberry Ginger with lemon and orgeat.

Lobby Lounge and Rawbar

1038 Canada Place Way

Grab a seat by the white Fazioli piano with walnut inlay, order some freshly made Ocean Wise sushi, and try a nonalcoholic sipper for a swish and delicious evening. Yuzu juice, pear green tea, basil, kombucha, and soda make up the Tang Dynasty; for something sunny, try the Cast Away: pineapple, coconut water, mint, and ginger honey.

Cactus Club Cafe

Various locations

When a Bellini just won’t do, try a Hey Hibiscus, with the namesake ingredient, rose, ginger, white peach, lemon, and soda. Or opt for a Soul Revival, which is a mix of ginger beer, lime, mango, turmeric, jalapeño, and Thai basil.",[]

After the one-two punch of the Dine Out Vancouver Festival and Vancouver International Wine Festival, both of which start off local wine enthusiasts’ year with a bang, the dust is indeed settling, but only so much.

This shoulder season between winter and spring used to be a sleepy one, but it looks like there are plenty of vinous offerings around town, and many of them are quite the bargain.

How much of a bargain? How does free grab ya?

On Friday (March 13), between 3 and 7 p.m., step into the B.C. Liquor Store signature tasting room at their 39th Avenue and Cambie Street location for a complimentary tasting through a trio of wines from northern Italy. Representatives from the Venetian winery Masi will be pouring their Masi Campofiorin Ripasso 2015, a “super Venetian” chewy red made from Corvina, Rondinella, and Molinara grapes; their fresh, lively, and berry-laden Masi Bonacosta Valpolicella Classico 2018; plus their crisp and citrusy Masi Masianco Pinot Grigio Verduzzo delle Venezie 2018. The latter is also $3 off the regular price of $19.99 through March 28, so now is the time to stop in.

Over at Everything Wine’s Vancouver location (8570 River District Crossing), representatives from British Columbia’s Lake Breeze winery will be pouring three wines from their portfolio on March 19 between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. The Naramata-based winery has had winemaker Garron Elmes overseeing things during its two-and-a-half-decade existence, and putting Okanagan terroir in our glasses. Look forward to supping Lake Breeze’s juicy and toasty red Meritage 2017 blend (Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, and Malbec), plus its aromatic white “Spice Jar” 2018 blend of Gewürztraminer, Schönberger, and Viognier. Rounding out the flight is Elmes’s iconic Pinot Blanc 2018; he’s always had a way with the crisp, apple-and-pear driven variety.

Got 10 bucks?

Over in Davie Village, John Clerides’s Marquis Wine Cellars is hosting a small series of tasting events, each with a measly $10 price tag.

Saturday (March 14) at 2 p.m., “Pacific Port” sees Fladgate Partnership brand manager Cynthia Opsal take attendees through the wonderful world of Portugal’s legendary port wine production, with a tour of white port, late-bottled vintage port, tawny port, and vintage port. Gems in the glass will include Taylor Fladgate 10-Year-Old Tawny Port and Fonseca 2012 Guimaraens Vintage Port. This one, as you may imagine, is going fast.

Then on March 20 at 5:30 p.m., Aaron Krombholz from Summit Fine Wines will guide guests through a half-dozen Pinot Noirs from his portfolio. Highlights will include Oregon’s Siduri Willamette Valley Pinot Noir 2017 and Hartford Court Russian River Pinot Noir 2016 from California.

Capping things off on March 23 at 5:30 p.m. is a Negociants Australia tasting that looks like a dynamite way to start your week. Pewsey Vale 1961 Block Riesling 2018 is a tart and mineral-driven take on the grape from old vines steeped in quartz soils, while the 50-year-old vines responsible for Henschke Louis Semillon 2015 make for a dazzling white that’s built to age. Fans of big reds won’t be left out in the cold either: selections like Henschke “Henry’s Seven” Red 2016 and Yalumba “The Signature” Cabernet Sauvignon Shiraz 2013 will be poured, among other selections.

More information on all three of these tastings is at Marquis-Wines.com.

Finally, how about rolling up our sleeves and getting some skin in the game?

On Thursday (March 12) at 6:30 p.m., Vancouver wine lovers will have the opportunity to do just that at Swirl Wine Store (1185 Mainland Street) in Yaletown. For $39.99, you get a seat at an interactive blending seminar with winemaker Mark Simpson of B.C. Wine Studio. First up, he’ll present a three-vintage vertical of his Bordeaux-inspired Siren’s Call Harmonious red wine, followed by a tutored tasting through each of its Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot, Malbec, and Syrah components. After that, the fun really starts. After a discussion of vintage variation and various blending strategies, attendees will be able to create their own red blend, offering thoughts and inspiration for the upcoming 2018 edition of the wine.

These exercises are always illuminating, quite educational, and a lot of fun, too! Visit SwirlWineStore.ca to secure your spot.

It’s always a great idea to keep an eye on the websites of local wine shops and to follow their social-media feeds. There are always fun events going on, with this week’s selections being just the tip of the iceberg. Cheers!",[]

As someone who was ahead of the curve when it came to raising the profile of craft beer in British Columbia, Howe Sound Brewing co-owner Leslie Fenn has seen a change in the way lagers and ales are regarded on the culinary front.

Long gone are the days when the only thing a cold one was paired with was a hot dog or hamburger and a baseball game. And when it comes to getting creative with alcohol in the kitchen, we’ve embraced the idea that wine—and cognac, if we’re being extra fancy—aren’t the only tools at our disposal for creating complex flavour profiles.

Fenn entered the beer business as co-owner of Squamish’s Howe Sound Brewing in 1996—a good decade and a half before the B.C. craft-beer scene exploded.

“When we started, there were about seven breweries,” she says, on the line from the States, where she’s on business. “Now I think there’s something like 180.”

Today, she’s also a co-owner at East Van’s R&B Brewing, with her time on the frontlines giving her a good vantage point for watching the way attitudes towards craft beer have evolved among those who love to cook and eat. Howe Sound Brewing’s menu, for example, features items like Rail Ale BBQ Smoked Chicken Wings and Ale and Cheddar Soup.

“Think about how mussels and beer seems to be a standard on menus these days,” says Fenn. “You might have seen it in Europe, in England, Ireland, Belgium, or France 20 years ago, but you wouldn’t have seen that here. Now it’s standard fare in North America.”

While folks on this side of the Atlantic took a while to pick up on it, beer has actually been used as a valuable cooking ingredient for centuries. Things date right back to the ancient Egyptians and Sumerians, whose physicians believed that using beer in recipes had health benefits.

In stews and traditional chilis, which tend to call for tougher cuts of meat, science comes into play. The process of braising helps break down collagen—the connective tissue that holds muscle fibres in meat together. And while you can use wine or stocks and broths for tenderizing during the braising process, you can also use beer.

“Wines can be more acidic, although probably the vintners wouldn’t agree with that,” Fenn says with a laugh. “Beers are very different. There have been unique beers created for centuries, using so many different yeasts and malts and hops. So when those are added to a recipe, they really add a flavour profile. They can be used for adding a bitterness, or a dark richness. And they can add a lightness, or a hoppiness.”

The next time you decide to play amateur Bobby Flay by attempting the celebrity chef’s Red Beef Chili, think about Howe Sound’s Pothole Filler Imperial Stout and what it might add with its pronounced notes of chocolate and coffee.

“Porters are also fantastic for adding a toasty aroma to meats in the cooking process because they are dark and strong,” Fenn says.

As sure as a traditional American lager has little in common with hop-heavy India pale ale, Irish stout, or Belgian lambic, different dishes will call for different beers.

“One year we made chocolate ganache and beautiful chocolate truffles to give out,” Fenn says. “And they were a hit—people are still asking us to make them. Chocolate and stouts definitely go together.”

With lighter dishes, you obviously go lighter with the beer. So, when breaking out the deep fryer and unleashing your inner Iron Chef on Cat Cora’s Spicy Onion Rings, opt for something like a Red Truck Round Trip Amber Ale.

There’s also nothing to stop you from getting creative. When doing a beer-can chicken on the barbecue, work a couple of lemon slices under the skin with the oregano sprigs and then stuff the cavity with a Parallel 49 Grapefruit Tricyle Radler.

As we’ve become more sophisticated as beer consumers, we’ve also started to pay attention to what pairs well with our food after it leaves the kitchen. Those marriages have long been important to Fenn and her team.

“We’ve done pairing with food for about 20 years,” she says. “Think stout and chocolate cake. Our Whitecap Wheat Ale has orange and cardamom in it, so it’s a natural pairing with a light fish dish. It adds to the profile of food whether it’s paired with it or added to it. It’s amazing what you can do.”

A pint can also help when you’re starting to regret ordering that extra slab of sliced beef brisket with the flavour-bomb fat cap.

“One of the things that beer does is sort of cut the fat as well,” Fenn says. “When you have something quite greasy, and have a standard pale ale or a British brown, it really cuts the fat.”

One of the greatest things about beer is its versatility. Whether you’re cooking with it or drinking it, Fenn notes there’s a style to go with anything, including hot dogs, hamburgers, and baseball.

“There are hundreds and hundreds of different versions of beers and ales,” Fenn says. “In many cultures beer is the standard drink instead of wine. If you’re in a British bar you’ll often have a sausage and pint, or a pickled egg and a pint—if you like pickled eggs. I can’t imagine having those things with a wine.”

(This story is sponsored by .)

Burgoo Bistro winning “Best Comfort Food” in this year’s Golden Plates awards was truly inevitable because the restaurant offers three droolworthy variations of mac and cheese—with toppings like bacon, shrimp, and smoked sausage.

The five local and especially cozy locations serve warm comfort classics including: shepherd’s pie, beef bourguignon, French onion soup, and cheese fondue with apple slices, grapes, and crusty bread.

If diners are looking for a meal on the lighter side, the eatery also has a wide range of delicious soups, salads, and sandwiches. All of the soups featured on the —crab bisque, tomato, mushroom medley, and corn and chicken—pair faultlessly with an order of cheddar and parsley Burgoo biscuits.

Try not to battle with your tablemates over the last one. Biscuits are (sadly) temporary but family is forever.

All Burgoo locations participate in Meatless Monday each week by creating a new vegetarian or vegan dish available for order. But fear not meat lovers, you can still get the pulled chicken and bacon sandwich.

For those who want to leave the restaurant with a belly full of melted cheese and fresh bread, this can be achieved by a visit on Fondue Friday. The fondue’s superb accompaniments are changed on a weekly basis.

Sweet treats like chocolate mousse, strawberry cheesecake, and banana chocolate bread pudding will be the proverbial cherry on top of your lunch or dinner.

If you’re unable to make it to a Burgoo location, multiple food delivery partners are able to bring the warm comfort fare to you. This is wonderfully convenient during torrential downpours, sick days at home, romantic date nights, or when you don’t want to put on pants.

Burgoo Bistro has had the pleasure of serving the hungry people of Vancouver for 19 years and counting. The team would like to share their gratitude with the restaurant’s valued diners who voted for Burgoo Bistro in the Golden Plates 2020 awards.

As executive director of culinary for JOEY Restaurants, chef Matthew Stowe is charged with coming up with dishes that will satisfy diners from Kelowna to Toronto to L.A.

The Surrey native studied at New York’s Culinary Institute of America then worked at Lutèce, a French restaurant in NYC, before returning to B.C. His CV includes positions at Sonora Resort, Cactus Club Cafe, and Joseph Richards Group; another key highlight was competing on Top Chef Canada in 2012, beating out 16 competitors from across the country to win.

Having just introduced new menu items to celebrate the launch of the company’s flagship location in North Vancouver, JOEY Shipyards, Stowe took some time to chat foodstuffs with the Straight.

Going waaay back, where did your interest in cooking come from?

My mother was a great cook. I am the oldest of six, so she cooked for eight people every night. I remember her roasting whole ducks, making curries, doing roast beef dinners with Yorkshire pudding. Dinner was a big deal in our house, and seeing the look on my family’s eyes as dinner landed on the table gave me a lot of joy. I definitely saw at an early age how food can bring people together.

What is it about cooking that you love?

I love the fact that when people go to a restaurant, they are trusting you with a memory. Whether it’s a birthday, anniversary, or important business meeting, it’s something that they will remember. Being able to cook and be a part of that, especially when you may not even know the person, to me is very cool.

What did you take away from your experience on Top Chef Canada ?

My biggest takeaway is having relationships with chefs from across this country. I had never been to Toronto before going on the show. I didn’t know any chefs from Newfoundland or Montreal. It was a great networking opportunity, and it was amazing how close you became after a short period of time together. The final four of us (John Goodyear, Danny Smiles, Dennis Tay, and I) had been through a lot and we grew pretty close during that time. Sharing bunk beds also helped, ha!

Any little known facts about Top Chef Canada you can share?

When I arrived in Toronto, the first thing they did was take away my phone, wallet, identification, everything! We were completely secluded from the outside world. We were allowed to call home usually once a week, but they would monitor the phone calls. We weren’t allowed to have any books or recipes. Everything had to be in your head. I was given a notebook after I unpacked. After I met everyone, I went back to my room, sat on my bed, and wrote down a bunch of pastry ratios, simple recipes, and stuff like that. I was able to bring that notebook into each challenge. I still have it seven years later.

Why JOEY?

Our aggressive USA expansion I thought was exciting, and I loved the idea of working on multiple brands. I like being able to work on a globally inspired menu, because it means I can cook whatever flavour profile I want! There are no limitations or restrictions. We have an exciting year coming up with new locations in Manhattan Beach, Houston, and Miami. It’s a very exciting time with lots of new dishes on the horizon.

What new dishes are you especially excited about?

The dishes I’m working on at the moment are top secret! Some new additions to our menu that I can tell you about are our ceviche [Japanese style, with prawns, lightly marinated salmon, soy yuzu dressing, mango, and serrano chili]. It’s light, fresh, and I love the flavour of yuzu. It’s definitely something I could eat every day. Our new oven-roasted Wild Pacific cod is great as well. It has a delicious, aromatic curry broth; coconut rice; snap peas; and cauliﬂower.

Do you notice differences in what Vancouver diners want compared to those in other cities like Winnipeg or Seattle?

There are definitely some geographical influences. I notice it more down in the U.S. than in Canada. We have two restaurants in California, for example, that obviously have a different climate and customer base, which we take into consideration. Our locations in Seattle are more similar to Vancouver. As we move across the USA, cultural influences and portion size are things we will need to take into consideration as well. What we may consider a ceviche here on the West Coast might be very different than what someone from Miami might look for, as an example.

When you’re not working, you’re...?

My wife, Amber, and I spend most of our time driving our two boys, Gavin and Benjamin, to sports. They play hockey, soccer, and baseball so it keeps us on our toes! It’s fun, though. I played lots of sports growing up, so I’m getting a taste of what my parents went through.",[]

When Maenam opened in Kits in 2009, the city's food scene was abuzz with excitement. People couldn't wait to get in to try its elevated, modern Thai dishes, from hot and sour soup and chicken satay to lobster clay pot and whole fish. Stocked with ingredients like bamboo, tamarind leaves, Thai basil, galangal, and fish sauce, the kitchen is still directed by executive chef Angus An and his wife, Kate. More than a decade later, they've managed to maintain the high standards of authenticity and quality thay they set out from the get-go.

Now, you can have your go at making things like green papaya salad, pad Thai, Panaeng curry, and coconut shave ice—as well as more challenging items such as squid-ink cupcakes, uni sundae, or coconut-cream relish of fermented pork and spot-prawn tomalley—with Maenam, the cookbook (Appetite by Random House).

An, who also runs Longtail Kitchen, Fat Mao Noodles, Sen Pad Thai, and Freebird Chicken Shack, and who's a partner in Popina Canteen, takes readers on a culinary journey from the busy street-food stalls of Bangkok to the charcoal grills of Chiang Mai in the book (with words and photos by Joie Alvaro Kent and Darren Chuang). If you've been fortunate enough to have visited Thailand and ravenously eaten your way through it, you might find the the country's extraordinary flavours and colourful ingredients coming back to mind in vivid detail; if memories could sizzle, this book would light the flame. An's recollections of travelling throughout his wife's homeland make for delicious reading.

There are some very personal revelations in the book. For instance, An shares how he and Kate opened Maenam only after the heartbreaking closure of their previous restaurant, Gastropod. Despite the latter's acclaim, it simply couldn’t weather the storm of the global recession. That much has long been public knowledge. But we didn't know that those early years at Maenam were hard for An. He struggled emotionally and admits his confidence and passion for cooking hit a low point. Once he was ready to lift himself back up, he became a dedicated student of Thai cuisine. His pursuit of exciting tastes using pure ingredients has been relentless, and his determination to develop his own unique style within one of the world's greatest cuilnary traditions is admirable.

Georgia Straight wine columnist Kurtis Kolt contributes a brief chapter on wine at the Maenam table. Plus, aspiring home cooks will love the How To sections: How to prepare a lobster, source spot prawns, prepare a crab, and shuck an oyster.

Once home to Elephant & Castle, the gorgeous corner space in the iconic 1930 Marine Building is now home to the Donnelly Group’s new Brass Fish Tavern & Kitchen (355 Burrard Street).

The name is a nod to the creatures that adorn the Art Deco building’s entrance.

There really are brass fish on the Art Deco Marine Building. Gail Johnson.

With marine and naval themes influencing the eclectic design, there are 80-year-old signal flags, ships’ banners, and a leather-top bar akin to what you’d find in an officers’ mess. The main floor tavern has banquettes the colour of Pacific giant kelp and circular high-tops custom-designed with trees coming up through the centres. There are multiple screens playing sports; that means a view of one or several TVs from every seat. The mezzanine parlour feels more lounge-y, darker, cozy, and home library-like with low-slung sofas and seats. Then there’s the standalone izakaya, off to the right when you first walk in, a full, real skeleton of a 21-foot juvenile blue whale suspended from above.

Clement Chan is in the house as executive chef. He’s a bright light in the city’s culinary scene. Formerly of Blue Water Café, Chambar (among other spots), and, most recently, Torafuku, the restaurant he cofounded, Chan has been a member of Culinary Team Canada and competed on Top Chef Canada and Chopped Canada. He’s known for playful, textural dishes with bold and inventive pan-Asian flavour combinations.

Chef Kevin Wong, whose resume includes positions in INUA, a Two Michelin star restaurant in Tokyo and at Vancouver’s Le Crocodile, is behind the sushi bar. There, you’ll find nigiri, sashimi, classic and speciality rolls (like silken tofu aburi, pea shoots, torched miso, honey, and yuzu). Goma-ae, torched tofu, seaweed salad, crudo, and other snacks round of the izakaya offerings.

On the modern pub menu, standout items include the ahi tuna sandwich: the barely seared furikake-crusted steak is topped with a seven-spice onion ring, greens, and wasabi mayo. Pumpkin (roasted and pickled), burrata, and beets add heft to miso-dressed arugula sprinkled with quinoa and spiced pumpkin seeds. Balsamic-glazed Brussels sprouts are generously coated with “chorizo streusel”, crispy bits that Chan makes by rendering fat from the spicy sausage.

The wine list is fully B.C., save for Champagne and some sparklers; the province is prominent on the beer list. For cocktails, Trevor Kallies focuses on inventive highballs with ingredients like shiso, turmeric, matcha, bee pollen, and salted mango.

1 of 1 2 of 1

Dennis Peckham has been keeping busy since he joined Fairmont Hotel Vancouver as executive chef of Notch8 Restaurant & Bar last year.

Born in Williams Lake, he graduated from Dubrulle Culinary Institute in Vancouver in 2001 and went on to work at such acclaimed places as Lumiere Restaurant, West Restaurant, and French Laundry, a Michelin Three Star restaurant in California. A fitness enthusiast and dog lover who hosts charity dinners in his own home for the SPCA, he has a penchant for making fresh pasta.

We caught up with the Top Chef Canada competitor (2019) and Chopped Canada champ (2016) to hear more.

How did you end up pursuing a culinary career?

I was working construction in Victoria, and I hated it. I was building scaffolding and I was always wet and cold, and I was terrified of heights. I was laid off one winter, and a buddy was a cook at a private golf course in Victoria. He said ‘why don’t you come wash dishes for a winter?’ It was on the ground and it was inside, so I figured why not?

I really liked the culture of the kitchen. I started doing prep, then I started doing banquet prep, then lunch, and I always had a lot of fun with it. It was my mom who said, ‘Why not go to cooking school?

After working with Thomas Keller at French Laundry, Rob Feenie at Lumiere, and David Hawksworth at West, you landed your first chef job at Hart House. Then you worked at Glowbal Restaurant Group and Sequoia Restaurant Group, among other places. Looking back now, what would you say to your younger chef self?

I thought I was so good, but in hindsight I was so terrible. I was a good cook but a terrible chef. Being a chef is about managing people and running a business and ensuring consistency and making sure the culture is positive and fosters progression and ownership. Cooking is such a small part of what you do as a chef. You teach it, but it’s a lot more about the culture that you bring to the kitchen.

A lot of people complain about staffing issues, but the bottom line is if you give people a reason to stay, they’ll stay.

What was it like competing on Top Chef Canada?

I had applied probably five times in my lifetime; I was like ‘Finally!’. It was a bucket list thing. It was awesome. I loved it. I had so much fun.

You don’t have to worry about anything—staffing, scheduling; nothing. You just have to cook. I’d do it again in a heartbeat. The first time we cooked in the kitchen, I was nervous as hell. But elimination challenges were fine. But don’t try something new. If you don’t know how to make bread, don’t make bread. Ultimately, that’s what sent me home.

What drew you to Notch8?

I had worked at the Fairmont Waterfront before. When I got the call, I had also been working a ton running my own business [Fraiche Street Foods, with his former partner]. I was working 30, 35 hours straight. I was so tired I couldn’t think straight.

I met with the GM and the director of operations [at Fairmont Hotel Vancouver]. I really love the brand, I love the culture of the company, I love the hotels… There wasn’t much to think about.

Everything comes from the restaurant: room service, the lounge, the breakfast buffet, happy hour, afternoon tea, dinner… We describe the style as approachable sophistication. I’m just in the process of launching a new breakfast menu. I just love to cook. I love it here.

Happy Hour tip: Order the beer-battered oyster mushrooms with parmesan dip (also available on the lounge menu); stay for the DJ, who spins twice a week.

What’s this about you making dinner for random strangers in your home to raise funds for the SPCA?

I love making pasta, but I don’t eat it all. I have a freezer full of tortellini. A few months ago, I was at home with my dog [MacGyver, a Doberman pincher] and I wanted to cook five courses of Indian food. Five Indian courses for one person is just such a waste. Why am I doing to cook all day long to eat for three minutes. My friends are super busy. So I thought, I’m going to invite random people off my Instagram page to come over to my house for dinner. The first six people to get back to me and who can show me made a minimum $40 donation to the SPCA can come over to my house and I’ll feed you. You have to be okay with the dog, the house won’t be spotless but it will be clean, and it’s for charity. I went to bed, and the next day 300 people had asked to come to this dinner. The next one is in March. I feel I live a very fortunate life, and I want to support the work they do.

Besides your own home and Notch8, where else can local diners enjoy your food?

I’m at the Greasy Spoon Diner with a Better Life Foundation on Monday (February 24). I’m really looking forward to it. It's really important to me to participate and give back.

Now on its 59th volume, Greasy Spoon diner series benefits A Better Life Foundation’s meal program (in partnership with Atria & BC Housing) and takes place at Save On Meats (43 West Hastings Street).

His three-course menu features My Dad’s Chef Salad with aged cheddar, green goddess dressing, ranch spices, and baby gem lettuce; quiche with chicken liver mousse, bacon glaze, and sherry vinaigrette; and key-lime pie for dessert.

Then for the Vancouver International Wine Festival, I’ll be at the Vintners’ Brunch.

Fresh mint, crisp vegetables, perfectly cooked kebab, and warm pita are all staples in the mouthwatering Persian cuisine served at Cazba Restaurant.

The family-owned establishment’s first location opened on the North Shore more than 15 years ago with the objective of providing comfort and a taste of home to the Persian community. Cazba means “small village”, which is what the restaurant hoped to be for those missing the hospitality and food found in their home country.

Cazba Restaurant was voted “Best Persian Cuisine” in the Straight’s Golden Plates 2020 awards. In addition to its recent win, the restaurant will also be celebrating the opening of three more locations over the next three months.

These will join the seven existing locations where people can get their Persian food fix: the two full-service restaurants (1103 Davie Street in Vancouver and #132–16th Street West in North Vancouver), four food court locations (Capilano Mall, Coquitlam Centre, Lougheed Town Centre, and Brentwood Town Centre), and the food cart.

The Persian eatery focuses on serving authentic and healthy dishes that will keep customers coming back for more. Main courses feature a variety of meat kebabs, such as lamb, chicken, and beef—all accompanied by rice and grilled tomatoes. Other popular menu items enjoyed by carnivores include: koofteh (Persian meatballs) and ghormeh sabzi (herbed stew).

Cazba Restaurant

Cazba Restaurant also offers many options for vegetarians, including veggie wraps, dolmades, oven-baked eggplant, salads, vegetable patties, soups, and homus. Pescatarians can enjoy the salmon entrée that comes partnered with a side of garden-fresh shirazi salad.

A trip to any Cazba location is not complete without dessert. The authentic baklava, bamieh, cream caramel, and Persian ice-cream will leave you feeling pleasantly full—so be sure to wear stretchy pants.

For those who would like to satisfy their fesenjaoon (chicken with pomegranate sauce, walnuts, and rice) craving in the comfort of their own home, Cazba can be ordered through local food delivery services.

Cazba can also provide catering services for work events and parties.

The best way to socialize with friends and family is over an enormous bowl of creamy hummus with pita bread in hand—this can be experienced by ordering in.

This year, Jamjar has more to celebrate than its mouthwatering dishes and ability to facilitate connection between its diners. The eatery scored a noteworthy hat trick in the Straight’s Golden Plates 2020 awards.

Jamjar won “Best Restaurant” in the South Granville neighbourhood and placed in the top two for “Best Lebanese” and “Best Restaurant” along Commercial Drive.

If you aren’t the type to get googly-eyed over a hummus plate, the Lebanese eatery offers plenty of other dishes that will do just that.

You’ll fall in love slowly and then all at once with the perfectly deep-fried cauliflower drizzled in pomegranate molasses.

The pan-seared halloumi cheese and the Fattoush salad will leave you feeling things that you’ve never felt toward food.

You may even become emotionally invested in Jamjar’s chickpea falafel served with tahini dipping sauce.

The menu at Jamjar has delicious options for those who eat gluten-free, vegetarian, or vegan.

Jamjar currently has three fast-casual locations that feature a more concise menu, quick service, and self-seating: 2290 Commercial Drive, #122–125 Victory Ship Way (North Vancouver), and 6035 University Boulevard (UBC).

The Commercial Drive location offers a sit-down experience from 3:30 p.m. to close and the fourth location found in South Granville is Jamjar’s only full-service restaurant. Both destinations are ideal for when guests want to stay longer and order countless share plates.

Two of the locations (Commercial Drive and South Granville) have a Happy Hour menu that is available Monday through Friday from 3:30 to 5:30 p.m. During Happy Hour, the halloumi fries, selected wine, and house beers are on special and guests can also enjoy 20 percent off all regular vegan dinner items.

Vancouver’s residents know that the best places to stuff your face with pasta are found along Commercial Drive—otherwise known as Little Italy.

This neighbourhood is filled with restaurants that believe a well-balanced meal consists of carbs, cheese, and more cheese (we support this). But if you’re craving handmade gnocchi, spaghetti Bolognese, or linguine vongole, you need to visit Marcello’s Ristorante & Pizzeria.

This Italian restaurant simply does not mess around when it comes to fresh, housemade pasta and sauces.

It’s hard to walk by the popular eatery without noticing the sheer number of customers dining and the long lineups outside. The restaurant’s wood-fired oven functions as both a cooker and a piece of art for diners to admire.

This year, Straight readers voted Marcello’s Ristorante & Pizzeria third in the category of “Best Pasta” in the Golden Plates 2020 awards. We can guess this probably has something to do with its mouthwatering four-cheese gnocchi.

Marcello's Ristorante & Pizzeria

Growing up in Palermo, Italy, chef Marcello discovered his passion for cooking at the age of eight. After professional training in Milan and owning a restaurant along the Adriatic Sea, Marcello felt that it was time to share his Italian food with Vancouver. The doors of his establishment at 1404 Commercial Drive first opened in 1999.

Marcello takes immense pride in the consistency of his recipes but also enjoys surprising the restaurant’s faithful customers. “I occasionally cook some Italian specialty dishes that we don’t have on the menu,” he says, “like cinghiale with polenta, Nero di seppia ai frutti di mare, chicken or veal Milanese.”

Creating extraordinary dishes allows Marcello to showcase his affinity for cooking while impressing restaurantgoers. If you prefer sticking to classic Italian dishes, the spaghetti puttanesca and pizza margherita will leave you wishing for leftovers the following evening at home.

Should you ever find yourself longing for a large bowl of creamy linguine carbonara, the friendly staff at Marcello’s Ristorante & Pizzeria will have you covered.

If you are hosting an upcoming corporate lunch, baby shower, birthday party, or wedding reception, you’re likely overwhelmed with planning. Between coordinating the guest list and balloon arrangements, there’s little time left to prepare elegant canapés, let alone an entire meal.

Savoury Chef can take some stress off of your plate by bringing a delicious culinary experience (and even stuffed peppadews) to your event.

Vancouver-based Savoury Chef was honoured with “Best Catering Company” in this year’s Golden Plates awards, which are voted on by readers of the Georgia Straight. The company’s recent successes can be attributed to the passionate catering team of executive chef Geoff Rogers and owner Anna Wallner. The two have often been publicly recognized from their past endeavors.

Wallner formerly produced and cohosted the popular television series The Shopping Bags and later Anna & Kristina’s Grocery Bag, a cookbook testing show. This is when she decided to focus her next venture squarely on food.

Rogers was once a contestant on Top Chef Canada and has perfected his culinary expertise by leading culinary teams at Fable and Blacktail in Vancouver and River Café in Calgary.

Savoury Chef can brighten up any event with its chef stations, multicourse plated menus, dessert buffets, family-style menus, and barbecues.

Clients can also order the late-night snack menu for their event, which includes a scrumptious macaroni and cheese bar—with three cheese sauce, pasta, bread crumbs, bacon bits, hot sauce, smoked tofu, broccoli, cherry tomatoes, and pickled jalapeños.

If you aren’t drooling yet, the same menu also includes sliders and a poutine bar. This will be very popular with guests who’ve danced up an appetite.

Those with a sweet tooth will enjoy the goodies found on the dessert menu: handcrafted macarons, salted chocolate tarts, mini opera cakes, and blueberry cheesecake tarts—to name a few.

Savoury Chef also offers bar service—clients can select beer and wine, cocktails, punches, and non-alcoholic beverages to be served at their event. Coffee enthusiasts will appreciate the company’s espresso bar option.

Along with creating edible masterpieces with fresh and local ingredients, Savoury Chef provides superior customer service at every event. Professionalism and the team’s dedication to quality have given the catering company an impeccable reputation.

We’ve heard a lot over the last few years about online grocery shopping but believe it or not, it’s been available in Vancouver before YouTube, Facebook, or even Y2K.

Imagine being back in 1999 listening to Backstreet Boys, hearing the familiar “uh oh” from your ICQ messenger and ordering your groceries online.

For this, we have local grocery legend Stong’s Market to thank for being one of the OGs in grocery delivery, not just in Vancouver but in all of North America. Mind you, it was 1999 so the Internet and websites were a bit more primitive back then. But it got the job done and for a lot of people became a life saver when they couldn’t leave the house.

Being the go-to neighbourhood grocery store has always meant being closely connected to the community for Stong’s Market and that’s why its Online School Rebate program has been a great way for the local schools to raise some extra funds. All online grocery customers are given the option to donate four percent of their order total to a local school.

Other than being the pioneer of online grocery shopping, Stong’s Market is also known for its extensive selection of gourmet, natural, and organic products. The grocer understands the importance of supporting local businesses so shoppers can often find unique items from small suppliers down every aisle.

This means that the market carries tons of specialty vegan and gluten-free products. Lovers of plant-based foods can order vegan pies, Miyoko’s and Parmela cheeses, and every flavour of oat milk imaginable, online and in stores.

It’s no surprise why a small two-store operation like Stong’s Market has been able to go toe-to-toe with some of the Goliaths that have moved into the online grocery game these days. Vancouverites and especially Georgia Straight readers love to support local businesses and for that, Stong’s says “thank you for continuing to support your local grocer.”

This year, Stong’s Market placed within the top three in the category of “Best Grocery Delivery” in the Straight’s Golden Plates 2020 awards, which are voted on by readers.

Stong’s Market offers daily delivery to Vancouver and North Vancouver and offers weekly delivery to residents of Bowen Island.

All items available for online grocery delivery can be found .

All online orders must be a minimum of $50 before taxes, fees, and delivery charges. Stong’s Market currently charges $10.99 for delivery to Vancouver, North Vancouver, and West Vancouver. To have groceries delivered to Bowen Island, it will cost $14.99.

If you were braising racks of lamb with cherry reduction while your friends lived off of Kraft Dinner, you should consider attending Vancouver’s top culinary school.

This year, Vancouver Community College (VCC) won the title of “Best Professional Culinary School” in the Golden Plates 2020 awards. But the local college is no stranger to victory. VCC has been repeatedly honoured in the Straight’s annual Best of Vancouver and Golden Plates awards, which are chosen by the paper’s readers.

That’s because its culinary program gives students the opportunity to learn advanced techniques and theory from professional chefs while using innovative cooking technology.

Some of these modern kitchen tools include the DJ Food Décor Turntable for plating, the PolyScience Smoking Gun for infusing dishes with smoky flavours, and pressure-cooking machines.

Graduates from VCC culinary arts leave with plenty of experience when it comes to both casual and fine dining. This means that they’re able to make a delicious thin crust pizza but also a fancy chicken cordon bleu. The school also offers programs for those specifically interested in baking and pastry art.

Culinary students host the popular Chef’s Table Dinner Series, which occurs a few times throughout the year with ticket sales available to the public. During the exciting event, students prepare a five-course fixed menu with wine pairings for a group of 20 guests in VCC’s full-service on-campus restaurant – JJ’s. This provides students with kitchen experience in a restaurant setting to ensure that they feel confident entering the workforce as trained chefs.

With highly regarded faculty members and state-of-the-art kitchens, VCC’s culinary school is where the next generation of talented chefs gets their start.

Something truly magical happens when you’re handed a double scoop cup or cone filled with gelato from Mario’s Gelati. Whether it’s milk-based gelato or dairy-free sorbetto—both versions of the frozen dessert work the same wonders.

The family-owned business placed within the top three in the category of “Best Gelato” in the Golden Plates 2020 awards, which are voted on by readers of the Georgia Straight.

Mario’s Gelati is served at Amato Gelato, located at 88 East 1st Avenue in Vancouver.

Mario’s Gelati was the first company in North America to introduce plant-based gelato back in 1983. The passionate team of “gelaticians” had aspirations to share the creamy, frosty dessert with everyone despite their dietary restrictions. This led to their impressive creation of soy-based tofulati.

For the people who love nothing more than gorging on a pint of traditional gelato, Mario’s Gelati offers tasty like white chocolate raspberry, chocolate pistachio marble, and cappuccino. Of course, the shop serves all of the classics too: cookies and cream, pistachio, mint chocolate chip, stracciatella, and vanilla bean.

Chocolate lovers will appreciate the chocolate peanut butter, hedgehog (chocolate hazelnut), and double chocolate flavours.

Mario’s Gelati also offers fruit-based sorbetto, including mango, pineapple, and strawberry, for customers who prefer their Italian ice-cream to be extra refreshing. These flavours will send you on a sunny tropical vacation with each spoonful.

With 72 rotating variations of gelati on display, everyone is sure to find a scoop (or several) that can satisfy their sweet tooth.

Mario’s Gelati also makes tubs, gelato bars, dairy-free calipops (kid-approved), biscotto gelato sandwiches, and mini cups. All of these can be enjoyed at home where you can shamelessly rock a chocolate moustache.

Customers can lean on the product consultants when they’re having trouble finding the required ingredients for the cocktail recipes found in the company’s online and in-store magazine . Product consultants can also be of great help when you need to find the haziest IPA for your significant other’s birthday.

The team members at each location can also point out the products that are on sale and featured in the monthly .

COLD ZONES, found at many locations, are always stocked with chilled domestic and imported beers, ciders, wine, and bubbly. This means that you’ll never have to drink a room temperature beer again, even if you’re in a rush.

Customers can visit BC Liquor Stores locations for a variety of special events like product tastings and special releases only available at BC Liquor Stores —there’s an upcoming Bordeaux release in September and a premium spirit release in November.

Finances cause the most stress for Canadians, but personal health is becoming more worrisome during the COVID-19 pandemic.

According to an FP Canada survey conducted by Leger in May, 49 per cent of Canadians have lost sleep over financial stress. Such worries are slightly more prominent among younger Canadians and women. But these figures are in line with similar surveys conducted in 2018 (48 per cent) and 2014 (53 per cent).

Despite the economic impacts of COVID-19, which brought the unemployment rate to an all-time high in May, more or less the same amount of people are losing sleep over bills and job instability.

Personal health is a growing concern

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected what some Canadians say cause the most stress: 38 per cent say money is the primary factor, less people than in 2018 (42 per cent) and 2014 (41 per cent).

At the same time, 25 per cent say that personal health is what causes them the most stress, more than the 22 per cent and 19 per cent who gave the same response in 2018 and 2014, respectively. Respondents who stressed about personal health skewed older.

The Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) and research company Delvinia have been conducting regular surveys checking in on mental health during the pandemic. The most recent found that 19.5 per cent among Canadians experience moderate-to-severe anxiety; 26.6 per cent have engaged in binge drinking; and 21 per cent feel lonely. Another 18.4 per cent have felt depressed.

Meanwhile, 46.1 per cent of Canadians suffering from anxiety are very worried about finances, with an additional 16.1 per cent being somewhat worried. Meanwhile, 37.3 per cent of those respondents were very worried about themselves or somewhat close to them getting infected with COVID-19, with another 17.5 per cent remaining somewhat worried.

The government of Canada has a page dedicated to taking care of physical and mental health while coping with COVID-19-related stress. On top of providing links to emergency and support resources, the site recommends mindfulness activities like stretching, meditating and taking deep breaths, as well as eating healthy, regular exercise and trying to get plenty of sleep.",[]

The COVID-19 pandemic has been the catalyst for more than 80 wealthy people to sign a letter calling on the super-rich to pay more taxes.

In an open letter, a group called Millionaires for Humanity urge governments to implement these hikes immediately, substantially, and permanently.

""As Covid-19 strikes the world, millionaires like us have a critical role to play in healing our world,"" the letter states. ""No, we are not the ones caring for the sick in intensive care wards. We are not driving the ambulances that will bring the ill to hospitals. We are not restocking grocery store shelves or delivering food door to door.

""But we do have money, lots of it. Money that is desperately needed now and will continue to be needed in the years ahead, as our world recovers from this crisis.""

There are three Canadian signatories: Barbara Clayton, Claire Trottier, and Sylvie Trottier. Most of the rest are Americans.

The Trottiers are directors of the Montreal-based Trottier Family Foundation and daughters of Lorne Trottier, cofounder of Matrox, which produces video card components and equipment for computers.

Their philanthropic gifts include funding the Trottier Observatory at Simon Fraser University.

Sylvie Trottier is a climate change analyst who once worked as coordinator of scientific content for the David Suzuki Foundation. Claire Trottier is an assistant professor in the department of microbiology and immunology at McGill University.

""The impact of this crisis will last for decades,"" their letter states. ""It could push half a billion more people into poverty. Hundreds of millions of people will lose their jobs as businesses close, some permanently.

""Already, there are nearly a billion children out of school, many with no access to the resources they need to continue their learning. And of course the absence of hospital beds, protective masks, and ventilators is a painful, daily reminder of the inadequate investment made in public health systems across the world.

""The problems caused by, and revealed by, Covid-19 can’t be solved with charity, no matter how generous. Government leaders must take the responsibility for raising the funds we need and spending them fairly. We can ensure we adequately fund our health systems, schools, and security through a permanent tax increase on the wealthiest people on the planet, people like us.""

The signatories state that they ""owe a huge debt"" to frontline workers, most of whom they say are ""grossly underpaid for the burden they carry"".

""At the vanguard of this fight are our health care workers, 70 percent of whom are women,"" they write. ""They confront the deadly virus each day at work, while bearing the majority of responsibility for unpaid work at home.

""The risks these brave people willingly embrace every day in order to care for the rest of us requires us to establish a new, real commitment to each other and to what really matters.""

They close their letter by stating that unlike tens of millions of people around the world, they don't have to worry about losing their jobs, homes, or ability to support their families.

""We are not fighting on the frontlines of this emergency and we are much less likely to be its victims,"" they note.



""So please. Tax us. Tax us. Tax us. It is the right choice. It is the only choice. Humanity is more important than our money.""",[]

The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to the loss of about 400,000 jobs in British Columbia in March and April.

But in June as the economy continued to recover and B.C. entered the third phase of its restart plan, an additional 118,100 new jobs were created in the province.

The greatest gains by far were on the services-producing sector, led by accommodation and food services (54,800); professional, scientific, and technical services (17,600); and wholesale and retail trade (14,100).

B.C.'s unemployment rate fell from 13.4 percent in May to 13 percent in June.

Among 15- to 24-year-olds, however, the jobless rate rose from 28.9 percent to 29.1 percent over the same period.

The unemployment rate for women 25 years of age and older in B.C. last month was 11.4 percent, compared to 9.3 percent among men in that age bracket.

In the goods-producing sector, there were 8,200 more construction jobs, 1,200 more natural-resources jobs, and 900 more utilities jobs in B.C. last month.

However, employment fell by 6,800 in manufacturing and 400 in agriculture in the province in June.

The chattering classes are in an uproar.

A social enterprise called ME to WE, which funds WE Charity, paid Justin Trudeau's mother, Margaret Trudeau, $312,000 for 28 speaking events, according to Canadaland.

That included a 20 percent commission for her speaking agency.

In addition, Trudeau's brother, Alexandre, collected $40,000 for eight events, minus the 20 percent commission. And Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, wife of the prime minister, received a $1,500 fee to appear at one of the charity's events in 2012, according to CBC News.

Meanwhile, it's been widely reported that Trudeau participated in a cabinet discussion about granting WE Charity a $19-million contract to oversee a new student-volunteer program costing nearly $1 billion.

The Trudeau family's long association with the WE Charity has triggered an investigation by federal ethics watchdog Mario Dion.

This isn't the first time Trudeau has been enmeshed in controversy in connection with speaking fees.

Before he became leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Trudeau charged $277,000 to speak to 27 groups, including registered charities, while he was a member of Parliament.

These included a $20,000 stipend from the Canadian Mental Health Association and $10,000 from the Children of Hope.

In the past, Trudeau has demonstrated a remarkable ability to surf through controversies that might sink an ordinary member of Parliament.

He's twice been found guilty of violating the federal conflict-of-interest legislation, yet still managed to win a fairly strong minority government in the 2019 election. Calling an MP a ""piece of shit"" in Parliament didn't prevent him from becoming Liberal leader.

Trudeau even survived after hiding that he had worn blackface on at least three occasions.

This time, however, things may not work out nearly as well.

That's because scandals have traditionally taken a greater toll on politicians during hard economic times, when voters tend to be much grumpier.

COVID-19 has walloped the country to its foundations, killing more than 8,000 Canadians, causing a massive contraction in output, and sending the unemployment rate to a record level in May.

Statisics Canada reported this morning that nearly one million jobs were created in June, pushing the national unemployment rate down from 13.7 percent to 12.3 percent.

From 1973 to 1974 during the most famous scandal in U.S. history—Watergate—the economy was mired in inflation and stagnant growth.

This was caused in part by skyrocketing oil prices due to the first Arab oil embargo, but also by then president Richard Nixon's decision to take the U.S. dollar off the gold standard in 1971.

Continuing the Vietnam War also took a toll on U.S. government finances.

Yahoo business writer Myles Udland pointed out in 2017 that from the beginning of 1973 to Nixon's resignation on August 9, 1974, the S&P 500 stock index tumbled by around 50 percent.

And a two-bit hotel break-in during the Democratic national convention ended up creating a political uproar of monumental proportions, sinking the president of the United States.

Brian Mulroney (right) saw his popularity crash in the early 1990s following a serious recession.

Shades of Mulroney?

More recently, there was a Canadian parallel to Trudeau's predicament.

Former Progressive Conservative prime minister Brian Mulroney was reelected in 1988, despite presiding over a scandal-plagued government.

The economy was in decent shape. But by the recession of the early 1990s, triggered by high interest rates, Mulroney's popularity was plummeting.

His approval rating eventually fell to the lowest of any Canadian prime minister—around 11 percent—in the history of these polls.

This came as the public chafed over the new Goods and Services Tax, as well as a litany of scandals.

In 1991, Canada's gross domestic product shrank by 2.09 percent in 1991. The economy grew by an anemic 0.9 percent the following year.

On February 24, 1993, Mulroney resigned rather than face voters in a third general election. Later that year, Mulroney's party was reduced to two seats in Parliament as Jean Chrétien's Liberaals won a landslide victory.

The Liberals then ruled until 2006. They survived the 2004 election with a minority of seats, despite the Sponsorship Scandal, in a year when the gross domestic product rose by 3.1 percent. High commodity prices likely kept Paul Martin in power.

In early 2006, the Martin government was defeated after a year in which the economy grew by 3.2 percent.

Then RCMP commissioner Giuliano Zaccardelli helped Conservative Stephen Harper become prime minister by disclosing in the midst of the campaign that there was a criminal investigation the leak of tax changes around income trusts. No wrongdoing was ever found in connection with the then Liberal finance minister, Ralph Goodale.

It's worth noting that Harper was ousted from power in the same year, 2015, that Canada's economy registered tepid 0.69 percent growth.

Prior to this year, that was the worst on record since 2009 recession following a global economic meltdown.

There may be many reasons why contemporary pundits may think Teflon Trudeau will likely ride out WE Charity scandal.

He's managed to survive previous conflicts of interest.

His immediate family—i.e. himself and his wife—did not pocket vast sums of money.

And as prime minister, he can exert tremendous control over his caucus.

But this time around, Trudeau doesn't have an iron grip on parliamentary committees because he's heading a minority government. They can make life miserable for him.

And perhaps worst of all for his political prospects, the Canadian economy is in the tank.

If history offers any lessons, this means that the WE affair could pose a far greater threat to Trudeau's prime ministership than his previous scandals.",[]

1 of 4 2 of 4

The first quarter of 2020 was very good for Canada’s largest grocery and pharmacy conglomerate, Loblaw Companies Limited.

Revenue in the first three months of the year reached $11.8 billion, up 10.7 percent from the same period one year earlier. Earnings before income taxes, depreciation, and amortization were up 12.4 percent, to $1.17 billion.

One factor has been its “omnichannel approach” to reaching customers. It sells groceries through a long list of retailers, including T & T, Real Canadian Superstore, Loblaws City Market, Wholesale Club, and Shoppers Drug Mart.

Loblaw also has more than 600 franchise stores under banners such as No Frills, Provigo, Valu-mart, and others.

It’s one reason why the family that oversees this empire, the Westons, is worth US$8.2 billion, according to Forbes magazine.

British Columbia–based food giants are also trying to reach customers in a multitude of ways.

The Jim Pattison Group’s grocery banners, for example, include Save-On-Foods, Urban Fare, Meinhardt Fine Foods, Nesters Market, PriceSmart Foods, and Choices Markets. Collectively, they attract two million visits per week.

Loblaw and Pattison also have their own in-store brands offered in their outlets.

Flooding the community with different grocery outlets in many locations is a way for Canadian companies to remain competitive against such American goliaths as Walmart, Costco, and Amazon, which now owns Whole Foods Market.

Georgia Main Food Group, controlled by Vancouver’s Louie family, operates IGA and Fresh St. Market.

Loblaw considers No Frills grocery stores to be franchises, which are named after the person in charge of each outlet. Charlie Smith

Union takes Sobeys to B.C. LRB

But when the Nova Scotia–based supermarket giant Sobeys Inc. embarked on an omnichannel approach in B.C., it ran into opposition from a former Safeway cashier who is now president of UFCW 1518.

Last year, Kim Novak became the first woman to head the 101-year-old union local, which represents more than 20,000 workers in a wide range of industries.

Since taking office, she’s been battling Sobeys after it shut down several Safeway stores and rebranded them as FreshCo franchises with different collective agreements.

“We recognize that diversifying a business and being able to increase business and market share is a good thing,” Novak told the Straight by phone. “It’s also a good thing for our members because it allows those businesses to be able to bring in more customers.

""Where we have a major issue is when doing so, you’re undercutting wages and benefits by reducing what people would be paid by decreasing the ability of them to access full-time jobs.”

Because the FreshCo stores are considered independent by Sobeys, Novak said that UFCW 1518 has to negotiate separate contracts with each store.

According to Novak, an arbitrated first contract gave starting FreshCo workers a rate only slightly higher than the minimum wage.

“At Safeway, you have access to hours in classifications that allows you to be able to work your way up a wage scale, whereas at FreshCo that’s not the case,” she said.

UFCW 1518 has filed applications to the B.C. Labour Relations Board seeking to have Sobeys and seven FreshCo franchisees declared a “common employer” with a single bargaining unit.

The union has argued that Sobeys spent millions of dollars converting former Safeway outlets into FreshCo stores in B.C., and that Sobeys hired and trained the workers at FreshCo stores.

“UFCW 1518 expects that there is very strong financial and contractual control by Sobeys over the franchisees and the employees at the store,” the union wrote in its application.

Novak said the union hopes to obtain documents through the disclosure process to support its position that Sobeys is the true employer.

If UFCW 1518 succeeds with its argument, it could have ramifications on other grocery chains, including Loblaw, which maintains that its No Frills discount stores are franchises. Sobeys also owns Thrifty Foods, which is a large supermarket chain on Vancouver Island.

None of the Canadian corporations mentioned in this article, including Sobeys, agreed to the Straight’s request for an interview by deadline.

Dalhouse University professor Sylvain Charlebois says the COVID-19 pandemic has complicated the business environment for grocers.

COVID-19 causes a major shakeup

Sylvain Charlebois, a Dalhousie University professor and food-distribution researcher, is one of Canada’s leading authorities on food policies.

In a phone interview with the Straight, he said that COVID-19 has upset the applecart, so to speak, because it is accelerating grocery chains’ adoption of e-commerce to retain market share.

Seattle-based Amazon, of course, is the market leader in this regard. And when it bought Whole Foods Markets for US$13.4 billion in 2017, it served as a wake-up call to the Canadian grocery sector.

But Charlebois pointed out that online selling also makes it possible for everyone across the supply chain, including farmers, to reach buyers.

“Pepsico is doing it,” Charlebois noted. “Saputo is doing it. Gordon…Sysco, you name it—they’ve all decided to sell directly to consumers.”

The professor also pointed out that real estate is undergoing a major transition due to the pandemic.

Working at home has become a legitimate option for large numbers of people. He suggested that this might even cause more people to leave cities and live in suburbs.

“That will have a huge impact on where grocery stores are actually going to be located,” he said. “You want to reconfigure your e-commerce strategy based on where people are.”

So even though the Canadian grocery chains may now seem flush with cash, there’s no guarantee that they’ll all thrive in the future.

“There are so many things in flux right now,” Charlebois said. “It’s very difficult to understand what’s happening.

“But I would say, right now, the omni-channel approach is becoming more popular,” he continued. “Getting to the consumer in many different ways is going to be a value strategy moving forward.”

This isn't just an issue for the supermarket giants.

Smaller B.C. players—such as Donald's Market and Fruiticana—are also fighting to maintain their market share in an era when groceries are being sold by everyone from Dollarama to HMart.

Video of Omnichannel: Retail (R)evolution | Kilian Wagner | TEDxHSG Video: Swiss eyewear entrepreneur Kilian Wagner explained in a 2017 TEDx Talk why retailers are embracing an omnichannel approach.

Workers lose pandemic premium

In the meantime, however, the unions aren't happy that grocery giants recently did away with giving workers an extra $2 per hour pandemic premium.

Some of them appeared before a House of Commons committee on July 6 to tell MPs that some workers have died of COVID-19. Two more recently tested positive in Windsor.

Novak said that prior to the pandemic, people often looked upon going to the grocery store as a mindless pastime at the end of their day, without fully recognizing the workers who made all of this possible.

That's changed in recent months for many Canadians.

Nowadays, she noted, grocery workers have to remain up to date with health protocols to keep themselves and customers safe.

""I think that we, as a society, have underestimated how important that work is,"" Novak said.",[]

The ElectraMeccanica zero-emission Solo is still a rare sight in Vancouver.

That's because only 64 of these one-seat electric-vehicle prototypes had been built by mid-March, when the pandemic started causing economic chaos.

But the Vancouver-based company's share price has recently been on a tear.

On July 2, ElectraMeccanica closed at US$3.13 on NASDAQ after peaking at US$3.55 on the day. In after-hours trading, the stock climbed to US$3.32.

A Solo appeared on the Georgia Straight cover in April.

There was exceptionally heavy volume, with nearly 130 million shares changing hands. The market capitalization stands at US$197.1 million.

The current share price is nearly double the June 11 closing price of US$1.58 when 11.6 million shares were exchanged.

On June 12, the designer and manufacturer of three-wheeled vehicles announced that it had raised US$20 million in a recent offering of 10,000 common shares at $2 per share.

Four days later, ElectraMeccanica revealed that it plans to open new retail locations for the Solo EV at Scottsdale Fashion Square in Arizona and later in Portland, Oregon.

That will be in addition to its Los Angeles showroom at Westfield Century City.

“Our updated plan to open new direct-to-consumer retail locations at high-traffic retail centers in EV-friendly cities provides a unique opportunity for potential customers to learn more about ElectraMeccanica and the Solo,"" CEO Paul Rivera said.

The Solo has a manufacturer's suggested retail price of $18,500 and it travels 160 kilometres without recharging. The EV reaches a top speed of 128 kilometres per hour, powered by a liquid-cooled motor.

The narrow rear end of the Solo is supported by only one wheel. Charlie Smith

In the first quarter of 2020, ElectraMeccanica posted an operating loss $6.9 million, a net loss of $1.9 million, and revenues of $116,813.

As Canada’s apparel industry attempts to recover from the economic impact of the pandemic, another Canadian clothing retailer is seeking creditor protection.

On June 22, Modasuite, the parent company for Frank and Oak, filed a notice under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. KPMG has been appointed as a trustee.

Modasuite owed approximately $19 million to creditors, as of June 22.

Montreal’s Ethan Song and Hicham Ratani originally launched the men’s and women’s clothing company as an online business in 2012 but expanded by opening 19 physical locations in Quebec, Ontario, Alberta, and B.C., which include one in Gastown in Vancouver and another at Metrotown in Burnaby.

The stores had reopened on June 1 with health measures in place, after being closed during the pandemic. The company reportedly has approximately 350 part-time and full-time employees.

After almost a century in business, Montreal-based Reitmans (Canada) announced in May that it would be filing for protection under Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act.

Reitmans issued a news release on June 1 that announced its restructuring plans, which includes permanently shutting down 54 Thyme Maternity stores on July 18 and 77 Addition Elle stores on August 15, and reducing its workforce by about 1,400 employees.

Hollywood has made its share of films linked to lawsuits.

In Erin Brockovich, the namesake of the film, played by Julia Roberts, took on Pacific Gas and Electric Company.

Bombshell featured Gretchen Carlson, played by Nicole Kidman, suing former FOX News boss Roger Ailes.

But there has never been a film in which one corporate moviehouse files the mother of all lawsuits against another corporate moviehouse after a takeover fell through.

That's the reality, however, for Ellis Jacob, the longtime CEO of Toronto-based CIneplex.

Today, his company filed documents in an Ontario court today seeking $2.18 billion in damages from U.K.-based Cineworld and its Canadian affiliate, 1232743 B.C. Ltd.. This was prompted by Cineworld backing out of a deal to buy Cineplex for $34 per share.

That $2.18-billion figure would be reduced by the value of Cineplex's securities, but the Canadian company wants its $664 million in debt and transaction costs compensated.

CIneplex shares closed today at $8.50 on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

""Cineplex claims that Cineworld breached its contractual obligations and its duty of good faith and honesty in contractual performance,"" Cineplex stated. ""Cineworld purports to rely upon alleged adverse impacts of COVID-19 on Cineplex’s business to terminate the Arrangement, which it is not entitled to do.

""The contractual agreements between the parties expressly exclude outbreaks of illness, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, as a circumstance entitling Cineworld to terminate the Arrangement,"" Cineplex continued. ""Without any legal right to avoid its contractual obligations, Cineworld intentionally chose to breach its obligations, including its obligation to seek timely regulatory approval for the Arrangement under the Investment Canada Act.""

None of Cineplex's allegations have been proven in court.

For its part, Cineworld denied Cineplex's claims on June 12, accusing the Canadian company of ""unwillingness to cure the breaches"" related to the acquisition.

In addition, Cineworld stated last month that it has ""reserved the right to seek damages from Cineplex"".",[]

Andrew Sorfleet has a long history of advocacy for sex workers.

He spent about 10 years as an organizer with the Sex Workers Alliance of Vancouver. Then he, along with other sex workers, created the Committee to Unite Prostitutes, but they felt that it didn’t have sufficient legitimacy because it wasn’t registered.

So in 2012, they formed the Triple-X Workers’ Solidarity Association of B.C.

“I believe we became the very first labour-oriented registered sex-worker organization in Canada,” Sorfleet recently told the Straight by phone.

They modelled their organization on the Union of B.C. Performers, which also represents members who sometimes compete with one another for work.

Triple-X has a board of directors, including a treasurer and secretary, and Sorfleet is its president.

Their goals include combatting discrimination against Triple-X members and increasing their pay. The organization also aims to enhance Triple-X workers’ job satisfaction and advocate for better jobs in the sex industry.

It’s open to anyone in the sex industry who has received financial remuneration for sexual stimulation within the previous six months. “That can involve touch or no touch,” Sorfleet said.

Triple-X obtained a certification of registration of trademarks from Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada. According to Sorfleet, this means the group can license its trademark to members after it creates standards—i.e., education and a test— to provide “protection appropriate to the service”.

“They could use this in their advertising,” Sorfleet said. “That would tell clients and anyone else who’s poking around that these people belong to a professional association or a union and that their services are provided safely.”

But the former Conservative government got in the way of Triple-X’s efforts to organize sex workers and help them make decisions about how to improve their lives.

As justice minister in 2014, Peter MacKay introduced amendments to the Criminal Code of Canada to clamp down on the sex industry through the Protection of Communities and Exploited Persons Act.

It outlawed the advertising or purchase of sexual services, even if this was between consenting adults. And it imposed severe restrictions on obtaining material benefits from the sale of sexual services.

“It means we are prohibited from collecting annual membership dues and we’re prohibited from recruiting new members because we would most definitely be counselling and encouraging people to work in the sex industry,” Sorfleet said. “So it stands right in the way of sex workers being able to form their own association.”

That, he declared, is unconstitutional because the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees freedom of association.

The Vancouver Queer Film Festival has released a robust lineup spanning movies from as far away as India and Georgia, as it moves to a digital format for its 11-day celebration. The theme? ""Still Here.""

The event runs August 13 to 23, with more than 60 films from 10 countries in its 32nd annual offering. The program also includes virtual visits from filmmakers, local directors, and local artists, as well as virtual parties and post-screening Q&As.

Festival passes and tickets are available here.

Curated by artistic director Anoushka Ratnarajah, the fest opens with director Elegance Bratton’s Pier Kids, a raw and affecting guerilla-style documentary that follows the life of Black trans woman Crystal LaBeija and other queer and trans youth of colour at the Christopher Street Pier in New York City. Filmmaker Elegance Bratton, himself queer and African-American, will be joining the fest at a virtual Q&A along with producer Chester Algernal Gordon.

The VQFF will also feature two special presentations of queer women’s history: Ahead of the Curve, a documentary about the history of Curve Magazine, the longest running lesbian publication in history; and Long Time Comin’, Dionne Brand’s 1993 documentary that charts the work of two Black queer Canadian artists--folk/jazz singer-songwriter Faith Nolan and multimedia visual artist Grace Channer. It will be followed by a panel of local Black queer femme activists, scholars, and activists.

Elsewhere, the Coast is Queer returns, spotlighting the work of emerging and established local queer filmmakers. And international programming spans A Worm In The Heart, a documentary shot in six cities along the Trans-Siberian Railway and capturing the stories of the LGBTQ community facing oppressive laws across Russia, Mongolia, and China, as well as Vietnam's Goodbye Mother, a family dramedy.",[]

It’s not only used cars that are in demand these days.

With people choosing to drive due to health concerns related to traveling by public transit because of COVID-19, sales of new automobiles are also rising.

Although sales are below last year’s numbers, transactions have picked from lows during the pandemic lockdown.

Figures released by Statistics Canada show that new car sales declined 47.2 percent year over year in May 2020.

However, sales are “recovering slightly from the 74.6% and 48.5% declines in April and March respectively”.

“Dealership showrooms began re-opening in May amid the COVID-19 pandemic, though physical distancing measures were put into place, such as limiting the number of customers in the showrooms at a time,” according to the federal statistics agency.

Moreover, “Physically distant options continue to be available to Canadians as an alternative to face-to-face interactions for new motor vehicle purchases.”

Figures released Wednesday (July 15) indicate that sales of trucks declined 43.5 percent year over year in May.

This is an improvement from the 71.8 percent and 45.5 percent declines in April and March 2020, respectively.

Trucks cover light trucks, heavy trucks, and buses.

“Sales of passenger cars (-56.5%) also saw a smaller decline than in April (-82.8%) and March (-57.8%),” according to Statistics Canada.

In June this year, TD Economics released a report titled The Right Direction, Slowly: An Update on Canadian Spending Patterns.

According to this report, resales of secondhand cars “may be benefitting from demand related to potential concerns about being in close proximity to others on public transit”.

This “shift towards personal transportation has been observed in other countries in response to the pandemic”, according to the TD Economics report.

Also last June, TransLink indicated that transit ridership may remain below pre-COVID-19 levels because of health concerns and cheap gas.

“There is a risk that previous regular transit users will start making more of their trips instead by automobile for understandable reasons, and that these habits will stick post-pandemic,” Geoff Cross, vice president for transportation planning and policy with the regional transit authority, wrote in a report.",[]

1 of 1 2 of 1

Of all the public health measures in place to protect people from COVID-19, one in particular has horrendous potential consequences for the environment.

Along with the pandemic has come a surge in use of single-use plastic bags, cups, straws, and utensils. Surfrider Foundation Canada regional coordinator Lilly Woodbury, however, says it’s a misconception that disposable goods are safer than reusables.

A recent statement signed by more than 125 health and science experts from 18 countries backs up her position. Published by Greenpeace USA and UPSTREAM (which are both members of the Break Free Plastic movement), the letter states reusable products can be used safely during the pandemic by employing basic hygiene.

“The promotion of unnecessary single-use plastics to decrease exposure to the coronavirus negatively impacts the environment, water systems, and potential food supply compared to the safe use of reusable bags, containers, and utensils,” wrote Mark Miller, former director of research at the National Institutes of Health’s Fogarty International Center, in the June 22 statement.

The statement came together following pauses on plastic bans around the world. The City of Vancouver has suspended education, outreach, and enforcement related to its Zero Waste 2040/ Single-Use Item Reduction Strategy until further notice.

“Many businesses, from independent-owned to massive multinational corporations like Starbucks, will not accept any type of reusable vessel despite the scientific evidence that proves reusables do not pose a threat for spreading the virus,” Woodbury tells the Straight. “Disposable items that are used once and then discarded have created a panoply of problems: filling up landfills, polluting oceans and freshwater ecosystems, threatening biodiversity, as well as contributing to the climate crisis as all plastics produced contribute to greenhouse gas emissions.

“Despite what plastic lobby groups are stating, plastics do not safeguard public health,” she says. “Plastics are a threat to both the health of humans and the planet.”

The June 22 statement’s signatories and Surfrider Foundation Canada (which, like its U.S. parent, Surfrider Foundation, aims to protect oceans and beaches through an activist network) say the plastics industry is capitalizing on the pandemic-era shift to disposables while demonizing reusables.

In a letter to the secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services earlier this year, Tony Radoszewski, head of the Plastics Industry Association, asked the federal body to stop the rush to ban disposables.

“Single-use plastic products are the most sanitary choice when it comes to many applications, especially the consumption and transport of food, whether purchased at a restaurant or at a grocery store,” Radoszewski wrote.

However, Woodbury maintains that soap and hot water are effective at killing coronavirus and notes that no cases of transmission via surfaces have been reported to date.

“We cannot afford to stall action on plastics when we're already behind on this issue,” Woodbury says. “More than ever, we need to ban single-use plastics and implement solutions for circular management of plastic products and packaging.”

Among the ways businesses can use reusable vessels and containers safely, Surfrider Canada suggests, is to have staff wear gloves and wash containers, either with soap and hot water or in a dishwasher, and wash their hands after removing gloves or handling used items.",[]

The North Vancouver gift shop joins the list of businesses felled by the COVID-19 pandemic.

In an announcement earlier this month, Lala’s founder Kristina Egyed said that the 4381 Gallant Avenue store is closing “due to the exhausting challenges of COVID-19”.

“I built LaLa’s on the foundation of casual socialization and amped-up fun at its core,” Egyed wrote. “COVID does not support this.”

Egyed opened Lala’s in the Cove on September 1, 1996.

There’s also a LaLa's on the Drive in Vancouver (1748 Commercial Drive).

The shop was founded with a mission of “Putting the Ohh LaLa into Gift Giving and Receiving!”

“LaLa's has prided itself on supporting local artists and producers as well as far flung, hard to find boutique items,” Egyed wrote on the shop’s website.

In her announcement, Egyed said that closing the store has been “extremely difficult decision”.

“We love the community, advocating for small businesses, and offering local, funky, and unique gifts,” she said.

1 of 4 2 of 4

Pickering’s Karena Evans, the director behind Drake’s ""God’s Plan"" and ""Nice For What"" videos, is making the leap into television and movies.

Her narrative debut, the pilot episode of Katori Hall’s drama about strippers P-Valley, premieres Sunday (July 12) on Starz and Crave. She’s following that up with an episode of ""Snowfall"", John Singleton’s series about the crack epidemic, and a feature film she plans to tell us more about next year. Evans is on a trajectory only a handful of people before her have successfully completed.

The list of music video directors who become prominent moviemakers like David Fincher, Michael Bay, and Spike Jonze is long. But for directors who come from hip-hop videos, it’s another story.

F. Gary Gray (Straight Outta Compton) and Antoine Fuqua (Training Day) are the most prominent among the few who leveraged their hip-hop work to build a career in movies. Melina Matsoukas made the leap recently with Queen And Slim.

Even Hype Williams—whose cultural imprint between videos for artists like Biggie, Nas and Wu-Tang runs far, wide and deep—has not directed a feature film since 1998’s Belly.

“Life, humanity, and art does not progress without Black culture,” Evans says on a Zoom call from Los Angeles. “Its maddening someone like Hype [Williams], who is the Godfather of music video filmmaking and storytelling, doesn’t get the same respect as a David Fincher and they come from the same place. That is bias and that is racism.”

Evans isn’t ignorant to how the mostly Black talent who come from hip-hop, no matter how many private jets they can own, are treated like they belong in coach by the artistic community. It took Kendrick Lamar winning the Pullitzer Prize for the entire hip-hop community to know that the Pullitzer Prize was even up for grabs.

“I have to work hard to not believe that narrative within myself,” says Evans, who in a few short years has been making a habit of pushing past one boundary after another. “I have to unlearn that thinking that was projected on to me to be able to move through that narrative and to break through.”

There is a lineage from Hype Williams to Evans, who is touted as the first lady of Director X’s company, Popp Rok. X was a Hype protégé. Likewise, Evans cut her teeth after she cold-called and started interning for X.

Evans also starred in Jasmin Mozaffari’s Firecrackers, a 2019 film about young women seemingly built from concrete scraping against the patriarchy. There’s a scrappy, chin-high energy in Firecrackers that can be felt in P-Valley. She admits that she soaks up all the knowledge she can from all her mentors and collaborators, Mozaffari included.

There is also that “hip-hop aesthetic” with saturated colours, neon lights, dizzying edits and slow-motion poses that can be traced from Belly to P-Valley. That, according to Evans, is exactly what the show’s creator Katori Hall, who adapted the series from her stage play Pussy Valley, was looking for.

“Katori envisioned a world called Delta Noir,” says Evans, explaining how they modernized film noir principles for the “Dirty Delta Mississippi” style, while using music video language. The high-contrast lighting and play with shadows from noir classics like Kiss Me Deadly and Double Indemnity are now flooded with heavy saturation. And the femme fatale is inverted to be the hero of this world. Hall has described it as doing a twerk on noir.

Evans and Hall also worked to give P-Valley an aesthetic that would subvert how strippers and sex workers have been portrayed in the past. The group has been frequently misrepresented onscreen and Black women in particular have been hypersexualized.

Bell Media

Flying high in P-Valley

There are plenty of scenes in the strip club, an exploitative space. But watching the spectacle in P-Valley doesn’t feel leery. Instead, it’s occasionally awe-inspiring. Watch out for when Brandee Evans’ character Mercedes climbs the pole, Goddess-like, and pounds the ceiling, taking the camera along with her while leaving everyone else far below.

The sequence is an example of how Evans imbued the material with a female gaze while recognizing that exotic dancing is also high art: There’s a performance, lighting design, costume and an interaction between dancer and audience.

“The power that they have over their audience, both men and women, is so fascinating and so worth telling,” says Evans, referencing her own leisurely experiences at the club.

Mercedes vaulting up the pole to bang against that ceiling is an apt and sensational metaphor. Women of colour everywhere, especially in media, are drawing attention to the glass ceilings and limitations that have been imposed on their voices and careers.

“I do very much feel like the industry has taught me not to strive to reach my full potential,” says Evans, referencing the assumptions made based on her age, sex and skin colour.

“I’ve just chosen not to accept that. And that is because I don’t feel it serves me as an artist and as a storyteller. My job is to be of service to the story and not anybody else’s ideas of who I should be,” she adds. “My job is to listen and to be present, and be a vessel for the story and the energy to move through, and not to abide by any one else’s misconceptions of who I am and how I should be.”

Karena Evans

Everyday people

Evans has described herself as a vessel in the past, specifically when speaking to her music video work. She tells stories that artists like Drake or SZA want to tell and channels their voice into the visuals. But there is also a piece of her in the work.

“I don’t like to take on anything that I can’t offer my perspective on,” says Evans, adding that all her projects have something she personally connects and identifies with.

When I grill her about what projects are the most personal—ones that scream “KARENA EVANS!”—she pauses to mull over the answer: Drake’s ""God’s Plan"" and ""In My Feelings"", and Coldplay’s ""Everyday Life"" as the titles closest to her heart. Tellingly, those are the videos that mix things up with street casting and in the moment discovery, reaching beyond a celebrity bubble and featuring working class people: New Orleans dancers, college-bound kids in the U.S. and gospel singers in Africa.

“Each of those [videos], in their respective way, have impacted culture and have impacted people, and have been able to in some small way strike hope in people,” says Evans.

“That’s why I tell stories. It’s to move people. Those were successful in moving people because they came from a place of love, purity and honesty.”",[]

1 of 1 2 of 1

Kitchener queen Kyne had a short, memorable, and rocky run on the inaugural season of Canada’s Drag Race.

The second contestant to sashay away, Kyne was pegged by the early on judges as a social media queen brimming with “overconfidence.” (She has 679,000 followers on TikTok and 76,000 on Instagram.)

She won the first mini-challenge and her unfiltered attitude afforded her ample screen time, but also harsh critiques from judges Brooke Lynn Hytes, Jeffrey Bowyer-Chapman, and Stacey McKenzie. After the premiere episode aired, she also had to contend with nasty messages on on social media.

In episode two, the panel was not taken in by her performance in the HER-Itage Moments acting challenge or runway look harkening back to her first time doing drag. She landed in the bottom two, lip synching for her life against an emotional Tynomi Banks—one of Toronto’s most respected drag performers—to Stars On 54’s disco-fied Gordon Lightfoot cover ""If You Could Read My Mind"".

But she also did what good reality TV contestants do: gave us moments of comedy, drama, vulnerability and candor. The day after her elimination aired on Crave, we spoke with Kyne about getting the “villain edit,” the pitfalls of opening up on reality TV and mixing drag with math as force for social change.

How did you become a drag queen?

I started out more as a YouTuber/makeup gay. I started experimenting with makeup back when I was in high school and documented it all on YouTube. I really fell in love with the artistry of it all and started slowly going from concealer here and there to eye shadow to face paint. When I first discovered RuPaul’s Drag Race, that opened my eyes to the world of drag. I had a very stereotypical idea of what drag was.

What was your stereotypical idea of drag?

I just thought that drag was this very odd thing of men dressing up as women and I didn’t understand why they did it. I saw it more as an art form when I took a closer look. I saw the humour and the fun and the irreverence.

You’re a math student. There’s one line of thought that would say art is similar to science and math and others that might say they’re opposing fields. What’s your view?

I like how math is a field where things are binary. Statement is either true or false. An object is either inside a set or isn’t. I do like the objectivity. In that sense, I would be on the side of people who say that math and art are very opposed. I think lots of mathematicians and people within that subject do have an artistic side to them. I like how I can do both because I do have a creativity side to me as well as an analytical side.

And drag lets you break the binary.

Exactly.

Your time on Canada’s Drag Race was short but memorable. How would you characterize it?

It was fun. It was chaotic. It was good TV. I’m glad that I got to make an impression on people. I was very confident—at some points too confident. I’m glad by the second episode viewers got to see more of my personality and got to see the cheekiness of it all.

When you left you you said in your voice-over that the show was a humbling experience. What was humbling about it and do you feel similarly today?

What was humbling was the knowledge that you’re not always going to get everything you want in life. You can try your hardest to impress people and people won’t like your sense of humour. You can give people the prettiest, juiciest peach and maybe they just don’t like peaches. I think the judges just didn’t like me. They were looking for something else. It was the lesson that not everything is going to work out for you and that’s okay.

It’s a weird time because Drag Race is a launch pad for the contestants, but we’re in a pandemic. How do you take your time on the show forward in the context we’re in?

Out of all the queens on the show, I was always going to be in my basement filming videos in front of the camera anyway. This is now the world we’re living in, but this has always been my comfort zone. I’m pursuing that lane of social media. I’ve been really loving doing my math videos. So many people hate math because of school—because of the way it’s taught to them. I think they just need to see it in a different light, see it in a different context, and understand the beauty and the elegance behind it.

They just need a drag queen teaching it to them.

Exactly. The drag draws them in and that’s when I teach them the math.

On Instagram you combine math, drag and the politics of the moment. You’ve used math to debunk crime statistics. Can you talk about how you use math to talk about anti-Black racism protests and became part of that conversation on social media?

This is the why people should be learning math: math is used not only to create our GPS and our computers, and make the banking system work; math is also used in media to manipulate people and drive political agendas. People need a stronger mathematical literacy in order to process these things. Many people see things like “crime rates are up five per cent from last year” and they have no idea what that means. Five per cent seems abstract to them. People need to be better equipped with the tools to understand statistics so it can’t be used for evil anymore.

Even though you were on the show for only a short time it seems like you got the “villain edit.” Do you agree with that? You had a beautiful moment with Tynomi at the end of the episode so there was this redemption arc. What’s your take on the way you were edited?

When I said to Tynomi “This is my moment,” that was the same spirit that I said everything in. Everything I said was meant to be in jest. There was that moment in Untucked with BOA that I did lose my cool. It seemed like it was the perfect storm of me thinking I was in the top for a sewing challenge. I do sewing tutorials so I felt the pressure. And I felt the embarrassment and the shame when I was in the bottom. I did snap there but I’m only human. That’s totally my sense of humour. I think it came across as arrogance to some people. I’m glad that people got to see that it was just lighthearted by the end of the second episode.

So far both eliminations have been very emotional. This week, Tynomi was the more emotional one and you really held it together even though you went home. How intense was the elimination experience?

It’s super intense. At that point I had really accepted my fate. When the judges were telling me that they did not like me in the acting challenge—even though they admitted I was very prepared and knew all my lines—that’s when I knew this was a competition that is not going to be successful for me. Clearly they’re looking for something that I don’t have. I didn’t want to embarrass myself anymore so I accepted my fate. Tynomi and BOA had the will to fight that I didn’t have and I could tell the judges really liked them more. I knew that it was my time to go.

I find the critiques on Canada’s Drag Race to be pretty harsh. I feel like they’re more diplomatic on the American version even though they can also be tough. How do you feel the show compares to the American version?

I wonder if maybe the judges felt like they had to be a little bit extra harsh to establish themselves and show people they’re serious. It definitely made me feel defeated because I applied all my critiques, I never talked back to them, I was more humble, I worked on my walk. I did everything they wanted in the challenge and for them to not even give me any positive [feedback], it felt like, how am I supposed to believe that they want me to succeed?

What was it like lip-synching against Tynomi Banks?

If I had to go home I’m glad it was against a queen that I really look up to. I was really at peace with the whole thing. I wanted to lip-synch to keep some dignity but I felt I was being her backup dancer in that moment. [laughs]

You opened up about your family on the show. What was it like watching that and what are your family’s thoughts on your time on Drag Race?

My family’s been liking it. My mom has been finding it a little hard to watch. To tell you the truth, I wish I hadn’t opened up and been that intimate about it because I’ve had a lot of nasty messages over the last week and I’m like, they don’t deserve to know me like that. It shouldn’t take trauma for people to see me as a human being.

On the one hand you’re unfiltered, which is great for reality TV, but it makes you vulnerable to things that some of the more buttoned-up queens won’t have to deal with.

If it humanized me I guess it’s a good thing. I was very scared coming into the second episode because the entire week leading up to it, I felt all the nerves. Episode one was really horrible for me. I really felt like I had to do damage control because so many people were just being very mean to me and I never had the chance to celebrate the premier. I never had a chance to be optimistic like the other queens were. For me, it felt like in both episodes I totally just felt flat on my face. I felt like my career was at stake, but if people found I was redeemed then I’m happy for that.",[]

1 of 1 2 of 1

Above the Law (Marc Serpa Francoeur, Robinder Uppal). 44 minutes. Airs on July 11 at 8 p.m. on CBC, and streaming on CBC Gem.

There’s no shortage of documentaries about police brutality right now, but CBC POV’s Above The Law—airing nationwide on CBC this Saturday (July 11) and already available to stream on the broadcaster’s Gem service—is notable for the way it addresses multiple points of the issue.

Five years in the making, Marc Serpa Francoeur and Robinder Uppal’s look at three recent cases of police abuse of authority in Calgary touches on anti-Black racism, wellness checks, and unnecessary use of force—and the way the police’s internal investigations almost never hold officers to account for their misdeeds.

Francoeur and Uppal tell the stories of Godfred Addai-Nyamekye, Anthony Heffernan and Daniel Haworth, whose encounters with the Calgary Police Service went terribly wrong.

Addai-Nyamekye’s traffic stop in 2013 led to two officers driving him away from his vehicle (and his friends) to a construction site on the edge of the city and leaving him there alone with no shelter against the -28 Celsius weather. Addai-Nyamekye called 911; they hung up on him. Eventually a constable, Trevor Lindsay arrived, told him to stop calling 911—then tasered and beat him.

Though Addai-Nyamekye filed a report, the officers remained on the job—and Lindsay wound up mired in an even uglier case in 2015, when he was caught on camera assaulting Haworth in a parking garage. Haworth, the son of a retired Calgary cop, had been arrested on suspicion of theft and handcuffed; his skull was fractured in the assault, leading to traumatic brain injury.

Heffernan’s case is murkier but no less acceptable: when the 27-year-old electrician and recovering addict relapsed in a Calgary hotel, five police officers arrived for a basic wellness check—leading to Heffernan being shot four times and killed.

Above The Law tells these stories simply and directly, interviewing survivors and families and using security-camera footage of Lindsay beating Haworth to illustrate the brutality of the constable’s assault—and to efficiently refute the self-defense argument brought by Lindsay’s attorney at his trial. (Lindsay was convicted of aggravated assault last June, and is still awaiting sentencing.)

Francoeur and Uppal don’t employ any big stylistic flourishes; they don’t have to. The horrors of police abuse are clear, as is the lip service paid to police reform every time a new case comes up; after all, isn’t the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team tasked with investigating “police officers whose conduct may have caused serious injuries or death”?

Well, ASIRT investigated 71 officer-involved shootings and deaths between 2013 and 2019; charges were laid exactly once. Above The Law shows us how it works, and while the doc allows that the arrival of new chief Mark Neufeld last summer might bring some desperately needed reform… yeah, that’d be nice, but I get the feeling we shouldn’t hold our breath.",[]

The B.C. screen industry is losing a production from its roster.

Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, which stars Kiernan Shipka as the title part-human, part-witch character and has been filmed in Vancouver since March 2018, was reported on July 8 as being cancelled and will end after part four of the series is released on Netflix.

Local filming for Chilling Adventures of Sabrina finished up in February, prior to COVID-19 shutdowns beginning in the B.C. filming industry.

Unfortunately, the end of the show also means that any possible future crossovers between Sabrina and its fellow Archie Comics–based series Riverdale won’t happen on screen.

The finale for Part 3 was released on January 24. While the release of Part 4 will take place later this year, a specific date is yet to be announced.

In other Archieverse news, Riverdale spinoff Katy Keene, starring Lucy Hale, Ashleigh Murray (whose character Josie McCoy crossed over from Riverdale), Katherine LaNassa, and Julia Chan, was reported on July 2 as being cancelled on the CW after only one season but Warner Bros. will continue to seek options to continue the show on other platforms.

Meanwhile, the CW renewed Riverdale for a fifth season and is slated to premiere in 2021.

A new Batwoman has been found and like her predecessor, she will also make TV history.

Warner Bros TV and Batwoman announced on July 8 that Javicia Leslie is taking on the lead role of the CW television series Batwoman in the second season of the series, which is primarily shot in Vancouver.

Leslie will portray a character named Ryan Wilder who will don the batsuit, and she will become the first Black actor to portray Batwoman in live-action TV and film productions. The show will also remain committed LGBT representation and issues.

The casting of Leslie comes in the wake of actor Ruby Rose, who played the character of Kate Kane (a.k.a. Batwoman), unexpectedly announcing on May 19, after the airing of the finale of the first season, that she would be leaving from the show.

Rose did not state the reason for her departure.

However, Rose congratulated Leslie on being cast in the role.

Batwoman became the first live-action TV superhero series with a lead LGBT character, which was also portrayed by an out lead actor.

According to reports, the character of Kate Kane won’t be killed off but her disappearance will become part of a mystery in Season 2.

The Hollywood Reporter states that Ryan Wilder is described as ""a girl who would steal milk for an alley cat and could also kill you with her bare hands, Ryan is the most dangerous type of fighter: highly skilled and wildly undisciplined. An out lesbian. Athletic. Raw. Passionate. Fallible. And very much not your stereotypical All-American hero.""

Leslie previously starred in God Friended Me (which was cancelled in April after two seasons) and has also appeared in the TV series The Family Business and the romcom feature Always a Bridesmaid.

Batwoman is scheduled to return to the airwaves in 2021.

Although filming in B.C. has resumed as part of the province's Phase 2 restart plan during the pandemic, the series is not yet appearing on any B.C. production lists and it remains to be confirmed if production for Batwoman returns to Vancouver where other Arrowverse TV series, such as The Flash and Supergirl, are also filmed.",[]

Canadian film funding agency Telefilm Canada is investigating misconduct accusations against one of its employees.

According to a statement released on July 9, Telefilm has retained third-party Le Cabinet RH, which specializes in psychological and sexual harassment complaints as well as discrimination-based complaints.

The allegations stem from comments on Twitter that were part of wider conversations about arts funding in Canada and structural issues.

The statement does not specify the nature of the allegations or the name of the employee in question.

“As an organization, Telefilm makes it a point to ensure that the behaviour of our employees is exemplary both internally and with respect to our partners and our clients. Inappropriate behaviour of any kind is not tolerated. We take these allegations very seriously,” the statement reads. “Telefilm wishes to cast light on these allegations, with the diligence that this requires.”

Though information about the allegations are in the public domain, Telefilm said, it is unable to provide further details regarding the employee due to privacy concerns.

The statement follows an earlier statement from Telefilm Canada’s executive director Christa Dickenson, who said on Monday that comments on social media “about conduct that does not reflect our corporate values” were brought to the agency’s attention.

Over the weekend, filmmakers took to social media to criticize the agency and the way film and television funding in Canada is allocated.

Dan Lyon is the feature film executive at Telefilm in charge of selecting projects from Ontario and Nunavut with budgets under $2.5 million that will receive production funding from the government.

On Monday, actor and writer Melissa D’Agostino claimed on Twitter that Lyon made a sexually inappropriate remark when inviting her to a meeting. D’Agostino also shared a clip from the 2019 documentary #MeAfterToo, in which she describes the incident but does not name Lyon.

In her statement, Dickenson directed others who have experienced harassment, racism, discrimination or misconduct involving a Telefilm employee to file formal complaints with the agency’s lawyer Khadidja Kedir.

Lyon has yet to respond to a request for comment for this article.

The funding conversation

D’Agostino posted her accusations against Lyon in response to Sundowners director Pavan Moondi’s Twitter thread on July 3. Moondi questioned Lyon’s position as a gatekeeper for film financing in Ontario and his relationship with actor Nicole Arbour, who has disparaged anti-racists and trans people on Twitter. Lyon has directed tweets with sexual innuendos to Arbour in the past.

Moondi posted his email correspondence with Lyon on Twitter after the executive denied a financing application and cited Telefilm’s gender parity goals (50/50 by 2020) as the reason.

Moondi has criticized Telefilm in the past over the agency’s refusal to implement formal measures to address representation beyond gender. Telefilm has cited privacy laws for the reason it is unable to collect race-based data that could factor into decision making.

Moondi’s correspondence with Lyon highlighted the issues with Telefilm’s system, beginning with an executive using gender parity as an excuse for denying POC filmmakers. Lyon later said that he and the anonymous script reader employed to vet Moondi’s project simply did not like it.

The allegations drew criticism from the filmmaking community around who greenlights film and television funding, and whether Canadian film and TV can represent the population without diversity among power brokers. The board of directors at Telefilm and Canadian Media Fund (CMF) are all white. Save for one Asian male at each agency, senior management are all white too. All four regional executives at Telefilm are white, with Lyon being the only male. Lyon has held the position for 15 years.

In a statement released on July 8, Telefilm said 21 percent management to executive-level staff and eight percent of project financing teams are visible minorities or racialized persons. The agency did not provide demographic information about anonymous script readers.

Moondi’s thread inspired filmmakers and organizations like BIPOC TV and Film to call on transparency in the funding process from Telefilm and the CMF. In a Twitter open letter co-signed by others, the organization calls on funding agencies to fill leadership roles with more Black, Indigenous and people of colour, do away with the anonymous outside reader process and instead employ peer-led juries for funding, and set term limits on decision maker to avoid “favouritism and unconscious bias.”

A December 2018 report commissioned in part by Telefilm recommended a mandated turnover of decision makers. The report on the future of filmmaking in Ontario suggested that swapping out the gatekeepers could “promote experimentation, creativity and different points of view in who and what gets funded, as well as prioritize diversity in new hires to encourage decision makers who are more representative of the audience.”

In the Wednesday statement, Telefilm stated that BIPOC TV and Film’s calls to action will be considered as the agency re-evaluates processes. That includes the rotating peer-led jury system, which is already in place in the microbudget Talent To Watch and Indigenous funding streams.",[]
195,straight,https://www.straight.com/movies/review-apple-tvs-greyhound-is-a-taut-wwii-naval-thriller,Review: Apple TV+’s Greyhound is a taut Second World War naval thriller,[],2020-07-09 14:29:28-07:00,"1 of 1 2 of 1

Greyhound (Aaron Schneider). 94 minutes. Streaming Friday (July 10) on AppleTV+.

There’s a little montage, fairly early in Steven Spielberg’s Saving Private Ryan, that demonstrates the emotional heft encoded into the classical war picture: having survived the landing at Omaha Beach, Tom Hanks’s Capt. Miller is ushered away from the mess tents to be given another mission. Spielberg gives us a quick glimpse at the specific comforts Miller won’t be able to enjoy: a cigarette, a cup of coffee, and so on. The items are generic, but Hanks’s look of exhausted longing tells us everything about what they mean to him.

I don’t doubt that Hanks kept that sequence at the forefront of his mind while developing Greyhound, because Spielberg’s shorthand informs his new project constantly—as does the actor’s lifelong fascination with the Second World War. As with his love of the space program, expressed most vividly in Apollo 13 and HBO’s From The Earth To The Moon, Hanks’s interest in these pivotal points in boomer iconography is much more than superficial affectation; he’s forever telling stories of untested men trapped within the movements of history, interrogating the American myth of heroism as something innate to the national spirit.

I don’t think Hanks believes acting heroically is a conscious choice; I think he feels that’s just something we tell ourselves in order not to think about the sheer terror we must overcome in order to act. Certainly, when he plays heroes he’s always sure to show us the fear and confusion—the doubt—in their eyes.

Greyhound is about such a hero, and how he tries to endure a nightmarish situation that simply will not end. Based on a 1955 novel by C.S. Forester and set in April 1942, the story follows untested Navy captain Ernest Krause as his gunboat escorts an Allied convoy across the Atlantic towards England, and directly through a hunting ground of German subs. The movie takes place over the three days of the trip in which air support is unavailable, allowing the U-boats to stalk the convoy without fear of being bombed from above.

It’s a good, tense tale, and Hanks—who wrote the script himself, and stars as the capable but terrified commander—makes it better by stripping the story down to an almost elemental level, cutting almost everything that isn’t essential to the moment-to-moment narrative. Aside from a brief flashback featuring Elisabeth Shue as the woman waiting for Ernie back home, the action never leaves the ship; we only know what Ernie and his crew knows, and when information is spotty we are terrified right along with them.

Dialogue is reduced almost entirely to tactics and jargon, with characters shouting about rudders and pings and sweeps. It’s briefly disconcerting, and then it snaps into place: who has time to talk about anything else? Saving Private Ryan was all about the downtime between battles, fleshing out its platoon of soldiers into three-dimensional characters defined by what they chose to share of themselves; Greyhound takes a very different approach, showing us how the crucible of battle reduces everyone to their assigned function. (Two other actors stand out: Stephen Graham as Ernie’s executive officer, and Rob Morgan as a galley cook who keeps trying to get Ernie a decent meal.)

It’s also just 90 minutes long, not counting the opening title and end credits, and its efficiency feels like something else that only someone with Hanks’s track record could command. When was the last time you saw a major studio action movie that was this brief?

Greyhound is generic in the best possible way, trusting the audience to catch the visual signifiers—plates of food, shiny new shoes, a murky sonar screen—and use our understanding of war-movie narratives to fill in the blanks. And while I was surprised to see Aaron Schneider, the director of the charming Robert Duvall dramedy Get Low, at the helm of such a complicated undertaking, he’s more than up for it, deftly integrating digital and practical images in the frantic action sequences and always cutting back to Hanks to maintain the movie’s emotional temperature.

Like The Old Guard, this is a movie that’d slot right into a list of summer studio blockbusters—and while it’s a shame that people won’t get the chance to see it on a big screen, at least it’s getting a shot at finding an audience.

Just promise me you won’t watch it on a laptop.",[]

The Old Guard (Gina Prince-Bythewood). 124 minutes. Some subtitles. Streaming on Netflix Canada on Friday (July 10).

What would happen if Highlanders didn’t need to kill each other, and were happy to work together instead? You’d get something like writer Greg Rucka and artist Leandro Fernandez’s comic-book series The Old Guard, about immortal warriors who’ve long since stopped trying to figure out why they are what they are, and choose to spend their time fighting for causes they deem worthy.

Adapted for the screen by Rucka himself, The Old Guard movie finally breaks the curse of Netflix’s high-octane, A-lister action junk like Triple Frontier and 6 Underground, movies that wasted some very pricey talent in grim, grinding thrillers that promised complexity but settled for noise and gore.

The Old Guard offers all of those elements as well, but director Gina Prince-Bythwood embraces the pulpier aspects of her source material, and makes the mixture sing. I have to admit I didn’t expect that from the director of Love & Basketball and Beyond The Lights, but she brings a rich sense of humanity to what could have been a mechanical cat-and-mouse action thriller; her movie is filled with little glances and asides that speak to the literally ancient history its characters share.

Most important of all, she’s got Charlize Theron, who is just so much damn fun to watch as team leader Andy, who’s been around for millennia and has refined herself to a sharp point; unlike so many other actors who’ve played undying, ancient characters, Theron seems to have spent some time thinking about what would and wouldn’t be important to someone who’s literally been everywhere and experienced everything. She has fun with the character’s lack of fun, if that makes any sense, and it keeps us watching her to see what she’ll do next.

There’s a moment about a third of the way into The Old Guard where Andy is surprised by something, and Theron plays it for delight instead of shock: she didn’t think that was still possible. It flickers across her face for barely a second, but I remember it a week later. Most action movies don’t have room for that sort of thing, and I’m really happy this one does.

Which isn’t to discount the rest of the absurdly overqualified international cast, which also includes Matthias Schoenaerts (Disorder, The Mustang), Marwan Kenzari (one of the few good things about Guy Ritchie’s awful Aladdin remake) and Luca Marinelli (Martin Eden) as Andy’s eternal comrades-in-arms, If Beale Street Could Talk’s KiKi Layne as their newest member, a Marine whose immortality activates when her throat is slashed in Afghanistan, and Chiwetel Ejiofor as the ex-CIA operative who’s discovered their secret.

Seriously, the entire movie is cast above its station: that’s Romanian legend Anamaria Marinca (4 Months, 3 Weeks And 2 Days) in the thankless role of a genetic researcher who works for the movie’s heavy (Harry Melling), a callow pharma bro who isn’t quite as menacing as the film wants us to believe. But he does shout a lot.

The Old Guard is both serious enough to justify its mission and smart enough to have fun with its premise: it’s Highlander without the in-fighting, and a lot more ordnance. The cast has fantastic chemistry, the story moves fast enough that we don’t have time to ask pesky questions about travel logistics and issues of international finance, and the action sequences are smartly staged and even essential to character development: just because our heroes can survive any injury doesn’t mean they’re impervious to pain, so the decision to step in front of a squad of armed paramilitary goons still carries some weight.

And over time, almost without us noticing, the grudging bond between Theron’s leader and Layne’s rookie becomes the movie’s heartbeat. I wasn’t expecting that, either. What a pleasant surprise.",[]

Films are lighting up big screens once again as cinemas have been reopening across Vancouver, with health measures in place of course. Among them have been the Cinematheque, the Rio Theatre, the Dunbar Theatre, and Cineplex.

Another movie theatre chain is joining them but a local arthouse cinema isn’t for reasons unrelated to the pandemic.

Landmark Cinemas

Calgary-based Landmark Cinemas is reopening all of its movie theatres in Western Canada.

Six locations reopened in Alberta on June 26 while all remaining locations in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and B.C. were scheduled to reopen today (July 3).

The chain’s theatres in Manitoba and Ontario will remain closed until municipal and provincial health authorities allow reopening.

All of its locations will practise new health and safety measures, including seating capacity reduced by 50 percent, reduced showtimes and increased time between screenings to reduce numbers of people in lobbies, and regular sanitization and cleaning of the facilities.

In the Lower Mainland, locations in New Westminster and Surrey reopen today.

As part of its reopening, Surrey Guildford will now feature the company's exclusive Laser Ultra premium large format (PLF), which uses a laser projection system and Dolby Atmos sound.

The renovated Vancouver International Film Centre will see a number of changes, including a new microcinema and a relocated concession stand. Vancouver International Film Centre

Vancity Theatre

One exception in the local film exhibition scene is Vancity Theatre, which began suspending screenings on March 16 due to the pandemic, is remaining closed this summer.

However, its ongoing closure is not due to the pandemic but because of a $2.8 million renovation project that will include the creation of a micro-cinema, a new media lab, an education suite, a relocated concession stand, and a redesigned atrium.

While its physical theatre may not be accessible, Vancity Theatre is still offering an array of films to stream at home, in addition to videos of talks and podcasts. For full details, visit the Vancouver International Film Centre website.

Starring Hong Chau and Sarah Gadon. Now streaming across on-demand and digital platforms

When people think of the Patty Hearst affair, they picture the kidnapped heiress herself, sporting a beret and machine gun. But behind the scenes there was another, lesser-known player: Wendy Yoshimura, an antiwar activist and Symbionese Liberation Army member who was hiding with Hearst when they were finally caught as fugitives.

Yoshimura and her final months with Hearst are the starting point for this meditative, moodily shot effort written and directed by Semi Chellas (of TV’s Mad Men and The Romanoffs). The film is fictional, inspired by the real events and based on Susan Choi’s novel of the same name; Yoshimura is called Jenny Shimada here and played by Hong Chau, who made such a buzzily out-of-the-box impression in Alexander Payne’s eclectic Downsizing.

Quiet and stern, Jenny is the enigmatic centre of American Woman, a pacifist who used to make bombs, as the film reveals early on. Her story is told in flashbacks from an FBI interrogation; “I’d sure like to know why you girls are so goddamned mad,” the agent patronizingly tells her. The movie goes on to hint that, in 1975, there was a lot for any woman, especially a woman of colour, to be royally pissed off about.

Jenny is an ex-radical in hiding, working as a caretaker to a wealthy old woman (a biting Ellen Burstyn)—a scenario that establishes the film’s themes of class and race—when she’s recruited by activists again. She’s hired to keep watch over the rural Upstate New York hideout where Hearst stand-in Pauline (Sarah Gadon) and her two volatile captors, Juan and Yvonne (John Gallagher Jr. and Lola Kirke), are holed up after a police shootout has killed the rest of their group.

A connection builds between the two women, Jenny somehow drawn to Pauline’s vulnerability and empathetic to what appears to be her trauma-induced fear, Pauline to her watcher’s gentleness, especially compared to the abuse from Juan—the angry anticapitalist who calls his captive “princess”.

Time stands still, and Chellas gives these scenes a dreamlike feel, leaves rustling, crickets chirping, all enhanced with poetic lensing by Vancouver cinematographer Greg Middleton.

When the pair break from Juan and Yvonne, the tension dissipates, and the movie shifts its tone dramatically into that of a more romanticized road movie, Pauline and Jenny speeding their way west.

The overall mood is a world away from Paul Schrader’s dark descent into brainwashing and captivity, 1988’s Patty Hearst. American Woman is more interested in the post-’60s political and cultural forces that led to radical acts, presented here in hushed, meditative tones.

In the end, Gadon’s Pauline remains a cipher, shellshocked, unstable, but coy. Chau, the core of the movie, fares better. Yoshimura had a fascinating life that led to her activism—especially having been born in a Japanese-American internment camp. That’s only mentioned briefly here, but Chau is strong enough to bring a compelling new perspective to this bizarre chapter of history—and to the entire idea of the identity of the “American woman”.",[]

The Toronto Star reported this weekend that WE Charity laid off 450 of 465 contract workers hired to administer the Canada Student Service Grant program.

This came as two high-profile Canadians have revealed that they weren't paid to appear at WE Days, unlike Justin Trudeau's mother and brother.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau has also been ensnared in this issue because his daughter works for WE Charity and neither he nor Trudeau recused themselves from cabinet discussions about the contract.

The Conservatives have called for a criminal investigation, whereas NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh has demanded that all documents from the cabinet deliberations be made public.

Earlier this month month, WE Charity backed out of the $19.5-million contract to administer the $900-million volunteer program after opposition politicians complained about its close ties to members of the Trudeau family.

Canadian singer Jully Black has also pointed out on her Instagram feed that she wasn't paid for her appearance.

WE Charity was registered with the Canada Revenue Agency in 1997.

Its latest financial statement to tax officials on August 31, 2019 shows that WE Charity had five employees earning between $120,000 to $159,999 in the previous year.

Another five were paid between $80,000 to $119,999.

Charities' public statements to the Canada Revenue Agency do not reveal the names of those collecting the highest salaries.

WE Charity reported $62.5 million in assets in 2019, including $43.7 million in the category of ""land and buildings in Canada"".

It listed $44.4 million in liabilities, mostly ""deferred revenue"" and ""accounts payable and accrued liabilities"".

In its last fiscal year, We Charity generated $65.9 million in revenue—including $680,050 from the federal government and $900,000 from provincial and territorial governments.

It spent $68.2 million, including $19.9 million on compensation.

B.C educators sang WE Charity's praises

In a WE transparency report on its website, there are testimonials from officials around the world, including some B.C. educators.

Jennifer McCrea, assistant deputy minister overseeing the learning division in the B.C. Ministry of Education, wrote that 300 students, Ministry of Education staff, and Education Minister Rob Fleming re-created the journey that girls must take in developing countries to bring fresh water to their families.

""Through the work WE has done, girls now have access to fresh water and an education as they are not spending their days walking back and forth to a fresh water source,"" McCrea wrote. ""Participating in that walk in British Columbia and then doing the actual water walk this summer in Kenya on my personal holidays solidified our responsibility to continue to support developing countries in a sustainable way.

""I was able to meet local girls completing high school and ones currently enrolled in college,"" McCrea continued, ""the excitement for their future was so empowering and to recognize BC students have helped support through WE Schools partnership was extremely gratifying.""

In another testimonial, Vancouver Community Schools Team youth and family worker Patti McVey declared that the We Schools program has been ""the best way for me to facilitate leadership skills to my grade 7 students"".

""One teacher is also using the novel 'Iqbal' who was the child who first

inspired Marc and Craig Keilburger [sic] to start 'Free the Children',"" McVey noted. ""I find that throughout the year, the many activities we undertake truly create an intrinsic motivation in each of the students that they will continue with throughout their lives.

""We belong to an inner city school in east Vancouver so the parents don’t have a lot of money,"" she continued. ""We already have a hot lunch program and send home food packages to the students, so there are a few standard WE fund raisers that we can’t do, such as the We Scare Hunger canned food collecting project. However, we find innovative ways to increase awareness and through assembly presentations throughout the year, and we still raise money for local causes and one global WE Village.""

Like McCrea, McVey also travelled abroad to learn more about the charity.

""My trip with the WE Educators Program to Ecuador/Amazon this summer was the most inspiring experience,"" she wrote. ""One of the highlights was meeting the Cichwa indigenous people and learning about the natural ways of living and farming. We also learned how they have suffered under Spanish colonization.""

There, she was able to witness the effects of a school built by previous WE Students. She joined in building a community kitchen.

""I truly witnessed first hand how the WE program operates globally and I respect their model of Equal Partnership agreements that precipitate any global village projects,"" McVey stated in the testimonial.

A Vancouver beauty college says it's serious about uplifting and celebrating Black Lives as it fights racism and discrimination.

As part of its efforts, the Blanche Macdonald Centre has announced that it's launched a $1-million scholarship program for Black Canadians.

Each year over the next five years, the school will award $200,000 to cover the full cost of tuition, books, and professional kits.

On August 28, the Blanche Macdonald Centre will provide details about how to apply. It's open to Black Canadians who are 19 years of age or older and who've graduated from high school.

""For 60 years Blanche Macdonald has been a space for education, for empowerment, for self-discovery,"" the school says on its website. ""Founded by a Metis woman and now led by a woman of colour, we have always rooted ourselves in the shared values of love, compassion and inclusion.

""Our walls are home to a diverse community of lifelong learners engaged in the difficult, transformative and often uncomfortable work of self-growth. Through this work we seek to amplify new and unheard voices. To tell unique stories. To educate ourselves and to uplift others.""

Blanche Macdonald Centre has Black faculty members—makeup program director Tracey Payne, makeup instructor Leah Elliston, pro hair instructor Lisa Callender, and esthetics instructor Angie Barnetson.

It's pledged to hire more Black instructors and to augment its makeup kits with more Black-owned beauty brands.

It also intends to expand training for natural textured Black hair.",[]

Langara College occupies an important position in the constellation of B.C. postsecondary institutions.

The Vancouver school is first in the country in helping students transfer from college to university. Every year, about 2,000 of them move on to other institutions, with about half of them attending the University of British Columbia.

One reason behind this success is Langara's emphasis on providing a smooth entry point for students beginning their postsecondary education.

That can be accomplished through smaller class sizes that enable students to really get to know their instructors.

But it's also achieved through Langara's impressive student-volunteer program, which helps forge a more cohesive campus community.

This year, the COVID-19 pandemic has made it more challenging for Langara and institutions to nurture that sense of belonging.

But Langara has still figured out a way to make postsecondary education more hospitable, even in the midst of a global health crisis.

It's doing this by offering students a series of regular free sessions over Zoom—and no registration is required.

One of those sessions, 11 Mindful Minutes at 11 a.m., enables students to take time to become more connected with themselves, live in the present, and relax their nervous system.

Another offering, Applying the Science of Happiness during COVID-19 Times, helps students learn the latest information in the burgeoning field of happiness studies. These are 20-minute sessions.

A different 20-minute session, Learning Memory & Academic Success Strategies for Online Learning, helps students improve their focus and concentration while making better use of memory to improve learning outcomes.

Then there's one entitled Resilience: From Stress to Success in COVID times, again offered in 20-minute sessions over Zoom.

After many years of controversies and discussions about free speech, hate speech, intellectual freedom, and freedom of expression, UBC is announcing some changes while other considerations remain underway.

Appearances at UBC by speakers and organizations associated with or allegedly affiliated with discrimination, white supremacy, or hate speech—such as Jordan Peterson, Jenn Smith, Ben Shapiro, Frances Widdowson, and Andy Ngo—have sparked protests, concerns, and debates.

UBC Students Against Bigotry (SAB) has a timeline that chronicles the recent history of hateful and discriminatory acts at the institution from 2016 onward.

On July 8, UBC president and vice-chancellor Santa Ono issued a statement addressing the debate about “controversial speakers whose views are deeply offensive and hurtful to members of our community” and which “also threaten to undermine our community’s broad commitments to inclusivity and diversity”.

While Ono explained that considerations for amendments that Vancouver-based senate began last year are continuing on, he said that he has consulted faculty and both internal and external counsel about legal frameworks for evaluating speakers, in addition to receiving feedback from others.

“In particular, our concern going forward is to be particularly attentive to those who experience the harmful consequences of speech that denigrates the full equality, inclusivity, and diversity to which UBC’s mission statement properly commits us,” he stated.

Thus far, a number of modifications have been made.

Ono said that the event risk assessment and mitigation process for bookings have been revised to clearly identify the risk level in order to help make decisions about speakers deemed ""controversial"".

An external legal expert, specializing in human rights and civil liberties law, will assess all event bookings at UBC in Vancouver, Okanagan, and Robson Square based on the B.C. Human Rights Code.

While the code prohibits publications that are discriminatory or are likely to expose a group to identity-based hatred or contempt, Ono pointed out that it also prohibits UBC from discriminating against anyone by preventing their access to accommodations, services, or facilities that are available to the public.

In the wake of anti-Asian attacks during the pandemic and George Floyd solidarity protests, Ono had released a statement on June 1 that UBC would commit to increasing and accelerating efforts to make the university more inclusive. On June 2, SFU president and vice-chancellor Andrew Petter also issued a statement to address efforts for diversity, equity, and inclusion at the institution.

Former NDP MP Svend Robinson has accepted a resident-scholar position with Simon Fraser University, staring with this year's fall semester.

The position of J.S. Woodsworth resident scholar is in the humanities department and runs for one year. Woodsworth was one of the founders in the 1930s of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, the precursor of the New Democratic Party.

SFU announced the position in a July 7 release that noted Robinson will teach a humanities seminar during the spring semester and ""participate in community outreach activities throughout the academic year with the Institute for the Humanities"".

In the release, Robinson remarked on the suitability of the position's name: “Woodsworth is one of my political heroes, who fought for peace, economic and social justice, and a better world, and laid the foundation for the NDP, the party I represented in Parliament for over a quarter of a century.""

Svend Robinson was arrested in 1985 during an antilogging protest in Haida Gwaii.

Robinson was no stranger to controversy during his 25-year political career (from 1979 to 2004) representing Burnaby, B.C., on the federal stage, often participating in civil-disobedience actions.

In 1985, he was arrested and fined $750 after taking part in antilogging protests on Lyell Island in Haida Gwaii. He also served nine days of a two-week jail term in 1994, incurred after being convicted of criminal contempt for defying a court order during another antilogging action the previous year in Clayoquot Sound on Vancouver Island.

In 1988, Robinson became the first openly gay Canadian MP after coming out publicly, and in 1994 he was present at the physician-assisted suicide of right-to-die activist Sue Rodriguez, an activity that was illegal under Canadian law at the time.

A federal political comeback attempt in 2019 fell short after a close race with and defeat by Liberal incumbent MP Terry Beech in the Burnaby North-Seymour riding.

“I look forward to engaging with the dynamic SFU community, students, faculty, and staff,"" Robinson said in the release, ""sharing my experience as an MP and learning from them in return.”",[]

1 of 2 2 of 2

In 2018, about $3 billion in federal money was targeted toward student loans and providing subsidies to parents to finance their children's education at colleges, universities, and institutes.

But according to a new report from the Office of the Auditor General, Employment and Social Development Canada ""did not efficiently manage some aspects"".

In particular, the report zeroed in on the Repayment Assistance Plan, which allows borrowers to reduce monthly payments to better manage their student debt. In some cases, the feds cover part of the interest or part of the principal.

By July 1, 2018, more than 200,000 borrowers were participants in the plan, representing $3.6 billion in federal student loans.

At that time, 87 percent of recipients—representing $2.9 billion in loans—were making no repayments, according to the report.

Employment and Social Development Canada agreed with the office's recommendation for the government to ensure ""proper, systematic verification of applications"" to be eligible for the Repayment Assistance Plan.

Karen Hogan became Canada's auditor general in June and has worked for this office since 2006.

Tax info unavailable in administration of loans

In the 2018-19 fiscal year, the federal government wrote off $160 million in student debt, deeming it ""unrecoverable"".

In addition, $244 million in interest was waived and $100 million was forgiven under the Repayment Assistance Plan.

The auditor general's office also recommended that Employment and Social Development Canada ""develop performance indicators"" that take into account the full impact of the Repayment Assistance Plan on nonrepayment of student loans.

The current minister overseeing employment is Carla Qualtrough, whereas Ahmed Hussen oversees social development, who were both appointed in December 2019.

Karen Hogan was appointed as Canada's auditor general in June.

In the report on student financial assistance, her office pointed out that the government's contracted service provider did not have income-tax information from the Canada Revenue Agency.

As a result, it checked the income of Canada Student Loan recipients from whatever pay slips were submitted. And these weren't verified.

""It thus could not efficiently determine whether the information declared by applicants was accurate,"" the auditor general's office reported. ""In 2017, the department undertook a special verification that showed that 58% of participants in the Repayment Assistance Plan had an income higher than what they declared when they applied to the plan.""

In 14 percent of these cases, the department determined that the difference was large enough that the borrowers should have received a lower benefit under the Repayment Assistance Plan.

In addition, the report revealed that in 2017, the department found that 22 percent of Repayment Assistance Plan recipients did not file tax returns. That meant their incomes could not be verified.

The provincial program in Ontario, on the other hand, requires student-loan recipients to disclose their tax returns to be eligible for many programs related to financial aid.

""We noted that 40,492 borrowers in the plan declared that they had ended their full-time post-secondary studies, had no job or income, and did not receive any form of government assistance,"" the auditor general's office stated.

""In our view, this number of people who declared that they had no income should have prompted the department to take appropriate measures to safeguard the integrity of the plan, given the integrity problem the department had identified.""

Debt details will go to credit bureaus

Even though borrowers give the federal government permission to disclose their debts to credit bureaus, Employment and Social Development Canada does not forward this information.

""This was inconsistent with the department’s practice for delinquent student loans, which are reported to credit bureaus through the service provider,"" the auditor general's office stated.

The department agreed with the office's recommendation that student-debt information be passed along to credit bureaus.

The report also concluded that Employment and Social Development ""does not offer enough tools to help students understand their obligations under the Canada Student Loans Program"".

A client-satisfaction survey in 2016, for instance, revealed that only 44 percent of borrowers in their last year of studies knew that interest on loans would kick when they stopped going to school.

And only 35 percent realized that interest would start accumulating if they switched from being full-time to part-time students.

The auditor general called on Employment and Social Development Canada to create a web portal, in collaboration with the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada, to make more financial information about the program available.

For the period covered by the report, the minister overseeing social development was Jean-Yves Duclos, who's now president of the treasury board. The minister overseeing employment and workforce development was Patty Hajdu, who's now the health minister.

In general, the report concluded that Employment and Social Development Canada failed to thoroughly evaluate the individual and combined impact of the Canada Student Loans Program and the Canada Education Savings Program on students' ability to gain access to colleges, universities and institutes.

In particular, the auditor general's office found that low-income families did not fully participate in the Canada Education Savings Program, which includes the Canada Learning Bond.

""For example, even though the Canada Learning Bond is paid by the government without any contribution from families, about 62% of eligible children did not receive it as of 2018 because no account had been opened for them,"" the auditor general's office noted.

""Also, the proportion of low-income families with a Registered Education Savings Plan account who contributed and therefore received the grant decreased from 92% to 74% between 2007 and 2018.""",[]

It appears increasingly likely that Simon Fraser University will dump the controversial name of its varsity sports teams.

Last night, SFU Athletics posted a statement on its website saying that a report regarding the ""Clan"" nickname will go to the university president in August.

""The university is deeply troubled by and attentive to the emotions and concerns to which these associations have given rise, and the impact they have on our athletes, particularly in light of our revulsion to and condemnation of anti-Black racism,"" SFU Athletics stated.

SFU president Andrew Petter has been under pressure for many years to change the varsity teams' name.

It remains to be seen whether the announcement will be made by him or the next president, Joy Johnson, who assumes office on September 1.

Since SFU opened in 1965, the ""Clan"" has been used to honour the school's Scottish traditions and the heritage of colonial explorer Simon Fraser.

But there's been a growing backlash in recent years because the sound of the team's name is identical to that of a notorious and murderous white supremacist organization.

A petition on change.org to scrap the ""Clan"" name has attracted 8,120 signatures, as of this writing.

It points out that the racist 1915 silent film, The Birth of a Nation, was inspired by a novel and play, The Clansmen, which was written by Thomas Dixon Jr.

""The implications of the political and social realm behind this history and era have directly affected Black communities to this day on several levels,"" the petition states. ""The worrisome part about this is it puts SFU’s NCAA Athletes at risk when in the states but it also undermines North American Black history regarding lynching, the KKK, segregation, and more.""

Former SFU men's basketball team guard Othniel Spence has played a key role in elevating awareness around this issue. He wrote an article on the Park Journal website explaining the harmful impact that the Clan name has had on him.

In his first NCAA game at Seattle Pacific University, he noted, a guy asked him what his team's name was.

After Spence replied ""the Clan"", the fellow replied that ""we don't do that here.""

""My heart skipped a beat, mainly because of the embarrassment I had,"" Spence wrote. ""He was right. Where in North America have we allowed a school to have the sports teams named 'The Clan'? It shook me to my core. I couldn't deny or defend the name of the school I represented.""

In his article, Spence revealed that during his fourth year, a poll was taken among student athletes around the name, showing resounding support for a change.

""But it was brought to a halt by the president of the school, Andrew Petter,"" Spence wrote.

A former president of the SFU Student Society, Robert Clift, is one of many who've spoken out on change.org.

""Given when SFU was created our Black friends in the US were literally in a fight for their lives, SFU should never have chosen Clansmen as the team name. 50+ years later, it's time to get on the right side of history,"" he wrote.",[]

The B.C. Ministry of Education has worked closely with a registered charity at the centre of a controversy swirling around Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

On July 3, ethics watchdog Mario Dion's office confirmed that he's investigating Trudeau for ""possible contraventions"" of the Conflict of Interest Act.

The probe is linked to the federal government contracting administration of the $900-million Canada Student Service Grant program to WE Charity.

WE Charity has previously invited the prime minister, his wife Sophie, and his mother Margaret to various public events. It backed out of the deal on July 3.

In the 2018-19 fiscal year, WE Charity's Western Canada office received $200,000 from the B.C. government.

That same year it piloted a program called ""WE Well-being"", which was developed with the Ministry of Education, UBC, and mental-health professionals.

Since then, it's been rolled out to more than 3,500 students, 150 educators, and 43 schools in 11 districts, according to a B.C. government news release in April.

The program aims to improve students' social, emotional, physical, and mental well-being and is part of the WE Schools @home project.

""WE will make mental well-being as understandable and actionable as physical well-being,"" the charity's website states. ""WE will actively celebrate diversity and promote strategies that include a focus on specific/priority populations and mental health equity.""

Last year, B.C.'s superintendent of literacy and numeracy, Maureen Dockendorf, tweeted a photo of B.C.'s education minister, Rob Fleming, welcoming more than 300 students to a WE event in Victoria.

Dockendorf has also tweeted photos of B.C. educators involved in the project.

B.C. has introduced a new curriculum promoting core competencies to enable students to thrive in the 21st century.

Among those competencies are personal awareness and responsibility, including self-determination, self-regulation, and well-being.

This is grounded in research showing that students are more apt to succeed if there is an absence of stress in their learning environments.

Earlier this year, Fleming encouraged B.C. parents to consider making use of the WE Well-being program as they were home-schooling their children.

He made this suggestion after K-12 schools were shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The WE Well-being program has been endorsed by UBC education professor Kimberly Schonert-Reichl, an internationally known expert on the impact of students' self-regulation on learning outcomes.

""The WE Well-being and WE Schools @home programs provide a perfect alignment with B.C.’s focus,"" Schonert-Reichl said in a B.C. government news release in April, ""because the WE organization has distilled the latest research into evidence-based practical approaches and resources that integrate social and emotional learning and the cultivation of positive human qualities, including empathy, gratitude, compassion altruism and resilience—those qualities that are essential for well-being.”

Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion was a long-time civil servant before being appointed to his position on January 9, 2018. Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner

Trudeau under scrutiny for ethics again

Meanwhile, Trudeau is being denounced by opposition politicians and some in the media for his handling of the Canada Student Service Grant program.

There's no evidence that WE Charity paid the Trudeaus for their speaking events, but WE has stated that Sophie Grégoire Trudeau's travel costs were covered by the charity.

She also does a regular podcast on a voluntary basis for WE, which was founded by brothers Craig and Marc Kielburger.

NDP MP Charlie Angus and Conservative MP Michael Barrett each wrote to the ethics commissioner requesting an investigation under the Conflict of Interest Act.

Dion's office later confirmed that a probe is underway.

Section 6(1) of the act states: ""No public office holder shall make a decision or participate in making a decision related to the exercise of an official power, duty or function if the public office holder knows or reasonably should know that, in the making of the decision, he or she would be in a conflict of interest.""

Section 7 states: ""No public office holder shall, in the exercise of an official power, duty or function, give preferential treatment to any person or organization based on the identity of the person or organization that represents the first-mentioned person or organization.""

Section 21 requires public office holders to recuse themselves from any discussion, debate, or vote on matters in which they would be in a conflict of interest.

According to the law, a conflict of interest occurs when a public office holder exercises an official power, duty or function ""that provides an opportunity to further his or her private interests or those of his or her relatives or friends or to improperly further another person’s private interests"".

Under section 48 of the act, Dion has the same power as a court in civil cases to enforce the attendance of witnesses and to compel them to give evidence.

Dion can also require them to speak under oath and to produce documents.

These powers ""shall be exercised in private"" and information provided is inadmissible in court other than for prosecuting a case of perjury.

It means that Dion has the authority to determine how much the charity paid for Grégoire Trudeau's travel expenses, whether she travelled first class, and whether any other considerations may have been granted to the Trudeau family by WE Charity over the years.

Trudeau is the only sitting prime minister in Canadian history who's been found guilty of violating Canada's Conflict of Interest Act. And it's happened twice.

It occurred for the first time in connection with him accepting a free vacation for his family on a private island owned by the Aga Khan when the Ismaili spiritual leader's charity had a financial relationship with the federal government.

It happened a second time in connection with the prime minister's office's efforts to obtain a deferred prosecution agreement for Montreal-based engineering giant SNC Lavalin.",[]

A B.C. educator has expressed deep sorrow over an incident that occurred nearly 13 years ago.

Jon Bonnar was vice principal of Langley Fine Arts School at the time when he wore blackface and a black curly wig on Halloween.

He informed parents in a letter that he and the then principal, a person of colour, chose to dress up as one another—and it was recorded in the yearbook.

""This happened and it never should have,"" Bonnar wrote. ""It was wrong. I understand how offensive it is to appear in blackface, and how it diminishes and demeans members of our black community.

""I also recognize that it is just one symbol of a long history of racism throughout our society,"" he added. ""I take responsibility for my action, recognizing I come from a privileged position in our society and that as a Caucasian person in a position of authority I should never have put myself in this position.""

Bonnar also write that he's ""committed to unlearning and learning and being better"".

""I know this apology letter to the community is only the first step I need to take.""

The superintendent of the Langley school district, Gord Stewart, has issued a statement saying the incident should never have occurred.

""Regardless of the principal dressing up in whiteface, that is no excuse,"" Stewart wrote. ""Dressing in whiteface does not carry the same history, emotion, and racist connotations as blackface.

Six months ago, we never would have imagined high-end restaurants doing takeout, servers wearing surgical masks, or having to wipe down all of the grocery-store and takeout packaging entering our homes. COVID-19 has introduced a mind-boggling new normal when it comes to eating safely, whether at one of your favourite eateries or at your kitchen table.

The novel coronavirus isn’t transmitted through food itself, but expert opinion has been divided since the onset of the pandemic over several aspects related to food. Do we need to take a Lysol wipe to soup cans and pizza boxes, for instance, and should we soak produce in soapy water to reduce the risk of contracting the virus? In a restaurant setting, is it safe to touch the table, chairs, glassware, and cutlery?

Much of the concern stemmed from research published in the New England Journal of Medicine showing that the virus can survive on certain surfaces for varying lengths of time: up to 24 hours on cardboard, for example, and up to three days on plastic.

The risk of virus transmission through infected surfaces has been exaggerated, according to Emanuel Goldman, professor of microbiology, biochemistry and molecular genetics at the Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, who is among the health professionals weighing in on this topic lately. In a recent commentary published in the Lancet, he said the data showing this kind of viral transfer have come from studies that have “little resemblance to real-life scenarios”.

“In my opinion, the chance of transmission through inanimate surfaces is very small, and only in instances where an infected person coughs or sneezes on the surface and someone else touches that surface soon after the cough or sneeze (within 1–2 h),” Goldman wrote. “I do not disagree with erring on the side of caution, but this can go to extremes not justified by the data. Although periodically disinfecting surfaces and use of gloves are reasonable precautions, especially in hospitals, I believe that fomites [inanimate surfaces that are normally likely to carry infection] that have not been in contact with an infected carrier for many hours do not pose a measurable risk of transmission in non-hospital settings.”

The focus on wiping down countertops, milk jugs, and to-go containers may turn people’s attention away from more effective measures of minimizing transmission. Goldman said. “It distracts and takes people away from what really protects you against this virus, and that’s the masks,” he told CTVNews.ca. “That’s where the emphasis has to be. That’s what’s going to save us.”

Things to consider when it comes to dining out during a pandemic

Masks and/or face shields have rightly become commonplace in many restaurants and food businesses, though practices vary from place to place. If you’re feeling apprehensive about dining out, visit the restaurant’s website or call directly to go over their COVID-19 protocols—ideally those that go above and beyond the provincial public-health guidelines.

Whether online or by phone, you should be able to easily discover all the steps a dining establishment is taking to help keep its employees and guests safe.

Are floor and kitchen staff wearing masks? Is hand sanitizer available upon entry or once you’re seated? (Some restaurants now put individual packets as part of the place settings.) How often are high-touch surfaces and washrooms being sanitized? Are there screens between tables? And are tables actually two metres apart? Are digital menus available so you don’t have to handle a paper version, or are the latter being recycled after each use? Are temperature checks being conducted among staff and guests before they enter? It may seem strange the first time you extend your wrist to get this measurement, but it’s quick, painless, and for the greater good. Is the restaurant taking down a name and number for at least one person in your party for contact tracing if necessary? Do they accept cash (many don’t)? Sitting outside is a better option than in, with the outdoors making it harder for the virus to spread.

These are all things to take into account, and everyone’s comfort level is different. There’s no right or wrong, and you need to consider whether you’ll be able to relax amid the many health measures around you that are stark reminders of the times.

Guests have their own part to play when it comes to dining out safely: stay home if you’re sick; consider wearing a mask until you’re seated; respect physical-distancing rules; and wash or sanitize your hands before eating.



If you didn’t finish what’s on your plate and want to take it home, you can ask to pack it up yourself.

Good things apparently come to those who wait, which on the West Coast means suffering through the monsoons of Juneuary in the hope that summer might arrive at some point. And one of the best parts of summer? That would be loading up the car, Airstream, or Mountain Equipment Co-Op Blue Ice Dragonfly backpack and getting the hell out of the city. It’s camping season, and it’s more welcome than ever this year, considering the days, weeks, and months you spent locked down at home self-isolating for the good of your fellow Canadians.

There are two basic kinds of campers out there: the hard-core lunatics determined to get completely off the grid (think freeze-dried food, sleeping on the ground, and dumping in the woods), and those who like to have the cooler accessible at all times, mostly because it makes it easier to get gooned by noon.

As a dedicated Liquor Nerd, you know which category you fall into.

The goal then becomes: how do you balance getting away from it all with making the most of happy hour? The key is to keep it simple and channel your inner Boy Scout by being prepared.

First, the simple part. A reality of camping is that space is usually at a premium, especially when getting from Point A to Point B in an Austin Mini, VW Golf, or Peel P50. That means you don’t want to be packing up an Oggi Jumbo Party Cocktail Shaker or Aicok Slow Masticating Juicer Extractor.

A one-stop solution to keeping things economical is the indispensable Adventure Happy Hour Cocktail Shaker Set from Stanley. Cleverly designed as a self-contained ticket to boozy paradise, the stainless-steel (read: indestructible) unit features two insulated glasses, a strainer lid, a jigger cap, and a citrus reamer. And, really, that covers most of what you’ll need to execute a perfect Lynchburg Lemonade.

Now to the being-prepared part. Once again, because space is at a premium, you don’t want to be lugging bags of sugar to make simple syrup, or toting around two-dozen limes or lemons. So do your squeezing and your sugar-and-water boiling at home. Combine the citrus juice and the simple syrup in equal amounts, pour into a Mason jar, and you’ve got a sweet-and-sour mix for a huge array of cocktails ready to go.

So all that’s left to get is the ice. Most folks go the cubed or block route, the problem being that, after a couple of days, everything tends to become a soggy mess. The last thing you want to be making for happy hour is a cocktail with ice that tastes like the Oscar Mayer wieners floating around the bottom of the cooler.

Bring a bag of cubed ice, but pick up a block of dry ice (available at Praxair in East Van) to keep your cooler cold and your cubes pristine. A 25-pound block runs about $40 and will last three days. Need crushed ice? Grab your axe and a reusable cloth shopping bag and have at ’er. Yes, it’s all that easy—until the rain, mosquitos, and cretins blaring Van Halen in the next campsite over arrive to make you wonder why the hell you ever left town.

Here’s a twist on a Lynchburg Lemonade using red huckleberries (found growing around pretty much every campsite in B.C.).

Lynchburg Huckleberry Lemonade

2 oz. Jack Daniel’s Old No. 7

1 oz. premixed sweet-and-sour mix

Sanpellegrino Limonata

20 foraged huckleberries

Muddle the huckleberries with the back of a spoon or a piece of kindling. Add ice, Jack Daniel’s, and sweet-and-sour, shake, and then strain into your Stanley tumbler over fresh ice. Top with the lemon soda and stir.

The Cowichan Valley might be best known for is rolling hills and namesake bay, where Indigenous artist Arthur Vickers has his cedar-scented studio and gallery. Now, the picturesque part of Vancouver Island between Victoria and Nanaimo has another feature to mark it on the map: it’s being officially recognized for its grape-growing and wine-making.

The Cowichan Valley has been named a new sub-geographical indication of B.C.’s wine industry by the Government of B.C. “Sub-GI” is a protected and official term under B.C. law that intends to help consumers identify the province’s wine origins.

There are nine official geographical indications province-wide (including the Okanagan Valley, Fraser Valley, and the Kootenays) and five sub-geographical indications, such as Golden Mile Bench, Naramata Bench, Okanagan Falls, and Skaha Bench (all in the Okanagan Valley). The Cowichan Valley is the first sub-GI outside of the Okanagan.

Wines that are labelled with geographical indications or sub-GIs must be produced with at least 95 percent of the grapes grown form that specific region.

The Cowichan Valley sub-GI is loosely defined as the area between the Cowichan watershed, the eastern coastline from Mill Bay to Maple Bay, and the western part of Cowichan Lake.

Grapes that thrive in the Island micro-climate include Ortega, Bacchus, Gewürztraminer, Pinot Gris, Marechal Foch, and Pinot Noir.

Blue Grouse Estate Winery is situated in the Cowichan Valley, the newest sub-geographical indication in the province's wind industry to be recognized by the B.C. government. Gail Johnson.

Among the wineries in the Cowichan Valley are Alderlea Vineyards, Averill Creek Vineyard, Blue Grouse Estate Winery and Vineyard, Cherry Point Estate Wines, Damali Lavender and Winery, Deol Estate Winery, Divino Estate Winery, Emandare Vineyard, Enrico Winery, Glenterra Vineyards, Rocky Creek Winery, Saison Market Vineyard, Unsworth Vineyards, Venturi-Schulze Vineyards, and Vigneti Zanatta Winery.

They’re situated in Cobble Hill, Cowichan Bay, Duncan, Glenora, Mill Bay, and North Cowichan.

“The newly announced Cowichan Valley sub-GI recognizes our unique terroir and solidifies Vancouver Island's position as an up-and-coming wine destination,” Paul Brunner, owner of Blue Grouse Estate Winery, said in a statement. “Bailey Williamson, Blue Grouse's winemaker, led the initiative, but it would not have been possible without the enthusiastic co-operation of every winery and grape grower in the valley. We are proud to be part of such a cohesive group of wine lovers and look forward to being part of an exciting future.”",[]

Beef jerky has some freshwater competition. El Diablito is a new brand of fish jerky that recently launched in Canada. And with product being made out of wild-caught, invasive devil fish, the company behind it is helping restore natural ecosystems in Mexico while boosting employment there.

El Diablito means ""little devil"" in Spanish, and the title of the new small-batch jerky is a play on the “devil fish” name in Mexico. The species’ real name is the suckermouth or armored catfish.

“The fish is a freshwater fish originally from the Amazon where it is commonly consumed in soups or grilled whole,” says Mike Mitchell, cofounder and CEO of Acari Fish, which makes El Diablito. “In Brazil, communities make a special fish meal called piracuí that they use to make fried balls like croquettes.

“Similar to many invasive fish stories, the devil fish is a popular aquarium fish but is now invasive in at least 15 countries around the world and has hit Mexico especially hard,” Mitchell tells the Straight, noting that the fish outcompetes native species and is decimating the fishing industry in that country. “Because of poor information and stigma, there's virtually no market for the devil fish in Mexico, meaning that fishermen are throwing away literally tonnes of the fish every day. Mexican fishermen nicknamed this fish the devil fish because of the havoc it has wreaked on fisheries.”

Mitchell first visited the state of Tabasco in 2014 via a Fulbright research grant to study small-scale fish farming in rural communities. Upon learning about the loathed suckermouth, he began thinking of ways to transform people’s perception of the fish and create ways for local fishermen to sustain their livelihood.

Acari Fish.

He began giving workshops and cooking demonstrations with Lupita Vidal, a friend and chef who heads La Cevichería restaurant in the Tabasco state capital of Villahermosa. He never imagined his journey would just be beginning.

“I never had any intention to create a business around the fish until 2017, when I spent time with Las Patronas, an NGO in the state of Veracruz that makes food and tosses it to migrants riding freight trains north to the U.S.,” Mitchell says. “This experience inspired me to experiment with ways to turn the fish into a shelf-stable food for people on-the-go. Lupita lent me her household dehydrator, I decided to give jerky a try, and the rest is history.”

The team’s first batch far exceeded expectations, and Acari Fish was born.

“Because the fish itself is rather tough and doesn't have much of a fishy smell or taste, the jerky came out tasting and feeling incredibly similar to beef jerky,” Mitchell says. “By finding markets abroad for this ‘trash fish’, we're boosting local employment and incomes in these communities where we work in Tabasco.”

The company’s main operations are based in the town of Simón Sarlat. Mitchell says its fish processors earn, on average, 40 percent more than they did before, while fishermen often double their daily income by selling Acari their devil fish by-catch.

Acari imports the fish and manufactures the jerky with a copacker in Nanaimo.

“We ended up making our jerky in B.C. after the US Congress effectively banned most catfish imports, including from Canada, in 2018 to protect American catfish farmers,” Mitchell explains. “My cofounder and I are both American but after the regulatory change, we had to look for another way to fulfill our social mission and bring El Diablito jerky to market. We connected with some great partners in B.C., and we launched our products in January 2020.

You can find El Diablito fish jerky in a handful of BC retail stores like Pomme Natural Market, City Avenue, and Windsor Meats. It’s also available online and via Amazon Canada.

The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that Canada needs to develop a more resilient food supply. To help bolster our food security, a nonprofit organization called SeedChange is working with farmers across the country to save seeds at risk of extinction and grow food sustainably.

And while the Ottawa-based SeedChange is enlisting more than 200 farmers from coast to coast to coast to grow local vegetable seed crops, it’s also encouraging individuals to contribute to a more secure food system. People can do that by supporting local farmers or planting their own veggie gardens.

“This pandemic is showing us that how we get food from farms to our plates is vulnerable to shocks,” SeedChange executive director Jane Rabinowicz tells the Straight. “The pandemic has increased food insecurity due to so many people losing their income, impacted farm workers and the farmers who employ them, affected markets, and many other aspects of farm life. We may not know the full effect of COVID-19 on our food security until harvest season.

“More people are growing food than ever, realizing the importance of a short supply chain, and showing unprecedented support for local farmers and seed growers,” she says. “Let's hope the positive trend of people growing their own food and supporting their local farmers lasts beyond the pandemic.""

SeedChange.

Home gardeners can contribute to a thriving food and farming sector through their seed purchases, Rabinowicz says.

“The more local you buy, the fewer steps between you and the farmer, and the higher the share of the revenue to the farmer,” she says. “Another benefit of buying local seed, whether it's direct from the seed producer or through a grocery store that sells seed from local farmers is that it's more likely to be well-adapted to a climate similar to your garden.

SeedChange’s SeedFinder database helps people find locally adapted vegetable seeds from farmers in their region.

“An example of a seed well adapted to B.C. is the Blacktail Mountain Watermelon,” Sal Dominelli of Sweet Rock Farm Seeds on Gabriola Island tells the Straight. “It was bred as a northern hardy watermelon by a farmer named Glenn Drowns in Iowa, but this watermelon now grows well all over B.C., from our farm on the Gulf Islands up to Woodgrain Farm in the Kispiox Valley. But any seed that is grown for a few generations in a locale will be more adapted to it. That is why it’s important to know where your seeds are coming from.”

For beginner gardeners who may be intimidated by growing vegetables, Dominelli suggests starting small and focusing on what they love to eat.

“Seeds are amazing and they want to do one thing: grow,” he says. “We just need to help them do what they want to do. One tiny tomato seed can grow into a large plant—sometimes over two metres tall—laden with pounds of fruit. This is inspiring.”",[]

Wine lovers take note: Black Hills Estate Winery is celebrating the 20th anniversary of its flagship wine, Nota Bene, with a big splash.

Actor Jason Priestly, musician Steven Page (formerly of the Barenaked Ladies), and hip-hop musician Prevail (Swollen Members) are among the high-profile Canadians who will party down, virtually, with ticketholders at an online party on July 17.

The Nota Bene has become an iconic BC wine, with the 2018 vintage being the first crafted by winemaker Ross Wise, Master of Wine. It’s a blend of 49 percent Cabernet Sauvignon, 41 percent Merlot, nine percent Cabernet Franc, and—for the first time—one percent Petit Verdot.

Luscious and complex, the wine has aromas of ripe black fruits (think mulberries and plums) and a flavour profile marked by blackberries, mocha, and dried herbs. Take it to the next level by serving it with barbecued ribs or steak.

“Under Wise’s advice, the new vintage features a touch of Petit Verdot for added richness and complexity,” Glenn Fawcett, Black Hills’ “chief wine evangelist”, tells the Straight. “An important milestone like the 20th anniversary of this iconic wine demanded a party like no other.”

Although the winery sold out of regular bottles of the coveted drink faster than you can say “take note”, it has accelerated the release of the Nota Bene 2018 large formats: magnums (1.5L) and 3L bottles.

People who purchase prior to Tuesday (July 14) will gain exclusive access to the celebration. (These wines aren’t usually released until August, but due to large demand for access to the exclusive online activities, it is on sale early—a first.)

The party features a wine tasting with a live performance by Page and the chance to connect with Priestly, Prevail, and Olympics medal-winning freestyle skier Kelsey Serwa, among others.

Then there’s the after-party, which consists of multiple “rooms” to check out, which will include a live performance by country singer Julianna Laine and a set by DJ Chloe Morgan. There will be a Q&A with the winemaker and an on-the-crush-pad networking session and more.

Situated on Black Sage Road between Osoyoos and Oliver, Black Hills grows four clones of Cabernet Sauvignon, two clones of Cabernet Franc, and four clones of Merlot, each with its own unique terroir and character. Nota Bene magnums (1.5L) are $199 and the 3L bottles are $379. Each large format wine is autographed by Wise.

Summertime in B.C. typically means an abundance of glorious fresh fruit, from juicy peaches and dark-red cherries to the fuzziest of apricots and pretty, bright strawberries. Rather than stock up on imported produce, seek out B.C. goodness at grocery stores, farms, and fruit stands.

Strawberry season is all over the calendar this year, thanks to the weather; their readiness depends on where they’re being grown. Wherever and whenever you do find them, B.C. strawberries are thimbles of fresh-tasting perfection—true simple pleasures. Eat them mindfully: notice their gorgeous hue and fragrance before popping them in your mouth, one at a time, closing your eyes to concentrate solely on the sweet juice. They need nothing to be enjoyed.

On the other hand, there are all sorts of deliciously creative ways to incorporate B.C. fruit into your baking and cooking. Here’s some inspiration from a handful of culinary talents.

Strawberry, Rhubarb, and Rose Frangipane Tart Amy Ho

Amy Ho, founder of the Constellation Inspiration blog, shares a recipe for Strawberry, Rhubarb, and Rose Frangipane Tart in her recently released cookbook, Blooms and Baking: Add Aromatic, Floral Flavors to Cakes, Cookies, Candies and More. “This is the dessert I make the most in the summertime,” she writes. “No other dessert even comes close to this one.” It features a buttery crust, almond frangipane filling, a layer of sweet and tangy strawberry-rhubarb-rose compote, and roasted rhubarb. For the tart pictured in her book, she picked the berries herself at Krause Berry Farms and Estate Winery in Langley.

Ripe Vancouver Island fruit plays a starring role in Michelle Schulze’s Panna Cotta With Balsamic Strawberries, a recipe from the recently released BC Wine Lover’s Cookbook: Recipes & Stories From Wineries Across British Columbia by Jennifer Schell. Schulze is a member of the family behind Venturi-Schulze Vineyards in Cobble Hill, where they make not only several varieties of wine but also their own balsamic vinegar. In this dish, a pound of strawberries along with two teaspoons of berry sugar and two teaspoons of balsamic vinegar marinate in the fridge for 90 minutes, then are brought to room temperature before being spooned atop the creamy dessert, garnished with fresh mint sprigs.

At Vancouver restaurant Say Mercy!, executive chef Sean Reeve took some of the tastes and textures from his favourite summertime desserts and turned them into his Snow Cone Salad. He chips a granita made of Odd Society Spirits’ Mongrel moonshine over strawberries, beets, and rhubarb, finishing everything off with a honey vinaigrette. It’s summer in a colourful bowl.

Other ideas? Add strawberries to a butter lettuce with feta, red onion, avocado, and lime vinaigrette; use them with any other berries or fruit you have on hand for an old-fashioned crumble; and make an easy galette. Fresh berries can also be added to muffins, scones, banana bread, pound cake, or cinnamon buns, or you can purée them to fold into batter for next-level chocolate-chip cookies or madeleines.",[]

If COVID-19 had you join the sourdough-bread-baking craze, it’s time to take your starter to the next level.

Whitehorse-based chef and cookbook author Michele Genest, who blogs at the Boreal Gourmet, has been walking people through the basics via her Sourdough Bootcamp: “How to build your own sourdough starter and then use it for the rest of your life.”

Here, she shares her recipe for Sourdough Buttermilk Cranberry Scones, which appears in Boreal Gourmet: The Boreal Gourmet, Adventures in Northern Cooking.

You can swap out the cranberries for fresh B.C. blueberries or raspberries.

The beauty of scones is that they’re just as enjoyable on a wintry weekend as they are on a bright summer morning. Whip up a batch before a walk along the seawall or a Deep Cove paddleboarding session. They’ll keep you going. You keep the starter going.

Sourdough Buttermilk Cranberry Scones

Adapted from The Boreal Gourmet cookbook

Makes 16 wedge scones, 15 large drop scones and about 30 small drop scones

These scones are dense and soft, great fresh on the first day and toasted on the second. The leavening comes from baking powder and baking soda; the sourdough starter is there to add flavour and moisture.

Ingredients

200 g (about 1 cup) sourdough starter

1 cup buttermilk or yogurt (not Greek---you need a more liquid yogurt; if you only have Greek, use ¾ cup yogurt and ¼ cup milk)

175 g (about 1 cup) all-purpose flour

1 large egg, beaten

3 Tbsp melted butter, cooled

3 Tbsp sugar

1 tsp salt

2 tsp baking powder

1 tsp baking soda

additional 250 to 325 g (1½ to 2 cups) all-purpose flour

1 cup berries—low bush cranberry, blueberry or raspberry, fresh or frozen

Method

Preheat oven to 375F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside.

In a medium-sized bowl, stir the starter and the buttermilk or yogurt together until combined. Stir in the first 175 g (1 cup) flour.

Whisk together the cooled melted butter and egg, and add to the dough.

In a separate bowl, whisk together sugar, salt, baking soda and baking powder. Stir into the dough—you will probably notice some leavening action as the baking soda reacts with the buttermilk or yogurt.

Stir in 250 g flour (1½ cups), reserving the final 75 g (½ cup)—you may not need it, especially if you used yogurt rather than buttermilk.

The flour should be fully hydrated, and the dough cohesive and elastic and still somewhat sticky, clinging to the spoon but easy to remove with a floured hand.

Add more flour only if the dough seems too wet and sticky.

Stir in berries.

To make the classic wedge-shaped scones, divide the dough in two with a spatula or dough scraper. With floured hands, gather one half and place it on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Shape into a circle about 8 inches in diameter. With a floured knife, cut into 8 even sized wedges. Repeat with remaining dough.

For large drop scones, scoop half-cup portions of dough and drop onto the baking sheet about 2 inches apart. For small drop scones (handy for hikes or mid-afternoon snacks), drop dough from a dessert spoon, leaving about 1 inch of space between. (Sometimes I mix it up and make a combination of wedges, large drop scones and small drop scones.)

Bake small scones for 15 minutes, large drop scones for 20 minutes, and wedges for 25 minutes.",[]

For many Whistler-area visitors, the best way to wind up a day outdoors is to enjoy a glass (or two) of wine.

Before we get to places to sip terrific wine in and around Whistler Village, we recommend a day trip two hours north along spectacular Duffey Lake Road to Lillooet, the home of Fort Berens Estate Winery.

Situated at the southern end of the Cariboo Chilcotin region, Lillooet has a long, hot, dry summers, like the Okanagan, while cooler nights mean overall summer temperatures are lower. Riesling, Pinot Noir, Cabernet Franc, Chardonnay, and Pinot Gris all grow here.

A team of eight owns Fort Berens, Lillooet’s first winery, which launched in 2009 and has gone on to win scores of awards, including gold for its 2018 Chardonnay at last year’s San Francisco International Wine Competition. The winery prides itself on making on clean, fresh, terroir-driven wines that combine Old World elegance with New World fruit-forwardness.

New releases include the Rosé 2019, a 100-percent estate-grown Pinot Noir Rosé with notes of strawberry and crab apple, and Pinot Noir 2018, a sophisticated vintage aged in French oak barrels with hints of berries and pepper.

If not at the winery itself, you can find Fort Berens wines at various liquor stores, grocery stores, and restaurants throughout B.C.

While dining out in Whistler, order them at Araxi, Bar Oso, Il Caminetto, Sushi Village Japanese Restaurant, and Legs Diamond, to name just a few spots that carry them.

To discover other wines you never knew you loved, head to Bearfoot Bistro, which has B.C.’s biggest restaurant wine cellar, with more than 10,000 bottles. Among the 1,500 different labels the acclaimed restaurant offers are Dom Pérignon (eight vintages), Penfolds Grange, Château de Beaucastel, E. Guigal’s La, La, La (14 vintages), and Screaming Eagle. B.C., Bordeaux, Burgundy, Tuscany, Piedmont, Napa Valley, and Spain are regions of the lengthy list’s focus. Happy hour runs Wednesday to Sunday from 5 to 7 p.m. with glasses of red, white, or rosé for $9, and, with summer here, the Champagne Lounge is set up out on the swanky patio.
