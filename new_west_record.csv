Since June 2017, the rent bank has been providing low-cost loans to residents who are at risk of eviction and/or at risk of having their utilities disconnected.

“During the first three months of the pandemic (i.e. March 1 to May 31, 2020), the program issued 22 loans for a total of $27,462,” said a staff report to council. “If this pace of demand continues for the next nine months, this would result in 88 loans for a total of $109,848. This would be a dramatic increase when compared to the fiscal year (April 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020) in which the program issued 37 loans for a total of $40,775.”

The rent bank provides loans of up to $1,400 for individuals and up to $1,700 for families. The Lower Mainland Purpose Society operates the rent bank in New West.

On July 13, city council approved a staff recommendation to continue to fund the administrative costs of the New Westminster Rent Bank program. The city will contribute $35,000 annually for a three-year period from Sept. 1 to Aug. 31, 2023.

According to the report, the province has provided $48,400, with another $42,820 having been requested for the program. The city previously provided onetime funding of $100,000 to the rent bank in March to expand administrative and loan capacity in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“The program has a demonstrated need,” said the report. “It has been highly effective in preventing evictions and essential utility disconnections; it is one of the city’s tools in preventing homelessness; it has facilitated partnerships, including with the financial sector; and it has leveraged provincial funding,” said the report. “Regarding the latter, this was an objective of the program from its initiation.”

In 2015, New Westminster MLA Judy Darcy and her constituency office staff began working on the concept of creating a rent bank in New West by meeting with stakeholders and seeking financial contributions toward an endowment fund. After securing $35,000 in donations from a number of financial organizations, Darcy and her team received a commitment from city council in 2016 to support the program and to contribute $20,000 annually for three years (increased to $35,000 in December 2018) to cover administrative costs associated with operating a rent bank.

""If you prevent homelessness, you prevent that downward spiral that is really, really hard for people to get out of,"" Darcy told council when seeking the city’s support for the rent bank. ""There are a lot of people who are one paycheque away from being homeless.""",[]

Police set up a roadblock in the 900 block of McBride Blvd. early Sunday morning. At around 1:50 a.m., as police were checking drivers for sobriety, a car in the line attempted a U-turn across the center median, said police.

“The driver mounted the car on the center median and attempted to drive away,” said a news release. “As officers ran to the vehicle, the driver attempted to dislodge the stuck vehicle from the median by hard acceleration to evade arrest.”

The driver was unsuccessful at fleeing in the vehicle before officers arrived and arrested the driver. Once in custody, the officers located a gun (pictured) on the back seat with ammunition.

“Policing is an unpredictable line of work, where the situation can rapidly change from a routine impaired driving CounterAttack to a possible dangerous and unpredictable encounter,” said Sgt. Jeff Scott. “Having public safety at the forefront of their minds, officers put themselves in harm’s way to help prevent a potentially more dangerous situation from occurring.”

Robert Billard, a lifelong musician, did just that by creating Fifth Chord Studios in uptown New Westminster.

The old clinic sat empty for many years. It’s positioned under a medical building and resides mainly under the landscaping and walkway in the 600 block of Fifth Avenue.

Billard said he realized the opportunity the space provided and undertook extensive renovations to turn the space into a sound-controlled rehearsal and recording studio.

“This isn’t just any music space,” said Billard. “We’ve worked to develop a space that is accessible, comfortable, and professional. While in the process of setting it up, we talked about who we want this space to support, and made a special commitment to supporting Black, Indigenous and artists of colour.”

Fifth Chord Studios features five locked-off monthly-rent rehearsal spaces, a live recording space, control studio, and gathering area to relax and meet the other musicians post-pandemic.

A special feature of the space is that it is accessible for people in wheelchairs and with mobility limitations, including an accessible washroom and thoughtful considerations such as offering light dimmers and low-noise air flow for neuro-diverse musicians.

The walls currently feature visual art by local artists, including PJ Patten, Sherida Charles, and Iris Mes Low.

“We are working with Black and Indigenous musicians to determine what kinds of programs would support their work best and how we can support their art,” said Billard.

Following COVID-19 protocols, Fifth Chord Studios is available for viewing by appointment only. Musicians interested in renting space can contact Robert Billard directly at 778 789-0621. You can visit the website here.",[]

The notion of establishing a framework to commercialize cannabis began as a promise by the Liberal Party in the 2015 federal election campaign that led to Justin Trudeau becoming prime minister. The implementation of the policy was not as smooth as first envisioned, and the provincial governments were put in charge of setting guidelines for the sale and consumption of marijuana.

article continues below

Research Co. and Glacier Media have been tracking perceptions about legalization every six months in British Columbia. Our latest survey shows that agreement with the new rules remains high across the entire province, that some residents are starting to ponder a future when other drugs could be treated in the same fashion as cannabis, and that – in stark contrast with what we found last year – marijuana users in British Columbia are starting to acquire all of their product through licensed retailers.

As more time passes, British Columbians appear happier with the decision to end prohibition. Seven in 10 of the province’s residents (70%) agree with marijuana being legal in Canada, while 26% disagree and 3% are undecided.

These findings represent a seven-point increase since a similar survey conducted in October 2019, as legal cannabis approached its first anniversary. The groups that are more likely to voice satisfaction with the new status quo are men (75%), British Columbians aged 35 to 54 (76%) and residents of northern B.C. (80%).

In recent weeks, we have seen more talk about creating a safe supply for drugs that are currently available only through illegal means. The impact of these discussions has led to a shift in the views of British Columbians about legalizing all drugs. It must be completely acknowledged that sizable majorities of the province’s residents continue to oppose a move to place any controlled substance inside a store, but the proponents of this option have grown since late last year.

At least two-thirds of British Columbians are opposed to legalizing ecstasy (66%), powder cocaine (70%), heroin (72%), crack cocaine (73%), methamphetamine or “crystal meth” (74%) and fentanyl (75%).

Support for making some of these drugs available in a fashion that would conceivably meet the same guidelines that govern cannabis has risen over the past six months, to 25% for cocaine (up from 18%) and to 24% for heroin (up from 19%). While these are still low proportions, the fluctuation could signal the start of a trend.

Just 10% of British Columbians say they only consumed marijuana after it became legal. Identical proportions of residents tried it before October 2018 (45%) or have never consumed it in Canada (also 45%). The incidence of “legal-only” marijuana users is highest among residents aged 18 to 34 (18%) and those who live in southern B.C. (19%).

But perhaps the biggest surprise, and a source of satisfaction for policy makers, is the way in which cannabis is being sought by users. Just over half of British Columbians who have consumed marijuana since legalization (51%) say that all of their product was acquired at a licensed retailer. In October 2019, only 31% of cannabis consumers in the province were getting all of their product at a licensed retailer.

We still see 16% of British Columbians who say none of their marijuana has been bought at a licensed retailer – a proportion that climbs to 25% among those aged 55 and over. Two-thirds of cannabis consumers aged 35 to 54 (68%) are buying all of their product at a licensed retailer.

Even though the delivery of cannabis products has improved over the past six months, there are significant regional differences that are indubitably related to the presence of stores in specific areas of the province. Cannabis consumers who reside in southern B.C. and Metro Vancouver are the most likely to be getting all of their product from licensed retailers (63% and 62%). The numbers are significantly lower in Vancouver Island (29%), northern B.C. (24%) and the Fraser Valley (19%).

Finally, the issue of “drug testing” remains a priority for British Columbians, with 61% saying that companies in the province should “definitely” or “probably” be able to administer these examinations to any employee now that marijuana is legal.

After a bumpy start that featured slow store openings and hitches with delivery options, there are signs that cannabis legalization is starting to work in a better fashion. More consumers are getting all of their product through licensed retailers, and the number of “new users” has not increased dramatically. Still, the significant regional disparities suggest that more marijuana outlets will need to be authorized in order to effectively eliminate the black market.

“Advance fee loans, the second riskiest scam in Canada for 2019, continues to wreak havoc for B.C. residents in a financial bind because of the pandemic,” according to the BBB, which is warning consumers, who may be urgently trying to acquire funds, to be on “high alert” to avoid losing money and exposing their personal information.

article continues below

The BBB says that the reports its received from victims across the province show consumers are extremely susceptible to the scam.

As part of the scam, the BBB says consumers may receive an email or phone call, or – as in the case of more recent reports to the bureau’s Scam Tracker – a pop-up ad online or find a website while searching for a loan company.

In this con, scammers disguised as loan brokers and other lending institutions advertise and promise loans to those in a financial bind. The loan, which is guaranteed regardless of credit history, comes with upfront charges labelled as “taxes,” “insurance” or “processing fees.”

However, when the charges are paid, the loan never materializes and the applicant is left with larger debts. The BBB says that requiring advance fees for loans is illegal in Canada

“Typically, the scammers will ask you to pay a fee for a seemingly legitimate reason,” said Karla Laird, the BBB’s manager for community and public relations.

“Oftentimes, they require that payment to be made by wire transfer, bitcoin or some other hard-to-recover method. However, once the fee is paid, the phony loan company stops communication and the consumer cannot get a refund.”

Vancouver man loses nearly $1,500

In one instance of the scam, which was reported to the BBB, a Vancouver resident lost nearly $1,500 to a company he found online with an Ontario address on its website.

The company told the Vancouver man his loan was approved for $10,000 at the rate of seven per cent for four years, however, the company needed a three-month advance payment in order to release the funds – a total of $718.

The company also told the man that his credit is high risk, so he would need to pay $1,500 insurance for the lender, although the company would cover half. The company wanted the Vancouver man to send the money using Bitcoin.

The company, Kingsway Lending, according to the BBB, is using the address of a Canada Revenue Agency office in Ontario.

“Scammers understand that consumers are searching for websites that look professional, and will put effort into making your loan application process feel like the real deal,” said Laird.

“With this in mind, thorough research on a company before initiating any transactions, is the best way to avoid being tricked out of your money and personal information.”

What to look out for

The BBB says consumers should look out for the following red flags is they are searching for a lender or loan broker:

The health authority added the outbreak of C. difficile to its list of current outbreaks on July 14.

According to Health Canada, Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is a bacterium that causes mild to severe diarrhea and intestinal conditions like pseudomembranous colitis (inflammation of the colon). C. difficile is the most frequent cause of infectious diarrhea in hospitals and long-term care facilities in Canada, as well as in other industrialized countries.

C. difficile bacteria and their spores are found in feces. People can get infected if they touch surfaces contaminated with feces, and then touch their mouth. Healthcare workers can spread the bacteria to their patients if their hands are contaminated.

Symptoms include watery diarrhea, fever, loss of appetite, nausea, and abdominal pain/tenderness.

For healthy people, C. difficile does not pose a health risk. The elderly and those with other illnesses or who are taking antibiotics, are at a greater risk of infection.

Fraser Health asks all visitors to use our hand hygiene stations when they enter and exit its facilities, particularly if there is a reported outbreak.

If you have any of the following, please do not visit at this time:

Vomiting or diarrhea

Cough or flu-like symptoms

Fever

Rash

If you are visiting someone who is located on an outbreak unit, visitors may be limited to two people at a time. Fraser Health asks that you do not visit other patient rooms or common areas on the unit such as the lounge and patient kitchenette. It also recommends you don’t visit public areas in the hospital such as the cafeteria and gift shop.",[]

Hate-fuelled graffiti on the home of a Summerland family. Systemic racism and sexism, both overt and covert, at all levels of society.

Prejudice is indeed pandemic. Bigotry is a virus. And we all have the potential to be hosts (even those of us from racialized minorities).

We’re not born with it in our blood. It’s transmitted from person to person. From family to family. It’s learned through conversations, comments, jokes, judgements, looks, books, micro-aggressions, political rhetoric, insults, attitudes, ignorance, and even classroom lesson plans.

It infects entire institutions to the point where everyone within the organization becomes immune to biased hiring practices, offensive language, token diversity, racial and religious profiling, and exclusive, patriarchal power structures.

And like COVID-19, it won’t just go away on its own. We have to track it and attack it. We have to trace it, isolate it, and call it out. By name. Persistently. We have to propose anti-racist policies, pass anti-racist laws, and push for anti-racist consequences.

We have to stop passively and proudly saying we’re not racist. And we have to start actively and loudly being anti-racist. We have to listen to those with lived experience.

We have to hold elected officials (and each other) accountable. We have to. And we can.

The world has changed dramatically over the last two months, since George Floyd took his last breath on May 25, 2020. In many ways, the globe has gotten smaller, as evidenced by the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus (with about 13.5 million cases worldwide and over 580,000 deaths and rising), and the massive outpouring of protesters on city streets from Vancouver to Sydney screaming that Black Lives Matter.

No matter what language we speak or what corner of the Earth we inhabit, “social distancing” has become a part of our everyday vocabulary and behaviour.

Yet science has proven that all human beings – regardless of colour, class, culture, gender, or sexual orientation – are inextricably linked like never before.

As the motto goes, we’re all in this together. Overnight, we’ve all become armchair epidemiologists. Following the lead of our Provincial Health Officer, Dr. Bonnie Henry, British Columbians have sacrificed and worked hard to flatten the curve of COVID-19.

Complacency is not an option. We can’t afford to go backwards. And we must be equally vigilant and aggressive to finally squash the scourge of white supremacy, police brutality, systemic racism, and hatred in all its insidious forms.

Silence is no longer acceptable. We’re in a pandemic. And lives are at stake.

The city has received rezoning and development permit applications related to a proposed five-storey residential building being proposed at 909 to 915 12th St. The project would include nine ground-oriented units.

Artist's rendering of a building being proposed on 12th Street. - Contributed

In a four to three vote, council directed staff to process a rezoning and development permit application for 909 to 915 12 St., as well as an official community plan amendment application for part of the rear lane adjacent to the site. Mayor Jonathan Cote, along with councillors Patrick Johnstone, Nadine Nakagawa and Mary Trentadue, supported the staff recommendation, while councillors Chinu Das, Jaimie McEvoy and Chuck Puchmayr were opposed.

In order to build this project, the applicant would buy a 96.6-square-metre (1,040-squrae-foot) city-owned lane at the rear of the property.

According to a staff report, the site’s current zoning allows for the development of a four-storey commercial or mixed-used building. While the site would need to be rezoned in order for the project to proceed, the report stated the five-storey residential building being proposed is consistent with the official community plan’s designation for the site, except for the city-owned lane.

Das noted three small businesses will be lost as a result of this proposal. She said upper 12th Street has been a vibrant area, but that could change if it becomes entirely residential and loses its retail.

“There will be no reason for people to step out into the street. Who would want to walk down 12th Street? Where is the activity? Where is the vibrancy?” she said. “Although I have nothing against this proposal per se – it is in its preliminary stage – my worry is that there is going to be more and more and more.”

Das questioned how many other development proposals are in the works on upper 12th Street that would see ground-level commercial replaced by residential.

“I don’t have the exact number of projects at my fingertips,” Jackie Teed, the city’s senior manager of development services, told council July 13. “However, I am aware of two that we are currently evaluating, potentially three. There’s one that is a little bit behind the rest.”

Puchmayr said the updated official community plan (OCP) didn’t provide protection of all of the commercial spaces on upper 12th Street. He said the area where this project is proposed is relatively flat, so it makes sense to have commercial at that location.

“I am very concerned about 12th Street. It is an incubator for a lot of new immigrants and small businesses. It has some affordable rents,” he said. “As soon as the OCP passed, there was a rash of purchases of these commercial businesses, which showed that people were literally buying them up to develop multi-family or residential properties at the expense of commercial.”

Puchmayr said he’d like council to send the application back to staff and have them tell the proponent that the city won’t sell the lane unless the development includes commercial space.

Mayor Jonathan Cote said a retail strategy that’s getting underway will consider issues related to 12th Street. During the official community plan process, he said some people expressed concern that the 12th Street business district was “too long to be a thriving business district” and would benefit by having a more compact commercial area.

“Whether that was the right decision or not, that’s what came out of the OCP process. Certainly I would be more than open in reengaging in this conversation,” he said. “We are embarking on a retail strategy, which I support, which very well may revisit that strategy.”

Based on council’s past instructions to staff, Cote said some development applications on 12th Street will still be coming to council for its consideration.

In June 2019, council and staff discussed the impact that new development is having on existing businesses on 12th Street. Council directed staff to report back on the impact of temporarily suspending all 12th Street development permits.

Council subsequently considered a staff recommendation to support continued application review of the four in-stream development applications on upper 12th Street, but to temporarily suspend any new rezoning applications for mixed-used sites until staff completes the retail strategy and the upper 12th Street land-use strategy. Instead of staff’s recommendation, council voted three to two in favour of considering new development applications on 12th Street on a case-by-case basis.

Base d on that decision, Cote said it would be “problematic” to now notify an applicant that council won’t consider its application.

“I think we need to be more consistent there,” he said. “The message we gave is, we would at least consider the application. Ultimately, this has to go through a full public process and is not necessarily going to be supported by council. But to me, I think the decision we made is that we would see these processes through, so I will be consistent with that.”",[]

Dr. Michael Schwandt, who was one of the first infectious disease specialists from Vancouver Coastal Health to help contain outbreaks at sites like the Lynn Valley Care Centre, made the comments not long after a group of 239 scientists from 32 countries wrote an open letter to the World Health Organization, successfully appealing for the world health body to change its guidance on aerosolized transmission.

article continues below

“We'll be watching closely the science around airborne transmission. At this time, we don't think it's played a major role in the outbreaks in Vancouver Coastal Health that we've had direct experience with,” said Dr. Schwandt.

The new W.H.O. guidance, which came last Thursday, accepts that the novel coronavirus can spread through aerosolized particles — tiny droplets in the air — in crowded indoor settings for prolonged periods of time.

“There have been reported outbreaks of COVID-19 in some closed settings, such as restaurants, nightclubs, places of worship or places of work where people may be shouting, talking, or singing.

“In these outbreaks, aerosol transmission, particularly in these indoor locations where there are crowded and inadequately ventilated spaces where infected persons spend long periods of time with others, cannot be ruled out,” reads the W.H.O.’s new guidance, which also calls for more research into aerosol transmission. aerosol transmission.

But Dr. Schwandt said his team doesn’t view the airborne versus droplet transmission debate as a binary, and that while the virus can be traced at varying distances at concentrations, most of the cases he’s come across in Vancouver Coastal Health region, home to the first outbreaks in the country, have been from “face-to-face” transmission.

The proof, he said, comes from Vancouver Coastal’s success in tracing contacts based on direct contact, an experience a spokesperson for Fraser Health told the Tri-City News has been echoed in their health authority.

“Without taking airborne transmission into account as a risk factor, we've been able to bring outbreaks under good control, really looking at close physical contact as the main risk factor,” said Dr. Schwandt.

That means, at the moment, current ventilation systems in places like long-term care homes are not considered a risk factor in the spread of the virus.

Airborne or not, sharing air in large, indoor public gatherings raises everyone’s risk of transmitting the virus, as Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry reminded British Columbians in her daily update Tuesday.

“Stay away from closed spaces as much as possible,” she said. “If it’s a house party, you may not know all the people who are there.”

And like the W.H.O., health officials in B.C. said they are keeping an eye on the science.

“If more evidence were to develop around airborne or aerosol transmission, then naturally we'd need to look at preventative measures that include attention to ventilation,” said Dr. Schwandt.",[]

Provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix announced July 15 that there were 21 new cases in the past 24 hours, including two cases that they call ""epi-linked,"" or presumed cases that have not been proven through testing but are being treated as official cases.

article continues below

The province has now recorded 3,149 cases since the novel coronavirus first appeared in B.C. in late January.

More than 87.4% of those infected, or 2,753 people, have recovered. Of those who haven't, 189 people have died and 207 people are actively fighting the virus. Only 14 people are hospitalized, with five of those in intensive care units. The rest are self-isolating at home. There were no new deaths recorded in the past 24 hours.

Recording at least 20 new COVID-19 cases in a 24-hour period has become common in B.C., and Henry said yesterday that she found that number ""distressing,"" even though, she added, the good news is that the province knows where the clusters of infection are, many of the infections are linked and the number is not really that large given the province's population of more than five million residents.

The numbers in the past week were:

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12;

• 21 new cases on July 13;

• 13 new cases on July 14; and now

• 21 new cases on July 15.

In June, the number of daily new cases many times was in the single digits.

""There is one active community outbreak, in addition to several community exposure events,"" Henry and Dix said. ""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks.""

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,023 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,659 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 216 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 51 people who reside outside Canada.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons is expected to take Sidoo into custody on September 23 and release him from a Pacific Northwest area facility just before Christmas.

article continues below

Sidoo, 61, appeared online via Zoom in front of United States District Judge Nathaniel Gorton of the United States District Court for District of Massachusetts, as well as his lawyers and prosecutors. He wore a plaid suit while sitting in an office space inside his $31.7 million home in Vancouver’s Point Grey neighbourhood.

Sidoo, now a convicted felon, initially pled innocent to fraud and money laundering charges; he teared up before being sentenced and read a prepared statement:

“The last several months have been the hardest in my entire life and today I accept the court’s decision without reservation. No words can express how sorry I am for my decisions and actions that led to this day. I make no excuses, your honour. I broke the law and pled guilty and I now must pay for my actions.

“To my wife and boys, all I ever wanted was your love and respect and to be a good role model. And I know I have made a terrible mistake that has deeply affected our family. To my friends and colleagues and former teammates over the years, I am deeply ashamed today. To the young men and women who looked up to me as a role model, you deserve better. To the court and all of you, I wish to apologize for my actions.

“I will serve my sentence and am committed to returning to the community and doing everything possible to make a positive impact. I hope in time people will not judge me for the worst mistake in my life but for the work in the days, weeks and years ahead in which I am committed to being a better man.”

Gorton told Sidoo he was “impressed” by the businessman’s “obvious remorse.”

But Gorton pointed out two omissions in Sidoo’s statement.

“You expect to put this behind you and go forward and make up for what you called mistakes. I would call it a crime, not a mistake, but nevertheless, it is important that you acknowledge it and realize how many constituencies you have disappointed,” said the judge.

Sidoo also did not explicitly acknowledge that his crimes resulted in two students missing an opportunity to attend the universities his sons, Dylan Sidoo and Jordan Sidoo, were admitted to.

“What you accomplished, along with getting them into college, is to deprive two other deserving students of admittance into those universities — an act that is the very antithesis of one you want to be known for,” said Gorton.

Likewise, United States Attorney Andrew Lelling submitted to Gorton: “Sidoo engaged in serious criminal conduct involving fraud and deception that stretched over multiple years.

“His crimes warrant significant punishment. By engaging in the scheme, with [scheme mastermind Rick Singer] and others, Sidoo was able to steal two college admissions slots for his sons, including one from the University of California at Berkeley, one of the top public universities in the nation.”

Sidoo, said Gorton, “committed a crime that displayed an unbelievable lack of integrity, morality and common sense.

“You have let your selfish desire, your pride and your enormous wealth overcome all of what you apparently want to stand for with your works of charity,” Gorton told Sidoo.

Sidoo’s philanthropy, derived from his earnings in the capital markets, was central to his sentencing defense. According to Sidoo he has donated several million dollars to charitable causes, such as the University of B.C. football program.

In pleading guilty to fraud, Sidoo avoided a maximum prison term of 20 years and prosecutors subsequently agreed to 90 days behind bars, plus a $250,000 fine and one-year of supervised release, which will not be enforced in Canada by the U.S. Probation Department. Prosecutors also agreed to drop the money laundering charge.

The prison Sidoo goes to is expected to have harsher conditions since his options are limited due to his foreign citizenship. His attorney Martin Weinberg said he is expected to spend 14 days in isolation in a “maximum security setting,” due to COVID-19.

Sidoo will get four days credit for time already served. If he serves the full 90 days he will be released December 17 but will have to spend 14 days in isolation at home should B.C. public health rules for international travellers and COVID-19 continue into the fall.

Gorton said Sidoo’s crime would normally warrant more time in jail but there are mitigating circumstances, such as his remorse, lack of criminal record, philanthropy and “collateral consequences,” such as not being able to enter the U.S. as a felon and being stripped last month of his Order of B.C. medal for community service. Sidoo’s attorneys also previously noted he did not directly pay the universities but that his fraud was limited to cheating on the tests.

The former B.C. Lions football player worked as a stock broker in the 1990s and an investment banker between 2000 and 2010. Since 2010 he has made millions of dollars directing a handful of public companies that have failed to generate wealth for retail investors.

Sidoo was arrested March 8, 2019, in San Jose, California, on charges by the U.S. Department of Justice of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering related to the high-profile U.S. college admissions and bribery scandal, brought to light by a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe dubbed Operation Varsity Blues.

One of dozens of parents to be charged, Sidoo initially pled innocent to paying $200,000 total to scheme mastermind William ‘Rick’ Singer, who hired corrupt exam expert Mark Riddell to take Dylan and Jordan’s SAT exams, in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Sidoo also helped falsify one of his son Jordan’s university applications in October 2013 with an essay that originally included a fake claim of Jordan being held up at gunpoint by gangsters, while he was purported to be an intern for an anti-gang organization.

Co-conspirators Singer and Riddell pled guilty last year in exchange for cooperating with the government’s investigation.

The guilty parties in the case, who used Singer’s criminal services, were generally well-off individuals. Celebrities such as actress Lori Loughlin and her clothing designer husband Mossimo Gianulli and actress Felicity Huffman also pled guilty for related crimes and brought much media attention to the investigation.

Sidoo’s sons had no involvement in their father’s crime.

Jordan is now a 2018 history graduate from University of California Berkeley. Dylan graduated in cinematic arts in 2016 from the University of Southern California (USC). The two previously attended Vancouver’s prestigious St. George’s School.

Neither university has announced whether or not their degrees will remain valid. Dylan, according to the sentencing documents, had scored a 1,460/2,400 SAT score until Riddell, using a fake ID in December 2011, bumped up the score to 1,700, which was high enough for Dylan to enter Chapman University (and later transfer to USC). Riddell then scored 2,280/2,400 for Jordan in December 2012, paving the way to Berkley.

Riddell also took a high school test for Dylan. The B.C. Ministry of Education has issued no statement on how its testing process was so vulnerable to fraud.

Both sons have since entered into penny stock promotion with their father.

In one cluster, at least 17 cases have been traced to a group of people who met up in Kelowna, some from the Interior and Alberta, others from the Lower Mainland.

article continues below

“There are a number of people who have been exposed in those events,” said Henry Tuesday.

More troubling still is the emergence of new cases at the Krazy Cherry Fruit Company in Oliver, where two have been identified among migrant workers. They were among 62 cases identified in B.C. between Friday and Monday.

“Public health teams are monitoring the situation closely and have placed restrictions on those living and working on the farm to limit the potential for further transmission,” said Dr. Henry in a written statement today.

But others have expressed concerns that not enough is being done to prevent outbreaks among vulnerable groups. Where newly arrived immigrants were disproportionately affected at earlier outbreaks at poultry plants in Coquitlam, others say migrant agricultural workers still run higher risks due to inadequate housing.

“As anticipated,” said Byron Cruz of Sanctuary Health, an organization that works to protect migrant workers from predatory practices. “We knew that something was going to happen because the situation for housing in that farm is terrible. They were all crowded.”

‘WAY ABOVE MY COMFORT ZONE’

Yesterday, Dr. Henry warned 25 cases a day was “distressing” and “cautionary to us.” And while not unexpected due to the increased travel and social interaction of phase 3, she said “That’s way above my comfort zone.”

Dr. Henry urged anyone who attended Canada Day parties in the vicinity of the Kelowna cluster to self-monitor for even the mildest of symptoms, noting that anyone can be tested should they feel they’ve been exposed.

Just how quickly a province or state can backslide has been painted in stark relief among our neighbours to the south.

In comments to the press Tuesday, Health Minister Adrian Dix pointed to surges in several U.S. states where record breaking daily caseloads in several states have led jurisdictions like California to re-introduce physical distancing protocols, in what Dix described as “lockdown 2.0.”

“All our neighbouring jurisdictions continue to see an increase, whether it’s our neighbouring province to the east, Alberta, or others, Washington, Oregon and California, in Nevada, Arizona and in other American states — we’ve seen record days of new cases of COVID-19 recently,” said Dix.

Here in B.C., Henry said that on Monday, she checked how weekly caseloads are tracking with the province’s modelling that suggests British Columbians keep their social contacts to 65% of normal.

“We are still skirting that line. The RT, the reproductive number, is hovering around one… which is sort of pushing the limits of where we need to be,” she said.

While health officials work to contain the outbreak in Oliver, it’s unclear how a potential surge in cases will affect that calculation, and Byron Cruz of Sanctuary Health said he expects more cases to crop up in coming days due to their tight living quarters.

What is clear is the more cases are contained to a single cluster, the easier they are to track.

“This is going to be our dance over the next few months, where we do what we can do, we travel, we have those social interactions, but we do it in a thoughtful way so we do it with the people we know we’re with,” said Dr. Henry.",[]

The man and woman, who have asked not to be identified, were taken in by what appeared to be a call from their grandson in dire need of help.

article continues below

“The guy sounded so much like our grandson. If he had said ‘Grandma,’ we’d have known [it wasn’t him] right away, but he said ‘Nan’ and so does my grandson,” said the man.

The imposter grandson, who used their grandson’s name, called on Monday and told them he had been driving a friend’s car and struck a vehicle with Quebec licence plates that had turned sharply in front of him.

The fake grandson went on to say he had been taken to jail, but a judge would free him if he could pay for the damage, estimated to be $5,000. The grandparents were told to send money to the car’s owner in Montreal.

“I wasn’t cluing in at all [that this was a scam], he sounded so much like our grandson,” the man said.

The dutiful grandparents then took cash from their bank and went to the Bank of Montreal and using an account number the scammer had provided via an accomplice posing as a lawyer, they sent money to a BMO branch in downtown Montreal.

“The kid said, ‘Please don’t tell Dad,’ ” the man said. It wasn’t until he later talked to his grandson that it became clear they had been scammed.

The couple has since been in touch with police and the Bank of Montreal, which they say has been very helpful.

“They are doing their best to try and get the money back,” said the man, who thinks the scammers “took a shot in the dark and got lucky.”

But according to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre, it’s likely the scammers mined information like the grandson’s name from social media to make the pitch more convincing.

The centre calls these types of scams “the emergency scam.” It preys on the fear of a loved one being hurt or in trouble. The scammer claims to be someone you know and says they need money immediately. They tend to use scenarios like needing bail money because they’ve been arrested, or being in a car accident, or having trouble returning from a foreign country.

The targets are often seniors and the scammer pretends to be a grandchild, who begs them not to tell their parents that they’re in trouble, the Anti-Fraud Centre said. As a result, the grandparent doesn’t find out until after they’ve sent the money that their grandchild was not the person who asked for help.

Const. Cam MacIntyre said scammers will go to any lengths to defraud a victim.

“They will pose as a family member, a trusted member of the public, or even the police. We strongly recommend that people never deposit money into accounts of people or entities they do know personally,” he said.

“It’s so important to verify where your money is going. Call a family member, a friend, or the police if you are suspicious.”

The Anti-Fraud Centre says there were 18,803 reports of fraud, and 6,671 victims reporting losses of $22.6 million in Canada in the first four months of this year.

MacIntyre suggests if you are in the process of providing financial information or sending money to potential fraudsters, stop immediately.

“Contact your financial institutions and ensure all payments that you have not authorized are stopped. Inform them of the fraud and change both passwords and access information,” he said.

Suspected frauds can be reported to your local police or the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre at 1-888-495-8501.

Giroux notes that loss is a sharp turnaround from the $7.3 billion in gains for the 12-month period ending in March.

He says losses are unusual for these Crown corporations and adds that each should provide detailed projections to Parliament as soon as possible about its COVID-19 liquidity programs.

Similarly, Giroux says the Liberals should provide details of their own borrowing, which his office estimates will exceed by $150 billion the ceiling set by federal legislation.

The report released Thursday also notes $4.4 billion in spending for measures the government has yet to announce.

All the spending is expected to push the federal debt past the $1-trillion mark.

The Liberals had previously made a declining debt-to-GDP ratio key to their fiscal plans, but skyrocketing spending will push the ratio to 49 per cent from 31.1 per cent.

Giroux says fiscal transparency and accountability would be enhanced if the Liberals identify their new ""fiscal anchor,"" how they'll measure their own successful handling of the budget and national economy, which wasn't specifically laid out in the update last week.

He said the federal government will contribute $19 billion under the ""Safe Restart Agreement.""

The money is to help the lower-tier governments with needs such as funding child care, bailing out cities whose expenses have soared and revenues plunged, increasing contact-tracing capacity, and buying personal protective equipment.

Trudeau had promised $14 billion in early June, but several premiers resisted some of the conditions the federal Liberals wanted to put on the money and said it wasn't enough.

Ontario's Doug Ford was one who didn't like a federal demand that some of it fund up to 10 days of paid sick leave to discourage workers with precarious employment from going into work ill. Quebec's Francois Legault wanted the money to be transferred without conditions so provinces could use it on whatever they considered most important.

Trudeau said the agreement outlines seven priority areas, with some flexibility for the provinces to apply the money to their particular needs over the next six to eight months.

""The provinces agreed to invest in the targeted sectors,"" Trudeau said. ""There are areas like support for vulnerable people where we will expect the provinces to declare publicly what they will do.""

At his side, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland added the agreement includes standards in certain areas, such as COVID-19 testing, in exchange for the federal money.

The pandemic is a health crisis, but Trudeau said it has a deep economic dimension that the funding is intended to address.

He said workers can't work if their children don't have safe care, and many can't get to their jobs if they don't have access to safe transit systems.

That means funding public services better so they don't have to rely on crowding many people into small spaces for their finances to make sense.

Municipal governments, which deliver many of those services, have been warning for months that their finances are careening toward brick walls and have been begging for aid.

Canada's largest city, Toronto, has reported that it's facing a $1.35-billion deficit this year. Montreal says it has a $500-million shortfall. Halifax expects to be short $85.4 million.

""The ruin of the First Nations and peoples of Canada is not just statistics. As seen here, it is real pain,"" Justice Chris Martin said in a written decision delivered July 10.

article continues below

Anthony McKay was sentenced to four years after pleading guilty to manslaughter in the death of his mother, Shirley McKay. He faces two years behind bars, after receiving credit for time already served, and will be subject to three years of supervised probation after that.

""As a human, Mrs. McKay deserved better. And, like anyone born in this bountiful country, her son, her killer, deserved a better start, a better chance, in life,"" Martin wrote.

The judge said the killing on the Berens River First Nation, about 300 kilometres north of Winnipeg, was a ""calamity of almost 150 years of government policy, actions and inactions affecting the Indigenous community.""

Anthony McKay, who was 21 at the time, went to his mother's home after a night of drinking on June 22, 2018.

Court was told there was blood everywhere when a cousin came over about 8 a.m. The cousin found Shirley McKay unconscious and badly beaten. Her son has said he doesn't know why he viciously beat her.

The woman was taken to a nursing station before being transported to a hospital in Winnipeg. Her son visited her in hospital daily and was overheard at her bedside sobbing and apologizing.

Court heard he was confronted by a stepbrother and admitted that he had hurt his mother.

Shirley McKay died that September. Her son was arrested the following month.

""She did not recover and died months later, another victim in a mass of slain Aboriginal women,"" Martin said. ""He pled guilty to manslaughter, joining an appalling line of young Aboriginals ending up in prison.""

Crown prosecutors were asking for a seven-year sentence in a federal penitentiary. The defence asked for two years behind bars plus the probation so that McKay could have access to programming available in provincial custody.

The judge pointed to impacts of colonization, the pass system which restricted Indigenous Peoples' movement, residential schools and the '60s Scoop in his sentencing.

""It is well accepted that the government's role, since the early days of dealing with First Nations peoples, has had the effect of isolating, infantilizing, marginalizing, and traumatizing Indigenous societies like the Ojibwa (or Anishinaabe) of Berens River,"" Martin wrote.

""Mr. McKay is a person shaped by a system historically designed to 'take the Indian out of the Indian.'""

Reports provided to the judge on McKay's background said he has partial fetal alcohol syndrome.

One of 13 siblings, he spent most of his time in foster homes on the First Nation or more often in Winnipeg. His parents struggled with alcohol and sniffing substances, and McKay followed a similar path starting when he was 13. His father died in 2010.

McKay was neglected and not cared for, files from child and family services said. He asked to become a permanent ward of child welfare in 2013 because he didn't feel safe with his family.

Martin said McKay's troubled upbringing doesn't excuse his behaviour, but does help explain why he is who he is.

Occasionally it is incumbent on a judge to underscore systemic issues, he said, adding Indigenous people are disproportionately affected by serious crime and disproportionately incarcerated.

""Like so many other cases, this case is troubling, not only for its specific facts, but because it reminds that core issues affecting many in the Indigenous population are not really being addressed sufficiently or urgently enough,"" Martin wrote.

""Many in this and the next generation of Indigenous people are at risk.""

The FBI is investigating the hack, according to a person familiar with the probe who was not authorized to discuss an ongoing probe and spoke on the condition of anonymity Thursday.

article continues below

The ruse discovered Wednesday included bogus tweets from Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Mike Bloomberg and a number of tech billionaires including Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Celebrities Kanye West and his wife, Kim Kardashian West, were also hacked.

Hackers used social engineering to target some of Twitter’s employees and then gained access to the high-profile accounts. The attackers sent out tweets from the accounts of the public figures, offering to send $2,000 for every $1,000 sent to an anonymous Bitcoin address.

Cybersecurity experts say such a breach could have dire consequences since the attackers were tweeting from verified, globally influential accounts with millions of followers.

""If you receive a tweet from a verified account, belonging to a well-known and therefore trusted person, you can no longer assume it’s really from them,"" said Michael Gazeley, managing director of cybersecurity firm Network Box.

Reacting to the breach, Twitter swiftly deleted the tweets and locked down the accounts to investigate. In the process it prevented verified users from sending out tweets for several hours.

The company said Thursday it has taken ""significant steps to limit access to internal systems and tools.""

Many celebrities, politicians and business leaders often use Twitter as a public platform to make statements. U.S. President Donald Trump, for example, regularly uses Twitter to post about national and geopolitical matters, and his account is closely followed by media, analysts and governments around the world.

Twitter faces an uphill battle in regaining people’s confidence, Gazeley said. For a start, it needs to figure out exactly the accounts were hacked and show the vulnerabilities have been fixed, he said.

""If key employees at Twitter were tricked, that’s actually a serious cybersecurity problem in itself,"" he said. ""How can one of the world’s most used social media platforms have such weak security, from a human perspective?""

Rachel Tobac, CEO of Socialproof Security, said that the breach appeared to be largely financially motivated. But such an attack could cause more serious consequences.

""Can you imagine if they had taken over a world leader’s account, and tweeted out a threat of violence to another country’s leader?"" asked Tobac, a social engineering hacker who specializes in providing training for companies to protect themselves from such breaches.

Social engineering attacks typically target human weaknesses to exploit networks and online platforms. Companies can guard themselves against such attacks by beefing up multi-factor authentication -– where users have to present multiple pieces of evidence as authentication before being allowed to log into a system, Tobac said.

Such a process could include having a physical token that an employee must have with them, on top of a password, before they can log into a corporate or other private system. Other methods include installing technical tools to monitor for suspicious insider activities and reducing the number of people who have access to an administrative panel, Tobac said.

Several U.S. lawmakers called on Twitter to co-operate with authorities including the Department of Justice and the FBI to secure the site.

""I am concerned that this event may represent not merely a co-ordinated set of separate hacking incidents but rather a successful attack on the security of Twitter itself,"" said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican.

He added that millions of users relied on Twitter not just to send tweets but also communicate privately via direct messaging. Twitter hasn't said if hackers were able to access the private messages of their high-profile targets.

Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden said Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey told him in a private conversation in 2018 that the company was working on protecting direct messages, known as DMs, with end-to-end encryption.

But that promise never materialized, Wyden said Thursday, leaving everyone's private messages ""vulnerable to employees who abuse their internal access to the company’s systems, and hackers who gain unauthorized access.""

""This is a vulnerability that has lasted for far too long, and one that is not present in other, competing platforms,"" Wyden said in an emailed statement. ""If hackers gained access to users’ DMs, this breach could have a breathtaking impact, for years to come.""

Mohammed Shahed, a member of the governing party who regularly appeared on TV talk shows, was arrested Wednesday by the Rapid Action Battalion near the Indian border after a nine-day manhunt.

article continues below

Shahed is chairman of the Regent Group and owner of two Regent hospitals in the capital, Dhaka.

Abdul Baten, a commissioner of the Detective Branch in Dhaka, said Shahed admitted after his arrest that his hospitals did not have proper equipment to conduct coronavirus tests.

A court in Dhaka on Thursday allowed investigators to keep Shahed in custody for 10 days for questioning.

Officials said the hospitals had issued more than 10,000 coronavirus test results and about 60% were fake even though patients were charged for them. The hospitals allegedly arranged for the remaining tests to be conducted by another hospital.

The two hospitals had not renewed their medical licenses for years, but the Ministry of Health nevertheless signed a deal with Shahed to dedicate the hospitals to coronavirus testing and treatment as the number of cases rose in Bangladesh.

Bangladesh on Thursday was nearing 200,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, including 2,496 deaths. Public health experts say the actual number is much higher because only about 70 testing facilities are available in the country of 160 million people.

Shahed belongs to the governing Awami League party headed by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and is a member of its foreign affairs subcommittee. He has more than 50 illegal cases pending against him across the country on various charges including forgery and cheating.

Another doctor and her husband were also arrested recently on similar charges of falsifying test results.

Local media reports say the scams could hurt Bangladesh’s earnings from overseas workers. Last week, Italy suspended all flights from Bangladesh to Rome after some Bangladeshis reportedly presented fake negative test reports for the coronavirus.

Bangladesh earns about $19 billion a year from about 10 million overseas workers. Authorities said about 15,000 Bangladeshi workers with jobs in Italy remain stranded in Bangladesh and it is unclear whether they will be able to travel to the European country.

The Anti-Defamation league and some Jewish leaders had condemned what they called anti-Semitic theories expressed by Cannon and demanded the apology.

article continues below

""First and foremost I extend my deepest and most sincere apologies to my Jewish sisters and brothers for the hurtful and divisive words that came out of my mouth during my interview with Richard Griffin,"" Cannon said on his Twitter account.

""They reinforced the worst stereotypes of a proud and magnificent people and I feel ashamed of the uninformed and naïve place that these words came from. The video of this interview has since been removed.""

ViacomCBS cut ties with the TV host and producer Tuesday in response to his comments on a podcast where he discussed racial bias.

Rabbi Abraham Cooper, the Simon Wiesenthal Center’s associate dean, told The Associated Press that Cannon reached out to him Wednesday and during a 30-minute telephone conversation he apologized to the Jewish community and Cooper asked him to post it on social media.

""He started out the right way, he said the right things. Half an hour is a long time, and we'll probably meet tomorrow in the LA area,"" Cooper said.

""He understood that the words and references that he thought were based on fact, turned out to be hateful propaganda and stereotypical rhetoric.""

The TV host and producer wrote earlier a lengthy Facebook post defending himself and criticizing his firing for what the company deemed ""bigotry"" and ""anti-Semitism,"" prominent members of the U.S. Jewish community said the post fell well short and demanded an apology.

""It’s not enough to say, ‘I’m not a racist, I’m not a bigot,’"" Cooper had told the AP earlier. ""The statements he made are hurtful, and they’re false.""

Cooper said Cannon should read and heed the words of Martin Luther King Jr., who ""dedicated his life for civil rights for all and a colour-blind America."" Cooper also had advised him to seek out the guidance of basketball Hall of Famer-turned-writer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who has condemned several sports and entertainment celebrities for anti-Semitic posts.

In the hour-plus episode of ""Cannon's Class"" released last month that prompted his firing, Cannon and Richard ""Professor Griff"" Griffin, formerly of the rap group Public Enemy, contended that Black people are the true Hebrews and Jews have usurped that identity.

Cannon then argued that lighter-skinned people — ""Jewish people, white people, Europeans"" — ""are a little less"" and have a ""deficiency"" that historically caused them to act out of fear and commit acts of violence to survive.

""They had to be savages,"" he said.

""When I first heard about the comments Mr. Cannon made, it was very, very disappointing,"" said Oren Segal, director of the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism. ""We’re in a time where hatred of all kinds is very much apparent. It’s in the news every day.""

""Anti-Semitism in particular over the past several years has been something that we've seen in increase , as well as racism and other issues,"" Segal added. ""So when you hear an individual who has a public profile, who has influence over people, make statements that are highly offensive to the Jewish community, the first reaction is disappointment.""

Anti-Semitic violent attacks rose worldwide by 18% in 2019 compared with the previous year, according to a report published in April by Tel Aviv University’s Kantor Center for the Study of Contemporary Jewry.

Segal said some members of the Black Hebrew Israelite movement see themselves as the true ""chosen people,"" and believe that Blacks, Hispanics and Native Americans are the true descendants of the 12 Tribes of Israel. He noted that not all spew hateful rhetoric, although many adhere to an extreme set of anti-Semitic beliefs.

Bruce D. Haynes, a professor of sociology at the University of California, Davis, who has been studying Black Jews for more than two decades, agreed that the remarks echo the ideas of extreme Black Hebrew Israelites and of Minister Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam leader who last year referenced ""Satanic Jews"" in a speech denying allegations of anti-Semitism. But Haynes took a more nuanced view.

""The danger is that those groups get confused with other self-identified Israelites like (Rabbi) Capers Funnye, who has a congregation in Chicago, and who is very much involved with the Ashkenazim Jewish community. So I want to make clear that the term 'Israelites' is a tricky term,"" he said.

""Is it anti-Semitic to say Black people are the real Israelites or the real Jews? I’m not sure I’d call it anti-Semitism,"" Haynes said. ""It’s not a good reading of history, but I wouldn’t call it anti-Semitism. On the other hand, some of those groups that call Jews impostors certainly cross the line.""

Until his firing, Cannon produced ""Wild ’n Out,"" a comedy improv series for VH1, the ViacomCBS-owned cable channel.

In an earlier Facebook post, he had said that he welcomes being held accountable and takes responsibility for his words, while also accusing the company of trying to silence an ""outspoken black man"" and demanding full ownership of the ""Wild ’n Out"" brand.

""I do not condone hate speech nor the spread of hateful rhetoric. ... The Black and Jewish communities have both faced enormous hatred, oppression persecution and prejudice for thousands of years and in many ways have and will continue to work together to overcome these obstacles,"" he wrote.

Cooper had said that Cannon should reject Farrakhan’s hate speech and ""reduce the long statement to two sentences"" — a simple apology, which he did after their conversation.

""I just had the blessed opportunity to converse with Rabbi Abraham Cooper director of global social action @SimonWiesenthal. My first words to my brother was, I apologize for the hurt I caused the Jewish Community"" Cannon tweeted.

""On my podcast I used words & referenced literature I assumed to be factual to uplift my community instead turned out to be hateful propaganda and stereotypical rhetoric that pained another community For this I am deeply sorry but now together we can write a new chapter of healing.""

In an email to workers Wednesday night, the company said that since January it has had fewer than 10 cases of the virus that causes COVID-19 that were transmitted in the workplace.

article continues below

But the email from Laurie Shelby, Tesla’s vice-president of environmental, safety and health, also confirmed reports that Tesla is looking into more than 130 positive tests among employees, including those who contracted the virus outside of Tesla facilities. She said less than 0.25% of employees worldwide have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, which equals just over 137 workers.

Her message came in response to a report by Electrek.co that over 130 Tesla employees or contractors have tested positive, and hundreds more are waiting for test results. The website said it based the report on internal company data.

Shelby wrote that the story referred to data ""that was in the process of being validated"" and included employees worldwide who may have been infected but never entered a Tesla site, or were infected at home while Tesla's operations were shut down earlier in the year. A Tesla spokesman would not comment on the report or the email, which was obtained by The Associated Press.

""Nearly all — more than 99.99% — of these occurrences were not cases of virus transmitted at work,"" Shelby wrote in the email. ""Most of the positive cases resulted from an individual living with or travelling with someone with COVID-19 and have returned to work after recovering from home.""

Shelby wrote that Tesla doesn't have any employees in serious condition anywhere in the world because of COVID-19.

A message was left Thursday seeking comment on the numbers from the public health department in Alameda County, California, which includes Fremont, the location of Tesla's only U.S. assembly plant. The factory employs about 10,000 workers.

Some workers have refused to return to the plant out of fear of catching the virus. They did so after CEO Elon Musk in May defied Health Department orders not to restart production under shutdown orders due to the virus.

Some Tesla workers and labour activists say the company is threatening to fire employees who haven’t returned, but Tesla officials have said claims about firings are not true. Workers say they've heard about COVID-19 cases at the plant but they don't know numbers. They have called on the company and health department to release the figures.

However, Shelby wrote in the email that an employee survey found the vast majority of workers feel comfortable with the safety measures being taken by the company.

Among the measures are increased cleaning, limiting access to facilities, temperature checks for employees before they enter buildings, staggered shifts to keep workers apart, additional barriers between employees and providing protective equipment, Shelby wrote.

She urged workers to wear masks or face coverings to stay healthy and save lives and warned that failing to wear masks where required, or not wearing them properly, will bring disciplinary actions. She also wrote that workers should stay home if they're sick.

Musk reopened the Fremont plant May 11 in defiance of county orders. The health department had deemed the factory a nonessential business that can’t fully open under virus restrictions, but Tesla contended it was essential under federal guidelines.

The next day, however, the Health Department announced that the plant could return to manufacturing as long as it delivers on worker safety precautions that it agreed to.",[]

Asa Hutchinson issued an order Thursday requiring people to wear face masks in public throughout the state, which has had a surge in coronavirus cases over the past several weeks.

The Republican governor had resisted a statewide mask mandate and opposed issuing a stay-at-home order earlier in the pandemic, but he signed the order requiring masks when social distancing isn't possible in the hopes of slowing the disease's rapid spread in the state. The order takes effect Monday.

article continues below

Hutchinson’s decision comes amid growing support for mask requirements from business and health leaders and a day after Bentonville-based Walmart said it would require customers to wear masks in all of its U.S. stores. The state’s largest newspaper, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, also called for a statewide requirement on Thursday.

Hutchinson previously encouraged people to wear masks and allowed cities to pass ordinances requiring their use, but he stopped short of requiring them statewide. He’s the latest Republican governor to relent on the mask issue in the face of a surge in COVID-19 cases. Alabama's governor issued a similar mask mandate on Wednesday.

Arkansas' coronavirus cases have dramatically risen since May, when the state began allowing businesses that had closed because of the pandemic to reopen despite warnings from national health officials about the risks of doing so too soon. Arkansas was one of a handful of states that did not issue a broader stay-at-home order that kept most businesses closed.

Hutchinson previously questioned how a mask mandate could be enforced in a rural state such as Arkansas, but this week he left open the possibility of such a requirement. The chancellor of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences called for a statewide requirement last weekend.

Hutchinson's order was expected to face criticism from some conservatives in the state. Hours before he issued the order, a Republican legislator urged people to call Hutchinson to oppose any mask directive.

A poll by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business suggested tensions are flaring between workers and employers, with around 27 per cent of 3,389 employers polled indicating some of their laid-off staff have refused to return to work.

article continues below

Of the nearly 870 businesses that provided the reasons their employees gave for refusing to return to work, 62 per cent reported workers ""prefer the Canada Emergency Response Benefit."" Employers could choose more than one explanation for why a worker refused to return, and respondents also selected options such as concern for health (47 per cent), childcare obligations (27 per cent) or lack of hours in return offer (16 per cent).

CFIB president Dan Kelly said it's ""clear"" that CERB ""created a disincentive to return to work for some staff, especially in industries like hospitality."" Other sectors where conflicts are arising include child care, dental offices, home health care, amusement parks, gambling and spectator sports, the study suggested.

""CERB was created as emergency support for workers who had lost their job due to the pandemic, not to fund a summer break,"" Kelly said in a statement.

But Ian Robb, Canadian director of the Unite Here union that represents hospitality workers, disagrees. He said workers are impatient to return to work — for what is usually the lucrative summer season — but employers are the ones failing to adopt measures like frequent cleaning and wage subsidies. The union previously estimated that average wages in cities like Toronto are around $20 per hour for hospitality.

""A number of our members in the U.S. have gone to work and contracted (COVID-19),"" Robb said.

""There's just not enough safety in front of service. Nobody wants to stay home and make two grand when they can make double that by working.""

The survey suggested that the hospitality sector had the biggest share of employers, 45 per cent, who had trouble recalling workers. CFIB defines hospitality as including hotels, restaurants and bars.

The CFIB study suggests that in the hospitality sector, 56 per cent of hard-to-fill positions were ""unskilled, entry-level jobs"" that pay ""at or around minimum wage,"" although across sectors, skilled and semi-skilled jobs were harder to fill.

Employment and human rights lawyer Neena Gupta says she has heard of tradespeople unable to perform jobs because workers failed to return.

She said the reason an employee is refusing the work matters. Lack of childcare, like daycare and camps, can be a job-protected reason for staying home, as can disabilities such as being immunocompromised, says Gupta, a partner in Gowling WLG's Waterloo Region and Toronto offices.

The federal government's website states that workers seeking CERB, which offers $500 per week over a limited period, ""should be seeking work opportunities and/or return to work when their employer makes a request for their return, provided they are able and it is reasonable to do so."" The government's COVID-19 guidelines also provide for employees to refuse to do a dangerous job, although the worker must already ""be at work"" to refuse such a task.

However, notes Gupta, general apprehension about the pandemic is likely not enough to merit a job refusal. She said workplaces must comply with health and safety guidelines, and that a ministry inspection must find some sort of violation to justify a job refusal.

Managers should give workers a written ""come back to work"" recall and an indication that it will be treated as job abandonment if the worker doesn't return, says Gupta. After that process is completed, the employer could consider that worker terminated for cause, and hire a replacement.

While reporting misuse of CERB by a former employee might appear to give an employer some moral satisfaction, Gupta says it’s unlikely to help with staffing concerns or worker morale.

""I do ask people to be reasonable. You can’t call someone at noon on a Thursday and expect them in at 7 a.m. on Friday,"" she says.

However, Cogeco says its cable television and internet operations in Ontario, Quebec and the United States have felt less impact from the pandemic.

Cogeco chief executive Philippe Jette told analysts Thursday that adjusted earnings and revenue at the cable and internet operations are expected to grow in the fourth quarter.

Cogeco Inc. reported late Wednesday that its third-quarter profit from continuing operations was $97.5 million, down 4.9 per cent from nearly $102.6 million last year.

A U.S. acquisition and favourable currency exchange rates helped push up overall revenue by 1.4 per cent to $626 million for the three months ended May 31.

A month after the BC Junior A Lacrosse League was supposed to begin playing, the league officially cancelled its 2020 season.

The Minto Cup, along with all other minor and senior national championships, has also been cancelled by the Canadian Lacrosse Association.

In a release, BCJALL president Karl Christiansen said ongoing restrictions in British Columbia limiting the size of public gatherings during the COVID-19 pandemic to no more than 50 people made it impossible for games to be played.

“We had hope we might be able to compete this year,” he said. “But it became evident we wouldn’t be able to have a normal season.”

Christiansen said alternative schedules were considered, but public health directives were insurmountable.

CLA president Shawn Williams said health and safety, travel concerns and venue closures were the main considerations in its decision to cancel all 2020 national championships from the Mann Cup senior men’s title to the U12 finals, as well as the U19 women’s field lacrosse championships.

“We recognize that national championships are important to lacrosse players of all ages,” he said, adding all hosts for 2020 events will be charged with staging their championships in 2021. That means the Minto and Mann Cups will both be played in Ontario.

But Paul Dal Monte said the league’s executive and governors are doing everything they can to ensure that doesn’t happen, even as the uncertainty about when restrictions on public gatherings could be lifted continues.

article continues below

At the very least, the coming season - which has already been postponed from its scheduled May 21 start - is unlikely to look like any other normal campaign.

Dal Monte said the league has a contingency to play a schedule as short as 12 games. But any decision on how to proceed relies on continuing direction from health authorities, as well as the Canadian Lacrosse Association.

Dal Monte added he’s also in regular communication with his counterpart at Major Series Lacrosse in Ontario, which is supposed to be hosting the Mann Cup national championship in September.

“We stay on top of things,” Dal Monte said. “We understand the pain points and challenges.”

One of those pain points is the financial viability of the league and its seven teams, including the Coquitlam Adanacs, Burnaby Lakers and New Westminster Salmonbellies.

Dal Monte said the niche nature of lacrosse means teams rely on sponsors and partnerships rather than gate receipts to cover expenses, and with so many businesses suffering because of the pandemic, those dollars may be hard to come by this summer.

“At this stage, it creates a significant obstacle for us and many of our teams,” he said, adding without the certainty of a schedule, it’s difficult for teams to even begin having a conversation with potential sponsors.

Dal Monte conceded some teams might have a hard time operating.

Still, he said, time is on the league’s side. Virtual meetings with team governors are being held May 2 and 16 to assess the current situation and options for moving forward.

Any final call on how to proceed with a season could be held off as late as June 1, Dal Monte said. Then “we would have to make a decision one way or the other.”

Meanwhile, the president of the BC Junior A Lacrosse League said a recent pronouncement by British Columbia’s health officer, Dr. Bonnie Henry, suggesting large gatherings of people may not be allowed through the summer in an effort to quash transmission of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 puts his league’s ability to hold a season “at risk.”

The BCJALL, which includes the Coquitlam Jr. Adanacs, PoCo Saints as well as junior incarnations of the Lakers and Salmonbellies among its eight teams, was supposed to play its first regular season game on Saturday. But that’s now on hold with the league executive meeting next on May 19.

Karl Kristiansen said the league could reduce its schedule to 14 games from 21, or even stage a tournament-style season to determine playoff teams that could compete for a chance to go to the Minto Cup in St. Catharines in August. That is, if the national championship even gets the green light to play.

Kristiansen said his group should have more clarity after the CLA meets May 15 when the fate of several national championships, from youth to senior leagues, is expected to be decided.

League governors decided to postpone the start, and officials with both the WLA and Major Series Lacrosse of Ontario are working together with an aim of having a Mann Cup championship series between the two leagues in September, hosted by Ontario.

Everything hinges on Canadian and provincial health officials ending the state of emergency, which has closed all community facilities and put a ban on large gatherings.

“Our intention is to play a full season but we have alternately drafted a few proposals that give us options should the situation not permit (a regular length schedule),” WLA commissioner Paul Dal Monte said in an interview with the Record on Tuesday. “We have drafted two alternative schedules, with playoff options, and aligned in lock-step with the MSL.”

When they receive the all-clear from health officials to open shuttered community facilities and permit public gatherings, municipal schedulers will be inundated with requests for floor time from the minor sports and recreation sports user groups, as well. That would also require some coordinating on a local standpoint, Dal Monte said.

The WLA governors are slated to meet again on April 11 to review their options. Dal Monte said the focus is on preparing for a possible spring startup that could facilitate a condensed schedule and playoffs and a September Mann Cup tournament.

“Obviously we all want to start the season soon,” New West Salmonbellies general manager Ray Porcellato said. “This is unprecedented, and everyone needs to follow (health officials) instructions. The goal is to have a season and playoffs leading to a Mann Cup. It’s going to be a challenge, as (most) Ontario teams play second or third fiddle to junior hockey in regards to their arenas.”

With Ontario slated to host the Mann Cup championship and as a number of the competitive teams there share their arenas with Ontario Hockey League clubs, postponing the national series past mid-September would be a challenge.

“In arenas where a number of Ontario teams play, junior hockey takes precedent, like in Peterborough,” noted Dal Monte. “But the Mann Cup is the Mann Cup, so we’ll have to see.”

The WLA regular season usually sees teams play each other three times in an 18-game schedule, for a total of 63 games. If the league reduced to a home-and-home series each, it would result in a 12-game schedule per team, for 42 league games.

Porcellato said he’s been in contact with the ‘Bellie players and says they are working out in anticipation of an eventual start to the season.

“They’re Instagramming each other with push-up challenges, staying home and doing what they can,” he noted. “I guess if there’s any benefit to this, the guys who play pro (in the National Lacrosse League) are getting a chance to heal up, rest and recuperate.”

The Ontario league has not announced a postponement to its schedule as of Tuesday, but released a statement that extends the ban on all in-person lacrosse activities to May 15, pending further provincial directives. The MSL was slated to launch May 31 and run until July 30, with the league playoffs running through August.

With both leagues working together in mapping out various options for condensed regular seasons and playoffs, Porcellato said his squad is all-in for however the 2020 season is drawn up.

“We will be ready to go, right to the bitter end until a Mann Cup is not feasible,” he said. “We plan on being there, even if it’s a one-game winner take-all.”",[]

The Lower Mainland Baseball Association, which oversees 37 teams over four leagues for 18-and older players, announced Monday that all events, games and meetings are cancelled as it encourages its members to remain safe.

Among the scrapped events was a league meeting slated for Saturday.

Lower Mainland Baseball League commissioner Dan Taylor said there the public health concerns trump sports, but has set some possible scenarios that would see the health scare abate and regular activities begin to return.

“I’m hoping it isn’t too long. I’ve got about 700 guys who are itching to play,” said Taylor. “We’re not anticipating starting the season any time soon, but I’ve sort of set a date in my head of the Victoria Day (May 16 to 18), and hopefully start a schedule then.”

His 38 teams, which compete in 18-plus, 30-plus and 45-plus divisions, would have to play a short-season schedule. In a regular season the teams play 16-game schedules, plus playoffs.

“Basically, we’re just in a great big holding pattern, like everybody else.”

Taylor notes his league is also dependent upon what the region’s minor baseball associations can do, since most of the men’s league field access relies on what is available after the kids need.

“We share all the same diamonds as the minor associations,” he noted. “Most parks are allocated (municipally) for the minor organizations, because the kids come first, as it should be. Over our 26 years we’ve built up a lot of goodwill so I’m confident that we can work together.”

The league has kept the registration system open, and has advised teams that have not yet paid its registration fees to hold on until an opening day is determined.

“LMBA is instructing all teams not to practice until parks have been re-opened – per instructions from Baseball BC and all Lower Mainland municipalities. We are optimistic that we will get in some baseball time in 2020 and will keep everyone updated,” a notice posted on the LMBL website.

While the three different divisions are full with teams, one squad that has competed over the past two seasons – the B.C. Badgers, a female team composed of provincial and national-level players – won’t be returning due to scheduling conflicts.

Taylor said it was a great experience having the Badgers compete in the over-45 division, where they received steady competition in preparing for the women’s national team responsibilities. Unfortunately, because their roster includes players from Vancouver Island and right through to the Fraser Valley, it was difficult to guarantee the Badgers could make the often early weekend games. They ended up forfeiting some games due to travel difficulties, he said.

“The schedule just didn’t mesh well with them,” said Taylor. “I’ve followed the female program for a while and you can see how much it’s improved over time, here in B.C. but also across Canada.

“We told the national level players that they could come out and tryout for any team in our league.”

He said the Badgers have decided to join the Vancouver Recreational Baseball League, which operates out of Burnaby’s Central Park and New West’s Queen’s Park.",[]

Four months after the NBA was forced to shut down due to COVID-19, the Raptors are making up for lost time with their fierce fight at practice.

article continues below

""Practices have been super, super competitive,"" said Patrick McCaw. ""A lot of trash talk, a lot of guys going at it, just pushing each other. We've been away from each other for two or three months, so guys are excited to see each other but also excited to play.

""So that energy (at) practice is super intense, and it's fun, because you're competing against the guys that you're going to war with. It's been a couple weeks of great fun.""

Coach Nick Nurse wasn't quite sure what to expected in this unprecedented situation. He's been pleased with his players' feistiness.

""There's a lot of juice in there, a lot of juice in the building, and high spirits,"" Nurse said after Thursday's practice at Disney, where courts have been laid down in a massive convention hall.

""It's all good-natured stuff — it's competitive-natured stuff, but it's all been fine.""

Norm Powell, the unofficial leader of the second unit, said the younger players have been pushing the veterans hard.

""Man, we're competing,"" Powell said. ""I was actually really happy and excited the way the younger guys were getting Fred (VanVleet) and Kyle (Lowry) and Pascal (Siakam) worked up, taking their intensity level even higher. The games have been really good when we're getting after it in our in-team scrimmages and things like that.""

The Raptors were second in the Eastern Conference when the league shuttered on March 11, and that was despite having a revolving door of a roster due to numerous injuries to key players. The Raptors were fifth in the league in games lost to injury.

Nurse now has the luxury of a full roster to choose from.

Powell, who was playing the most consistent basketball of his NBA career before the hiatus, is being more vocal at practice. He's taken aside players such as Chris Boucher, rookie Terence Davis, McCaw and Stanley Johnson to remind them to make Nurse's job more difficult, to constantly battle for more a bigger role.

""I'm telling them, 'We've got to go at these guys (the starters) because we want their spot. They are in the position we want to be in. So we're not going to take it easy on them in these drills, we're not going to let them feel like they can do whatever they want and take it easy and go through the motions. We're going to go after them, we're going to compete, and we're going to show them that we're here and we want more,'"" Powell said.

Nurse said he could go deep into his bench for the three scrimmages and eight-game seeding round before tightening it up for the playoffs.

""I just think that you're going to play eight, nine in the playoffs. Everybody sort of gets to that point, every possession is so critical,"" he said.

""One thing that's for sure, each series always seems to be so different. Sometimes there's just some guy that doesn't fit and then maybe there's a series where a Chris Boucher or Rondae Hollis-Jefferson or somebody who's in the rotation but towards the back of it maybe they get slotted in for a matchup or something.

""So I think it's always good to have some versatility, maybe 12 guys you can use because you can never know who suits each series.""

Nurse received a virtual thumbs up from reporters in Thursday's Zoom video call for his sweater. It said ""Box + One,"" a nod to the box-and-one defence, most often seen in collegiate games, that he implemented against Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors in last year's NBA Finals.

The Raptors could be at Disney World for the next three months if they go deep into the playoffs. The team has tried to make them feel at home, and most recently decorated their floor of the hotel. There's large ""We The North"" banners on players' doors, and a huge photo of the Toronto skyline decorates one wall of the hallway.

A cracked bone? Good to go. What about a sore shoulder? No problem.

It's well-known NHLers battle through aches, pains and even illness. Almost like clockwork, a flu bug tears through more than a few locker rooms every season. Players often attempt to soldier on without missing any time, especially when the games matter most.

In the era of COVID-19, however, some of that old the definition of ""toughness"" is being thrown out the window.

Players and coaches are keenly aware that if they're feeling even the slightest bit off — and there are a laundry list of symptoms associated with the novel coronavirus, from chills to headaches to fatigue and weakness — it needs to be reported immediately.

""Doesn't matter if you're a tough hockey player or not,"" said Tippett, now the head coach of the Edmonton Oilers. ""I had a lot of games where I hid a broken finger or something like that from doctors. I didn't want them to know because they wouldn't let me play.

""But when you get sick, you're going to have to tell people. That's just the way of the new world.""

The NHL opened training camps this week as part of its plan to kickstart a campaign that was suspended in mid-March by the pandemic. Players and staff are getting tested every 48 hours — they're not currently quarantined — and that will be kick up another notch to once a day when the 24 teams involved in the resumption head to the hub cities of Edmonton and Toronto, where they'll be kept in a bubble separate from the general public.

Vancouver Canucks captain Bo Horvat said the mentality of the past has been turned on its head when it comes to illness.

""As hockey players you want to be in every single game, you want to play, and you want to help your teammate, and you want to be a difference-maker,"" he said. ""Before you played through colds, you played through injuries, you played through sickness and stuff like that.

""You have to step back and think a little bit now. It's a different animal, this virus. You have to be not only cautious of yourself and how you're feeling, but the people around you, too. It's not just your teammates, it's the medical staff, it's the trainers, it's everybody you're around every single day, and even obviously opposing teams. You've got to think of everybody. You've got to be very cautious.""

Edmonton Oilers centre and NHL leading scorer Leon Draisaitl said that caution is going to become the new norm.

""Every hockey player has played through certain things and we've all played through a flu or sickness or whatever it is,"" he said. ""But now with this going around, it makes it a little more dangerous.

""You have to be careful.""

Winnipeg Jets centre Andrew Copp said hockey's team-first mentality should kick in if someone isn't feeling right.

""You hope that everyone's pretty dialled in, and not only for everyone's health and safety, but for the team too,"" he said. ""If this guy gets it, he's not playing. Hopefully everyone can realize that we're all making a lot of sacrifices here.""

The NHL hasn't said how many positive tests would constitute the ""uncontrolled outbreak"" listed in its return-to-play protocol that could conceivably shut the league's resumption down. There's a difference between cases being spread out and a cluster of infections on a team or teams.

The league said earlier this week 30 players tested positive for COVID-19 during voluntary workouts at team facilities between June 8 and July 12. Another 13 positive results came outside of the league's protocol, while 10 other players tested positive in the spring. Training camps opened Monday, but individuals and teams won't be named moving forward with regards to positive tests.

It's no secret players have hid countless injuries in the past, and the league has been criticized heavily for how it dealt with the concussion issue, but Mathieu Schneider, special assistant to NHLPA executive director Don Fehr, said the virus is different territory.

""If concussions were contagious, I think players would feel differently about it,"" Schneider said. ""Guys certainly understand the notion that if they are not honest with symptoms or how they might feel, that they put their entire team in jeopardy.

""There's going to be a huge onus on the players here in (training camp) to make sure that they're taking care of themselves and looking out for their teammates — going to the rink, going home, going to the grocery store, social distancing, wearing mask, washing your hands. All the things that all of us are practising every single day now.""

Toronto Maple Leafs defenceman Morgan Rielly said it simply comes down to common sense is in this new reality.

""It's on the players and our staff to be honest with each other,"" he said. ""You don't want to put anyone else at risk.

""You want to do what's best for them.""

“With COVID being what it is, my work with musicians from Canadian bands like Prism, Trooper, Idle Eyes, Barney Bentall, has ground to a halt,” Young said in email to the Record. “The side-effect of not be able to currently produce records and perform has opened up time to work on my own music, which never seemed to get done.”

Young was thinking about a longtime friend who works at Royal Columbian Hospital and had recently entered a promising new relationship.

“Then COVID swoops in, and because he is frontline in the pandemic, he can’t see his new love close up,” Young said. “My wife and I chatted about how that must be really tough. It inspired me to write this cheeky little pop-rock song, called Lock Down Love Affair. I hope it can put a smile on some faces.”

To date, Lock Down Love Affair has been viewed more than 11,000 times on YouTube.

Young, the in-house producer and engineer at Alchemy Sound Studios in New West, said COVID-19 is the latest blow to his industry.

“The recording studio business has gone from being ambushed by the MP3, which turned the music industry upside down, to Vancouver’s crazy real estate, which has forced most professional recording facilities out of business,” he said. “The responsibility of recording young, local, indie artists and Canadian legacy artists has fallen to the smaller, agile studios like myself at Alchemy Sound Studios. COVID is another blow that is hitting an industry already on its knees.”

Just as COVID was warming up, Young said he was finishing up work on a record project involving Al Harlow (Prism) and Kevin Stuart Swain (Idle Eyes/Barney Bentall.) He was also producing a record by fellow New West resident/artist Clayton Hill from Trooper.

Musicians, said Young, are in a bit of a pickle because of COVID-19 and restrictions on large gatherings.

“Playing music live has been an important part of my life and income,” he said. “On a local level, I regularly played music at the Union Jack Public House, whose owner Darell Myers has actively supported live music from the moment he took over the pub.”

Along with playing at the Union Jack on weekends, Young hosted a jam night every Wednesday evening. He said the jam night was a hub where music lovers and amateur and pro musicians could get together to hit the stage and socialize.

“This evening is greatly missed in the community,” he said.

Young said the “silver lining” in the COVID situation is that it’s given him time to finally work on personal projects that always seemed to get put on the back burner. You can check out Young’s new tune on YouTube – search for Lockdown Love Affair.",[]

The show is part of a series of stand-up performances that are being produced in support of local businesses to help them with recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. For each show, audience members are given a chance to enjoy the show for free with purchase of gift certificates from the local business in question (ranging from $10 to $50 in value) or to pay $10 for just the online show. All the ticket proceeds go back to the business.

The coming show is in support of the Heritage Grill and its sister restaurant, Begbie’s Tavern, both of which are owned by New Westminster entrepreneur Paul Minhas.

A press release notes that Minhas was one of many small business owners that were hit hard by the pandemic when he was forced to close his doors for more than two months. The performers wanted to help Minhas because he has been a longtime supporter of the local entertainment scene.

“Prior to closing, Heritage Grill and Begbie’s have been home to several arts programs, shows and communities including the ukulele club, open mic nights, live music, trivia night, Way Off-Broadway Wednesdays, drag and, of course, stand-up comedy,” the release says. “(Minhas) has been an advocate and supporter of the arts, and these comedians want to give back.”

The show is being produced by Life is Still Funny and Laugh Wild Comedy. It’s set to feature Ray Morrison, Simi C., Ragini Kapil, Kalyn Miles, Helen Schneiderman and Nina Wilder, and it’s being hosted by Christine Hackman.

Performers will be on site at the Heritage Grill, while audiences watch from home via Zoom. Virtual “doors” open at 7:30 p.m. for the 8 p.m. show. A Zoom link will be sent out an hour before the show (audience members need a Zoom account, which can be set up for free).

Tickets can be booked through www.eventbrite.ca (search for Grill and Tavern Comedy), or use a direct link at www.tinyurl.com/GrillandTavernComedy.

The New Westminster-based quintet is offering up a live-streamed concert on Sunday, July 5 from 100 Braid Street Studios – the group’s home base and, as they call it, their “living room.”

Quayside in the House will feature a set of the group’s favourite songs, pulled from their repertoire of original a cappella arrangements of pop music.

It’s being brought to the stage thanks to a New Westminster Responsive Neighbourhood Small Grant from the Vancouver Foundation.

Audience members won’t be allowed in to watch live, out of concerns over COVID-19, but the singers will be able to work together – at appropriate physical distance from each other – thanks to some new technology.

“Using in-ear monitors and microphones will allow the five of us to sing apart from each other while being able to hear the blend and voices clearly,” explained Stephanie Lam, who sings alto with the group.

The group’s sound engineer, Emil Wu, has been working with the technology to ensure the group can produce a clear sound for the online audience.

Lam noted that their tech use stems from training sessions they had with Tony Huerta, the sound engineer for international a cappella stars Take 6 and The Real Group. Huerta flew in earlier this year to give the Quayside singers a weekend intensive.

Along with the technology, the singers have benefited from having the spacious surroundings of 100 Braid Street to work in.

“100 Braid Street has also been a huge factor in why we can even do this, as the space is large enough, with tall ceilings and circulation, to ease our minds and fears of aerosols and droplets,” Lam said.

As a result, she said, the singers will be able to put on a concert that, despite social distancing, will still provide the musical intricacies experienced through a cappella vocal music.

Looking ahead, Lam said, the singers are hoping to be able to stage an outdoor performance – and a musically satisfying one, since the in-ear monitors and microphones will allow them to produce good sound, even physically distanced, in the open air.

Quayside Voices features the talents of Lam, Justin Pham and Troy Martell, along with Elyse Kantonen and Megan Dray – who are filling in for Maggie Ma and Alyssa Inouye, both on maternity leave.

The livestreamed concert will be free. You can find the stream through https://quaysidevoices.com/",[]

That’s the news released today by the B.C. government, which claims the move will allow help with the cannabis retail industry's need for more security-screened workers, as well as reducing costs to cannabis workers and reducing interruptions from having to go through criminal record checks.

The government claims the move will also “allow provincial security screening resources to focus on the qualification of new workers rather than the requalification of current workers who are already working in the legal cannabis retail industry.”

Security screening and re-screening requirements were implemented as a measure to keep organized crime out of the legal, non-medical cannabis market.

Screenings involve background checks with police, courts and corrections databases. To date, 4,300 workers have been screened.

All workers with a current valid security screening will have their security verification period extended from the date of their initial verification. Security verifications for all new workers will be valid for five years.",[]

So the news of a record $3.9 billion in sales last year may temper some of the adverse effects no doubt coming down the pipe later this year and beyond.

Areas of growth included a close to $300-million increase in cannabis sales, along with a $47-million increase in dairy sales, a $25-million increase in beef sales and a $17.5-million increase in field vegetable sales.

The figures represent an increase of more than 13 per cent, or $462 million, more than 2018.

Indeed, the B.C. government hopes 2019’s bumper sales in the farming industry is a sign of a strong recovery in the future.

""For the past three years, our government has been focused on helping farmers farm and strengthening food security,” said Lana Popham, Minister of Agriculture.

“We know the pandemic has impacted farmers greatly this year, but the farming sector's record economic growth in 2019 sets the sector up for a strong recovery.

“COVID-19 has opened our eyes to the importance of our province's self-sufficiency. I urge everyone to continue to show their appreciation for our farmers and support our local food system by making a special effort to Buy BC.""

As government works on the overall economic restart, more British Columbian farm workers are still needed to ensure B.C.'s agriculture sector remains strong.

""Connecting more British Columbians to agriculture jobs and careers is more important than ever as we work to restart the economy and keep this momentum going,"" added Popham.

“We are working together with industry as we focus on restarting our farming sector.""

In May, government launched the BC Farm, Fish and Food Job Connector and a digital campaign is underway to further promote these job opportunities for the summer.

* Farm cash receipts refer to the revenues from the sale of agricultural commodities, program payments from government agencies and payments from private crop and livestock insurance programs.

* Other sectors/commodities with increased sales include:

* blueberries - $7 million;

* grapes - $5.6 million; and

Along with completing an online survey, the city is inviting people to attend small group discussions on the topic. It’s also providing an opportunity for people to make arrangements to complete the survey in a different language (with a translator) by phone by emailing engage@newwestcity.ca or calling 604-527-4653.



“Engagement on the city’s pandemic recovery is expected to continue through the summer and into September 2020,” said a notice about the survey. “We will report back to council and the community in the fall about what we heard, and input received will be considered in recovery planning as well as various departments, projects and decision-making.”

article continues below

The survey asks community members to rank their level of support for the nine principles developed by the city to guide the city’s pandemic recovery plan.

“In responding to the pandemic, the city has worked quickly to put physical changes and supports in place to help manage impacts in the community,” says the survey. “Some examples include changes to roadways to allow more space for pedestrians and cyclists, allowing expanded patio space for restaurants, and exploring creation of new parklets (outdoor seating areas, etc. that are not connected with a specific business / no purchase required. In May, city council passed a resolution to “move quickly in 2020 to expand road re-allocation toward pedestrian, cyclist, and public gathering space, using temporary measures where necessary with a mind towards more permanent solutions that can be applied after the period of crisis has passed.”

Aside from initiatives that have already been introduced, the survey asks survey respondents if they have any ideas for additional physical changes or innovations residents would like the city to consider in their neighbourhoods or in New Westminster as it moves through the recovery period and plans for the post-pandemic future.

The survey also asks people to rank the community benefits the city is anticipating as a result of city council’s declaration of a climate emergency and support of Seven Bold Steps on climate change – initiatives approved prior to the pandemic. It also asks if there are any particular climate-action activities the city should prioritize through the recovery period.

Prior to the pandemic, council approved a 2019 to 2022 strategic plan that identified priority areas, which included: affordable housing; culture and economic development; environment and climate action; reconciliation, inclusion and engagement; and sustainable transportation. In light of “the new COVID-19 pandemic reality and thinking about recovery” the survey asks how important these priorities are now, what types of actions in these areas are most important, and if any new priorities have come to light because of the pandemic.

According to the survey, the pandemic has increased and drawn attention to ongoing social issues and inequities in New Westminster, including economic inequality, systemic racism, quality of long-term care for and social isolation of elders and people with disabilities, the opioid overdose crisis, food insecurity, lack of affordable housing, employment inequities such as precarious jobs with no sick leave or other benefits, increasing poverty due to job loss, lack of affordable childcare, domestic violence, and others. On this front, the survey asks what actions the city should take to build a more equitable, sustainable and resilient city, and questions the degree of support for the city’s efforts to take transformation action during the pandemic recovery and beyond.

“City council would specifically like to hear from members of demographic groups that have been disproportionally impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic,” said the survey. “This information is important to understand what perspectives might be missing from the conversation, and to ensure diversity of participation.”",[]

On Monday, city council approved a motion calling on the federal government to extend the emergency wage subsidy program until such time that businesses are able to resume business at full pre-pandemic capacity. The motion states Canada’s emergency wage supplement is currently making the difference between the survival and failure of many small businesses.

While presenting his motion, Coun. Chuck Puchmayr said he had just learned the federal government had agreed to extend the benefit, which was set to expire Aug. 29. Given that council won’t be meeting again until Aug. 31, he said he wanted to ensure the city informed the federal government of its support for the program.

“One of the businesses that brought this up gave me a really good example; they would have lost probably half of their work force had this not if already been in existence,” he said. “Losing this program, they would lose a lot of their skilled workers.”

Puchmayr said one local restaurant has had to reduce its seating from 129 to 55 seats because of social spacing requirements, something that’s not sustainable for many businesses.

“There are many, many restaurants that are in this same position right now. As one of the owners said, this is a slow moving train wreck that is going to have some dire consequences – by the time COVID is over, there will be a lot of casualties,” he said. “This motion is to ask (the federal government) to continue that support and keep these restaurants viable, and small businesses that are limited to capacity limits.”

Mayor Jonathan Cote agreed the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy has been among a number of important programs helping Canadians through the pandemic.

“We know that many of our local businesses, definitely in some specific sectors, are going to have a rough period during this time,” he said. “I think it’s important that we show our support for these types of programs.”

Launched as part of the federal government’s response to the pandemic, Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) provides eligible businesses affected by COVID-19 with a subsidy of 75% of employee wages for up to 24 weeks. The wage subsidy aims to allow businesses to rehire workers previously laid off because of COVID-19, to help prevent further job losses and to put them in a better position to resume normal operations following the crisis.

New Westminster-Buranby MP Peter Julian says the federal government must do more to ensure Canadians are supported while business owners and workers begin to get back on their feet. - File

New Westminster-Burnaby MP Peter Julian said he welcomes the announcement that the CEWS program will be extended, but believes more help is needed for Canadian businesses.

“For weeks, we have been calling on the government to extend the CEWS past Aug. 29 and to adopt more flexible criteria so that more businesses can get the help they desperately need,” he said in a news release. “The existing criteria for CEWS is too restrictive, and New Democrats are pushing for changes to make the program more flexible.”

Julian, who is the federal NDP’s finance critic, said New Democrats have proposed a sliding-scale for the wage subsidy in order to help more businesses over the summer.

“Right now, if a business loses less than 30% of their revenue they don’t qualify for the CEWS. This arbitrary number chosen by the government is unfairly leaving too many businesses without the support they need,” he said. “Under the NDP approach, businesses with a smaller loss of revenue could still qualify for a partial wage subsidy so that more businesses get support.”",[]

Can you help?,['Darrell Hoekstra'],,"We are blessed to live in a society and a part of the world where we experience a level of freedom and prosperity almost unparalleled in the history of human existence.

We aren't often pushed (and then typically not far) outside our comfort zone. One of the things that COVID-19 has done is helped me to re-evaluate my priorities.

article continues below

To spend time thinking about what is really important in life. To recognize how pervasive an underlying attitude of selfishness and laziness has become in my life because of such ease. I believe this to be true (to some extent at least) of our society generally without denying for a second the very real hardships that we do still experience as human beings.

Call it a wake-up call, call it a paradigm shift, these lines of thought have galvanized me to action. My wife Mary-Lin and her two brothers Jonathan and Timothy all have Cystic Fibrosis.

This is the most common fatal genetic disease in Canada, affecting over 4,300 Canadians. There is a defect in the body’s cells resulting in the production of particularly thick mucus in the lungs which, if left untreated, creates the perfect breeding ground for bad infections.

Forty years ago, children born with CF typically died young. For decades, Canada has been at the forefront of research and development of therapies and improved patient care.

Now CFers often live into adulthood, sometimes even middle age. But it’s still not possible to beat the disease, with the final recourse of treatment being a lung transplant. As drastic a procedure as that is, it is really like putting a Band Aid on a broken leg.

I've known that Mary-Lin has CF as long as I've known her. I try to convince myself that I've been supportive in regards to her disease throughout the years that we dated and have been married. But, if I'm honest, I haven’t really done much about it.

I was reminded this spring about an annual cycling fundraiser called GearUp4CF that I first heard of a decade ago. When I was a teenager, I rode my bike all the time, so why haven't I been part of this for the last 10 years?

Well, better late than never. I jumped online and found the website (www.gearup4cf.com).

Turns out this year's fundraising ride is ""virtual"" to encourage social distancing. What that means is instead of a group ride, participants are setting personal challenges to complete individually. I signed up the same day, and set a fundraising target of $25,000. Within an hour, a ride challenge began to formulate in my mind.

I would ride to Penticton and back from New West in five days. I literally hadn't pedaled my bike for 10 years.

That was two months ago.

So, for the last two months I've been training. I knew I had to do two things.

1) Get my legs in shape. The ride requires me to pull off at least 150 kilometres per day for five days, with some real climbs involved too (day one includes summiting the Coquihalla)

2) Prepare my mind. I'm not an athlete, but I am in reasonably good shape and my work involves physical labour, so I was fairly confident I could prepare physically.

However, to pull off five long endurance rides in a row requires mental toughness as well. I realized that the mental training could come partly from the physical training. Confidence in my physical ability to accomplish my goal would go a long way towards being mentally prepared. Therefore, I would train towards a really hard training ride to be accomplished shortly before the actual challenge.

Darrell Hoekstra with his wife Mary-Lin, who has Cystic Fibrosis. submitted

Well, I dug out the rusty old mountain bike I bought as a teenager and brought it to the shop. I decided it was better to ride that than buy a new one so that I could kick-start my fundraising campaign with my own money (which I did).

Unfortunately, after a full tune-up and new tires, it was stolen out of my parkade after only a couple rides. I borrowed a bike for a week so I could keep riding (often commuting to the jobsite as a way to squeeze more time out of the day, since I was working fulltime) and then replaced it the next weekend.

Now the training could really begin. I've put 1,300 kilometres on the new bike in the last six weeks, and last weekend accomplished the last big training ride, a Triple Crown ride which involves summiting Seymour, Grouse and Cypress on the same day.

Which brings us to today. Now I just have to pull off five of them in a row, while sleeping on the ground and eating from a backpack.

On July 20, I'm leaving from New West early in the morning. And since five days might be too easy, my new goal is to do it ""as fast as possible.""

I'm going push myself hard every day, and post regularly to social media so people can follow along.

I want to say a heartfelt thank-you to all my supporters. Together we've raised $16,000 (over 60% of my goal so far!) and this money is so important for everyone whose lives are directly or indirectly affected by CF.

The funds are for CF Canada, a non-profit that works tirelessly advocating for and funding world class patient care and research into life-sustaining therapies and treatments and ultimately, hopefully, a cure.

You can help, too, by doing your part to protect immuno-compromised people like those with CF.

Washing your hands, staying home when you're sick, the exact things we're so aware of the need to do now due to COVID-19.

Normal little seasonal illnesses take a huge toll on someone with CF, and as Mary-Lin's husband I've observed the cumulative damage they have caused her over time.

Save lives by being an organ donor.

You can also help by sponsoring my ride. Donations go directly to CFCanada and are tax receipted. Just go to www.gearup4cf.com and search for Darrell. And follow along on Instagram (@darrell.hoekstra) if you'd like to see how the ride goes.

Together we can make CF stand for “Cure Found.”

65,newwestrecord,https://www.newwestrecord.ca/gun-violence-imported-from-u-s-is-a-key-concern-for-canadians-1.24169958,Gun violence imported from U.S. is a key concern for Canadians,['Mario Canseco'],,"National governments have a tendency to overreact immediately after they are forced to face an unexpected challenge. No example is better than the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks in the United States, which gave us the “Patriot Act” after just 45 days of deliberation to expand government surveillance of Americans to previously unimagined levels.

In mid-April, the actions of Gabriel Wortman led to the deaths of 22 people in Nova Scotia after multiple shootings and fires. Most Canadians, at the time still under lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, were horrified at Wortman’s actions, which included impersonating a police officer.

article continues below

It took the federal government only 13 days after Wortman’s criminal activity was evident for the entire country to announce a nationwide ban on 1,500 types of military-grade “assault-style” weapons in Canada. Any Canadian who possesses these firearms will have two years to get rid of them. The prohibition led to many new discussions about the role that firearms play in Canada’s urban and rural areas.

We know now that the perpetrator of the 22 murders in Nova Scotia had obtained his weapons illegally from Canadian and American sources. This was not a surprise for Canadian authorities, who have consistently reported that more than 70% of the weapons used in gun-related crimes in our country come from the United States.

On the issue of firearms, Canada is decidedly different from the United States. In Canada, it is not legal for a person to own or carry a firearm for the purpose of self defence against human beings. When Research Co. and Glacier Media asked Canadians about this key precept of Canadian law, more than three in four (77%) agreed with it, while 18% disagreed and 5% were undecided.

Atlantic Canada (31%), Saskatchewan and Manitoba (29%) and Alberta (24%) boast the highest number of residents who openly question Canada’s long-standing regulations for firearms. While higher than what is observed in Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia, these are not proportions of voters that would sway an election, certainly not in the way American statewide and congressional races can be tilted if your candidate can adequately hold a shotgun and recite the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution in a manner that panders to the base.

Fewer than one in five Canadians welcome the notion of citizens carrying firearms for something other than hunting or scaring wildlife away. Any survey measuring opinions on banning “assault-style” weapons would be met with near unanimity. The opposition reacted to the announced ban as it always has under its outgoing leader, by claiming the regulations would affect law-abiding Canadians. Lost in this unfortunate combination of inadequate polling and incapable opposition are the solutions that matter to Canadians.

In our survey, more than three in five Canadians (63%) told us that gun violence in Canada is a “very serious” or “moderately serious” problem – a proportion that climbs to 69% among women and 68% among those aged 55 and over.

Sizable majorities of Ontarians and British Columbians, who have experienced gang wars in urban areas, are more likely to look at gun violence as particularly problematic (76% and 67%, respectively). The COVID-19 pandemic did little to curb gun violence in Toronto, where 61 people were shot in the first four months of the year.

We asked Canadians about the effectiveness of four possible measures, and their responses outline a public that is ready for bold action. More than three in five Canadians (62%) think enacting a complete ban on handguns would be “very effective” or “moderately effective” in reducing gun violence in Canada. Most crimes, after all, are not being committed with the military-grade “assault-style” weapons that the federal government was quick to ban.

A higher proportion of Canadians deem two other measures as effective: imposing mandatory jail terms for crimes committed with firearms (74%) and introducing new outreach programs to steer youth away from gangs (also 74%).

Canadians place dealing with firearms smuggled from the United States as the most important issue that needs to be addressed. Many of the country’s residents also want to make sure gangs are not attractive to our country’s youth and believe mandatory minimum jail sentences would act as a deterrent.

Banning military-grade “assault-style” weapons is low-hanging fruit in a challenge that definitely has Canadians preoccupied and wishing for a type of government intervention that goes beyond a photo-op celebrated by poorly executed survey charity work.

True sociologists know that we learn nothing from posing the wrong questions to Canadians, and capable politicians should go beyond voicing displeasure with plans and proposals just because that is what they are expected to do. Meanwhile, Canadians are still worried about gun violence and expecting their elected officials to do better. •

The metaphor suggested by the title of Christian Sands’ new album is apt.

The jazz pianist says he was trying to be freer and more flexible on ""Be Water,"" and it shows. The set's 10 cuts explore a wide range of moods and instrumental combinations, with Sands' trio at the core.

Much of the material is built on the same pattern of tension and release found in a body of water. That begins with the opening ""Intro,"" which settles on the tonic chord after nearly four minutes of shimmering undulation.

The reflective ""Still,"" featuring Marvin Sewell on acoustic guitar, rides a mere ripple of rhythm. On ""Be Water II,"" a string quartet plays against the lapping beat established by Sands' piano. Marcus Strickland's woodwind work makes ""Drive"" swing as it crests with a cascading electric guitar solo by Sewell.

Sands rarely cuts loose at the piano — his objective isn't to be splashy — but he takes an active role as the producer, overdubbing extra keyboards and including sound effects and brief recitations by martial artist Bruce Lee. ""Water can flow, or it can crash,"" Lee says. Forgive the flood of puns, but ""Be Water"" flows freely.",[]

The band lends a sweeping grandeur to most of the tracks with horns and strings punching up already-rowdy guitar riffs.

The newspaper explained the decision in a note by Bill Sternberg, editorial page editor, attached to the column online. Navarro's column originally moved online late Tuesday and was published in Wednesday's newspaper.

article continues below

Navarro wrote that Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, ""has been wrong about everything I interacted with him on.""

The newspaper on Wednesday evening also ran a fact-check story by Washington reporter Ledyard King examining five of Navarro's claims.

It wasn't clear how Navarro's column escaped such scrutiny before being published. Sternberg said in an email that he's letting his editorial note speak for itself. The incident is reminiscent of The New York Times saying last month that an opinion column by U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton hadn't been properly vetted, which led to the resignation of the paper's opinion editor.

Navarro did not immediately return a message for comment.

USA Today said it had sought Navarro's opinion to accompany an editorial that the newspaper ran calling Fauci ""a national treasure.""

That editorial said the fact that Navarro was writing the opposing viewpoint ""shows how hard it is to find an actual medical professional willing to undercut Fauci.""

It wasn't clear whether the newspaper sought those opinions.

Fauci has essentially been shelved by the White House as a prominent spokesperson on the coronavirus pandemic because he's publicly been more pessimistic than the president. He does webcasts but rarely gives television interviews anymore.

Trump distanced himself from Navarro's column, saying Wednesday that the column was Navarro's views and ""he shouldn't be doing that.""

Navarro claimed in the column that Fauci opposed travel restrictions from China that were imposed by Trump that ""might well have saved hundreds of thousands of American lives."" USA Today said there isn't enough data to conclude the restrictions made a significant difference, and that despite some initial skepticism, Fauci backed the president.

The fact-checker also gave more context to Navarro claims about masks, the drug hydroxychloroquine and Fauci's early statements of concern about the virus.",[]

He’s returned to the charts in 2020, working on songs for rising and established rap stars, including Lil Wayne, Juice WRLD, Saweetie and Doja Cat.

The songmaster, who has been entangled in a bitter lawsuit with former collaborator Kesha since 2014, has produced and co-written Saweetie’s new single ""Tap In,"" the follow-up to her double-platinum smash ""My Type."" Dr. Luke also co-wrote and co-produced Juice WRLD’s ""Wishing Well,"" taken from the rapper’s first posthumous album ""Legends Never Die,"" released last week.

article continues below

The recent successes mean all three major U.S. record label companies have worked with Dr. Luke this year, even if he hasn't always put his widely recognizable professional name to the new collaborations.

Dr. Luke marked a major comeback this year with the success of the Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hit ""Say So"" by rapper-singer Doja Cat, who is signed to Dr. Luke's Kemosabe Records. Dr. Luke, born Lukasz Sebastian Gottwald, produced several songs on Cat’s sophomore album ""Hot Pink,"" including single ""Like That,"" which is No. 5 on Billboard’s Hot R&B songs chart. He is the only producer with two songs in the Top 10 on the latter chart (""Say So"" sits at No. 2).

For his work with Cat, he used the alias Tyson Traxe. He used the same pseudonym for his production credit on Toronto rapper-singer Benny Mayne’s ""Hokey Pokey,"" released this year. For Lil Wayne’s ""Shimmy,"" a track featuring Cat on the deluxe edition of his latest album ""Funeral,"" Dr. Luke used the name Loctor Duke.

Label representatives for Saweetie, Juice WRLD, Lil Wayne and Cat didn’t immediately reply to emails seeking comment. Neither did a representative for Dr. Luke.

Luke has sprinkled his comeback among the major labels. Cat is signed to Sony Music’s RCA Records, while Saweetie is part of the Warner Music family. Lil Wayne releases music through his Young Money imprint and Republic Records, a division of Universal Music Group.

Before Dr. Luke topped the charts this year with ""Say So,"" he last had a No. 1 with Katy Perry's ""Dark Horse"" in 2014. Months later, Kesha accused him of sexual assault during their yearslong partnership (Dr. Luke has vigorously denied the allegations.)

A New York court dismissed Kesha’s sexual abuse-related claims in 2016 because of legal issues, without ruling on whether the allegations were true. Kesha lost another round in February, when a New York judge said she made a defamatory statement about Dr. Luke on a different occasion: a 2016 text message telling Gaga the producer had also raped Perry. Both he and Perry have denied it, and the judge said there was ""no evidence whatsoever"" to support the claim.

Kesha’s lawyers have said they plan to appeal the ruling, but it didn’t resolve other aspects of his defamation and breach-of-contract suit, including the crucial question of whether Kesha’s allegation that he raped her is true. The judge said that’s for a jury to decide at trial.

Outside of rap in 2020, Dr. Luke has produced music for pop singer Kim Petras, using the pseudonym MADE IN CHINA.",[]

In fact, women may be at a higher risk than men due to the sheer societal views of sleep apnea.

Marina Abramskey, a Registered Respiratory Therapist at CanSleep Services, says women are less likely to report snoring due to embarrassment, and may even under-report it to their physician. “Women often associate it as a ‘men’s’ disease, and are unaware that other symptoms can be the cause of sleep apnea,” she said.

article continues below

There are different types of sleep apnea with various symptoms. Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is the most common form; it is a breathing disorder that is caused by a blockage in the pharynx, at the back of the throat, obstructing airflow. It can cause patients to stop breathing repeatedly throughout their sleep.

Women experience different, subtler, symptoms of sleep apnea than men do. Abramskey said women are more likely to experience morning headaches, fatigue and tiredness, depression, and insomnia, rather than snoring or waking gasping, which are more common in men. “Because of the different symptoms experienced by women – mainly tiredness and insomnia – they are more likely to attribute it to taking care of the household and children, or even a stressful job rather than sleep apnea,” Abramskey added.

In both the medical and non-medical worlds, sleep apnea was traditionally seen as a men’s condition. However, as physicians become more educated on women’s symptoms, Abramskey said more women are being referred for sleep studies. So far, the studies have shown that women’s anatomies are different and therefore, women’s apnea and hypopneas are also different. “Women might experience shorter apneas and more in REM sleep,” Abramskey said.

As the medical field progresses with its studies on women and sleep apnea, Abramskey said it is especially important for women to report any sleep apnea symptoms to their physicians, or to consult the Registered Respiratory Therapists at CanSleep Services.

Between Oct. 24 and Dec. 5, the city received rezoning and business licence applications for cannabis retail stores at 22 locations around the city. Following an evaluation process, staff recommended five applications for retail cannabis stores including four private stores – Maple Leaf Greenery at 71 Sixth St. (downtown); Muse Cannabis – 532 Sixth St. (uptown); the Herb Co. Cannabis Store – 451 East Columbia St. (Sapperton); and Westcanna – 710 12th St. – and one public store to be operated by B.C. Cannabis Stores at Queensborough Landing Shopping Centre.

article continues below

As part of a plan to allow five initial cannabis retail shops to open in New Westminster, city staff evaluated all of the applications using a checklist that includes items related to: location and land use; business operations, nuisance and security; and esthetics (such as signage, windows and gates).

The city’s plan has been to see a blend of public and private operators, and to have one shop in each of the downtown, uptown and Sapperton neighbourhoods and two shops in remaining commercial areas. At Monday’s meeting, council voted four to three to consider the Queensborough Cannabis Co. Ltd.’s application for a store at 540 Ewen Ave. instead of the government store in Queensborough Landing.

“I understand that council originally was hopeful or interested in the idea of a public cannabis store to be part of the first stores that opened. I support that, except I feel that the B.C. Cannabis Store that has put forward an application has scored quite low as compared to the other location in Queensborough,” said Coun. Mary Trentadue. “I don’t feel that the argument of having a public store is strong enough to outweigh the scores of those two. I feel an independent store has done its work. It’s provided all the information required. It has a fairly high score, and I think that’s a reasonable reason to put forward that business, as opposed to the B.C. one, which has not scored well at all.”

Because the city’s plan was to have a mix of public and private stores, Coun. Jaimie McEvoy said the staff recommendation was consistent with the process laid out by the city.

“I believe in the role of the public sector in this. I think it’s important,” he said. “I think the role of the B.C. Liquor Branch in this is going to be a critical part of its success, particularly in a community-sensitive location like Queensborough. That role is going to be an important part of seeing how this works and being able to compare and draw lessons from both the public and private sector, rather than just one of those sectors.”

Councillors Trentadue, Patrick Johnstone and Nadine Nakagawa and Mayor Jonathan Cote supported consideration of the application from the private store, while councillors Chinu Das, McEvoy and Puchmayr preferred having a government-run store in Queensborough. (BC Cannabis Stores had an overall score of 28, compared to the Queensborough Cannabis Co. Ltd. score of 40.)

Council has directed staff to prepare a zoning amendment bylaw to permit the retail sale of cannabis at the five locations in the city and will consider first and second readings of the bylaw on April 8. The city will hold a public hearing on April 29, at which time council would also consider third reading and adoption of the bylaw.",[]

I think it’s a great idea and one the city should consider continuing well into the future. Making communities friendlier to pedestrians and cyclists is the way of the future. We need to get people out of their pollution-spewing vehicles.

This disgusting anti-abortion material has started arriving in New West mail boxes and mail slots.

article continues below

The flyers are being called out for the terrible images displayed and the anti-choice message.

“Hey #NewWest, someone just put a very graphic anti-choice/anti-abortion flyer through my mail slot,” tweeted New West resident @IjustKat. “It appears there is active campaigning in our city attacking the rights and autonomy of people with uteruses over our own bodies .., it’s gross enough on its own but something about putting it through my mail slot into my house that makes it extra offensive.”

That’s a key point for people. Someone coming onto your property and inserting it through a mail slot also exposes children to the graphic images, which can be seen embedded in this blog post.

Flyers being delivered by hand to residents. Screenshot

I wrote recently about a father of two named Dustin whose children sadly saw the graphic flyers.

“My kids went to get my neighbours mail as they were away,” Dustin said. “I found our 7 and 4 year olds sitting on my neighbour’s front lawn looking at that disgusting anti-abortion pamphlet. My 4-year-old ran to his room screaming. I phoned the RCMP and they said they would call the company to suggest they don’t distribute them that way. They didn’t care to find the person distributing them.”

I’ve included a photo below of one of the images because some readers said they wanted more ""proof,"" but I have blurred out the more disgusting parts of it.

People legally have a right to print up flyers like this, but I don’t feel they have the right to step on private property and inflict this on people.

I wrote recently about Keith, a Burnaby resident with two young children who get a kick out of going to grab the daily mail from the box outside his home.

Luckily, Keith’s kids didn’t see the flyers.

“(They) would have been greeted by very explicit images that should not be shown to kids,” said Keith.

Keith checked the footage from the security cameras he had installed and they show a woman with a stack of the flyers dropping one off.

The flyers were not delivered in a sealed envelope and Keith thinks that, at the very least, they should be.

“As the pamphlets are not delivered in a sealed envelope, they often end up in the hands of children,” he said. “And the girl delivering the flyers could clearly tell we have kids by the amount of kids’ stuff around our yard. Distributing graphic images like these, which easily end up being viewed by children, should be illegal. Movies, books and games all have a rating system and packaging must be made appropriate. These images are worse, and should be provided only with a warning.”

The question was one faced by parents around British Columbia as their children’s schools sent out surveys asking one deceptively simple question: Do you intend to have your child return to in-class instruction starting June 1?

article continues below

It’s amazing how complicated one simple question can be.

For the record, I said No. My daughter isn’t returning for in-class instruction in New West on Monday. But I can’t remember the last time a simple question caused me so much what-iffing, but-waiting and on-the-other-handing.

My initial response to the news that schools were reopening their doors in June was one huge and enthusiastic “yahoo!” Our seven-year-old is an only child. She’s been learning at home since March break, while my husband and I have both been working remotely at jobs that have demanded more-than-full-time attention.

Finding a way to spend time with her has been, without a doubt, the single biggest challenge we’ve faced since we all came home for March break and never went back to our outside lives. Trying to engage and interact with her, to help her figure out the necessary technology, to make sure she’s on top of her assignments and gets her half-hour of reading done and writes her daily journal and checks out her virtual music lesson and doesn’t try to sneak extra YouTube videos in while she’s supposed to be doing Mathletics and then trying to think of ways we can all get fresh air and exercise and do something fun because you’re supposed to do something fun every day and why can’t I just bake cookies and if I was a good mom I would be baking cookies right now and helping her learn how to do more household chores and after all this pandemic isn’t supposed to be all bad I mean other people are having fun right now so why am I not having fun and why am I not sleeping and somebody hand me the Advil because I have a migraine and dammit I’m not supposed to take Advil now because wasn’t there something about Advil and COVID-19 so fine make it Tylenol and where is my coffee and

and

and

My right eye is twitching again just typing it all out.

Suffice it to say, sending our daughter back to school seemed like a good idea.

The thought that somebody else – somebody trained and qualified and good at teaching; somebody she’ll listen to and learn properly from instead of digging in her heels and resisting help – would take over her education? Yes, please.

And friends? In the solitary life of only children everywhere, Facetime and Messenger Kids have been her lifeline to other humans under the age of 10. And even though she’s an introvert at heart who enjoys her own space and keeps herself company pretty well, it’s not the same as spending time with other kids.

Returning to class, even part-time, could only be a win all around – for my husband, for me and for my daughter.

But wait.

We’re still in the midst of a viral pandemic. And, although all indications at this point are that the virus doesn’t transmit readily among groups of children, there are still a lot of question marks. What do we really know about how the virus will react until we try it out and see? And do I want my child to be part of one of those test groups? What if it all gets worse, fast, once groups of kids start assembling again? Do I want our family to come in contact with so many other people who may or may not have been taking social distancing as seriously as we have?

But wait.

I know the school district is taking its direction from people who know far more than I do. The B.C. Centre for Disease Control and public health officials and the Ministry of Education wouldn’t be clearing the return to school if they hadn’t decided, based on science and evidence, that it was possible to minimize and contain the risks.

But wait.

Even if our daughter does go back to school, will her friends be there? And will she really enjoy it, given how different the school day is going to look? If the kids aren’t allowed to work together and interact normally and play on the playground like they usually would, is she going to get the kind of social interaction that is at least half the reason we want to send her back? On the other hand, isn’t some social interaction, even limited and restricted interaction, better than none at all?

But wait.

If she doesn’t go back to school, can I keep doing this? Can I really make it through another month of muddling through home learning while I’m trying to navigate a full-time job? Can I handle being the “bad guy” every day (or, more accurately, taking turns with my husband being the bad guy) and forcing her to do the schoolwork she’d rather skip and dealing with the subsequent moods and attitude? Do I even want to try?

But wait.

Anxiety. She’s an anxiety-prone kind of kid, and we’ve finally managed to work through a lot of the anxiety she had – and, let’s face it, that we had - about the world turning upside down around us. We’ve found a bit of a “normal” in the way we live now, and we’re making it work (ish), so do I want to turn that all on its head, again, for the sake of a few weeks of school? If she takes a couple of weeks to get used to a new routine – and she always does – then is it even worth it for the little time that’s left in the school year?

But wait.

Is it fair to our daughter’s teacher to keep her home, when the teacher is going to be in class and ready to teach? Is it fair to my daughter to keep her home if her friends are going to be at school? Is it fair to me and my husband to keep her home when our jobs are still as demanding as ever? Is it fair that I even feel like all of this isn’t fair, given that we’re both employed and we have a home and we lack for nothing and we rate pretty damn high on the scale of pandemic privilege?

So yeah.

That “do you intend to send your child back to school” question was a simple one. It just didn’t come with a built-in guaranteed right answer.

In the end, our daughter’s own verdict that she’d rather continue learning at home tipped the balance for us. But even as I filled out “No” on the survey and sent it back to the school principal, I wondered if we were doing the right thing.

I still wonder.

It helps to know that our daughter is, after all, in Grade 2. Realizing that whatever decision we make, her entire academic future is not at stake here – well, that helps. And so does the fact that she has a dedicated and supportive teacher who has been 100% available to her students and their families since this crazy journey began. She’s assured us that our child will be fine, either way, and that she’s here to support the decision that works best for us.

So I feel good about our “No.” Mostly.

But let me be clear: I’m not casting judgment on anyone who said Yes and whose children will be back in school on Monday. I can think of a thousand reasons why parents want – and, in some cases, need – to have their children back in class. My decision isn’t intended to in any way cast aspersions on those reasons. I only hope that, by having families like ours step out of the in-class instruction part of learning, perhaps we can free up some of the teachers’ time and attention for those students who need that face-to-face contact more than we do.

We may still change our minds.

If COVID-19 has taught us nothing else, it has at least taught us that we can’t predict what life’s going to throw at us next. Everything may stay very much the same for the next month. Or everything could be upside down tomorrow.

All we can do is make the best decision for us right now, with the information we have available. And if something changes? Well, we’ll move on and do the next right thing – whatever that may be.

For all my fellow parents who’ve agonized over all of this too, solidarity. And for the teachers and administrators who have been working so phenomenally hard to make remote learning work and then to gear up for the return to class, all without missing a beat for our kids, my deepest gratitude.

As for my daughter? Well, she just got off a long Messenger Kids chat with her aunt in Toronto and is now, I suspect, sneaking YouTube videos instead of doing Mathletics.

But you know what? She’s done all her work for the week, and she’s not in any danger of losing her Grade 2 year if I give us both a break and let it go.

Me too.

I’m sitting here writing this post as an act of solidarity with all of the parents who are also muddling through the brave new world of working full-time from home while attempting something resembling “home schooling” with your children.

Let me preface this up front by saying this: I know what a fortunate position I am in. Right here, right now, this house has two partners who are both working full-time. We are caring for one child, we have a freezer and a pantry full of food, and we have enough tucked away for a rainy day that even if it all came crashing down tomorrow we’d be fine for the time being.

These are blessings that I don’t take for granted.

But, while my gratitude for full-time work (work that I love and happen to get a paycheque for) remains boundless, it also means that neither my husband nor I have the time to be as engaged and involved with our daughter as we’d like. All those marvellous lists of resources and educational ideas for parents that are going around social media? They’re awesome, but the chances of me having time to delve into them, let alone sit down and actually interact with my child to make most of them happen, are slim to none.

I do not need any posts about “how to make baking muffins an educational activity for your child” or “how you and your child can build a backyard rocketship.” What I need are basic strategies for survival. Period.

So I’m writing my own.

Thanks to some crowd-sourced wisdom from the New West Moms Group on Facebook, I have come up with this list of strategies to help you stay sane while you pretend this is a balancing act you can actually accomplish.

Take what will help you, discard what won’t, or just swear at me from the comfort of your own home if it’ll make you feel better.

Here, for what it’s worth, are my 10 survival strategies:

1. MAKE SURE EVERYONE HAS A WORK SPACE.

Whether you have an actual “home office” or you’re working on a laptop in the living room, try to make sure everyone in the house has a defined work space – and that includes your child. Everyone needs a space where they can go to be (mostly) uninterrupted and where they can work without being distracted by others.

Be sure your children know that when you’re at your work space, you’re working and therefore not meant to be interrupted except for important questions. Offer them the same courtesy in return with their schoolwork space.

Consider making your own “Do Not Disturb” sign to hang next to you when you really need a designated amount of quiet time (for an important meeting, for instance).

No, you’ll never stop the “Moo-ooooom” questions. But the more you can provide visual cues that you are “at work” or “at school,” the more you can help your whole family separate those tasks from the “at home” hours – and the more fun it’ll be to hang out together when you’re all “at home” again in the evening.

Or, at least, you can tell yourself that. It hasn’t entirely worked for me yet, but I remain convinced that it’s a strategy that will pay off – eventually.

2. ACCEPT REALITY.

Reality #1: You’re not at your office, so your dream of uninterrupted time to focus on work is officially on hold. Indefinitely.

Reality #2: You’re not “home schooling.” You’re pinch hitting in a crisis, to the best of your ability (whatever that means for you), but unless you’re actually a teacher in real life, you’re not a teacher – and you didn’t just suddenly become one because your kid is sitting there staring expectantly at you expecting you to make this all make sense for her.

So work isn’t going to be “normal,” and neither is school. The faster you can accept both of those facts, the better off you’ll be.





3. COMMUNICATE.

Communicate with your own work team – your co-workers, your boss – and being clear about what you can and cannot achieve and when you can and cannot be available. No one (well, no one with any common sense and compassion) expects that you’ll be the exact same employee you are at the office when your child is safely ensconced at school or daycare. Everyone knows you will have some distractions and that maybe the old nine-to-five expectations are off the table right now. Talk to your team, if you need to, about how you can all help each other make this transition to working at home easier.

Even more importantly, communicate with your child’s teacher. That teacher is still guiding your child’s education, and he or she is now also struggling to navigate some very unfamiliar territory. Stay in touch. If you’re struggling to help your child, reach out. Chances are other parents are struggling, too, and the more honest we all are with the teachers in our lives, the more those teachers will be able to help us help our children.

And, above all, communicate to yourself. Repeat to yourself, as many times a day as you need to: I am not alone. We are in this together.

4. BE FLEXIBLE WITH YOUR HOURS.

How much of your work must be done at a certain time, and how much do you just stick to your routines because that’s how you’ve always done it? Your answer will be individual to your own situation, but, wherever possible, now’s the time to rethink the way your schedule works.

If you have a partner in the house, sit down and rethink your schedules together. Can one be the “more available” parent in the morning and one in the afternoon? Can some work get done in the evenings or on the weekends? Can you take longer lunch hours to give yourself a chance to play in the backyard or go for a walk with your child in the middle of the day? However you can free yourself up to give your child some attention and engagement during the day, it’s worth giving it a try.

And if that way fails? Then try something different. These days life is all about different. Go with it, and see what kind of new “normal” you can create for your own family in a world where nothing is normal at all.



5. SET UP A SCHEDULE.

Whether you’re the kind of person who likes to map out your day down to the minute or the kind who likes to go with the flow, everyone – especially the small humans in the house – will benefit from some kind of routine.

Decide how your household’s “schedule” is going to work. Whether it’s a list of tasks that can be accomplished in any order (which is how we like it), or whether it’s a specific hourly plan, commit that plan to paper and post it in a place where you can all see it.

My daughter’s in Grade 2; I know that her academic future won’t be irredeemably altered if she fails to complete her journal writing or her two tasks in Mathletics today. But having those expectations written down on a task list helps her, because she can take her checklist and run with it while I do my own work (and, yes, answer the inevitable questions that arise while she’s working).

Another help for us? Build rewards into your schedule to keep everyone motivated. For my kidlet, it’s earning extra screen time by finishing academic, creative and household tasks. For me, it’s sitting down with a glass of Naramata rosé and a satisfying murder mystery novel to end my evening.



6. KEEP EVERYONE FED.

Snacks, snacks and more snacks. Make sure your day, and your child’s, includes food.

It seems like a foolish thing to say, but it’s amazing to me how often I can “forget” to eat when I get engrossed in something work-related. And if you have a child who, like mine, suffers from a bad case of the hangries when food doesn’t arrive on time, you want to be prepared.

However you choose to provide that food is up to you. Maybe your household works best with specific snack items set out in easy-to-reach bins for the kids so they can grab their own food when they need it. Maybe you’re more of a fridge free-for-all family or a formal-sit-down-meal household. Whatever your style, just keep everyone nourished and hydrated.

And then do it all again tomorrow. And the next day. And the next day. And the one after that.



7. GET OUTDOORS AND GET MOVING.

Your child needs fresh air, and so do you. And, here on the West Coast, we’ve been blessed by the arrival of spring in all its cherry-blossom-and-magnolia-tree glory. So get outside, every day. Twice a day if you can. Whether that means taking a longer lunch to get outdoors together, going for an early-morning jog or taking to your neighbourhood streets for an after-work stroll, make sure you get out and give yourselves that brain break.

And get moving. Crank the tunes and throw yourselves a dance party, search out some yoga on YouTube, or whatever it takes to work out your body and shake off some stress. Heck, just run laps around the yard or the living room if it helps.

Tire out all the bodies in your house, and hopefully all the minds will sleep better.

8. RELAX SCREEN TIME RIGIDITY.

I know, I know, you have screen time limits for a reason, and so do I. But we can all allow ourselves to relax those limits – at least a little - right about now.

If you absolutely need your child to stay out of your hair while you’re in a Zoom meeting, or you have two hard hours of work to complete on a tight deadline, then maybe a movie on the TV or a half-hour of precious games on the iPad will be the solution to buy you the time you require.

If your child is a bookworm who loves reading more than screen time, then embrace the magical unicorn that you are raising and let her go to town on books instead. But for the rest of us mortals? Screen time may be just the break we need.

9. LAUGH.

Seriously, just start laughing now, because it’s all crazy, and someday it’ll have to be funny because if it’s not funny you’ll just start crying and you might not stop.

So find the funny side, fast. And if you can’t find the funny side in your daughter’s attempt to dress the cats in Easter outfits or in your own attempts to produce home baking, then turn to the experts and put on your favourite funny TV show or podcast, or seek out some comedy on YouTube. Or something. Anything to get the giggles going.

Embrace this new life you are leading, in all its bizarre gloriousness, and laugh. And, yes, laughter tinged with overtired maniacal hysteria is still laughter.

10. ALLOW YOURSELF THE GRACE TO BE IMPERFECT.

You’re going to suck at this sometimes. Probably even a lot of the time. You’re going to be stressed, frazzled and emotional. You may lose your patience with your child, forget to return a phone call, or not remember what day it is. And you may do all of those things with or without a shower, with or without clean hair, and with or without pants.

You are not in fact an incurable mess. You are just a human being, navigating what is undoubtedly the strangest time in your personal history. It’s OK if that contact has to wait a few hours for an email, or if your child does not in fact finish her two tasks in Mathletics today.

Her future and yours do not depend upon perfection. They depend only upon you showing up and doing your best, whatever that looks like today.

That’s it. That’s all I’ve got. And if you see a frazzled-looking mom with her unwashed hair in a messy ponytail wearing the same leggings she’s been wearing for a week and dragging a whining blonde seven-year-old around the neighbourhood for a walk, that’s probably me.

Feel free to say hi. I’ll say hi back, and I promise I’ll even smile.

We may or may not actually have this whole situation in hand. But whatever happens, remember: we’re all in this together.",[]

But right now, it just pisses me off.

article continues below

When I see a troop of teens huddled together on the beach, sharing drinks and scooching closer to snap selfies, it doesn’t make me miss my high school days, it makes my stomach turn.

This isn’t a snow day, and it’s not the spring break social time that we’ve come to expect during this time of year.

We have yet to see the worst of this global pandemic, and while some seem to be brushing off the warnings by the authorities, I’m starting to take their ignorance personally.

COVID-19 is spreading quickly, and we’ve been urged to stay home and act as though we’ve already contracted the contagious disease.

Many cases are mild enough that the carrier doesn’t realize that they’ve been infected. One visit to a family member or friend, and the virus is passed on, and the spread continues.

In one of her latest updates, Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer, urges residents to stay home, and only go out for essential trips such as to the grocery store. She emphasized that it’s alright to go for walks, but only with the members that live in your household.

Playdates are not ok. Coffee dates with friends are unacceptable. Crowding into public spaces - even if they are outdoors, is not practicing social distancing. Continuing to do these things will put our province in the same position as Italy, with rapidly spiking cases and increasing death rates by the hour. We could be where they are, only weeks from now, if we don’t start listening to the cautions today.

Physicians are working together to help spread the word, encouraging everyone to stay indoors. In an email sent to my aunt by her own physician, the content reads, “The time to act is now. Our province is in a state of emergency. What we do today will impact the health of British Columbians in the weeks to come. Stay home unless absolutely necessary. No dinner parties. No shopping. No sports, not even outside. Instead, have coffee with a friend online. Keep six feet or two metres away from everyone at all times. Call your loved ones and tell them to do the same.

Remind young people in your life that they can get sick from this virus. More importantly, they can be carriers and cause a lot of harm to parents, grandparents, and other loved ones.”

I get it, your kids are bored. Your teens are craving social interactions, and you need to separate stir crazy siblings. But it’s time to listen to the experts.

Our city shouldn’t have to tape up playgrounds, close down coffee shops, and barricade beaches to get you to stay home.

Because the only thing more annoying than staying home, is knowing that other people aren’t.

She didn’t seem concerned, more just curious about the introduction of a new word to her ever-growing vocabulary, and as she looked back down at her Lego structure that she was building, I realized that it was time to be honest with her.

article continues below

Because while I’ve spent the last couple of weeks hovered over my computer, watching live Q&A broadcasts with the World Health Organization (WHO), reading updates on the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) website, and following the latest travel advisories posted on Health Canada, my kids have been mostly in the dark about the quickly-spreading disease.

Last week we cancelled what was going to be our first-ever family trip abroad, a two-week trek through the south of France for spring break, and since then, our plans have been ever-changing. Maybe we’ll just go to Palm Springs or Phoenix instead? Nope, increased cases in the US. Maybe we’ll visit another province in Canada? Nope, air travel is not recommended. A ferry to Victoria? Social distancing doesn’t recommend time spent in such close quarters with so many people.

As I write this, the coronavirus has spread to 146 countries, with over 153,000 confirmed cases around the world - 73 of which are right here in BC. Things are changing by the hour, and while we’re all, for the most part, trying to remain calm, most of our kids are concerned, curious, or confused as they watch us as we watch things evolve.

It’s time to be open and honest with our kids about the coronavirus and all that’s happening around the world. They need to know why they can’t go to Science World, or hang out at the mall, and they need to know the severity of the situation.

Start by asking them questions to find out what they know - or think they know already. Then, let’s not just tell them to wash their hands, but explain why it’s more important than ever right now. Let’s explain to them that it’s not just about us getting sick, but about the people around us who are already sick or immunocompromised too. Let’s make sure they know that it’s not ok to make jokes about COVID-19 as the global death toll continues to rise.

Let’s tell our kids where to find the facts, and not to listen to the fiction that is filling their ears from friends and on social media platforms. Let’s explain the border closures and self-quarantines and stockpiling that’s happening, and let’s also show them videos of how people are coming together, supporting small businesses, providing for their sick neighbours who need help, and using this pandemic to come together as a community.

And then let’s comfort them, let them know that we’re here to answer their questions, and that we’ll do our best to keep them healthy and safe. And let’s follow through with that promise, because friends, this is only the beginning.

Financial Services Authority (BCFSA) said June 16.

“The current state of the strata insurance market is unhealthy,” said authority vice-president and deputy superintendent for regulation Frank Chong.

article continues below

Minister of Finance Carole James said rising condo and apartment building costs are serious issues for thousands of British Columbians.

“This is especially true with many people facing additional financial pressure related to the COVID-19 pandemic,” she said. “We knew this was a complex issue, and now we have a clearer picture of the different local, national and global factors affecting cost and availability within the insurance market.”

Among key report findings, based on a survey of 6,000 strata and townhouse properties, are:

• an average increase of 40% year-over-year to strata insurance premiums province-wide;

• a 50% increase in Metro Vancouver;

• 54% of strata properties experienced a premium increase of less than 30% compared to premiums the previous year;

• 31% of strata properties saw increases in the 30-50 % range;

• 9% faced year-over-year increases of 50 -100%; and

• 6% saw increases in excess of 100% compared to the previous year.

“Price pressures will continue,” the authority said in the report to James. “Buildings considered to be higher risk are expected to face the most significant increases as well as the possibility of not being able to obtain full, or in rare cases any, insurance coverage.""

The data is in an interim report done at the direction of the provincial government. Further findings will be released in the fall after continued stakeholder consultations, Chong said.

The authority regulates the province’s insurance industry, among other things.

CEO Blair Morrison said the market is failing to meet goals of sustainability, affordability and availability.

“Despite large increases already being felt, the situation has not yet stabilized, meaning many stratas, particularly those in buildings considered to be higher risk by insurers, can expect to face further pricing pressures as well as the risk of not being able to obtain full strata property insurance coverage,” Morrison said.

The industry generates about $300 million in premiums, covering more than $100 billion of insured property value. Coverage is mandatory under B.C.’s Strata Property Act, the authority told James.

Insurance under the act, which must provide full replacement value of the common strata property and assets, does not cover individual unit insurance, which owners need to ensure under individual policies.

The authority said earthquake coverage is not required under the act, but it is often included in strata property coverage.

“Strata corporations that choose not to purchase earthquake coverage are still covered for fire damage following an earthquake,” the authority told James. “An estimated 1.5 million residents live in strata properties in BC and properties can range from under $1 million to over $200 million in insured value.”

The investigation found evidence showing the industry has been incurring losses over the past three years from mostly minor claims, particularly from water damage, due to poor building maintenance.

“The data suggests that strata insurance has also been used to fill in the gaps left by other forms of protection such as home warranties for new buildings and maintenance programs for older buildings,” the authority said.

Further complicating things is the exposure to risk insurers have to earthquake damages in B.C. which has prompted many to reduce the amount of insurance they offer, the study found.

“With this reduction in capacity comes upward price pressures,” the authority said.

“It’s clear there is no quick fix for this problem,” James said. “It’s important to recognize that the dynamics driving these increases are playing out in the private insurance industry – government does not set insurance rates or regulate pricing.”

She said the government is reviewing the report and will be bringing in legislation this summer as a first step to help tackle this problem, while the authority continues its engagement with the sector.

While legislation details won’t be released before being introduced in the Legislature, Liberal Party Opposition Leader Andrew Wilkinson has called on James to take action.

“Skyrocketing strata insurance costs represent one more unexpected hit to the wallets of British Columbians, with a growing number truly at risk of losing their homes. Action by your government is needed now,” Wilkinson said in a June 16 letter to James.

Wilkinson suggested the following actions be taken:

• implementation of a temporary tax holiday on the 4.4% Insurance Premium Tax applicable on strata property to leave money in the pockets of strata owners;

• Extension on a temporary basis the Property Tax Deferment Program to enable strata owners facing extraordinary additional expenses to defer a portion of their property taxes;

• changes to Strata Property Act and regulations that ensure annual contributions are made to a strata corporation’s consolidated revenue fund at levels acceptable considering a building’s age, claims history and other unique circumstances;

• require strata corporations to have a depreciation report detailing necessary maintenance every year;

• require a strata corporation to inform owners and tenants of any material change in insurance coverage, including an increase in any deductible, as soon as feasible;

• develop a mandatory education and training program for strata council members, with particular emphasis on risk mitigation;

• review the B.C. Building Code and implement new requirements focused on the prevention and severity of water damage events, and;

• require the B.C. Financial Services Authority to make public the data and information it is gathering from insurance companies to better understand the current climate of rapidly rising strata insurance.

Condominium Home Owners' Association of B.C. CEO Tony Gioventu in March warned that uninsured condo owners could find themselves bankrupt and homeless if they didn’t maintain suites and personal insurance as strata insurance costs skyrocket.

Birds Nest Properties handles condo and townhouse rentals in Vancouver, Burnaby and Richmond. Director Alvin Cheung said the situation is putting pressures on both strata corporations and individual owners.

Cheung said some buildings have seen deductibles rise from $250,000 to $750,000, situations that have led to special levies for unit owners.

“What if all the owners can’t pay the special levy? What happens then?” he asked.

That could lead to cases of buildings not triggering their insurance leaving owners to pay for repairs or upkeep just not being done.

“It would be a neglected building,” he said.

And that could cause future insurance coverage problems, he agreed.

As well, Cheung said, landlords have seen their landlord insurance premiums leap, in some cases from $500 to $4,000 a year.

They were also 63% lower than the 10-year sales average for the month - a direct result, said the board, of social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Predictably, the number of home sales and listings declined in April given the physical distancing measures in place,” Colette Gerber, REBGV’s president-elect said. “People are, however, adapting.”

According to Gerber, this adaptation is coming in the form of “using different technology to showcase homes virtually, assess neighbourhood amenities with their clients and handle paperwork electronically.”

Across the region, 1,109 homes changed hands last month. This is a 39.4% drop year-over-year and a 56.1% decline compared with March 2020.

The number of new listings for all residential property types was 2,313 in April, which is a 59.7% drop compared with April 2019 and a 47.9% decline compared with March 2020, when 4.436 homes were listed.

The benchmark price for all homes across the region is $1,036,000, which is 2.5% higher than it was one year prior.

“Home prices have held relatively steady in our region since the COVID-19 situation worsened in March,” Gerber said.

A total of 388 detached homes sold in April, which is 33.8% lower than the 586 homes of this type sold in April 2019. The benchmark price for detached homes is $1,462,100 - up 2.3% year-over-year.

In April 2020, 503 apartments were sold, which is 43.2% lower than the 885 homes sold in the same month last year. The benchmark price for apartments is $685,500, up 2.7% from April 2019.

For attached homes, sales reached 218 - a 39.1% decline year-over-year. The benchmark price was $796,800 - up 2.8% compared with the same month last year.

REBGV data includes sales and prices for Vancouver, West Vancouver, North Vancouver, Burnaby, New Westminster, Coquitlam, Port Coquitlam, Richmond, Port Moody, the Sunshine Coast, Whistler, Squamish, Pitt Meadows, Maple Ridge and South Delta. It does not include Langley or Surrey.

However, the vast majority of those transactions were in the first half of the month, and many of those deals reflect pre-pandemic buying activity, due to the reporting lag.

“The first two weeks of the month were the busiest days of the year for our region, with heightened demand and multiple offers becoming more common,” said Ashley Smith, REBGV president. “Like other aspects of our lives, this changed as concerns over the COVID-19 situation in our province grew.”

REBGV said April 2 that residential sales on the region’s MLS averaged 138 per day during the first ten business days of March, and 93 during the final ten business days of the month.

“Many of the sales recorded in March were in process before the provincial government declared a state of emergency. We’ll need more time to pass to fully understand the impact that the pandemic is having on the housing market,” Smith added.

Story continues below

Kevin Skipworth, a realtor with Dexter Realty, said, “This month’s numbers for Greater Vancouver are a tale of what could have been, not so much what will be… There is a time lag between when the contract is written and when it is reported. A degree of [March’s] activity came from transactions that were initiated prior to the increased attention to COVID-19.”

Cameron McNeill, partner and executive director at real estate marketing firm MLA, predicted that the market would see a hiatus until the pandemic is over, but then would rebound later. “While it is too soon to determine the real effects COVID-19 will have on the Greater Vancouver real estate market, we certainly expect significantly slower sales volumes in historically active spring months ahead. The speed and timing of recovery is uncertain, but long-term housing demand for the region will likely be heightened by Canada’s COVID-19 response, and supply constraints.”

Sellers still listing

Despite the pandemic, sellers continued to list their homes in March. There were 4,436 homes listed for sale in Metro Vancouver in March, which is 10.4 per cent lower than March 2019 but a 10.8 per cent increase compared with February 2020 this year, reported the board.

“I was surprised at the number of new listings,” said Skipworth. “It dropped off in the last week of the month but people are still coming to market. Perhaps some people who had been planning on selling decided to do so before the situation gets any worse. We’re also seeing some listing cancellations and re-lists of those properties, so that accounts for some of the new listings.”

With overall sales increasing more than new listings, the sales-to-active listings ratio for March 2020 increased to 26.3 per cent. By property type, the ratio is 21.1 per cent for detached homes, 33 per cent for townhomes, and 28.9 per cent for apartments.

One question mark is whether the no-eviction rule applies retroactively to tenants in recently purchased homes, where the new owner intends to occupy the property, or whether existing eviction notices served before the announcement have been grandfathered in.

Now, a leading real estate lawyer in Vancouver has offered clarification on this issue, following advice he received directly from the B.C. government.

Richard Bell of Bell Alliance told Glacier Media Real Estate on Monday, “Up until today [March 30], if an eviction notice has already been given to the tenants to vacate because the buyers are to take possession, that eviction still stands. However, any new home purchase contract, from today onwards, you will not be able to evict the tenant, under any section of the legislation.”

He added, “That was a big concern for us, as we [at Bell Alliance] are working on lots of purchase contracts where the notice of eviction for tenants had already been given. Those purchases can now go ahead.”

However, the eviction ban may significantly affect sales of currently tenanted homes, now that any new buyers wouldn’t be permitted to evict sitting tenants from March 30 onwards, until the ban is lifted.",[]

Home buyers who have paid their deposit and signed a purchase contract, who may now want to get out of the purchase since the pandemic hit, do not have a standard “Force majeure” or “Act of God” clause that will let them walk away, said Richard Bell of Bell Alliance in Vancouver. Such a clause would need to have been specifically written into the purchase contract to be applicable, which is unlikely, he said.

What’s more, if the buyer walks away from a purchase contract, even if they have lost their job and can no longer afford the home, they could be liable for much more than simply losing their deposit.

“If a buyer loses their job – well, that could happen any time,” Bell told Glacier Media Real Estate March 30. “If they can’t complete the deal, they become liable for at least the deposit. But there could be a further, knock-on liability, if the seller then resells for less than the original amount. The buyer who caused the original deal to collapse could also be liable for the difference.”

Bell added, “Then the question becomes, if the collapse of the original deal causes a series of deals in a chain to collapse, how remote is the original buyer’s liability? How many links in that chain is the buyer liable for? That’s when you get into a legal battle.”

A purchase contract can, however, be rendered void under the doctrine of “frustration” whereby the deal can’t go ahead and collapses under extraordinary circumstances, through no fault of either party. However, this requires the explicit agreement of both parties to the contract, explained Bell.

For example, a buyer may not want to go ahead with a home purchase due to lost income, and the vendor may equally not want to sell anymore because they can no longer afford to upsize, also due to lost income. Under such circumstances, the buyer and seller can come to an agreement whereby the contract is cancelled and the buyer’s deposit returned.

Cold feet a symptom of COVID-19

Vancouver realtor Kevin Skipworth of Dexter Realty is seeing a lot of nervousness among buyers who have signed purchase contracts. He told Glacier Media Real Estate March 31 that he had one buyer with cold feet because of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated concerns about the economy, but after discussion with their conveyancing lawyers, the deal finally went ahead.

“There’s really nothing in the contract that allows for a buyer to walk away from a transaction because of the virus pandemic, but that doesn’t stop anybody from trying. For us as realtors, it’s not our place to try to negotiate out of a contract, that’s where legal advice is the first place to go.

He agrees with Bell that there can be much pricier ramifications than merely a lost deposit. “Everybody seems to think you can walk away and just lose your deposit and that will be fine, but that’s not the case. Sellers can go after you for damages, and more.”

Bell said he is seeing some collapsed home purchases at his law firm, but this is not currently his key concern in terms of real estate conveyancing. He pointed to rules of social distancing and quarantining making it virtually impossible to comply with legal requirements that home buyers and mortgage consumers be present in person to sign contracts, along with their government ID.

“It’s a major roadblock to closing home purchases right now,” said Bell. “Different lenders require different things. But some are literally requiring that we go round to quarantined clients’ homes and have them show their ID to us through the window. It’s ridiculous. Hopefully it will change before long, so we can do it by video. We’re trying to get this up the chain of command.”

‘Force majeure’ in construction

One sector that may have some luck in claiming “force majeure” when failing to complete a contract due to COVID-19 is the construction industry, where sites have had to close due to the outbreak – depending on such a clause being in the contract.

Whether or not a judge under Canadian common law would grant “force majeure” varies greatly from case to case, said Sahil Shoor, a Waterloo, Ontario-based civil litigator for Gowling WLG, in a legal bulletin to the construction sector on March 20.

That is because while some contracts include “force majeure” clauses that clearly states diseases, plagues, epidemics or quarantine restrictions as applicable conditions (beyond the typical “acts of God” events such as natural disasters, fires, floods and wars), other make no such distinctions. Some other contracts yet, Shoor said, may not have a “force majeure” clause at all, further complicating the issue in court.

“In order to successfully rely on a force majeure clause, the relying party [contractor] has the burden of establishing Force Majeure Event and proving that the Force Majeure Event has effectively prevented the party from fulfilling its obligations under the construction contract,” Shoor said in the bulletin, adding the court will assess the merits of the case based on whether the COVIC-19 outbreak qualifies as a force majeure, whether the risk of not being able to complete the contract was “foreseeable and able to be mitigated,” as well was whether it was really impossible to complete the contract.

In cases where there is no clear description of an epidemic or disease as force majeure, a judge will often hinge decisions on the availability of an “alternative method of performance” – even if the alternative is significantly more expensive for the contractor applying for relief.

“As an example, are the party’s employees ill due to the virus and unable to work, or simply afraid to work and choosing not to attend?” Shoor said, adding that cases without a force majeure clause will follow similar lines of legal logic under the doctrine of frustration.

This is the third 50-basis-point cut this month as the bank does what it can to ease the cost of borrowing during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

The unscheduled rate decision brings the bank’s policy interest rate down to 0.25 per cent. At 0.75 per cent, it was the highest such rate among the central banks of G7 countries.

On Friday, Canada’s central bank also announced two new programs to bring greater liquidity to Canadian markets: the Commercial Paper Purchase Program (CPPP), and a quantitative easing program.

Under the latter, the bank will purchase a minimum of $5 billion in Government of Canada securities per week, starting April 1. The program will continue until Canada’s economic recovery is “well underway.”

Over the next 12 months, the CPPP will see the bank undertake primary and secondary market purchases of commercial paper issued by Canadian firms, municipalities and provincial agencies that have an outstanding commercial paper program. Poloz said the program will “help to restore a key source of short-term funding for businesses.”

Bank of Canada rate decisions over the last five quarters | Bank of Canada website

“The intent of our decision today is two-fold: to immediately support the financial system so it keeps on providing credit, and, over the longer term, to lay the foundation for the economy’s return to normalcy,” Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz said in an opening statement to media.

Although existing variable-rate mortgage holders will enjoy additional discounts from the BoC's new rate, whether or not the cuts will be passed on to new mortgage consumers remains to be seen. Thus far, despite two previous recent rate reductions of 50 basis points each, mortgage rates for new customers have been rising, not falling.

“This is a very uncertain time for banks and lenders, just as it is for consumers,” said Alex Conconi, CEO of Lendesk. “While the normal consequence of a Bank of Canada prime rate cut is to pass that on to borrowers, at the end of the day, banks control their own prime rate and it cannot be taken for granted amid COVID-19. Moreover, until recently, it wasn’t unusual to see variable rates that were prime minus something: now that has all but evaporated, and we’re seeing prime plus a spread. The consequence is that the banks are able to shore up some margin, which may be necessary if they are to take losses in other parts of their business. Meanwhile, consumers aren’t necessarily paying any less than they would have been paying a few months ago.”

Tenant advocates are openly wondering if it even makes sense to pay rent.

In a response to the COVID-19 crisis, the March 25 announcement by the provincial government will end virtually all rental evictions – including those currently in process – freeze rental increases, and pay $500 direct to landlords to help tenants battling job and income losses over the next three months.

""This is not the time to seek rent increases and there is just zero per cent chance of that happening,"" said Premier John Horgan. “Landlords will be prevented from legally raising rents starting April 1. Increases slated to take effect on April 1 will no longer be applied.”

Despite the good intentions, many say the unprecedented program is wide open to abuse. This is apparently recognized by the provincial government whose models concede that 100 per cent of B.C.’s 500,000 renters could theoretically qualify for assistance.

The new rental supplement is in addition to federal and provincial programs announced to offer financial aid to those who lose income due to the health crisis.

Mark Goodman, a multi-family real estate specialist with Goodman Commercial Inc. Vancouver, estimates B.C.'s rental aid package could add up to more than $1 billion over the next three months, but argued it is landlords who could end up paying the most. The $500 paid directly to the landlord will not compensate for losses from the rental increase freeze, Goodman said.

This is particularly evident in Metro Vancouver, he said, where the average rent is now $2,351, according to Rentals.ca.

While the $500 payment direct to landlords is welcome, David Hutniak, CEO of LandlordBC, said that, with no potential for evictions, landlords have little protection if a tenant refuses to pay the balance owing.

“This is wide open to potential abuse,” Hutniak said. He added he hoped common decency would keep abuses in check.

“Two-thirds of landlords in Metro Vancouver are mom-and-pop situations,” Hutniak said, which includes people renting out a basement suite or a condominium to help cover the highest mortgages cost in the country. These owners are also struggling during the current crisis, Hutniak said.

According to a December 2019 survey by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp., there are 67,000 rental condos in Metro Vancouver.

Hutniak also noted a naivety in the potential of landlords qualifying for a mortgage payment deferral. Premier Horgan encouraged banks to provide this, but Hutniak doubts most landlords would qualify or could afford such a deferral.“We have heard advocates speak about landlords getting mortgage deferrals so they can 'pass those savings onto renters.' But a mortgage deferral by a bank does not constitute any savings to the landlord. It has to be paid back with compound interest on the deferred amount. In other words, interest upon interest,""Hutniak explained. Any deferred amount is added to the mortgage principal, whereas a landlord doesn’t have any security for deferred rent from a tenant, he noted, or from the loss of legal rent increases.

Angela Calla, mortgage broker with Dominion Lending Centres, said landlords are unlikely to get approved for a deferral from some mortgage lenders, even if their tenants can’t pay rent due to lost income. “Deferrals are not being approved on rentals at this time,” she said on March 25. “If/when they are, it will come with additional costs for the landlord, once determined.” However, she updated this information March 26 with the news that Scotiabank is now allowing deferrals regardless of occupancy, and other banks may follow suit.

""It is the government’s expectation that all renters, including those renters impacted by the COVID-19 crisis, who have the capacity to pay rent do the responsible thing and pay their rent,” Hutniak added.

But the Vancouver Tenants Union noted that Premier Horgan conceded he could not guarantee that any rental aid will actually be paid by April 1, when the next rent is due.

“Every person should think towards the future, see where they are going to be in a few months and decide if it makes sense to pay rent,” said Mazdak Gharibnavaz, a steering committee member of the Vancouver Tenants Union, in a March 25 interview on CiTR 101.9 FM’s station at the University of British Columbia.",[]

But with phone lines jammed, and websites unable to process applications that are assessed on a case-by-case basis, many homeowners looking for a deferral or seeking answers have had little success.

Confusion reigns over what makes a homeowner eligible for an emergency deferral, how the program works, whether interest is payable and whether deferring payments will affect credit scores. Unfortunately, with the situation changing on a daily basis, and lenders forced to make up rules as they go, it has been impossible for most people to get any information.

To clear up some of these issues, Glacier Media Real Estate spoke with five mortgage experts who offered their insights and advice on some frequently asked questions.

Would deferring my mortgage payments damage my credit score?

As long as the proper arrangements are made in advance, your credit score should not be affected. Atrina Kouroshnia, mortgage broker with Dominion Lending Centres, says, “I don't think deferring payments will have the same impact as [it did] before, as it's a global [pandemic] and, especially if your job is affected, you are making a proactive choice.”

Peter Kinch, best-selling author and award-winning mortgage broker, agrees, “I do not see a situation wherein this will have any impact on your credit score.”

The number-one most important thing? Never assume that you’ll be able to get the deferral and simply not pay your mortgage when it’s due, as this will damage your credit score. “The worst thing would be to just skip your payments,” warns Kouroshnia.

Angela Calla, also with Dominion Lending Centres, cautions, “If you miss the payment without an agreement or your lender does not approve you, it can impact your credit score and could significantly increase your cost of borrowing at renewal. Each borrower should confirm with the lender before they agree to the deferral.”

How can I get through to my lender?

For those trying to make such arrangements but having trouble getting through, Calla says it’s important to give the banks time. “Unless you have a payment due in the next five days [that you can’t pay], they ask that you delay calling at this time [due to overwhelming call volumes]. Email is preferred, or some lenders have portals they have created to assist with this. Look at your lender’s website for updates.”

Alisa Aragon, also with Dominion Lending Centres, recommends speaking first to your mortgage broker, if you have one. “Lenders are experiencing an overwhelming amount of calls and it is very hard to get through. If people have questions, it is best that they talk to their mortgage expert, as we are getting information from most lenders and we might be able to answer their questions faster.”

Should I apply, and would I be approved, for a deferral?

Once you’ve managed to get through to your lender, you’ll likely only be approved for a payment deferral if you’ve lost income due to the COVID-19 pandemic, say the brokers.

If you’re still working and can afford your mortgage, don’t attempt to get a deferral. Not only will you likely be wasting your time and that of the overstretched lenders, the program should only be used as an emergency last resort. That’s because deferring payments will cost you more money in the long term (see “How would a mortgage payment deferral work?” below).

Only those truly unable to pay their mortgage right now, due to lost income from the pandemic, should apply. “The deferral program is really for homeowners that are experiencing financial hardship due to the COVID-19 virus,” says Aragon. “If you are still employed and earning an income, then lenders will not be assisting those borrowers at this time. This program is for people that really need it.”

For those who feel they meet the requirements, it’s worth applying, and each application will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. “It also depends on the lender,” adds Aragon. “Each lender has its own requirements on what has to be provided.”

Landlords may not get approved for a deferral with some banks, even if their tenants can’t pay rent due to lost income, according to Calla. “Deferrals are not being approved on rentals at this time [March 25],” she says. “If/when they are, it will come with additional costs for the landlord, once determined.” However, Calla has an update of this information as of March 26, with the news that Scotiabank is now allowing deferrals regardless of occupancy, and other banks may follow suit.

One relief for landlords is that tenants unable to pay rent due to lost income can now apply for the new $500-a-month rent supplement, to be paid directly to their landlord via BC Housing, which was announced March 25. However, the accompanying temporary ban on evictions may mean leave landlords without options if tenants don't pay their rent at all.

If I were approved, how would a mortgage payment deferral work?

Make no mistake, a mortgage payment deferral is an emergency, temporary measure that will cost you more in the long term, caution the brokers. What’s more, the longer you defer payments, the more it will cost you, as interest will be payable at your contract rate during the deferral period, and will add up.

Kinch explains, “Your principal and interest payments do not have to be made for a period of [up to] six months. However, the banks will accrue your monthly interest payments and add that amount onto your current mortgage balance. As such, after the six-month deferral period, you will have a larger mortgage balance and your monthly payment will be adjusted accordingly to compensate. So you end up with a cash-flow break today, but you’ll have to make up for it in six months. To be clear – this is a ‘deferral’ not a ‘loan holiday’.”

Kinch’s colleague Jonathan Barlow adds, “Every lender will be different in how they manage it. Ones with deep pockets may allow for the deferral to continue until renewal, when they simply renew with the higher balance. Others may structure a repayment plan. Again, this is untrodden ground for the lenders, so they will all approach it differently.”

Calla says, “You are responsible to pay the deferral [interest] taken on the remaining payments on the term with most lenders. This is why it’s approved only for those who can’t make a payment due to not having the financial means. Everyone’s amounts per month and total interest cost will be different based on mortgage amount, rate and term remaining.”

What if my mortgage is with a monoline lender?

The Big Six Canadian banks, plus some credit unions such as Vancity, have been vocal about offering their mortgage payment deferral programs to those in need. But many Canadian homeowners have their mortgages with alternative specialist mortgage lenders, also known as monoline lenders. So are they offering the same payment deferral program?

Barlow says, “Monolines are supporting the deferral program as well, but because they are single service providers (mortgages only), their monetary base is much smaller. So they will be much more strategic about who they offer it to. They’ll certainly ask more questions, but you’ll likely get a much better plan and collaboration from them.”

Premier John Horgan announced Wednesday that B.C. will also freeze rent increases and evictions until the current crisis has passed, with some exceptions to the latter.

“This is not the time to seek rent increases and there is just zero per cent of that happening,” he said. Landlords will be prevented from legally raising rents starting April 1. Increases slated to take effect on April 1 will no longer be applied.

Horgan said the province is assuming its rental supplement will see 100 per cent pick-up, and that the province is then “working back from there” on the understanding that not everyone will need it. He added that there are around 500,000 tenant households in the province.

“[Uptake] will depend on the depth of the pandemic and the time it will take us to recover,” Horgan said.

The additional rental assistance program will be delivered through BC Housing. Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing Selina Robinson confirmed that the funds are intended to help pay the rent of low- and middle-income renters who have seen a “significant reduction” in income directly related to the spread of COVID-19, such as reduced hours or layoffs.

The supplement will be paid directly to landlords.

Robinson added that the province is granting landlords the power to regulate the use of multi-purpose and amenity spaces to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Existing eviction orders with B.C.’s Residential Tenancy Branch have been halted.

With few exceptions, landlords will also be prevented from entering tenants’ homes without tenants’ consent.

Vancouver-West End MLA Spencer Chandra Herbert, former chair of B.C.’s Rental Housing Task Force, confirmed that the Residential Tenancy Branch will continue to operate to address questions and concerns.

“The stress is off the charts right now. We need to give people security and safety in their rental housing,” he said.

The announcement comes a week before April 1 rental payments are due.

The measures are part of the province’s $5 billion COVID-19 response plan – which was announced on Monday – and follow tax and payment deferral options from governments, Crown corporations and banks intended to ease the financial burdens Canadians’ may be facing.

Earlier today, the federal government announced a new $2,000 monthly benefit for Canadians, which replaces and expands two previously announced emergency benefits.

“It is the inevitable next step,” said Jon Stovell, president and CEO of Reliance Properties and past chair of the Urban Development Institute.

Quebec announced the extended shutdown of the majority of construction sites as it ramped up efforts to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus. Quebec's construction unions had called for a work stoppage, saying many sites lack proper hygiene control and require working close to others.

B.C. is second only to Quebec in the number of residents infected by COVID-19.

On March 22, six days after B.C. banned large gatherings, its COVID-19 Joint Information Centre released guidelines that allow for construction to continue, provided no more than 50 workers are working in any one space at a time.

Dr. Bonnie Henry, provincial health officer, has issued a set of guidelines regarding hygiene on construction sites.

Stovell’s company has two big building projects underway, an office tower and a condominium project, and he said his contractors are “going beyond” the provincial measures to assure worker and public safety.

But he believes that all B.C. construction work, aside from infrastructure projects deemed essential, will soon be ordered to close.

A request for comment from the provincial health officer was not received by the Western Investor deadline.

Ron Rapp, CEO of the Homebuilders Association of Vancouver, sent a memo to members this week.

“I told them we have the privilege to continue to work and to make darn sure they all meet the criteria of the provincial health guidelines,” he said.

But Rapp warned that much of the private sector construction in Metro Vancouver – estimated to be worth $10 billion to the B.C. economy and employing up to 130,000 people – could be forced to close regardless of legislation.

A lack of key building supplies due to a broken trade chain, especially from Asia, and the number of people who can’t or won’t report to work is among the problems, he said. He noted that one local supplier, a fabricator, had 25 per cent of its staff test positive for COVID-19.",[]

Reports include inadequate access to washroom facilities, a disregard for social-distancing and workers showing up to job sites sick. On more than one site, workers have no access to hand sanitizer or hand-washing facilities. Multiple workers shared that they risk losing their jobs if they leave, even though colleagues are showing up to work with flu-like symptoms.

Last week, the BC Building Trades Council asked construction workers to report working conditions on job sites during the COVID-19 outbreak. BC Building Trades (BCBT) is now urging WorkSafeBC to enforce mandatory and provincially recommended health and safety practices after reports of unsafe and unsanitary worker conditions.

“Workers are pleading for help – this is urgent,” said BCBT executive director Andrew Mercier in a news release.

“I have been in direct contact with the top brass at WorkSafeBC about this. We need more hand-washing stations. We need better social distancing. Regulations on paper mean nothing if they are not being enforced on the ground.”

One worker who emailed BIV said there are at least 50 people using four washrooms on his Port Moody job site every day, and he has yet to see them cleaned on a daily basis.

Another individual told BIV that a Vancouver site superintendent told workers that he doesn’t care about social distancing: “Either to go to work, or go home.“

A number of the workers who reached out to BCBT – and whose responses have been anonymized – expressed concerns about both continuing to work and about losing their jobs if they chose to stay home or self-isolate. Some have called for non-essential work sites to be shut down.

“The fact no one is shutting these sites down right now is unreal... Well over 200 people sharing this one water hose... No hot water. No hand sanitizer, and five to six bathrooms for the whole site,” wrote one respondent.

Last week, the Urban Development Institute (UDI) said government confirmed that B.C.’s limit on gatherings of more than 50 people does not apply to construction sites. Sites must still follow WorkSafeBC standards and COVID-19 prevention protocols. The latter include additional hand-washing stations and social distancing of one to two metres between workers.

Not so, according to mortgage experts. In fact, advertised interest rates for new mortgage applications have been climbing significantly over the past few days.

article continues below

In its March 19 update, mortgage comparison website RateSpy.com wrote as an example that TD Bank had just increased its advertised rates:

• three-year fixed: from 2.69 per cent to 2.89 per cent

• five-year fixed (high ratio): from 2.69 per cent to 2.79 per cent

• five-year variable: from 2.85 per cent to 2.95 per cent (no discount on the bank’s prime lending rate)

Alisa Aragon, mortgage broker with Dominion Lending Centres Mountain View, told Glacier Media in an interview March 20, “Lenders started increasing rates last Friday [March 13, the same day that the Bank of Canada made its emergency cut to the overnight interest rate]. That includes major lenders such as Scotiabank, TD, RBC. They’ve also been reducing variable-rate mortgage discounts on the prime rate, which is currently 2.95 per cent, so the discount on most variable rates is barely anything. In the future, we could see no discounts at all.”

She added, “The fixed rates are usually connected to the bond market, but because banks need liquidity right now, they’re increasing the rates.” The bond market had previously dropped in line with the central bank’s interest rate, but has also rebounded over the past couple of days.

Liquidity for the banks is a key issue for the federal government right now, which announced March 20 that it is introducing “changes will help provide stable funding and liquidity to financial institutions and mortgage lenders and support continued lending to Canadian businesses and consumers.”

This follows an announcement by the Ministry of Finance that it is launching “a $50 billion Insured Mortgage Purchase Program (IMPP)... The amendments allow mortgage lenders to pool previously uninsured mortgages into National Housing Act Mortgage-Backed Securities for CMHC to purchase these securities through the IMPP. The impact of this measure will provide financial institutions with more liquidity. This, in turn, will allow financial institutions to continue lending to businesses as well as individuals, while assisting customers who face hardship and need flexibility, on a case by case basis.”

By insuring previously uninsured mortgages, the government is essentially taking on the risk associated with those loans, freeing up banks’ balance sheets to provide more liquidity. The moves are intended to support banks while they offer such programs as six-month deferrals of mortgage payments to customers facing financial hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, Aragon said that the program would not necessarily prevent banks from raising mortgage interest rates. “It depends on the bank’s balance sheets, every bank is different,” she said. “These are unprecedented times.”

Even though rates for new mortgages are currently rising, applicants are rushing to get a mortgage on the back of news that the Bank of Canada has slashed its overnight rate.

RateSpy’s March 20 update added, “Nearly every long-time mortgage broker we’ve talked to is swamped, with some saying they’re having their highest application volume ever for a March.”

Aragon is one such busy mortgage professional. She told Glacier Media she is also fielding countless calls from people who are asking about possible mortgage deferrals, even when they haven’t lost their jobs. She added that some are hoping to stop paying their mortgages so they can use the money to invest in the stock market while it is depressed. “That’s not how you do it,” she added. “These deferral programs are really for people who are struggling financially due to the pandemic, and those customers will be required to provide proof of hardship.”

RateSpy’s March 20 update confirmed this trend, saying, “We’re hearing of cases where people are using HELOCs [home equity line of credit] to buy stocks. These are presumably (hopefully) well-qualified, risk-tolerant clients with financial safety nets. It’s definitely not a strategy for the overwhelming majority.”",[]

The board said that it was making “this explicit recommendation today with the support of real estate brokerages, and after an assessment of the latest information and commentary from public health and other government authorities.”

REBGV said that, earlier in the week, it had also “removed the rule requiring that properties listed on MLS be made available for showings.”

Ashley Smith, REBGV president said, “Realtors want to do their part to help prevent the spread of illness in our communities and to meet the housing needs of residents in a responsible way. We’ve heard from some in the community who are unhappy that their Realtors are not holding Open Houses. To those people, we ask for your understanding given the public health crisis we all face today.”

The board said that “anyone looking to buy or sell a home in today’s environment is encouraged to discuss COVID-19 preparedness with their Realtor” and offered some key tips for buyers and sellers. These include:

• If you recently travelled abroad and/or are unwell, do not view a property, and stay home.

• If you’re a seller, talk with your Realtor about alternative approaches to open houses, such as virtual showings and other technology-based solutions.

• If you’re a buyer, only visit a property when others are not present, sanitize your hands before and after a showing, and avoid touching doorknobs and other surfaces in the property.

The REBGV is also offering other tips for buyer and sellers at www.rebgv.org.

Construction must go on

Announced the same day was approval to B.C. construction companies to continue site operations, as the ban on gatherings of more than 50 people does not apply to construction sites, according to the Urban Development Institute.

The UDI said in a March 19 statement that “a senior provincial government official has contacted UDI president and CEO Anne McMullin to assure our industry and membership the 50-person limit does NOT apply to construction sites. The provincial government official confirmed that all sites can and should remain operating… Sites must continue to conform to Worksafe BC practices and current COVID-19 prevention protocols. That means additional handwashing stations should be made available, that workers should maintain their social distance of 1-2 metres from one another and during any on-site meetings.”

The UDI statement added, “In addition, the Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said during the March 17 news conference… that ‘Construction work outside is not as much of a risk that we are concerned about... but anyone who’s sick should not be going to work.’”

The Homebuilders Association of Vancouver (HAVAN) also sent out a statement March 19 offering advice to construction employers on site safety during the pandemic.

In a combined press release, all six big banks said they were also working with commercial customers to provide “flexible solutions” for Canadian businesses struggling because of the virus outbreak.

On the same day, credit union Vancity announced that it was also implementing mortgage payment deferrals of up to six months for struggling homeowners.

It wrote in a statement: “Vancity initially responded by introducing a three-month loan deferral program for our members. It is clear the effects of the pandemic will last longer, so today we are announcing an extension of that deferral program for a term of up to six months. This includes mortgages and other loans and will support members facing financial uncertainty and vulnerability from the fallout of coronavirus.”

Vancity said that personal banking and business customers should contact their customer service line to find out how the credit union can help.

It wrote: “Each case will be assessed individually to help people through these difficult times… Other support for Vancity members facing financial difficulties owing to the virus include providing emergency working capital [and] buying back foreign currency at the rate it was sold, for customers impacted by travel disruption, to ensure they do not suffer financial loss.”

During a press conference, Premier Horgan said these are among the many issues the province has on its plate, and government is looking at next steps, using a cross-governmental approach.

article continues below

""It's not just individual renters that are concerned. Businesses who have rents to pay and no customers coming in the door are equally concerned. So we have a whole range of issues that are piling up and we're looking at what mechanisms we have to assist these individuals,"" he said at the press conference March 17.

""But I want to stress, as I did on Friday, the objective of our government is to provide services for people. That's why we're here. We do not want to come up short. I've made that clear to deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland in our daily discussions — that we all need to work on this together.""

Chandra Herbert, meanwhile, headed up the three-person rental housing task forced that criss-crossed the province in 2018 to come up with recommendations to modernize the Rental Tenancy Act.

Chandra Herbert is now reaching out to many of the same people and groups he dealt with on that file to make short-term and long-term recommendations with respect to the impact coronavirus will have on renters and rental housing.

“It's quick work in terms of short-term [recommendations] given rents come due at the end of the month. We'll have to be looking at that as an issue. We're looking at how to support renters, but also landlords — there's a number of smaller landlords [for whom] the rent cheque is often also the mortgage cheque,” he told the Courier March 17.

“Tomorrow, I understand, the federal government will be making major announcements around rents, in part. We don’t have an early preview of that, but it will inform the work.”

Chandra Herbert has already put out calls to organizations such as the B.C. Non-Profit Housing Association, the Tenant Resource and Advisory Centre and LandlordBC. Within government, he’ll be checking in with B.C. Housing, as well as Vancouver and Victoria’s rental advisory committees.

“It’s not everybody under the sun — we have to work faster than that — but I'm doing my best to get out to as many folks that have key experience in this work,” he said. “I’ve set my own deadline — as soon as possible. The sooner we can get action, the sooner people have some peace of mind, which is in short supply right now.”

Challenges are numerous as April 1 approaches and rent becomes due. Some workers have already lost jobs while others are at risk of losing them. Some residents are in quarantine or self-isolation. Landlords of smaller and larger buildings, meanwhile, as well as those who rent suites in their homes, face mortgage payments.

“[Some renters] may not be able to get rent money because they're not working or they may have been laid off — if you're a casino worker or somebody in the entertainment industry, for example — the film business,” Chandra Herbert said. “In many cases, people are one paycheque away from not being able to afford rent.”

But, he added, some relief sooner than later, depending what the federal government announces Wednesday.

“CMHC on the federal level has said they're looking at mortgage deferrals and questions like that. But really, [after] we hear what the federal cabinet is announcing tomorrow, we'll see what we, as a province, needs to do,” he added.

“They have a considerable fiscal firepower at their disposal. We'll watch them and then see what more we can do. Certainly, we've been encouraging the federal government to look at the challenge of renters, of course, the challenge with mortgage holders, people in the gig economy who might not qualify for EI, and that kind of thing.”

Under the province’s current Residential Tenancy Act, meanwhile, evictions are still possible — an issue renters’ advocates want addressed. Changes could come.

“Most folks aren't paying rent until the end of this month, so it's all on the table,” Chandra Herbert said.

Real Estate Association predicted March 17.

The tentative forecast by the BCREA admitted that “nobody knows” what will happen, but it ran a series of economic models under four scenarios.

article continues below

All four scenarios predicted home sales in the province would drop in the spring and early summer. The market would then likely rebound in the second half of the year “contingent on the outbreak resolving.” However, only one of the scenarios found that home sales in the province would recover to a point of activity higher than if there had been no pandemic, with the other three forecasting a more muted recovery (see graph above).

Although some industry pundits have suggested that the dramatic interest rate cuts in response to the crisis would fuel housing sales, the BCREA said that the suspension of the planned relaxations of the mortgage stress test would “mute the impact of falling interest rates for the BC housing market.”

The BCREA went further by saying that a national recession was possible due to the pandemic-related uncertainty, and in particular its impact on oil prices.

The authors wrote, “The additional shock to the Canadian economy due to a collapse in oil prices – itself the by-product of a price war between the world’s largest oil producers due to COVID-19 – makes the probability of a recession in Canada that much higher.”

Financial aid needed

BCREA also applauded the CMHC’s move to work with mortgage lenders to help homeowners defer payments, but said it was not enough, and that financial aid packages would be needed for households, especially renters.

The report said, “An unfortunate but unavoidable product of recessions is losses in employment and incomes, which may put some financially vulnerable families in an even more precarious position. The CMHC announced that it would be working with lenders to defer mortgage payments by up to six months if needed, which should stem potential mortgage defaults and foreclosures. However, there is still a need to address lost income for those who cannot afford to practice social distancing by staying home from work, and for those who have to make monthly rent payments and can’t take advantage of payment deferrals. For those individuals and families, cash is king. That means these households will need government cash transfers to meet their financial priorities during this time, and we hope this will be part of the yet-to-be-announced stimulus package from the Canadian government.”

James Laird, co-founder of Ratehub.ca and president of CanWise Financial mortgage brokerage, said of the CMHC’s mortgage deferment program, “Any Canadian who will be unable to make an upcoming mortgage payment should reach out to their lender before they miss the payment to discuss options and come up with a plan that works for their financial situation. The goal of lenders and CMHC is that no one will default on their mortgage as a result of COVID-19.""",[]

The federal financial regulator had previously announced that the stress test would be relaxed for insured-mortgage applicants. The new qualifying rate for insured mortgages (those with less than 20 per cent down payment) would have calculated at the weekly median five-year fixed rate from mortgage insurance applications, plus two per cent. This was intended to replace the current calculation, which is the Bank of Canada’s average posted interest rate, or the mortgage applicant’s contracted rate plus two per cent, whichever is the higher.

article continues below

However, following the Bank of Canada’s emergency interest-rate cut on March 13 of 50 basis points, the second such cut in nine days in response to COVID-19, OSFI has suspended the change indefinitely.

The new lower interest rates may have a similar effect as the planned stress test relaxation, and OSFI may be attempting not to compound the effect.

However, many mortgage lenders have not yet passed on the first of the two BoC rate cuts to their customers, and some have even increased fixed mortgage rates.

Jeremy Rudin, the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, said in a statement, “OSFI is focusing its efforts on issues in the environment that require continued vigilance. OSFI is committed to being a risk-based and agile regulator that calibrates responses that are fit for purpose.”

OSFI is also lowering the Domestic Stability Buffer requirement for domestic systemically important banks by 1.25 per cent of risk weighted assets, effective immediately, according to the Department of Finance. Such banks were supposed to see their buffer increased to 2.25 per cent, but this increase is now cancelled.

The department said is a statement, “This action will increase the lending capacity of Canada’s large banks and support the supply of credit to the economy during the period of disruption related to COVID-19. The release of the buffer will support in excess of $300 billion of additional lending capacity.”

Finance minister Bill Morneau stated, “The government is preparing a significant stimulus program, to stabilize our economy, support businesses and protect Canadians… To all Canadians, our government wants you to know that we have your back. We will take every necessary step to give you confidence.”",[]

""This unscheduled rate decision is a proactive measure taken in light of the negative shocks to Canada’s economy arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and the recent sharp drop in oil prices,"" the central bank stated. The statement added the bank’s governing council is ready to further lower rates if that is necessary ""support economic growth and keep inflation on target.”

When questioned, Bank of Canada Stephen Poloz said even a negative interest rate is on the table but told reporters it would likely not be needed “because of our financial firepower.”

The leading rate reductions are part of a $10 billion stimulus package announced March 13 by the federal government.

The rate cut immediately reduced the BoC lending rate to 0.75 per cent, the lowest since the global financial crisis more than a decade ago.

“Those borrowers who have stuck with variable rate mortgages now look like geniuses,” said Vancouver mortgage broker Peter Kinch, “Someone who has a variable rate mortgage at minus 1 per cent would be paying a 1.95 per cent rate for a mortgage today” he said.

The rate cut will also affect the mortgage stress test, which was scheduled to be modified on April 6 to make it reactive to the average contract rate for five-year mortgage loans at big banks. The stress test had required a borrower to qualify at the posted five-year mortgage rate, plus 2 per cent, or at the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. rate of 5.19 per cent, whichever was higher.

Now, the mortgage stress test will be linked only to the current average contract rate available at federally regulated banks.

A BIV survey March 13 showed this five-year rate is in an average of 2.42 per cent, which means a homebuyer would need to qualify at 4.42 per cent, the lowest level since the mortgage stress was expanded in January 2018 to include all home buyers.

“The housing market in Vancouver is already heating up and these rate cuts will add fuel to the fire,” said Kinch, head of the Peter Kinch Mortgage Team with Diversifi Alternative Investments Ltd.

Housing sales in Metro Vancouver soared 44.9 per cent in February compared to the same month a year earlier and were up 36.9 per cent from January, according to the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver, The composite benchmark price for a home is now $1.02 million, up 2.7 per cent from six months ago.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau, appearing on live national TV March 13 with Poloz and Canada’s banking regulator Jeremy Rubin, said he would deliver a fiscal stimulus package next week that will include an additional $10 billion in new funding to the country’s two business financing agencies — the Business Development Bank of Canada and Export Development Canada. The financial aid could be expanded: Morneau said the government would “do whatever it takes.”

Kinch said rumours are rife in the mortgage and banking sectors that one measure being considered is an 18-month suspension of the mortgage stress test.",[]

There were 5,741 residential unit sales were recorded by B.C.’s MLS last month, which is an increase of 26.3 per cent from February 2019

article continues below

Added to that, the average MLS sale price in B.C. last month was $758,863, a 12 per cent increase from one year previously.

However, all that improvement is in comparison to the weak activity seen in early 2019, and merely brings the provincial real estate market back to normal levels.

“Housing markets in BC continued to trend near long-term average levels in February,” said Brendon Ogmundson, BCREA’s chief economist. “Recent declines in mortgage rates and favourable changes to mortgage qualifying rules may provide a boost to home sales heading into the spring, although there is significant economic uncertainty lingering over the outlook.”

With total B.C. MLS home listings down 8.3 per cent year over year, and sales increasing, the ratio of sales-to-active residential listings across B.C. rose to 20.3 per cent. It is considered a seller’s market only when the ratio is above 20 per cent for several months, so the market is still considered balanced at this point.

As ever, the picture changes dramatically when looking at individual real estate markets, with some recovering more than others, and some struggling.

Greater Vancouver saw the biggest sales increase (but not the biggest price rises), while the small markets of Northern Lights and Powell River both saw fewer sales than in February last year. Of the larger markets, only B.C. Northern reported a decline in transactions compared with its active market of one year ago.

Average sale prices rose on an annual basis in every B.C. market except Powell River, which is small enough to see wild percentage changes in sales and prices, and therefore does not indicate a trend. Of the larger markets, the highest average annual price rise was in the Fraser Valley, up 9.4 per cent, followed by Okanagan Mainline and Vancouver Island.

A reverse mortgage is a mechanism for those who have paid off their mortgages to tap into their home’s equity, receiving a monthly or lump-sum payment. It is popular among retirees as it allows them to stay in their home while giving them an income. It is usually only payable upon sale of the home, or death, which means that it is paid off before the rest of the estate is passed to the beneficiaries.

The latest OSFI data shows that there was $4.01 billion in reverse mortgage debt in December 2019, up 0.69 per cent from November 2019, according to Better Dwelling.

This is a 13 per cent increase from one year previously and the first time in Canadian history that reverse mortgage debt has topped $4 billion.

However, the blog pointed out that the rate of growth for reverse mortgage debt is slowing, as the 13 per cent year-over-year increase for December was the lowest growth rate in many years (see graph below). It added that residential mortgage credit is growing at 5.1 per cent as of January 2020.

There were 2,150 transactions on the residential resale market in February 2020, a 44.9 per cent rise over February 2019, and 36.9 per cent higher than the 1,571 homes sold in January 2020.

Even though February’s total sales was 15.9 per cent below the 10-year average for the month, the supply of available homes for sale was unable to meet demand.

“Home buyer demand again saw strong year-over-year increases in February while the total inventory of homes for sale struggled to keep pace,” said Ashley Smith, REBGV president. “This was most pronounced in the condominium market.”

(Story continues below)

This lack of competition increased the pressure on home prices, with the benchmark composite price of a Metro Vancouver home rising slightly again last month. The benchmark price for all residential properties combined, across the region, now stands at $1,020,600, which is a 0.3 per cent increase over February 2019 and a 2.7 per cent increase over the past six months.

(Story continues below)

Although new listings in February were 3.4 per cent higher than in January, the total number of homes for sale as of the end of February was 20.7 per cent lower than the same month last year, at 9,195 units.

The sales-to-active listings ratio in February 2020 was 23.4 per cent. It is deemed to be a seller’s market if the measure is more than 20 per cent for several consecutive months. By property type, the ratio is 17.3 per cent for detached homes (a balanced market), 26.9 per cent for townhomes, and 28.4 per cent for apartments (both now seller’s markets).

Smith added, “Our Realtors are reporting increased traffic at open houses and multiple offer scenarios in certain pockets of the market. If you’re considering listing your home for sale, now is a good time to act with increased demand, reduced competition from other sellers, and some upward pressure on prices.”

Sales and prices by property type and area

Although detached homes in Metro Vancouver saw the lowest sales-to-listings ratio, it was the submarket to see the most rapid sales growth in February. There were 685 single-family home sales across the region last month, which is a jump of 52.9 per cent year over year.

The benchmark price for a detached Metro Vancouver house has not recovered its recent losses yet, but it is recovering. The benchmark price for a detached home in the region is now $1,433,900. This is 0.7 per cent lower than in February 2019 but a 1.9 per cent increase compared with the low point seen around six months ago.

Whistler and Squamish were again the markets to see the biggest annual jump in typical detached home values, up 15.7 per cent and 10.1 per cent respectively. The steepest price loss in the REBGV’s jurisdiction was seen in Bowen Island, where typical detached prices are down 8.4 per cent year over year, followed by the Sunshine Coast, down 7.8 per cent.

Sales of attached Metro Vancouver homes such as townhouses and duplexes totalled 404 in February, a 45.8 per cent increase compared with the 277 sales in February 2019.

A typical attached home in the region now sells for $785,000, according to the board. This is 0.6 per cent higher than in February 2019 and a 1.7 per cent increase over the past six months.

As with detached homes, Whistler and Squamish townhome prices have seen the biggest increases in the region, up 7.5 and 7.2 per cent respectively. Once again, resale townhome prices in Ladner (down 5.0 per cent) and Tsawwassen (down 4.5 per cent) dropped the most year over year, although those declines are not as steep as they have been recently.

Some 1,061 Metro Vancouver condos traded on the MLS last month, which is a 39.8 per cent increase over the 759 sales in February 2019.

With the demand for condos highest of all the property types, and supply not keeping up, the price of a typical Metro Vancouver condo has recovered the most so far. The benchmark price of an apartment property now stands at $677,200, which is 0.9 per cent higher than in February 2019 and a 3.6 per cent increase over the past six months.

Surprisingly, given the rise in detached and townhome prices in the area, Squamish condos saw the region’s biggest annual condo price drops, down 6.8 per cent. Port Moody and Coquitlam were the areas with the biggest benchmark condo price rises, up four and three per cent year over year respectively.

Sav Dhaliwal made the call recently on Twitter amid news of skyrocketing insurance rates for strata properties. Throughout the region, reports have surfaced of massive year-over-year spikes in insurance rates, and a petition originating in New Westminster is urging action.

article continues below

New West condo owner Asifa Lalji wrote in her petition that insurance rates for some owners of strata properties are going up by 50 to 300%, while others have been unable to renew their insurance altogether.

Dhaliwal told the NOW he has gotten two calls from people in Burnaby reporting similar issues with their strata insurance in the city.

“There is definitely anxiety,” Dhaliwal said in an interview.

As a result, Dhaliwal said, he expects the city could be seeing spikes in rental rates, as the rising cost of insurance could be passed on to renters.

In a Twitter post, Dhaliwal said it’s time for ICBC to “consider entering into the general insurance business to provide choice to renters and homeowners.”

Dhaliwal said ICBC should not seek to maximize profits – instead, as a public insurer, it should seek to break even, he said – which would allow it to offer lower, more competitive rates.

“The bottom line is, every time your insurance is through a private insurance company, there is a … profit margin,” Dhaliwal said. “If those were taken out of the equation, there should definitely be some savings.”

Dhaliwal said he doesn’t envision expanding ICBC into general insurance as another monopoly, like the corporation holds over auto insurance, but rather as added competition to private insurers.

But since the 2017 election, the BC NDP government has struggled to contain ICBC auto insurance rates after finding the insurer was deep in the red and nearing insolvency. The elected official in charge of ICBC, David Eby, has repeatedly referred to the situation as a “dumpster fire.”

In recent years, right-wing commentators and politicians have called for ICBC to be privatized as a result, suggesting it’s an issue inherent in public insurance. BC Liberal Leader Andrew Wilkinson has called for ending ICBC’s monopoly on auto insurance and potentially releasing it from government ownership.

But Dhaliwal said the crisis currently facing the public insurer isn’t an existential one for a public insurer.

“ICBC’s current dumpster fire and their problems aren’t really a problem of the concept, the principle, of public insurance,” Dhaliwal said, pointing instead to previous governments using ICBC as a “cash cow.”

“That can be managed if the governments have the right intentions, like I believe this government is now trying to do, to make ICBC stand on its own without having to have the rates go up substantially.”

Between 2010 and 2016, the BC Liberal government siphoned $1.2 billion from ICBC profits, to top up other areas of government. The Liberals said in 2016 the developing crisis was not a result of that, but of increasing crashes and rising costs of car repairs.

Dhaliwal added he doesn’t see an expansion of ICBC by the BC NDP being negated by a future BC Liberal government – and he emphasized that he doesn’t see the Liberals privatizing the Crown insurer anytime soon.

“Deep down, they recognize how it benefits the public.”",[]

Asifa Lalji, who owns a condo in Anchor Pointe at the Quay, said her strata had been anticipating increases to their insurance rates, but it turned out to be far worse than anyone imagined.

“We thought we were going to get a 40% increase in our insurance for our building, which would then translate to an increase in our maintenance fees,” she said. “Then January rolled around, when our insurance for the building actually came due, and we found out instead of a 40% increase that we had budgeted for, we actually ended up with a 300% increase.”

Lalji said other stratas in the area are facing similar increases, which could result in increased maintenance fees and/or special levies – something many residents may not be able to afford. She said the increases are particularly challenging for seniors and people with disabilities.

“Having a hit like that – where does the money come from? You dip into your savings, you dip into your home equity lines. There is no fiscally responsible way to cover these costs,” she said. “What do you do when all of a sudden you have like a $150 or $200 increase to your living expenses every month?”

Bruce Campbell, Anchor Pointe’s strata president, said a 40% hike in insurance premiums would have seen in his monthly strata fees rise to about $480 a month, but it’s now more than $600.

“People are obviously in a panic and a crisis mode at this point in time,” he said of the 300% increase. “They just don’t know what is going to happen, what the rates are going to be next year.”

Lalji has started an online petition, which will be forwarded to the premier and other provincial officials, the Office of the Superintendent of Real Estate Services, the BC Financial Services Authority, the Insurance Council of BC, the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada and the Financial Institutions Commission. The petition, called Stop the Unfair and Unprecedented Increase to B.C. Strata Insurance Premiums, is found at change.org.

The petition is an attempt to bring some calm to the crisis by sparking a conversation and a process that aims to bring everyone to the table.

Campbell believes part of the problem is the current insurance model means condo owners are dependent on commercial insurers, who need to show a profit for their stakeholders.

“There is any number of ways it can be addressed. It is a matter of getting all the stakeholders together and figuring out what the best way to do this is,” he said. “The only way that is going to happen is bringing everyone to the table to discuss it. This petition is kind of the starting point for that.”

Bruce Campbell, president of the Anchor Pointe strata, said industry had been warning that insurance hikes could be coming for stratas but few expected the significant increases that actually came through this year. Condo owner Asifa Lalji has spearheaded a petition to get help addressing the skyrocketing insurance premiums and deductibles - affecting the affordability of condos across B.C. - Jennifer Gauthier

Anchor Pointe representatives are also reaching out to the Quayside Community Board and other residents’ associations in the city, New Westminster MLA Judy Darcy, Burnaby-New Westminster MP Peter Julian and city hall for support in dealing with an issue that could affect hundreds of thousands of strata owners across the province.

“Although some of the regulatory bodies are trying to lobby the province, there is not a lot of consumer protection. We need to see that,” Lalji said. “We need to see the consumer, the strata owner, the tenant protected in all of this. We aren’t seeing that right now. … We want to see that protection and we want to see it get to a point where it is affordable again.”

Lalji said the soaring insurance premiums and deductibles is an affordability issue that affects folks on a number of fronts. She noted some people will be forced to sell their homes, some people who want to buy condos may choose not to get into the condo market because of uncertainty about future costs, and tenants in units that are being rented out may lose their homes if the owners need to sell.

“I think there is a sentiment that this isn’t a local issue, that it’s not something that the local government can do anything about. The effect, the consequence at the end, will very much impact the social and economic base here in New Westminster,” she said. “If the condo market goes down, if there isn’t a confidence that the insurance market will adjust itself and somehow our monthly expenses and the cost of living is actually going to go down, you can have catastrophic effects here.”

As strata owners across B.C. and in other provinces start to get their insurance renewals for their buildings, Lalji said some of them are starting to realize they aren’t even going to get insured.

“Stratas are getting denied their insurance premiums. We are hearing that people are trying to move and because of the increases in their maintenance fees, they are not able to sell their homes,” she said. “They are being priced out of the market based on affordability.”

While some organizations have suggested stratas can bring their insurance deductibles down by ensuring their building is well maintained, Lalji said Anchor Pointe did that but still faced a huge premium increase. In addition to putting money into a contingency reserve fund, she said the building had a study done to determine all of the work that needs to be done to the building.

The Insurance Brokers Association of BC recognizes the severe impact recent increases to strata insurance deductibles and premiums are having on consumers and is calling for consultation amongst all key stakeholders with a focus on proposed legislative action.

“Now is the time to act to help stabilize the market, “said IBABC executive director Chuck Byrne in a news release. “We all have the consumer’s best interest in mind, and by acting together we can help them through this difficult situation and add long-term clarity and stability to the market.”",[]
113,newwestrecord,https://www.newwestrecord.ca/real-estate/condo-owners-face-huge-bills-from-massive-strata-insurance-rate-hikes-1.24076654,Condo owners face huge bills from massive strata insurance rate hikes,['Joannah Connolly'],,"A crisis is bubbling up in the condo sector, with insurance companies hiking building insurance premiums to unprecedented levels, leaving condo owners (and their renters) on the hook for huge bills. The cost of strata’s building insurance is passed to homeowners in their maintenance fees and, if the unit is rented, it is likely to be passed on again to tenants.

What’s more, insurers are being so picky about their risk exposure that some poorly maintained or older strata face losing their insurance coverage entirely. This would mean that not only would owners lose everything in a major event such as a fire, flood or earthquake, but also they would not be able to sell or remortgage their homes, even if there was no such catastrophe.

A lack of competition in the insurance market across North America, combined with massive payouts that insurance firms have had to shell out due to increasing severe-weather events damaging buildings, have led to the premium increases.

Insurance brokerage Hub International said in a recent note, “Strata and condo corporations should budget for a minimum 35 per cent increase even on properties with no history of losses and full updates (roof, plumbing, heating, and electrical). Stratas with losses or those that have not undergone updates should expect greater increases. The cost of reconstruction appraisals also continues to rise, equating to as much as 5-10 per cent of the building value. These two factors combined will continue to drive premiums up through 2020.”

Insurance firms finding it hard to make ends meet have resulted in a reduction in the current number of insurers operating in the market, which has two effects on premiums. The first is a simple lack of competition allowing insurers to offer less competitive prices. The second, more serious, issue is that many of these fewer insurance firms are now at capacity, and can pick and choose which buildings they insure, while those they turn down are left out in the cold.

Tony Gioventu, executive director of the Condominium Home Owners’ Association of B.C. (CHOA), told Glacier Media, “There is less competition and much higher demand on the insurance. The risks are being very closely monitored. Because there are fewer insurers taking on a greater load of the risk, they’re being very picky about who they’re insuring, and at what value. Compound all that together, and you can hear the cash registers ringing in the background.”

Increasing construction costs, especially in expensive cities like Toronto and Vancouver, are also adding into these premium hikes and refusal to insure, as the financial risk is greater for the insurance companies. Gioventu added, “Another problem is that the value of reconstruction of buildings in high-density markets, where construction costs are high and values are high, the price of construction of these properties is at an all-time high.”

He said the issue is most acute for buildings that have a history of insurance claims. ""What about those buildings that are not getting their insurance renewed. If they have a history of claims or are not keeping their building maintained or repaired, the insurance company just isn't willing to take on the risk, regardless of what you're willing to pay. So now, all of a sudden, no sales, no mortgages, and if there's a loss in the building, everyone loses everything. It's a terrifying thought.""

CHOA has been receiving increasing numbers of calls for help from member strata corporations, said Gioventu, and he predicts this is only going to get worse throughout the year. He also said that he is in discussions with the B.C. government about the problem, but is not optimistic they can help. “Short of creating a provincial insurance program for strata buildings, which represents trillions of dollars of risk and they would never take on, there’s not much the province can do,” he said.

Gioventu said that strata corporations can mitigate the risk of losing their insurance, and reduce their premium hikes, by making sure the building is well cared-for. ""Strata corporations seriously need to make sure that they have depreciation report, and are engaging in it, that they are maintaining their properties and not seeing special resolutions for repairs defeated in their meetings. Look at your building systems. If your plumbing hasn't been replaced and it's 35 to 40 years old, I'd be moving pretty quick. They also need to be looking at bylaws that could make a difference in terms of the risk to the property.""

However, Gioventu did have some optimism for the future. “We’ve got fewer players [in the insurance sector] right now, but industries go in cycles.”

In an interview with Glacier Media, Sam Hanson, president of development company South Street, agreed. South Street is developing a one-million-square-foot residential and commercial community with three levels of underground parking in the downtown core of sea-level Richmond. When asked if he was concerned about building insurance, Hanson said, “We’ve had a meeting with our insurers to discuss this, and we are looking at higher premiums than anticipated. But they explained that the marketplace for insurance is like any other market. It goes up and it goes down. As the cost of insurance goes up, more players start to enter the marketplace, and they start to compete with each other, and prices will come down.”

He added, “Right now there have been all kinds of natural and manmade disasters that have caused insurers to pay out lots of money, and they raise their prices to cover what they have to pay out. It’s just the normal course of business. So yes, right now there is a tremendous issue, but how long it will last, I don’t know. According to our insurers, it is cyclical and it will eventually go the other way.”",[]

There were 1,571 home sales on the MLS in January, which is a 42.4 per cent increase over January 2019.

article continues below

Traditionally the slowest month of the year for real estate sale registrations (see graph below), because there is so little home-hunting activity in December, January’s sales were a 22.1 per cent decrease from the 2,016 homes sold in December 2019.

Last month’s sales were still slightly unde long-term typical activity for the month, as the very active markets of 2015 through 2017 pushed up the 10-year sales averages. January’s total was 7.3 per cent below the 10-year January sales average.

(Story continues below)

“We’ve begun 2020 with steady home buyer demand that tracks close to the region’s long-term average,” Ashley Smith, REBGV president said. “Looking at supply, we’re seeing fewer homes listed for sale than is typical for this time of year. As we approach the traditionally more active spring market, we’ll keep a close eye on supply to see if the number of homes being listed is keeping pace with demand.”

There were 3,872 homes newly listed for sale in January, which is 20.1 per cent lower than the 4,848 homes listed in January 2019, although it’s more than double the number of homes that were listed in December 2019.

This takes the total number of homes listed for sale in Metro Vancouver, as of January 31, to 8,617, which is a 20.3 per cent decrease from January 2019 and only a 0.2 per cent higher than December 2019. The current figure is also 13.7 per cent below the 10-year January average number of active listings.

The increase in demand coupled with a relatively low supply of homes for sale is inevitably keeping home prices on the slow upward trajectory they have been seeing since summer 2019 (see graph below).

(Story continues below)

The composite benchmark price for all home types in Metro Vancouver is currently $1,008,700. This is a 1.4 per cent rise in the past six months, and 0.8 per cent higher than December, although still 1.2 per cent less than in January 2019.

Sales and prices by property type and area

At 439 transactions in January, Metro Vancouver’s single-family detached home sales were up 29.5 per cent year over year. However, it’s also a 26.7 per cent decline over December’s relatively strong sales, which is bringing the sector back towards buyer’s market territory.

Nevertheless, the typical price of a detached home in the region rose 0.5 per cent month over month to $1,431,200, which is a one-per-cent recovery over the past six months, but 1.7 per cent lower than January 2019.

Region-wide figures only tell half the story, however. Seven of the board’s 20 areas saw detached prices in January higher those of one year previously, led by Whistler (up 4.8 per cent) and Squamish (up 4.7 per cent). Annual declines in region’s overall detached benchmark price were led by the Sunshine Coast, (down 5.9 per cent) and Bowen Island (down 5.3 per cent). The double-digit benchmark price declines seen in areas such as West Vancouver and Vancouver West have now subdued to two to three per cent annual price drops.

In the attached-home sector, such as townhomes and duplexes, sales across Metro Vancouver rose 55.1 per cent year over year to 318 transactions. This is 12.6 per cent below December 2019’s attached home sales.

Townhomes have seen the biggest benchmark price recovery since last summer, with the typical price of an attached unit now at $782,500. This is a 1.6 per cent increase over the past six months, a 0.5 per cent increase from December 2019 and only 0.7 per cent lower than in January 2019.

Four MLS areas saw higher attached-home benchmark prices than one year previously. Like in the detached sector, Whistler and Squamish saw townhome prices increase the most, up 9.4 and 7.7 per cent respectively. Ladner (down 6.7 per cent) and Tsawwassen (down 6.5 per cent) continued to lead the annual price declines for this sector, with new townhome construction in those areas apparently exceeding local demand.

Some 814 condos traded in Metro Vancouver last month, which was a 45.6 jump year over year, and a 22.7 per cent drop compared with December.

The benchmark price of a condo in the region has risen one per cent over a month to $663,200, which is a 1.5 per cent increase over the past six months, but a drop of one per cent over the year since January 2019.

Looking at condo markets in the different areas, five MLS areas saw values hold their own from one year previously, with prices up 1.8 per cent in Port Moody and 1.2 per cent in Coquitlam. Like townhomes, the biggest annual price declines in the condo sub-markets were seen in Ladner (down 7.1 per cent) and Tsawwassen (down 8.1 per cent).

Following a public hearing on Monday night, council approved a zoning amendment bylaw (text amendment) and a housing agreement amendment bylaw for sites in the Brewery District.

article continues below

Rupinder Basi, the city’s development planning supervisor, said the amendment would allow changes to the development of the Building 8 site by allowing up to 200,000 square feet of the permitted 300,000 square feet of density to be used for either residential, including strata residential, or a variety of commercial uses. The remaining 100,000 square feet of the permitted floor space would be limited to general and health-related commercial uses.

“The overall density for the Building 8 site would not change,” he said. “However, there would be provisions within the zone to allow for an increase in the maximum permitted building height from 195 feet to 320 feet, should a residential component, a tower, be included as part of a future mixed-use development for the site.”

In exchange for the text amendment, Wesgroup is proposing to secure 100% of Building 5 as a rental residential building for 60 years, or the life of the building. In addition, 210,000 square feet of the space permitted for residential uses within Building 7 would be converted to secured market rental residential, with remaining 50,000 square feet in this building to be used as general and health-related commercial space.

According to Basi, these changes would amount to an increase of approximately 320 secured market rental units within the Brewery District development. The changes would also ensure a minimum of 150,000 square feet of general and health-related commercial space is retained within Building 7 and 8, but it could be more depending on future market conditions.

Building 5, located at 228 Nelson’s Cres., is a newly constructed residential building with half of the units being secured market rental. A development permit was recently issued for Building 7 at 268 Nelson’s Crt., which will be the next phase of construction at the Brewery District. Building 8, located at 230 Keary St., is a future development site.

The height and massing of Building 8 would depend on the final land-use mix that’s determined for the property, something to be determined at the development permit stage and be dependent on market conditions.

No residents spoke at Monday’s public hearing, but one resident wrote a letter “strongly” opposing the proposal and saying his neighbours “gave up” a long time ago because the process is flawed. Some residents have voiced concerns about the potential height and massing of the tower, as well as traffic and parking.

“One of the things that we have seen with a recently commissioned traffic report from Bunt and Associates is that there has actually been a reduced amount of vehicle flow in and out, especially based on the rental homes where we are seeing a lot of people SkyTrain or just elect not to have vehicles,” said Fabian Leitner, Wesgroup’s director of development. “We were pleasantly surprised by that trend.”

Coun. Chuck Puchmayr was the lone council member to oppose the plan, citing concerns about the loss of office space from what was originally contemplated when council approved a master plan for the Brewery District site. With a $1.5-billion expansion taking place across the street at Royal Columbian Hospital, he said the plan was to designate certain amounts of space for office and health-care services – not residential.

“The money is in residential. I am worried they are going to become residential,” he said. “I think doing this prior to seeing fruition of that huge, biggest hospital expansion in British Columbia history, right here in New Westminster, I think it is short-sighted. It reverses the vision, which I thought was a really good vision in putting those pieces in place clearly for the future of the future expansion of the hospital.”

Coun. Patrick Johnstone believes the “big win” is a quadrupling of the amount of purpose-built rental or secured market rental housing at this location. He said Sapperton is a neighbourhood that really could afford to have more rental, especially next to a health-care centre

Coun. Nadine Nakagawa said it’s important to put housing near SkyTrain, especially in the context of the climate crisis. She said it makes a lot of sense to provide rental housing near transit and near jobs like those nearby at Royal Columbian Hospital and TransLink.

Mayor Jonathan Cote believes what’s been built and what’s being planned to be built at the Brewery District is intact with the city’s original vision of creating a mixed-use neighbourhood that includes retail, residential and office space. He said the site will contain more rental than was ever conceived, but that’s a positive addition to the neighbourhood.

While health-care uses are critically important in the area and are a big part of the city’s economic development strategy, Cote said things have changed since the Brewery District was first proposed.

“It was actually envisioned that the hospital expansion might occur on that site and that’s why such a large building right next to the hospital was contemplated in there,” he said. “As things have evolved that is no longer the case. The hospital is now going to be redeveloped strictly on-site.”",[]

A new development is an opportunity for more than just getting into the real estate game. Often, new apartment and townhouse complexes are being built with more than housing in mind – in many cases there’s also a community focus. In addition, on many occasions new owners have the opportunity to add bespoke touches. Some developers offer different floorplans or let you choose unique finishes.

Although there’s much to be said about buying a new development as an investment – the real investment is in your future. A home where you can create new memories, a place you can fill with friends and family, and feel a sense of comfort every time you walk in the door.

But it seems like every other block has a new apartment or townhouse complex being built. How can you find one that combines quality and integrity with the lifestyle and community you’re looking for?

Mayor Jonathan Cote said the downtown core is the leading area when it comes to transportation, but the design of the road network in that neighbourhood doesn’t reflect today’s downtown.

“I think the plan is an important step, but I guess what I am more excited about is actually starting to operationalize and implement some of key concepts. … I think what this plan really does is actually better connect that neighbourhood where it is and where it is going in terms of transportation compared to some of its past designs,” he said. “I am really eager to see us work through that process and actually see some of these big steps and big moves start to be implemented.”

An artist's rendering shows the interim plans being proposed for the Eighth Street Complete Street. - Contributed

Big changes coming

A recent staff presentation included artist’s renderings about some components of the plan, including the Eighth Street ""complete street"" – an area close to the New Westminster SkyTrain Station and Anvil Centre.

While walking, cycling and transit are dominant modes of transportation on Eighth Street, primarily between Carnarvon and Columbia, but also between Carnarvon and Royal, the street doesn’t look anything like how it currently functions, said Lisa Leblanc, the city’s transportation manager.

“When you look at the proportion of road width that’s given over to walking and cycling, it doesn’t reflect that dominant mode,” she said. “So what we are proposing is a reallocation of space on Eighth Street to better reflect what’s actually happening today, and to better support ongoing increases in sustainable modes on Eighth Street and across Eighth Street.”

The vision includes a weather-protected, mid-block crossing (where many people already cross) under the SkyTrain guideway on Eighth Street, a centre median, wider sidewalks, fully separated cycling lanes on both sides of the street from Royal to Columbia, and greening of the space.

“We see it as entirely possible to implement an interim treatment using flexible bollards and pavement markings, planter boxes, that type of thing, in order to establish this vision in a temporary or a quick-build kind of way,” Leblanc said.

Leblanc said it’s envisioned that the bus shelter on Eighth Street (near the SkyTrain station) would eventually be placed on “a bus island” to better serve people walking on this sidewalk, as well as people who are boarding and alighting from the bus. While it could take some time to build the bus island, other changes could happen quite soon.

“In the long-term, we see the bus shelter on a bus island. We see that empty lot being redeveloped into something that’s much friendlier on the street,” she said of a site at the foot of Eighth Street. “We see the centre median, with single-lane traffic in each direction. We can see this being implemented as an interim measure within the next six to 12 months, with pavement markings and flexible bollards, and a temporary, quick-build bus bulge, to at least get the boarding and alighting off of the sidewalk.”

What’s happening on Carnarvon?

The city believes current and future developments on Carnarvon Street will help it become more of a complete street and create opportunities to improve connections along the street to the Shops at New West and to the New Westminster SkyTrain station.

“Carnarvon has a great opportunity to become a complete street,” Leblanc said. “There are existing problems with Carnarvon Street. There is a lot of people queuing and waiting on a very narrow, obstructed sidewalk.”

The downtown transportation plan anticipates an expansion of the bike network on Carnarvon Street. Road options include making Carnarvon Street one-way eastbound in order to provide more space adjacent to curbs for people waiting to board buses, or keeping it as a two-way street but removing some parking on the north side of the street.

“Ultimately, this is how we envision Carnarvon Street, with single-lane traffic in each direction, buses continuing to pull up to the curb, more space for people on sidewalks, and a bike lane heading westbound on Carnarvon Street on the north side of the street,” Leblanc said.

Key directions in the plan

Eighth Street and Carnarvon Street are just two pieces of the downtown transportation plan, with other key directions including the use of SkyTrain stations as multi-modal hubs prioritizing sustainable modes of transportation, construction of the Agnes Greenway and the development of a cycling network. A comprehensive network of primary and secondary cycling routes is planned throughout the downtown.

Leblanc said the primary network would be constructed to AAA standards, which almost always means separated bike lanes for all or some segments of the route. The seconday bike route would primarily be implemented with signage and pavement markings.

“So it’s not quite the same level of service as a AAA facility, but a much more extensive and direct network of bike lanes that will be signed so it draws motorists’ attention to the fact that they should be expecting cyclists on these routes,” Leblanc said. “It will result in 30-kilometres-per-hour speed limits on these streets. It also helps with cycling way-finding to key destinations in the downtown and outside of the downtown. There’s about five kilometres of secondary route in the downtown, so it is not an insignificant amount of bikeway.”

Greening of Agnes Street

The future Agnes Greenway is primarily on Agnes Street, but it connects to Carnarvon and Begbie streets, which are viewed as links to key destinations, like the New Westminster SkyTrain station and the riverfront. The greenway envisions separated bike lanes on the south side of Agnes Street, greenway improvements that will be unique to each block, potential tree plantings on private property and more.

“Implementation of this greenway will require some traffic changes within the neighbourhood,” Leblanc said. “Some of them will feel significant to some people.”

According to Leblanc, the Agnes Greenway requires three segments of one-way streets: Agnes Street between Merivale Street and Fourth Street will require a one-way segment westbound; Agnes Street between Sixth Street and Fourth Street will require a one-way segment eastbound; and Fourth Street will be one-way southbound between Agnes Street and Carnarvon Street.

“We are also proposing a road closure in support of this greenway, which is a small piece of Merivale, the slip ring that comes off of Royal Avenue eastbound,” she said. “We are proposing to close that to enable extension of this existing multi-use path that connects into an already-good crossing across Royal Avenue at Third Street and into an excellent bike connection into Tipperary Park, which forms an important connection up to uptown from downtown.”

Buses will also have to be rerouted in order to accomplish the goals of the greenway, Leblanc noted, so the city has already engaged TransLink and Coast Mountain Bus Company in that discussion. It’s yet to be determined whether the bus will be rerouted to Merivale Street or Elliot Street.

“We see us constructing this in two phases, beginning with Phase 1 potentially as early as 2021, subject to funding,” Leblanc said of the Agnes Greenway. “If we can get the funding in place, we would advance this. Otherwise, it would be completed in the current five-year plan. Phase 2 would be completed over a number of years, elements of it through redevelopment of adjacent properties and through future capital plans, with elements of it being implemented, such as signage and pavement markings, in the interim so that we do have a complete route signed to the SkyTrain station and to the riverfront. It just wouldn’t be in its final constructed form for a number of years.”

Curb changes coming

Another one of the key items in the downtown transportation plan is a plan to prioritize curb space to support priority modes and a quality, people-centred public realm.

“This is easily the most challenging piece of the plan to communicate our intentions with respect to curb space,” Leblanc said. “Curb space refers to, typically, to what people think about first with curb space is parking or bus stops, but there’s a lot more going on at the curb than parking and bus stops. There are also deliveries. There are also opportunities for parklets and for greening. There are also opportunities to improve access for people with disabilities. Loading and servicing. And it goes on.”

According to a staff report, curbside space in urban areas is important for many reasons and is “valuable for much more than the storage of private vehicles.”

“It’s quite a challenging thing to talk to people about the curbside space and prioritization of this space because everybody feels a piece of ownership about the curb,” Leblanc said.

A set of guiding principles outlines the city’s priorities for curb space, with sustainable transportation (including sidewalks, bike lanes, transit and bike parking) being the Number 1 priority. That’s followed by: Number 2 – access for people (including accessible parking, bus stops, passenger zones); Number 3 – greening and activation (plantings, street trees, parklets, patios, food trucks); Number 4 – delivery and loading (local and commercial deliveries); Number 5 – short-term parking (car share, visitor parking, servicing, meter parking); and Number 6 – on-street parking.

“On-street parking becomes a lower priority,” Leblanc said. “The reality is some space on-street curbside for parking of private vehicles, in particular, will be reduced.”

Coun. Patrick Johnstone said the development of principles related to the use of curbs is important work.

“It’s good that we have some policy guidance,” he said. “I think curb space ends up always being that point of tension when we are redefining road spaces, especially in a downtown area.”

Rerouting the 106 bus

The engineering department is also proposing that the 106 bus be rerouted eastbound on to Carnarvon Street, as the city believes it will improve bus speed and reliability – and allow for the creation of an accessible bus stop with weather protection and seating on Sixth Street, just north of Carnarvon Street.

What about roads?

The road network won’t be forgotten in the downtown transportation plan, said Leblanc, but it’s definitely not being prioritized as high as sustainable modes of transportation.

A staff report states there are “numerous” streets throughout the downtown area that are wider than necessary. Over time, the city will be able to reallocate “excess pavement” for other priority uses.

“We anticipate right-sizing of roads through reallocation of excess pavement. There are streets that have too much pavement for what’s required,” Leblanc said. “We see opportunities for urban forest and integrated storm water management, parklets and park streets.”

The city also wants to use way-finding signage, signal-timing optimization and informational signage at “decision” points for drivers to ensure traffic goes where it’s supposed to be.

“We want to see the right traffic on the right road and discourage shortcutting through local roads,” Leblanc said.

What’s the plan for the plan?

Once approved by council, staff anticipates it will take several years to implement the downtown transportation plan – as some of it will take place as adjacent properties are redeveloped. Initiatives will be done in phases: Immediate – within a few months; near term – within six to 12 months; medium term – within the city’s current five-year financial plan; longer term – five to 10 years; and much longer term – through development and/or with significant partnerships.

“Some measures will be implemented in the very near-term. Some already have been,” Leblanc said. “In the near-term, we anticipate having a signed downtown/uptown cycling route. We anticipate having Carnarvon Street, the widening of the sidewalk on the south side taken care of. We are (closing) Front Street on weekends throughout the summer to enable connections between Westminster Pier Park and Sapperton Landing.”

Within six to 12 months, the city anticipates having signage, pavement markings and quick-build calming traffic circulation changes and interim separated bike lanes on the Agnes Greenway.

“We also anticipate, in the immediate- and near-term, advancing quick-build designs for the Agnes Greenway and advancing the detailed design so that it’s ready for construction in 2021 if we get external funding to support that,” Leblanc said. “We also propose implementing the secondary bike network within the next year, having signage and pavement markings in place.”

Staff is also working on plans and designs regarding some quick-build basic elements of the Eighth Street Complete Street section south of Carnarvon Street, including improvements to the bus stop.",[]

But home care isn’t just about medical care, in fact it’s as much about helping seniors keep their independence for longer.

“For us, senior home care is about caring, not just health care,” Susan and Wendy Scott from Nurse Next Door say. “In our experience, once a senior begins to lose their independence, their happiness starts to disappear too, so we do everything in our power to help keep them in their own home as long as they want to remain there and can so safely.”

article continues below

Here the Scott’s draw on their experience with seniors to share the four keys to happier aging.

1. Play: Seniors with a full dance card of hobbies and passions are much less likely to fall foul to the pitfalls of social isolation that we traditionally associate with old age. However for a variety of reasons seniors can find themselves drifting from passions that were once a key part of their lives. A good caregiver’s job involves helping seniors to continue the pursuit of their passions, helping them to maintain hobbies and interests that encourage them to remain active both socially and physically.

2. Connections and relationships: No matter what age we are, personal connections with our friends and families remain crucial to living happy and healthy lives. Research has shown that those people who maintain their interpersonal connections live longer than people who are isolated as they get older. As well as making us happy, maintaining these relationships can also impact our health, boosting things like our immune systems, lowering blood pressure and alleviating depression.

3. Learning: We’ve all heard the saying “It’s never too late to teach an old dog new tricks” but did you know the same applied to us humans too? Indeed ongoing learning, even in the later stages of our lives, has been widely proven to help boost health and longevity.

4. Travel and adventure: Whether it’s soaking up some Vitamin D on a pristine beach or venturing off of the beaten track, everyone has dreams of travelling. And these don't just stop as we start to get older. Many seniors have had to shelve their dreams and aspirations due to family commitments, work, or financial constraints. But those dreams never fade and just because you are getting older doesn’t mean that they cannot become a reality.

123,newwestrecord,https://www.newwestrecord.ca/standout/four-trends-in-funeral-planning-1.23175885,Four trends in funeral planning,[],,"Just like wedding trends, varying funeral rituals and décor ebb and flow. Here are four we’re seeing in memorial and funeral planning, according to Andrew Knapman Location Manager of Burnaby’s Forest Lawn Funeral Home.

1. Cremation is becoming more and more popular as opposed to a more traditional burial or mausoleum interment. “B.C. has one of the highest cremation rates in North America because of space concerns … Also, the further West you go, the less traditional people tend to be,” Knapman explains. That said, a lot of people are purchasing cemetery property for cremation so that families have a site at which to visit their loved ones.

article continues below

2. These days many people are taking a proactive approach to their funeral planning by arranging many of the logistics—from the music to flowers to ceremony rituals—before they pass on. Not only does this help take the burden off of loved ones, it also ensures that you are remembered the way you want to be.

3. There’s also a trend towards putting a more optimistic spin on what has traditionally been a sad event by planning a Celebration of Life, where a person’s accomplishments, contributions and passions are the focus of the occasion. “It can be a time to memorialize you and talk about the stories that surround you,” says Knapman.

4. In terms of funeral service ideas, many people are foregoing the traditional church ceremony and personalizing the event. “We try to encourage clients to think outside the box,” says Knapman. Often, that means incorporating symbols of your loved one’s passions into the event. For one family that meant driving the funeral hearse around a race track to commemorate a person who had a deep love of car racing, says Knapman.

Since the COVID-19 pandemic brought live performances and large gatherings to a halt in March, the theatre team has been working to figure out its approach for the future. Now it’s taking its first cautious steps towards welcoming the public back inside.

article continues below

“You can’t just go from zero to 60; you have to figure it out,” said executive director Jessica Schneider. “At the same time, we can’t just wait until everything’s normal again. We can’t go without culture for that long. We can’t go without the arts.”

Schneider is quick to note that doesn’t mean the theatre will simply throw open its doors and host large shows again. With public health directives around physical distancing top of mind, the theatre team is going out of its way to keep people apart while bringing them together.

For the first stage of its reopening, the theatre will open just the Plaskett Gallery and lobby area. The area will be divided into three zones, and visitors will be allowed to book times to attend with a small group from their “bubble.” The small groups will be able to take in an artist’s talk, look at the work and then leave.

The gallery then plans to add a performance portion to the visit. The gallery is recruiting local performers of all kinds – musicians, magicians, comedians, spoken word artists and more – so that visitors can enjoy a show on their way through.

No, it won’t be like sitting down for a full-scale show in the theatre – but it’s a start.

“Any amount of time that you get a performance and some beautiful art is better than nothing,” Schneider said.

Those performers aren’t all programmed yet, but Schneider noted the theatre wants to focus on New Westminster artists in an attempt to provide opportunities for artists and economic recovery for the local cultural sector.

As the month unfolds, Schneider and her team also have their sights set on “date night” events – which are planned to give couples a chance to enjoy a glass of wine, take in a reserved dinner at a local restaurant and do some kind of neighbourhood walking tour along with their night at the gallery. Similar family adventures will be set up that include some sort of virtual “scavenger hunt” for the kids.

Schneider noted the theatre team wants to help people increase their sense of trust in the idea of going out – not just to the theatre itself, but around the community and into local businesses.

“It’s just getting people out, moving around. It’s like that escape. It’s like a vacation – you’re not just doing your errands and going home and locking your doors again,” Schneider said.

She hopes events like the date nights and family scavenger hunts can help to add some vibrancy to the community and help the business community build some momentum again.

“We’re looking at really heavy hits on the business community,” she said. “We can’t do their street festivals and everything this year, but we can sort of replace it.”

As they start up the first programming in June, Schneider and her team are also looking at how they’ll be able to use both the Massey Theatre and the Anvil Centre Theatre over the longer term.

Like the rest of the province, the theatre sector is guided by public health directives – and so far, those are still limiting gatherings to an upper limit of 50 people.

Schneider says the Massey Theatre, with more than 1,200 seats, is perfectly positioned to take on some physically distanced performances because it has more than enough room to keep people apart – even when that 50-person limit is raised to a higher number at some future point.

Schneider pointed out that many smaller venues can’t operate right now because they don’t have enough space to keep their audiences physically distanced, so it’s going to be up to large venues like the Massey to pick up a lot of smaller-scale performances – theatre, dance, musical theatre and more.

With national and international touring shows out of the picture for the indefinite future, Schneider’s focus is on B.C. artists. She foresees the Massey being able to work with many artists and arts groups that it might not typically have worked with in the past.

“I think we’ll be really fortunate in New Westminster,” she said. “We’ll have a huge variety of things you used to have to travel downtown for.”

Schneider is confident the theatre will be able to find audiences for shows again, noting there are a large number of people who’ve been missing their chance to get out and connect with live performances.

For Schneider, nothing can replace the emotions that come along with the shared experience of theatre.

“The feelings you have when you’re watching a show are personal, but they’re shared. It’s not just your feelings you’re feeling; it’s the human condition you’re feeling,” she said.

And having artists to give voice to the human experience in the midst of, and emerging from, the COVID-19 pandemic? That, too, is something Schneider can’t wait to share.

“There’ll be some beauty and some joy, and some chance to reflect what we’ve all been going through,” she said. “I can’t wait to see what artists will bring.”

The home consignment store in New Westminster is the next beneficiary of a series of comedy nights that’s being presented by Burnaby stand-up comic Ray Morrison and a group of local comics.

article continues below

The comedy nights are being presented online, via Zoom, and audience members can enjoy the show from the comfort of their own home.

Morrison held the first comedy night in May in support of Cozmos Café + Bistro in Burnaby. For that occasion, each comic performed remotely from their own living room. For the upcoming Champagne Taste show, set for Friday, June 12 at 8 p.m., the comics will actually be performing on-site in the store – though audiences will still watch from home.

For show admission, audience members can either pay $10 to enjoy the performance outright, or else buy a Champagne Taste gift certificate (denominations of $10 to $50 are available) to enjoy the show first and shop later.

Janice Wright, owner of Champagne Taste, noted four of the eight performers are from New Westminster.

“They were quite excited about actually coming together and broadcasting here,” she said.

It’s a win for the comics, who get a chance to perform in the company – albeit the physically distanced company – of others. And it’s a win for the store, which gets to show off some of the merchandise it has on hand in various sections of the shop.

“This is a unique way to showcase some of the great merchandise and staged vignettes we are so famous for, as each comedian will be nestled in to their own part of the store as a backdrop to their routine,” Wright said.

The shop has been reopen part-time since May 7, Wright noted, with Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday hours. She’s been using her pandemic time to also work on the store’s website and social media presence – which, she says, has been paying dividends, if the amount of interest from the community is anything to go by.

“We’ve really been upping our game,” she said.

Wright and Morrison have known each other for years; before retiring and pursuing his stand-up career, Morrison was the rep for a furniture company and did business with Wright’s store.

For Morrison, a desire to support local business was the impetus to launch the comedy night series.

“As I do not see masses of people feeling comfortable reverting immediately to the old habits, many of these businesses will have a long road ahead,” he told the Burnaby NOW when he launched the first show in support of Cozmos. “They need our support more than ever.”

“We are all spending more time in our own spaces, making the beautification of our homes and spaces a crucial aspect of our mental health and well-being,” the gallery said in a write-up about the exhibition. “The creative sector is a significant aspect of our local economy and in need of our collective support. Many artists and associated small businesses are looking for encouragement as they contribute to the sustainable vitality of our local economy.”

The gallery is hosting an opening exhibition on Saturday, June 6, between 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. – but you can’t just show up. To allow the gallery to maintain social distancing, anyone who wants to attend needs to make an appointment ahead (call 604-521-7887 or email trudy@vandopgallery.com) for a 20-minute viewing slot.

Van Dop Gallery is at 421 Richmond St. See www.vandopgallery.com for full details.",[]

Metro Vancouver has extended the usual process for its regional cultural grants, in recognition of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the arts community.

article continues below

Arts and culture organizations now have until Tuesday, Aug. 4 to apply for 2020 grants, rather than the usual spring timeline.

A Metro Vancouver press release notes that a total of $140,000 in funding is available to arts and culture organizations for regional projects, with a maximum of $10,000 per project grant. These annual regional cultural grants support arts and culture projects including research, creation, production, dissemination, audience development, project staff and administrative capacity building.

The release notes this year’s application deadline was extended to give applicants more time to focus on their base operations, brainstorm adapted methods of project delivery and “reconfirm the availability of necessary resources.”

“The arts community is facing unprecedented challenges due to the ongoing public health measures enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Sav Dhaliwal, chair of the Metro Vancouver board of directors, in a press release.

“As such, we have adjusted this year’s cultural grants program to offer greater clarity and flexibility in terms of project delivery options, timeframes and other grant criteria.

“Arts and culture connect our communities in important and creative ways that are the heart and soul of the quality of life that we all value so much, and we are proud to support the arts and culture community during this difficult period.”

Completed applications must be submitted by 4 p.m. on Tuesday, Aug. 4.

100 Braid Street Studios is taking its popular paint-and-sip nights into the virtual realm in response to COVID-19. The virtual paint nights are happening throughout May.

“The arts help people cope in dark times, so during this COVID pandemic we are delighted to be going virtual and bring our paint events to the comfort of your own home,” says a write-up on the studio’s website.

As with the gallery’s in-person sessions, the events are led by professional artists who lead people of various skill levels through the production of a painting – and, at the same time, as the website notes, they teach painting techniques so you can learn and improve your skill over time.

Participants have two ticket choices. It’s $20 if you have the necessary supplies already, and $45 if you’d like to pick up a paint event kit with full supplies.

The gallery offers paint nights at a variety of skill levels, so check ahead to find the level appropriate for you. There are even a couple of Kids and Adults paint nights coming up aimed at artists of all ages.

All you need to take part is a space to work (with no distractions so you’ll be able to keep up with the teacher), and your own drinks and snacks to work with, plus the Zoom app on your digital device.

The arts council has just doled out $5,000 in grant funding for Seniors Expressions Through the Arts projects.

article continues below

The grants are part of the arts council’s efforts to steer the city’s arts community through the COVID-19 pandemic. A press release notes the money is geared toward promoting creative expression and professional development for emerging, mid-career and senior-level artists in the city’s 55-plus community.

In late April, the arts council put out an artist call for project ideas, with each project eligible to receive up to $500 to cover the cost of materials, technology upgrades and professional online courses.

“The opportunity to engage creativity through the pursuit of arts, crafts, design and learning can help dissolve the boundaries and challenges experienced in isolation,” said Olivia C. Davies, Arts Council of New Westminster seniors coordinator, in the press release. “These arts awards will promote the health and welfare of our senior community by encouraging new creative expression and help ease the financial burden of purchasing non-essential items that help fulfil the artists’ desires to create something beautiful in these difficult times of social distancing.”

The award recipients are:

Candace Colmer: series of acrylic paintings and online learning

Carolyn McLaughlin: batik art fashion designs

Janet Kvammen: seniors’ weekend pop-up show event, with live demos

Jim Keyes: series of acrylic paintings for exhibition and online portfolio upgrades

Lanta Meng: series of oil paintings for exhibition

Lavana La Brey: software and equipment for online teaching and presentations

Lee Down: series of acrylic paintings for exhibition

Melissa Mary Duncan: equipment for online presentations of fantasy art practice

Susan Ormsby: series of watercolour paintings for exhibition

Rodrigo Sarrat Cave: printing series of photobooks as teaching tools

The successful grant applicants were chosen by a volunteer committee made up of New West folks aged 55 and up connected to the arts and culture community.

Each of the projects developed with the funding will be considered for public exhibition at the Gallery at Queen’s Park in 2021. Additional online content and virtual exhibition will be available on the arts council’s website this fall.

The project is funded through the Government of Canada’s New Horizons for Seniors program.",[]

A month after the BC Junior A Lacrosse League was supposed to begin playing, the league officially cancelled its 2020 season.

article continues below

The Minto Cup, along with all other minor and senior national championships, has also been cancelled by the Canadian Lacrosse Association.

In a release, BCJALL president Karl Christiansen said ongoing restrictions in British Columbia limiting the size of public gatherings during the COVID-19 pandemic to no more than 50 people made it impossible for games to be played.

“We had hope we might be able to compete this year,” he said. “But it became evident we wouldn’t be able to have a normal season.”

Christiansen said alternative schedules were considered, but public health directives were insurmountable.

CLA president Shawn Williams said health and safety, travel concerns and venue closures were the main considerations in its decision to cancel all 2020 national championships from the Mann Cup senior men’s title to the U12 finals, as well as the U19 women’s field lacrosse championships.

“We recognize that national championships are important to lacrosse players of all ages,” he said, adding all hosts for 2020 events will be charged with staging their championships in 2021. That means the Minto and Mann Cups will both be played in Ontario.

The senior Western Lacrosse Association called off its season last week.",[]

Each spring, the city’s parks and recreation department holds classes where community members make hanging baskets like those beautifying city streets.

article continues below

“COVID-19 has disrupted the city’s learn-to-make-a-hanging-basket program held annually in Queen’s Park. As a result, for the first time we are offering ‘grab and go kits’ to help even the most novice of green thumbs create their own baskets in the comfort of their own home,” Dean Gibson, the city’s director of parks and recreation, said in an email to the Record. “Our expert horticulture staff have done all the hard work of selecting plants that will ensure every basket is spectacular. It’s easy….Grab your kit, assemble with the aid of our on-line instructor, and add water.”

Gibson suggests that anyone wanting to get involved do so right away as supplies are limited.

The “grab-and-go kits” include plants, soil, fertilizer, moss, a 14-inch frame, wick, hardware and instructions (both a hard copy and a video.) The kits are $75 each.

In addition to the basket-making kits, the City of New Westminster is also hosting a plant sale that features flats of mixed summer annuals that are suitable for garden beds, containers and planters. Each $25 flat consists of either 20 shade plants or 20 sun plants (no substitutions are available).

To purchase hanging basket kits or flats of flowers, call 604-526-4281 or 604-777-5111, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. The city is allowing a maximum of four kits or flats per purchase.

When ordering the grab-and-go kits and plants, people can register for time slots to pick them up at the Queen’s Park greenhouse. City staff will be onsite to coordinate traffic and kit distribution while ensuring appropriate physical distancing.

Pickups for the hanging basket kits will be on Saturday, May 16 and Sunday, May 17 from 8 to 9:30 a.m., 10:30 a.m. to noon and 1:30 to 3:00 p.m.

For residents who buy the flats of summer annuals, pickups will take place next weekend:

*Saturday, May 23: 8 to 9 a.m. (shade); 9:30 to 10:30 a.m. (shade); 10:30 to 11:30 a.m. (shade); 1 to 2 p.m. (sun); and 2 to 3 p.m. (sun).

*Sunday, May 24: 8 to 9 a.m. (sun); 9:30 to 10:30 a.m. (sun); 10:30 to 11:30 a.m. (sun); 1 to 2 p.m. (sun); and 2 to 3 p.m. (sun).",[]
143,newwestrecord,https://www.newwestrecord.ca/business/the-hub-barbershop-s-legacy-lives-on-in-new-west-1.24128255,The Hub Barbershop’s legacy lives on in New West,['Theresa Mcmanus'],,"Ah, the stories he could tell.

After more than 50 years in Uptown New West, Paul Sanders recently sold the Hub Barbershop and started easing his way into retirement – something he’s happy to do now that he’s confident his family’s business legacy will carry on. John Van Leest, Sanders’ father-in-law, took over the Hub Barbershop in 1955, and it Sanders kept it going when Van Leest retired.

article continues below

“I feel very privileged and lucky to do what I have done – just that everything fell into my lap to go into barbering because of my father-in-law. Everything just turned out beautiful,” Sanders said. “It’s something I still really, really enjoy doing. When you have been in this business long enough and have the customers I have had, they become customer-friends.”

It was important to Sanders that the Hub Barbershop’s name live on because it carries on the legacy of Van Leest, a man he affectionately refers to as dad. The Hub wasn’t the first business the duo pursued together, but it was definitely the longest lasting.

“Dad and I opened the Rainbow Billiards at 708 Sixth St. in New Westminster in the 60s. We ran that for a few years. It didn’t do well. Matter of fact, we lost a little bit of money,” Sanders said. “At that time we had the most modern billiard hall in North America.”

Billiards may not have been a successful venture, but barbering, now that’s a career with staying power.

“Dad was a barber. When we sold Rainbow Billiards, I was going to go off into a different area,” Sanders said. “Dad said to me, ‘Paul – have you ever thought about being a barber?’’ I thought about it, and said, ‘Sure, I’d like to try.’ That’s how I got into barbering. I went to barber school in Vancouver. It was fantastic. I apprenticed in North Vancouver and then I came to work for dad. That was in the 1970s. That’s how I got into the barbering businesses.”

Having started barbering when “Moby Dick was a sardine,” Sanders said it’s a career path he’s never regretted.

“My father-in-law said, if I was ever to be a barber, I am never going to be rich, but I’m never going to be poor. I’ll always have a dollar in my pocket and I will meet nice people,” he recalled.

Although the COVID-19 crisis has forced the barbershop to close temporarily, when it reopen Sanders will return to working three days a week, something he’s been doing since selling the Hub in January. Working Thursday to Saturday is the best of both worlds; he has more time at home with his wife, Deanna, and he maintains connections with all the folks he’s met through the years.

“I am loving it. I have been doing it since January. But you know, I am awfully happy when I come back to work on Thursday. I am so glad I am able to do what I am able to do, and to have that many days off. No pressure,” he told the Record before the shop temporarily closed because of COVID-19. “It’s a real social thing for me. I really enjoy doing it.”

Mina Pourjahani was thrilled to be able to take over the Hub Barbershop earlier this year. - Lisa King

Sanders had an opportunity to sell the Hub to a couple of different people, ultimately selecting Mina Pourjahani. He thinks the shop’s legacy is safe in her hands.

“That is why I selected Mina,” he said. “One of the biggest reasons I selected her for the Hub Barbershop is she cares. She really cares about the haircut. So many people in the business today, I’m not going to say.”

Pourjahani heard about the Hub from friends in New West and helped out at the shop when one of Sanders’ employees was away. Having had her own salon in the past, the North Vancouver resident was keen on the idea of working in a barbershop instead of a salon, as it involves fewer hair care products, and is better for her skin.

“This is the best place,” she told the Record.

With a loyal customer base, including many who have been getting their hair cut at the Hub for decades, Pourjahani has adjusted to something a bit different than she’s encountered in past salons.

“What was interesting for me, I didn’t see before a lot of grey hair,” she smiled.

Through the decades, Sanders’ clientele has included many of the city’s “movers and shakers” including mayors and city councillors, city employees, school principals, hall of fame lacrosse players and former CFL player Jon Cornish (when he still had hair).

The Hub was included in a 2015 exhibition at the New Westminster Museum – Hair Apparent: A Hairy History of New Westminster. Sanders contributed some items, including antique razors, to the exhibition.

“Dad, my father-in-law, was a barber. My brother-in-law was a barber and I was a barber. My mother-in-law was a hairdresser. My sister-in-law was a hairdresser and my wife is a hairdresser. We opened two hairdressing shops here in New West,” Sanders said about the Powder Puff. “There’s quite a good history.”

Sanders and his wife would often share stories about the things they heard during the work day – but some things are off-limits.

“When we have our happy hour at home, which we do and have done for 40 years, Deanna and I, it’s never been short on the conversation,” Sanders said. “As a hairdresser, I am generally interested in what she had to say. As a barber, she was always interested in what I have to say. Besides talking about the kids, we always had something neat and funny. There are a lot of stories she doesn’t know – and I’m not going to let you print them either.”

Ken McDonald, who was born and raised in New West and went on to work in the school district for 38 years and serve two terms on school board, is one of those loyal customers who have gone to the Hub for decades.

“I just feel so comfortable with Paul. Number 1, he is a very good barber. It is the nicest atmosphere in the barbershop. Everybody is friendly. Lots of jokes,” he said. “He is just a great guy. It is such a nice feeling to go in and get your hair cut. One of the disadvantages over the years is that you have a wait, but you don’t mind waiting for something this good.”

Sanders is looking forward to the day the shop can reopen and he can get back to the work he loves.

“Especially now that I am semi-retired – the feeling now is like never before. I have always enjoyed it. I didn’t think I could enjoy it even better,” he said. “Because of having Nina here, and we have a third one here part time, I can look after my customers, and that’s just what I want to do. The pressure is off.”",[]

But instead of an annual street festival on Columbia Street that’s attended by thousands of people, New West Pride – Digital Edition will take place by livestream on Saturday, Aug. 15 from 7 to 9 p.m.

“Last year we celebrated and we created community. This year, in response to COVID-19, the world has paused and become more and more uncertain. Yet one thing that has become certain is how important community can be, and the resilience of the human spirit,” stated New West Pride in a notice about this year’s event. “Pride cannot be cancelled. We are excited to bring you the same energy from our festival but this time via livestream.”

The one-night celebration, which will be hosted by Kendall Gender and feature an intro by the Greater Vancouver Native Cultural Society, will be livestreamed on Facebook and YouTube.

New West Pride is promising to make headliner announcements soon, but it’s unveiled some of the other performances that will be featured during the event. Performers include: Mx. Bukuru, Grace Mari, Dong Ganisa, Roger Blenman, Skim, King Fisher, Jason Qiu, Maiden China, Jaylene Tyme and Celestial Seasons.

New West Pride, which usually hosts a week of LGBTQ+ events, was one of a number of local groups that sought the city’s approval to repurpose its civic grant in a new way for 2020, given the restrictions on large gatherings imposed by COVID-19. The society told the city it plans on leveraging international efforts to celebrate Pride and addressing social isolation in the community by developing an online lounge for gathering.

Hospitalized on three occasions, the 76-year old Coquitlam resident is grateful to Royal Columbian Hospital for helping her manage her illness with medications and continue to live independently.

She was first hospitalized in the late 1960s, when she had what she describes as a nervous breakdown. “I had anxiety attacks. They were bad, and I went to see my doctor,” Joyce remembers. “He said I should be in the hospital.”

She was diagnosed with schizophrenia and given a prescription that Joyce says helped for more than 40 years. But then, around the time her husband passed away, Joyce says the medication stopped working.

She ended up in Royal Columbian Hospital’s emergency department, where she was admitted to the Sherbrooke Centre. Psychiatrist Dr. Hem Phaterpekar put her on a new medication.

“Unfortunately, that is a reasonably common occurrence, where medication after some time may not have as good an effect as it did before,” explains Dr. Phaterpekar, who has a specialty in geriatric psychiatry. “Also, when a person ages, his or her body change significantly in its metabolism.”

Three years after that short stay, Joyce was again brought to emergency. “My podiatrist had come to my home, and she realized there was something that wasn’t right,” says Joyce.

This time she was admitted to the Sherbrooke Centre for a month. Her medication dosage was adjusted again. “The staff was so caring, and that made a big difference,” she says.

After being discharged, she followed up with the local community mental health centre and is now using her family doctor as her first point of contact.

“Our goal is always to have short hospitalizations where people can begin to recover,” explains Royal Columbian Hospital Psychiatry department head Dr. Anson Koo, “and where we can establish appropriate services and care in the community so people can continue their recovery in the community.”

These days, Joyce says she feels good. “I can cope. I am out almost every day. I socialize. I’ve got lots of good friends,” she says.

“We’ve renovated twice and expanded our facilities by taking over another 700 square feet at the rear of the building,” says Dr. Murphy. “It’s allowed us to accommodate more chairs for more patients.”

And thanks to countless referrals from happy patients, those extra chairs have been necessary.

“Going to the dentist isn’t everyone’s idea of fun,” Dr. Murphy laughs, “but we try to make our patients feel comfortable by treating them like a member of the Queen’s Park Dental family. Some people come in joking and relaxed; some people are nervous. Either way, we try to make sure everyone leaves with a smile.”

Queen’s Park Dental offers a full list of dental services, including mild sedation to make the experience easier for those who find going to the dentist to be a little nerve-wracking.

“Typically, anxious patients will ask for an oral sedation for the first couple of appointments,” Dr. Murphy says. “Once we build up a rapport and trust level, however, they usually find that the medication is not needed.”

Dr. Murphy, his associate Dr. Karen Liang, and rest of the team at Queen’s Park Dental are passionate advocates of the benefits of preventative care.

“Keeping up with preventative care is really important for good oral health,” Dr. Murphy says. “It’s a lot easier to catch a cavity early and fix it with a filling, but neglecting dental care for a few years means more complex work, such as a root canal or a crown. Prevention is the key.”

“Shockwave therapy is a modern and highly effective treatment method where high-energy sound waves are introduced into the painful areas of the body,” explains Jeanie Bezdan, co-founder and owner of Royal City Health & Manual Therapy. “It accelerates the healing process in the body by stimulating the metabolism and enhancing blood circulation to help regenerate damaged tissue.”

article continues below

At Royal City Health & Manual Therapy, the procedure is administered by a chiropractor or a physiotherapist.

“A doctor referral isn’t usually required,” notes Jeanie, “and we recommend coming for a free consultation before deciding if shockwave therapy is appropriate for your condition.”

Conditions that might benefit from a course of shockwave therapy treatment include tendonitis, plantar fasciitis, tennis elbow, stress fractures, jumper’s knee and many more.

“One of our therapists has received shockwave treatments for painful disc symptoms in her back,” Jeanie says. “She reported that it has saved her career. Personally, I have a meniscal tear in my knee and, even though shockwave therapy is not really indicated for this type of injury, I felt immediate pain relief and an increased range of motion for several days after the treatment.”

Jeanie also points to the ample case studies with journal references proving the effectiveness of the therapy for certain conditions.

“While the therapy itself can be uncomfortable,” Jeanie explains, “the relief of painful symptoms can be immediate after treatment.”

The first use of shockwave therapy was in 1971 to eliminate kidney stones. In 1985, the treatment was used to treat ailments in other organs such as the gall bladder, bile duct, pancreas, and salivary glands. Subsequently, trials were completed on treating orthopedic conditions and shockwave therapy is now a common tool for pain alleviation.

“There are no side effects and shockwave treatments are non-invasive,” Jeanie notes. “The technology has been used successfully for decades on millions of people.”

Ali J. Chernoff, a Registered Dietitian and Nutrition Consultant working with Royal City Health & Manual Therapy, knows all about the effort needed to change food choices.

“We’re talking lifestyle changes,” says Ali. “It’s not something you can successfully do in 24 hours. Many of our clients have been skipping breakfast for decades, for example. This isn’t something you’re going to change overnight.”

Conveniently located in Royal City Centre Mall in New Westminster, Royal City Health & Manual Therapy offers a full range of health care services, including chiropractic, massage therapy, physiotherapy, clinical counselling and nutrition advice.

“It’s a holistic approach,” Ali explains. “It’s all about lifestyle. Everything is connected: eat well, sleep well, and have a daily exercise routine.”

Ali has been involved in the field of nutrition since 1993. She offers dietitian services to schools, sporting events and teams, as well as family nutrition counselling. Ali also offers food tours that focus on shopping for families, in addition to nutritional education relating to diabetes, and the importance of understanding food labels.

“Sadly, the rules governing what appears on nutrition labels don’t help translate what’s in the ingredients,” she notes. “Cereal is a great example: a nutrition label might say it’s made from ‘whole grains.’ That could just be a fancy way of saying ‘white flour.’ We help people interpret the labels.”

Ali recommends booking an initial consultation to get started on a healthier nutritional lifestyle.

“The initial consultation takes about an hour,” she explains. “We talk about what’s going on in your life, from your eating habits to your work schedule, to your workout preferences. We ask about your medical background, because it’s not just about eating. It’s about changing your lifestyle.”

Also in that first hour, Ali will make sure you understand what a proper portion size is.

“Not many people truly understand what a serving size actually looks like,” she says. “So we discuss that right off the bat. Then we’ll send you home with a little homework and ask to see you again within the week, because the first session is an exploratory time to find out why you’re here and what are your nutrition goals. Then we start working on one goal at a time.”

It’s a true calling – and something she hopes to share with every single student at her music education centre in New Westminster.

Rover Music School was born out of Angelica’s desire to find a path that allowed her to share her passion and joy for music with students in a positive and supportive environment.

Drawn to music as a young child, she was teaching private lessons while working as a rehearsal pianist by the age of 15. She spent time with the New Zealand National Opera Project, Melbourne University Opera Project, Brandon Theater Company, Hipposonic and Armoury Recording Studios. But over time it became clear that her heart was in teaching others and the idea for Rover Music School was born.

“I am the happiest when I get to help another person through music,” she said. “Music made a huge impact in my personal life during hardships, and as I searched for the right path, I realized it was to help others feel the incredible value and impact music could make in helping them express themselves.”

Angelica said she carefully gathered together a team of fellow music teachers who shared her student-centred philosophy. “I wanted to build a school where it was okay to make mistakes, okay to not be perfect and to just enjoy the entire process of learning music and speaking through music.”

The school offers private lessons in piano, flute, guitar, voice, song-writing and Royal Conservatory of Music curriculums. They also provide group lessons to help young children with the Kids Music Fundamentals program, and help parents understand music and the music learning process with the Parents Keyboard Class, as well as offering song-writing workshops for teens and choirs for both adults and children.

“We hear adults say they’re too late to start music lessons, but that couldn’t be farther from the truth! It’s never too late to learn something new, especially in music,” she said. “Rover teaches beginner students of all ages from 3 to 73. Please know that if it’s in your heart, it’s never too late and we’re here to help.”

The response in the community has been incredibly positive, with rave reviews from students and parents alike. The school recently expanded into a larger classroom space.

“New Westminster is a great city for welcoming creative opportunities and growth within its art community,” she said. She’s also a member of the New Westminster Art Council Board of Directors, assisting in curating new programs and events for the city.

She also volunteers with the music therapy program Last Door, which helps people express their emotions during recovery through the power of music.

“It’s been such an incredible experience for everyone involved and reminds me just how special this community is.” Angelica is proud of what she and her team have created – not just because of what they can teach in terms of music but also in the joy and pride it creates in her students.

“Excellence can often be perceived as an end product but we don’t see excellence in only the end result,” she said. “Excellence is in the quality of effort along your journey. For a performer to smile at the end of a performance, not simply because of the performance itself, but because they are proud of their dedication to being the highest quality version of themselves, is what we believe creates excellence.”

The school offers free trial lessons and people are welcome to drop in to learn more.

And her goal is to help every single woman who comes in the door at 30 Minute Hit feel exactly the same way she does.

“I started this business because I honestly felt that every woman needs this feeling in their life, and we are here to bring that to them,” said Firth.

She should know: her own experience at 30 Minute Hit was what led her to open the New Westminster location. She was working in commercial real estate when she went in for a free 30-minute trial session in another community.

“I can remember being in there and knowing I had to open one,” she said. “I had tried tons of different fitness programs and this was the only one that gave me this truly intoxicating feeling of empowerment, confidence, and truly delivered on the results I wanted pretty much right away. I wanted every woman to have access to that same feeling.”

Six weeks after that initial workout, she had officially decided to open a 30 Minute Hit – and eight years later, she’s still in love with the workout and the opportunity to work with other women.

30 Minute Hit is unique in the fitness field: it’s a high intensity boxing/kickboxing circuit workout designed specifically for women. Firth says it’s a fast paced, challenging and empowering workout that appeals to all fitness levels, in a non-intimidating and friendly environment.

“I love everything about the workout, the environment and how it makes me feel,” she said. “I love how I feel energized, beautiful and strong after every session. I can honestly say that I am at my absolute happiest when dripping in sweat, surrounded by other amazing women doing the same thing.”

“We’re a welcoming place, you don’t have to be nervous,” she said. “We’re full of women of all shapes, sizes, and fitness levels and we’re all there for the same reason. You’ll find a whole new version of yourself that you didn’t even know was inside of you when you start the HIT.

Firth gives credit to her staff for their dedication and commitment.

“My wonderful team of instructors are one of a kind,” she said. “The effort that they all put into their roles is outstanding. Our goal, as a team, is that each and every single member that walks in knows that they matter to us.”

She notes that all of the instructors started as members, and understand what newcomers feel like.

“They know what everyone goes through from starting with their free trial nerves, to getting better at their skills, to seeing their results,” she said. “Most of all, they have the passion that makes all the difference. When you’re passionate about something it shines through in your work, and I truly couldn’t ask for a better team.”

Firth says she also feels grateful for the community she gets to work in.

“My husband grew up in New West and I grew up in the small town of Sechelt. I really love the community and the small-town feel that New West has,” she said. “Everyone that lives in New West are noticeably proud to be a part of this vibrant little city and I absolutely love it. It’s got a cozy, close-knit vibe and just feels like home.”

“There’s always someone here who can relate to a patient,” says Dr. Errin Bligh, an optometrist at FYidoctors. “Eye care and choosing eyewear is personal so it helps to have optometrists and opticians with different perspectives and styles.”

And an all-female team of eight Doctors of Optometry brings an added layer of distinctiveness to the clinic.

“It’s pretty unique in the healthcare field,” says Dr. Bligh. “We have a reputation for taking that extra time with our patients and listening carefully to their needs.”

In order to deliver the best possible service and leading-edge treatment, the clinic invests heavily in the latest technology for exams and manufacturing lenses.

It’s currently the only clinic in New Westminster to use Optomap™ retinal imaging, for example, which assists doctors with early detection of eye diseases and other health conditions, such as diabetes and high blood pressure.

“Eyes are individual organs that are an extension of the brain,” explains Dr. Bligh. “So they reflect what’s going on in the body. That’s why it’s so important to check the health of your eyes. It’s not uncommon for the signs of a health condition to show in the eyes first.”

Here are four ways their clinic can offer support:

1. Comfortable clinic visits

Royal City Health offers a special padding in their clinic that allows women to comfortably lay face down to relieve back pain and pressure. ""Feedback from expectant mothers is that they enjoy the ability to lie comfortably face down, especially if that is their usual sleep position prior to pregnancy,"" says Jeanie Bezdan, co-owner of Royal City Health and a Registered Massage Therapist. ""The padding can also be adjusted to provide support and comfort for lying on the side.""

2. Dealing with Diastasis Recti

A condition that's commonly experienced by pregnant or post partum women, diastasis recti involves the separation of the abdominal muscle into two halves.

""It's common in women with multiple pregnancies due to the repeated stretching of the abdominal walls,"" explains Nikhita Jain, a physiotherapist with Royal City Health. ""We offer physiotherapy exercises that target the pelvic floor and your breathing, we find that progressive core exercises are highly beneficial for this condition.” Their team also provides education on proper posture and body mechanics that can help to avoid the back pain that can result from diastasis recti.

3. Avoiding urinary incontinence

Post partum bladder leakage is a common condition due to the stretching of the pelvic floor muscles. ""It's very common in cases with prolonged labour and forceps delivery,"" says Nikhita. ""Physiotherapy interventions such as the knack technique, pelvic floor muscle training and bladder training can help women avoid incontinence.""

4. Learning baby massage

Designed for babies from birth to nine months, Royal City Health offers two private one-hour infant massage sessions to promote parent-baby bonding and stress-relief for babies.

""Infant massage is an effective way to help relieve painful colic symptoms, stimulate growth, and promote relaxation for both baby and parent,"" Jeanie says.

On the other hand, dental implants are fixed directly to the jawbone.”

And yet, dental implants are a worthy alternative to traditional dentures. Dentures are most often associated with the elderly, who most often lose enough teeth to render dentures relevant. However, everything from a playground fall to poor hygiene causes tooth loss. “The benefit of dental implants,” says Dr. Katz, “is that you can have one or many.” Because each artificial tooth is connected individually via titanium screw to the jawbone, a patient can have anything from individual replacements to a full march. As Dr. Katz concludes, “in most cases [implants] are the best replacement option.”

article continues below

Unfortunately, not everyone is a candidate for implants. Some patients are lacking healthy enough bones and gums. Luckily, increases in technology mean that even patients without enough bone can receive a bone graft, so long as they’re in good overall health. “[Dentists] are learning to manipulate the hard tissue as well as soft tissue,” Dr. Katz explains.

Fancy new technology does come with a price. Most insurance companies do not cover the cost of dental replacements; if they do, the fee is higher than dentures or another form. That’s why Dr. Katz provides transparent consultation to customers. Part of the consultation involves creating a 3D scan of the area, which saves the cost of a patient having to travel elsewhere. “A good dentist will do their best to keep the cost down for the patients,” he states.

“When you make all the important decisions related to your funeral in advance, your loved ones don’t need to worry about them at the time of your passing,” says Knapman, location manager of Forest Lawn Funeral Home in nearby Burnaby.

article continues below

Here are five reasons Knapman says pre-arrangement is beneficial to you and your loved ones:

1) You get to be involved in the process. Meeting with a funeral professional, you have an opportunity to outline exactly what you’re looking for and cover off all the details. Not only are you assured of getting the funeral you envisioned, you take away any second-guessing on the part of your family.

2) You can opt to pay for the services at the time of arrangement. Pre-funding your funeral means your family won’t be affected by future price increases. It also means that they don’t have to worry about how to pay for your funeral in their time of grief.

3) You have a chance to get organized. Providers such as Forest Lawn and Ocean View offer a personal planning guide, which outlines everything you need to organize your personal affairs and key information.

But too often we let our homes become outdated, or we let them become cluttered, unorganized or dishevelled. It’s common, our lives are busy, our time is limited and our focus is outside, where the majority of our life happens.

However, the happier the look and feeling of your home, the more satisfied and relaxing your time spent there will be. Outfitting your home with new fixtures or redecorating can be an easy, cost-effective way to inject some life into your space without breaking your budget and at Budget Blinds, that is precisely the company’s sole purpose.

158,newwestrecord,https://www.newwestrecord.ca/entertainment/shaun-majumder-talks-parenting-prejudice-and-his-new-west-show-1.24002375,"Shaun Majumder talks parenting, prejudice and his New West show",['Julie Maclellan'],,"It’s the kind of milestone you have to interrupt a conversation for. Shaun Majumder, on the phone from his home in L.A., breaks into his own train of thought about race and politics and parenting to share a moment from the world of the infant daughter he’s settling down for a nap.

“I held out a little toy and she reached out and picked it out of my hand,” he says, and you can practically see the beaming Dad smile through the phone line. “She’s never done that before.”

article continues below

“She,” by the way, is Mattis Maple Majumder, who’s coming up on 12 weeks old and whose small baby squawks instruct her father to put the phone on speaker so he can pick her up. It’s clear she and her mother (actor Shelby Fenner, who’s been married to Majumder since 2012) are everything to the Canadian comedy star.

Majumder is just winding up a summer and fall hiatus, having interrupted the cross-country tour of his new show, HATE, to be at home for the birth of his daughter.

“I’m very, very thankful to be here. There’s no more important time in my life and in hers,” Majumder says.

For Majumder, becoming a father at 47 was perfect timing (and not just because, as he jokes, “My prostate’s amazing.”)

“I just feel like I’ve got a great foundation right now,” he says. “I’m grounded. I feel good, my mind is really good; it’s perfect. I’m past all the bullshit.”

He’s about to hit the road again, with B.C. tour dates – including a Nov. 23 show at the Massey Theatre – coming up quickly. Yes, it will be his first time leaving wee Mattis behind (and yes, it’s killing him, thanks for asking).

For Majumder, the arrival of Mattis gives him all the more reason to take to the road with HATE. The show combines stand-up, multimedia, video and even song to start a conversation about intolerance and prejudice.

“I’ve been so focused on having a baby and taking care of this beautiful child, so she is not raised in a world that’s filled with hate,” he says.

For those who know Majumder best from his long stint on CBC’s This Hour Has 22 Minutes, he has a warning: This isn’t all benign, CBC-style humour.

“Oh no,” he says emphatically. “This is raw. This is me saying some things that’ll make people feel a little uncomfortable at times. I believe that’s the purpose of comedy. We’ve got to say the things that people don’t want to talk about.”

But no, he says, he’s not talking about the worst things humanity does to each other; this isn’t about violence or bloodshed or war.

“The minutiae that I get into in the show is more what I consider to be, it’s ridiculous, it really is,” he says. “When we talk about hate, it’s people who think they hate someone else. It’s not about hate, it’s about protection of their own tribe.

“What is hate? Hate is kind of spawned by a fear of the other, because they feel threatened by the other. They lash out in a way that would be perceived as hate: ‘You’re not welcome here.’ ‘Build a wall.’ ‘Immigration is bad.’ These kind of things, they’re loosely based on hate – they’re not genocidal,” he says.

He’s not talking about the worst of humanity – the tyrants who have justified the extermination of “others” – but rather, about the more everyday occurrences of racism in Canadian society.

“The stuff that I’m getting to is more ignorance,” he says, citing the example of an Abbotsford man caught in a racist tirade on a video that went viral in 2016. “These are the things I show and talk about.”

His show has evolved over its months of touring (though he admits he hasn’t been doing as much writing for the past few months, since he’s been focusing his time on Mattis). He frequently updates and reworks it to reflect the goings-on on both sides of the 49th parallel.

Majumder can’t help but laugh a little at the fact that, at the beginning of his show’s run, he made fun of Canadian politics for being so devoid of material.

“I make fun of the fact that our scandals in Canada are so lame compared to Trump’s scandals, that Trudeau can’t even buy himself a scandal, a real, juicy scandal,” he says.

Majumder poked fun at the ""scandal” surrounding Trudeau when he “dressed up like Aladdin” – words that, in that moment, were referencing Trudeau’s 2018 trip to India, when he took heat for overdoing it with traditional Indian outfits.

Then the federal election campaign happened.

“The joke became reality,” Majumder says, laughing.

His show covers a lot of ground – from the rise of neo-Nazism in the U.S. and the #MeToo movement, to his own upbringing as the sole “beige” kid in Burlington, Newfoundland, population 350.

And no, Majumder doesn’t have any sad tales about racism in small-town Newfoundland.

“I thought I was lily-white,” says Majumder, the son of an Indian father and white mother. “I had no idea I was any different. It was amazing; looking back, there were some things said to me that I now realize were somewhat racist-slash-ignorant. … I laugh because, In Newfoundland, even when people say things that are racist, they’re still coming from a place of love.”

He tells the story of a woman he met while taking his show back home to Newfoundland. As he speaks, the faintly Celtic lilt that remains in his speaking voice broadens into a full-on Newfoundland brogue.

The woman in question was a fan, and she couldn’t wait to compliment Majumder on his skill with accents. So, in finest Newfoundland style, she told him: “We love you, Shaun, we do; you do the best Paki.”

Majumder laughs with genuine warmth at the memory.

“I was like, ‘That’s so racistly sweet.’”

It’s that kind of good-natured acceptance of humanity, with all its foibles, that Majumder brings with him on the road.

“The way that I’m doing it is, ‘Come into my house and let’s talk about stuff that we will all collectively think is ridiculous,’” he says. “It’s a safe way of doing it. I’m having fun with the ridiculousness of hate. In the end, it’s a very positive message.”

Because, he says, humans are a pretty good species as a lot.

“Ultimately, we all want to love each other; there’s no doubt about it. The fear that gets in the way of people connecting and seeing another person? That’s a problem. People are most definitely fearful.”

But, he says, we don’t start out that way.

“Like, look at Mattis right now. She is completely open to everything in the world,” he says, and his voice is gentle.

“Now that I stare down at my beautiful child, I think I have to write a LOVE show.”

I applaud your decision to protect people, especially when you enter indoor public places. Unless, of course, you’re not wearing that mask properly.

article continues below

I’ve seen too many people attempt to “wear” a face mask, but then ruin things by doing what the dude in the above photo is doing. (The photo kills me because it’s NBA player Daniel Theis from my beloved Boston Celtics, but what he’s doing is being done right here in Burnaby.)

Too many people are wearing their mask below their nose. Or their mask is only covering their nose and not all of their mouth. Or, in extreme cases, the person just says, f*%$ it, I’m going to just let it hang around my neck. I’ve seen at least two people have the mask loop just hanging off of one ear as they parade around a grocery store.

It’s like they think the mere approximation of the mask to their face – without actually covering the face – is enough to protect themselves and others.

It’s not, of course. I hate to get all preachy, but wearing the mask incorrectly is dangerous and embarrassing to you. People are literally laughing at you behind your back.

This is how you wear a mask. - ENGIN AKYURT PHOTO/UNSPLASH

Look, I get it. Wearing a mask is hot. I can’t wear my reading glasses and my mask at the same time because the glasses fog up. And so, I just move the phone or restaurant menu farther away from me so I can, well, sort of read it.

Compromises are necessary to ensure safety and stop the spread of COVID-19.

“Make sure your mask is well-fitted over your nose, mouth and chin, and that it is secured to your head with ties or ear loops so that you do not have to adjust frequently,” says Canada’s top public health official, Dr. Theresa Tam. “Try not to touch the mask or your face while wearing the mask, as this is another route of infection. Some people may not realize that masks can become contaminated on the outside. Wash your hands before and after putting on and taking off your mask using soap and water or a Health Canada-approved hand sanitizer. Only you should wear your mask - please do not share it with others.”

The new virtual portal acts as a local guide for maternity care in Coquitlam, Port Coquitlam and Port Moody, as well as Anmore, Belcarra and New Westminster, and offers information on care providers, clinics, and vaccinations.

article continues below

“As COVID-19 progressed and social distancing became our new norm, myself and my physician-colleagues became concerned our patients were not seeking the care they need,” said Port Coquitlam’s Dr. Cathy Clelland in a written statement.

The virtual hub represents the Fraser Northwest Division of Family Practice’s latest adaptation in how it treats patients since the COVID-19 pandemic began.

Dr. Grover Wong examines Elizabeth Ten at the Elgin Medical Centre in downtown Port Coquitlam. The clinic is now taking on new mothers and their babies to make up for a shortfall in family doctors left by COVID-19. - STEFAN LABBÉ/THE TRI-CITY NEWS

Earlier in B.C.’s pandemic, family doctors in the Tri-Cities and New Westminster areas started seeing more and more patients with COVID-19-like symptoms, and many shut their doors because of a lack of personal protective equipment.

Without a place to see patients, several of the division’s roughly 400 doctors pooled resources at three hubs: one at a COVID-19 testing clinic recently moved to Port Coquitlam, one at the Burke Mountain Medical Centre where a parallel practice sees new patients falling through the cracks, and another where doctors act as stop-gap for mothers and their newborns without easy access to health care. But the hub goes beyond basic care, and includes a series of virtual classes around everything from prenatal yoga to infant first aid and videos on breastfeeding. Other parts still under construction look to cover difficult topics like post-natal depression.

“This has been such a helpful resource for my patients…it’s all local,” added family doctor Dr. Dayna Mudie.

Hot on the heels of Cineplex announcing it was reopening its theatres, Landmark Cinemas has announced the theatre at the New Westminster SkyTrain station will reopen.

article continues below

The date has been set for Friday, July 3.

To ensure physical distancing, Landmarks announced the following changes:

Reduced the capacity of all theatres by over 50% in recliner locations and 75% in traditional seating locations. Theatre capacity will vary to adhere to provincial and municipal occupancy guidelines.

Recliner seating locations will have alternating loveseats, blocked off and checkerboard pattern in front and behind each guest.

Traditional seating locations will have three seats between each pair of seats and alternating rows blocked off.

Every Landmark staff member member will be wearing proper protective equipment as physical distancing might not always be possible, the company said.

Just like Cineplex, Landmark is not making patrons wear face masks – they are only “encouraged” to wear one.

U.S. movie theatre company AMC initially didn’t require masks, but then reversed that decision after social media backlash.

Landmark Cinemas chief executive Bill Walker described to the Canadian Press a significantly different climate in Canada, where as the second-largest theatre owner it operates 46 locations stretching from British Columbia to Ontario.

""Masks have become an oddly divisive issue in the U.S. and so I think Canada... has really just taken a 'personal choice'-type stance on this,"" he said. ""I've been to the shopping malls, I've been to the restaurants, I've been around. It is really not commonplace.

School district superintendent Karim Hachlaf acknowledged that’s the “burning question” on the minds of everyone involved with New West schools right now – and the answer is, there is no answer yet.

Hachlaf told school trustees at their June 23 meeting, held online via Webex, that the district is taking many possibilities into account as it works on its plans for September.

As part of those plans, the district has reached out to parents and students with a survey asking for their input about how remote and hybrid instruction worked for them in June. The survey is open until Monday, June 29.

“We wanted to know what had worked, what we can improve on from the past few months, with the assumption that we could potentially return in still a hybrid mode with face-to-face and remote instruction,” he said. “We wanted to know what other elements we should consider, and how safe our parents and students felt, and supported, while making these various transitions.”

A similar survey has been sent out to staff members as well.

Hachlaf said the district will consider the survey responses as it shapes its plans for September in the face of the evolving COVID-19 situation.

“We’ve commented that ‘We’re in this together’ through this whole process, and we wanted that feedback as part of our September planning,” he said.

Hachlaf noted the province will be informing school districts in mid-August what stage schools will be at in September. The month of June has been spent in what the Ministry of Education has labelled Stage 3, in which families were offered an optional return to part-time in-class instruction.

At Stage 2, if the province opts to move there, elementary school students would be in class full-time and secondary school students (grades 8 to 12) part-time.

Stage 1 would mean a return to regular, full-time, in-class schooling for all levels.

Hachlaf said the district is reviewing its school schedules to ensure it will be able to transition between stages as seamlessly as possible, as need arises.

“We have the whole year to consider now, not just the month of June, and it is very realistic that we may need to move in between stages throughout the school year,” he said. “We want to make that in a way that reduces the impact on instruction and definitely considers the schedule of our parents as well.”

For instance, Hachlaf noted, for current Stage 3 schedules, the district has had elementary students return part-time five days a week. Looking ahead to September, he said, the district is considering a move to full days on a part-time schedule, to better accommodate parents’ work schedules.

The school district is also working on ensuring it can align with health and safety guidelines while moving back to mandatory, rather than optional, in-class instruction.

“We really need to look at the whole school year now and minimize the disruptive impact of staying at home and provide that combination of hybrid and hopefully, over the course of the year, land on Stage 1,” he said. “Those are the conversations we are diving right into. … Input from our parents, our students, our staff is critical to navigate that work.”

That’s a big figure, but even that’s not enough for Julian, who says many people with disabilities are being unfairly left out of much-needed funding.

Burnaby South MP and federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh and Julian have been leading the charge to have more people with disabilities qualify for CERB. Right now, people who don’t qualify for the federal disability tax credit also don’t qualify for CERB, Julian said.

“What they’ve come up with has too many holes,” Julian told the Record in an interview on Wednesday.

Julian outlined what the past few months have been like in politics. These days, Julian works up to 20 hours a day trying to negotiate changes to government programs being rolled out since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. That includes having to take part in calls at 4 a.m. due to the time difference on the East Coast.

Singh, as party leader, sets out the direction the NDP wants to take as far as changes and Julian leads the negotiations with the federal government, as well as the other major political parties.

Singh and Julian have been pushing for things like wage subsidies and rent rebates for commercial tenants.

“My meetings usually start with the Liberals telling why they can’t do something,” Julian said. “Then we negotiated from there.”

New Westminster-Burnaby MP Peter Julian, right, has been appointed by federal NDP leader Jagmeet Singh as NDP house leader. - Contributed

The latest battle was to get the federal government to extend CERB longer. On Tuesday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the federal government is extending the program by eight weeks. The 16-week program was due to end the first week of July. The extension means the $2,000 monthly payments are now set to conclude after the last full week of August. The prime minister has not offer a cost estimate of the extension.

Instead, he said the hope is that fewer Canadians will need to tap the CERB as the economy opens up across the nation.

The federal Liberals proposed a bill last week that would call for CERB recipients to certify they are actively searching for work while accepting benefits. The legislation also proposed fines for those who fraudulently applied for the benefit. The bill fell apart when it was not able to find support within the minority Parliament.

Julian said that the minority Parliament has been a blessing because it’s allowed the NDP and other parties to push for changes by using the “leverage” of their votes.

“The minority government makes such a difference with this,” Julian said.

The NDP is also pushing the feds to drop their goal of fines through the CRA, saying fraud can be pursued through other legal channels.

“People are already struggling enough without CRA coming after them with draconian penalties,” Julian said.

Vince Li wants to have a word with you about that. The 26-year-old had been battling a fever for several days back in March when he made his way to Burnaby Hospital looking for answers.

The results of an X-ray and blood test revealed tell-tale signs of COVID-19. Doctors decided to immediately sedate, intubate, and send Li to Royal Columbian Hospital, one of the province’s primary COVID-19 sites. There, he became the youngest COVID-positive patient to be mechanically ventilated in the hospital’s intensive care unit during the pandemic’s spring peak, according to the RCH foundation.

“I didn’t have a chance to tell anybody,” Li recalls after hearing he would be placed in an induced coma. “My mom was outside at the waiting area in the ER, and social workers called her.”

“His blood levels of oxygen were ridiculously low, so he needed quite a lot of oxygen to support him,” said Dr. Robert Sharpe, a critical care physician at RCH. “His carbon dioxide levels were also quite high. It was quite difficult to blow off CO2 because his lungs were greatly inflamed from the body’s reaction to the virus. He was pretty touch and go early on.”

A personal trainer and competitive mixed-martial artist who controlled his type 2 diabetes through diet and exercise, Li remained hospitalized for a month and remembers nothing about the first three weeks. During that time, ICU teams kept a close watch on his blood gases, made sure his organs were getting enough oxygen, and watched for signs of new infections.

Since there is no specific treatment yet for COVID-19, patients are supported medically in the hopes they can fight off the virus.

“He fooled us a couple of times, where we thought he was ready to come off the ventilator,” said Sharpe. “And then we just needed to give him more time, and he turned around.”

When he regained consciousness, Li was surprised at the amount of weight and muscle he lost. It took him a while to start moving comfortably again.

“In the beginning, it was pretty rough,” he said. “I didn’t realize that being in a bed for a month, I could have so much muscle atrophy.”

While his time at Royal Columbian is hazy, Li says the care – from the doctors to the nurses and physiotherapists – stands out, as does other, simpler milestones.

“My fondest memory was getting the tubes out of my nose and eating actual food for the first time in a month,” Li said. “That felt pretty good.”",[]

Dr. Michael Schwandt, who was one of the first infectious disease specialists from Vancouver Coastal Health to help contain outbreaks at sites like the Lynn Valley Care Centre, made the comments not long after a group of 239 scientists from 32 countries wrote an open letter to the World Health Organization, successfully appealing for the world health body to change its guidance on aerosolized transmission.

“We'll be watching closely the science around airborne transmission. At this time, we don't think it's played a major role in the outbreaks in Vancouver Coastal Health that we've had direct experience with,” said Dr. Schwandt.

The new W.H.O. guidance, which came last Thursday, accepts that the novel coronavirus can spread through aerosolized particles — tiny droplets in the air — in crowded indoor settings for prolonged periods of time.

“There have been reported outbreaks of COVID-19 in some closed settings, such as restaurants, nightclubs, places of worship or places of work where people may be shouting, talking, or singing.

“In these outbreaks, aerosol transmission, particularly in these indoor locations where there are crowded and inadequately ventilated spaces where infected persons spend long periods of time with others, cannot be ruled out,” reads the W.H.O.’s new guidance, which also calls for more research into aerosol transmission. aerosol transmission.

But Dr. Schwandt said his team doesn’t view the airborne versus droplet transmission debate as a binary, and that while the virus can be traced at varying distances at concentrations, most of the cases he’s come across in Vancouver Coastal Health region, home to the first outbreaks in the country, have been from “face-to-face” transmission.

The proof, he said, comes from Vancouver Coastal’s success in tracing contacts based on direct contact, an experience a spokesperson for Fraser Health told the Tri-City News has been echoed in their health authority.

“Without taking airborne transmission into account as a risk factor, we've been able to bring outbreaks under good control, really looking at close physical contact as the main risk factor,” said Dr. Schwandt.

That means, at the moment, current ventilation systems in places like long-term care homes are not considered a risk factor in the spread of the virus.

Airborne or not, sharing air in large, indoor public gatherings raises everyone’s risk of transmitting the virus, as Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry reminded British Columbians in her daily update Tuesday.

“Stay away from closed spaces as much as possible,” she said. “If it’s a house party, you may not know all the people who are there.”

And like the W.H.O., health officials in B.C. said they are keeping an eye on the science.

“If more evidence were to develop around airborne or aerosol transmission, then naturally we'd need to look at preventative measures that include attention to ventilation,” said Dr. Schwandt.",[]

In a letter sent Wednesday to various ministers, the country's largest airline says the situation is becoming ""increasingly urgent"" as Canada has made virtually no change to its quarantine restrictions since mid-March despite improvements in containing the spread of the virus.

Air Canada's chief medical officer, Dr. Jim Chung, wrote that the restrictions are severely impacting the airline, its customers and employees, as well as an overall recovery.

He says the proposed measures mirror those adopted by the European Union, Britain and other jurisdictions.

It notes that requirements in place to travel to various countries include pre-departure medically certified negative COVID-19 tests to enter the Caribbean; a waiver of quarantine requirements after a negative test on arrival to Iceland, Austria and Luxembourg; and mandatory testing on arrival to South Korea, Hong Kong, Macau and the United Arab Emirates.

""There are many other interests affected by the quarantine restrictions — not only jobs and pensions, but also the social and economic well-being of individuals and communities that rely on air travel, as well as basic freedoms of mobility,"" says Chung.

""Business and labour leaders alike have implored the government to act on easing these restrictions in order to strike a better balance, without adversely impacting public health.""

In one cluster, at least 17 cases have been traced to a group of people who met up in Kelowna, some from the Interior and Alberta, others from the Lower Mainland.

“There are a number of people who have been exposed in those events,” said Henry Tuesday.

More troubling still is the emergence of new cases at the Krazy Cherry Fruit Company in Oliver, where two have been identified among migrant workers. They were among 62 cases identified in B.C. between Friday and Monday.

“Public health teams are monitoring the situation closely and have placed restrictions on those living and working on the farm to limit the potential for further transmission,” said Dr. Henry in a written statement today.

But others have expressed concerns that not enough is being done to prevent outbreaks among vulnerable groups. Where newly arrived immigrants were disproportionately affected at earlier outbreaks at poultry plants in Coquitlam, others say migrant agricultural workers still run higher risks due to inadequate housing.

“As anticipated,” said Byron Cruz of Sanctuary Health, an organization that works to protect migrant workers from predatory practices. “We knew that something was going to happen because the situation for housing in that farm is terrible. They were all crowded.”

‘WAY ABOVE MY COMFORT ZONE’

Yesterday, Dr. Henry warned 25 cases a day was “distressing” and “cautionary to us.” And while not unexpected due to the increased travel and social interaction of phase 3, she said “That’s way above my comfort zone.”

Dr. Henry urged anyone who attended Canada Day parties in the vicinity of the Kelowna cluster to self-monitor for even the mildest of symptoms, noting that anyone can be tested should they feel they’ve been exposed.

Just how quickly a province or state can backslide has been painted in stark relief among our neighbours to the south.

In comments to the press Tuesday, Health Minister Adrian Dix pointed to surges in several U.S. states where record breaking daily caseloads in several states have led jurisdictions like California to re-introduce physical distancing protocols, in what Dix described as “lockdown 2.0.”

“All our neighbouring jurisdictions continue to see an increase, whether it’s our neighbouring province to the east, Alberta, or others, Washington, Oregon and California, in Nevada, Arizona and in other American states — we’ve seen record days of new cases of COVID-19 recently,” said Dix.

Here in B.C., Henry said that on Monday, she checked how weekly caseloads are tracking with the province’s modelling that suggests British Columbians keep their social contacts to 65% of normal.

“We are still skirting that line. The RT, the reproductive number, is hovering around one… which is sort of pushing the limits of where we need to be,” she said.

While health officials work to contain the outbreak in Oliver, it’s unclear how a potential surge in cases will affect that calculation, and Byron Cruz of Sanctuary Health said he expects more cases to crop up in coming days due to their tight living quarters.

What is clear is the more cases are contained to a single cluster, the easier they are to track.

“This is going to be our dance over the next few months, where we do what we can do, we travel, we have those social interactions, but we do it in a thoughtful way so we do it with the people we know we’re with,” said Dr. Henry.",[]

The question is whether strong summer sales — driven in part by delayed purchasers waiting to buy since spring's lockdown — will carry forward to fall, experts said.

article continues below

The Canadian Real Estate Association on Wednesday reported that June sales were up 63 per cent on a month-over-month basis, and 15.2 per cent higher than the same time last year. Prices also rose from June 2019, up 6.5 per cent to an average $539,000.

""Home sales, prices and starts have effectively regained all the ground lost during the shutdown,"" BMO chief economist Douglas Porter wrote in a note to clients.

""However, fair point that some of this outsized strength is simply pent-up demand for the lost sales from the key spring season.""

The real estate industry came to a near standstill earlier this year as non-essential businesses closed to help slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. CREA said the jump in sales returned them to ""normal levels"" for June, noting they were up 150 per cent from where they were in April.

Porter said the housing market now must keep up its momentum headed into autumn. Though at a glance, the numbers appear to suggest nothing ""amiss in the economy whatsoever,"" the market will have to balance slowing immigration levels, low interest rates and short housing supply, he said in the note. This tension will come with lasting scars, he said.

Also on Wednesday, the Bank of Canada released its quarterly outlook, forecasting an uncertain economic recovery ahead, and suggesting housing activity will slow over the next few years.

Royal LePage CEO Phil Soper said that the ""pent-up demand"" in the market has been boosted by first-time homebuyers looking for bargains during the downturn. That can crunch the number of new listings, since first-time owners don't have a home to sell, he said, noting CREA's data showed housing inventory at a 16-year low. The association said that the number of newly listed properties climbed 49.5 per cent from May to June.

If there are too many home buyers and too few listings available, that can drive up prices, said Soper. Soper predicts that more existing homeowners may list their homes in the fall, which may cause price increases to level off.

""We're seeing upward pressure on prices, and the highest levels of demand in Ontario and Quebec,"" said Soper. ""Things are good in other parts of the country, but they're quite calm, where the number of people looking for homes and the number of homes available for sale are roughly equal.""

Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Dominion Lending Centres, said in a client note that home prices are declining in Calgary, while elsewhere on the prairies, prices are either flat or rising.

Tim Otitoju, a Regina, Sask.-based real estate agent and chairperson of the province's real estate association, said that while the supply of homes for sale is steady and a bit low, sellers are getting more comfortable with the provincial measures to re-open business.

""We saw a surge in demand in June — we are actually attributing that to the buyers that held off during the shutdown,"" said Otitoju. ""It seems that buyers and sellers are showing a lot of confidence in the provincial reopening plan. Sellers are starting to put their houses back on the market.""

Soper said that he was reassured by the recovery in the West, given oil price volatility and regulatory changes in British Columbia. If immigration does slow, said Soper, it may be a few years before the long-term impacts surface, since homeownership for new Canadians spikes between three and seven years after arrival.

While home sales may be hitting ""normal levels,"" the overall housing market is ""obviously not back to normal at this point,"" said Shaun Cathcart, CREA's senior economist.

""The market has recovered much faster than many would have thought, but what happens later this year remains a big question mark,"" said Cathcart in a statement.

""That said, daily tracking suggests that July, at least, will be even stronger.""

The Canadian Federation of Independent Business surveyed more than 4,500 small business owners online from June 26 to July 2 and found that 2,100 respondents took on an average $135,000 in debt ($285.4 million for the responding group as a whole).

article continues below

Laura Jones, the executive vice-president of the organization that represents at least 110,000 small businesses, said debt has ballooned as 58 per cent of small businesses re-opened fully.

About 35 per cent are back to full staffing but only 24 per cent are back to normal revenue, she said.

""I've talked to many businesses that are open again, but are worried about being able to outrun the debt they have accumulated, particularly with sales still down,"" Jones said in a statement.

At the national level, that debt amounts to billions of dollars.

To finance COVID-19 revenue shortfalls and extra costs, the CFIB survey found 37 per cent of businesses are relying on personal savings, 34 per cent on credit cards, 18 per cent on bank loans, 11 per cent on retirement savings and 9 per cent each on mortgages and loans from families and friends.

Josie Rudderham, a co-owner of Cake and Loaf Bakery in Hamilton, Ont., wasn't surprised by the findings because her 12-year-old company was hit hard when COVID-19 began.

Cake and Loaf temporarily closed one location, permanently shut down a second and laid off workers right as the company's busiest season — Easter — hit. It emptied out what treats it had ready for sale and sent them home with employees or over to health care workers and food banks.

""A lot of expenses didn't stop, the overhead really didn't slow down that much, insurance itself is a big chunk of what we pay and that didn't get reduced. In fact, it went up,"" she said.

Rudderham, who has since reopened a location for curbside pickup, had to take out a loan to deal with cash flow issues and said many of her fellow small business owners did the same because they don't have the cash reserves larger companies do.

""I anticipate it will take us more than a decade to pay off some of this debt that we've had to take on because we are never aiming for profit,"" she said. ""We're aiming to break even every year and then every year we also increase wages because living wage gets recalculated every year.""

James McIntosh, the founder of Meaford, Ont.-based Duxbury Cider and chair of the Ontario Craft Cider Association, also stumbled on troubles when bars and restaurants were forced to close in March.

Duxbury's sales dropped 53 per cent, but McIntosh still considered himself fortunate because his family operates the farm and only has a few workers on staff.

He took out a loan and later, when patios reopened saw about a fifth of his licensed business came back.

Others borrowed money and didn't have such luck. They could be trying to cover what they lost for far longer, he said.

""Some of the smaller guys were really hurt because they didn't have an LCBO or grocery store (selling arrangement),"" he said. ""They were basically relying on what business they could drum up locally with bars and restaurants.""

According to the polling industry's generally accepted standards, online surveys cannot be assigned a margin of error because they do not randomly sample the population.

“The decision about criminal jury trials is entirely in the hands of the chief justice of the Supreme Court and the judiciary,” David Eby said. “On our end, the sheriffs and court services branch are working very closely with the judiciary to support the courts in getting jury trials up and running as soon as we can.”

article continues below

The court is expected to make an announcement on criminal jury trials this week.

The pandemic has created a significant backlog in court cases, Eby said. Four thousand cases were adjourned when in-person hearings were restricted in B.C. Supreme Court. The provincial court has adjourned more than 10,000 cases, including traffic tickets, family matters, minor prosecutions and small claims.

To help deal with the backlog, Eby has proposed a one-year restriction on civil jury trials.

But people accused of a criminal offence have a constitutional right to a jury trial. It’s considered the key to a fair and just system. To choose a jury, whether civil or criminal, requires the assembling of a significant number of people, Eby said.

“Potential solutions include larger venues for jury selection and doing tiered selection, where you bring in one group of people, and then another group of people, as opposed to typically bringing in around 200 people and selecting from the pool,” he said.

The order of the provincial health officer limiting all public gatherings to 50 people makes it a challenge, he said.

At the Victoria courthouse, defence lawyers have been setting criminal jury trial dates for the fall, even though they believe it’s unlikely their trials will go ahead.

Criminal defence lawyer Jordan Watt said it’s difficult to conceptualize getting 12 people together, approximately one foot apart from each other, to listen to the evidence throughout a trial which could last one week or up to three or four months.

“Then to get them to deliberate together without there being some type of massive construction to the current courtroom setup that we have right now, it’s just not going to happen,” Watt said.

“Even if you go a step further, I think you’re going to have problems getting people to come to court in order to be selected as jurors.”

All the provinces are struggling with the issue, said Eby, who is part of a national committee co-chaired by Chief Justice Richard Wagner and federal Justice Minister and Attorney General David Lametti.

The committee offers national guidance to chief justices, judges and court administration officials on the gradual resumption of court operations across Canada. The action committee is dealing with the challenges of jury trials and hearings in small court rooms, circuit and remote courts. It has released a document around best practices for jury trials and how to try and conduct jury trials in the COVID-19 era.

Eby has repeatedly asked Lametti to give increased discretion to judges under the Criminal Code around jury trials to address the realities of COVID-19.

“He’s indicated that he’s willing to look at those things, but the earliest they could be in the legislature is in the fall, so we’ve got quite a period of time before that happens,” Eby said.

The provincial attorneys general have also been asking the federal government for guidance on the timelines of the Jordan decision during COVID-19, Eby said.

In July 2016, in R. v. Jordan, the Supreme Court of Canada created new limits of 18 months from the time a charge is laid until the trial is completed in provincial courts and 30 months in superior court. Anything longer violates the accused’s right to be tried within a reasonable time, unless the prosecution can show exceptional circumstances.

“It’s clear that in exceptional circumstances you can go beyond the Jordan timelines,” Eby said. “The question for everybody is how long is the exceptional circumstance in relation to COVID.”

He hopes the federal government can give the provinces a legislated COVID-19 period that is deemed to be an exceptional circumstance “so we don’t end up with different exceptional circumstances across Canada and different standards of access to justice for the accused.”

Eby is calling for mandatory arbitration of ICBC claims to deal with the backlog.

“There were already a significant number of people waiting a long period of time for their trials,” he said. “Now we’re looking at allowing plaintiffs to require ICBC to enter into a binding arbitration process so they can have their matter heard sooner and relieve pressure on the court.”

Another strategy would allow people to appear virtually in both traffic and family matters. This would free the court from restrictions on how many courtrooms and how much spacing is needed, he said.",[]

That’s been the automatic response in most of the world. It’s undeniably effective, and an overwhelmingly popular approach. So Finance Minister Carole James committed Tuesday to carrying on. But her fiscal update vividly illustrated what the government is up against.

article continues below

Her February budget was balanced, with a few hundred million in reserve.

The new estimate is a deficit this year of $12.5 billion, the biggest ever, and one that developed almost instantly.

That’s not a forecast. The situation is so wildly unpredictable they’ve give up doing forecasts. They’re just “scenarios” now. So it could go higher.

As James said: “That's why we've developed a scenario, rather than a typical forecast, because of the unprecedented nature of COVID-19 and the uncertainty regarding the magnitude of the economic decline caused by the pandemic.”

She’s acknowledged there will be deficits for at least the next three years. But it’s more likely to be a decade or more.

(Two years ago officials marked the elimination of just one component of B.C.’s debt, the operating debt stemming mostly from accumulated deficits. It took 40 years to accomplish that.)

The federal government did a similar update last week. Its projected deficit of $34 billion has jumped to $343 billion because of the pandemic.

So the on-going federal-provincial plan to keep helping people is based on borrowing more and more money to pay for it.

Rock-bottom interest rates will ease some concern about the hole they’re digging.

And there are projections that the economic collapse will only last for a year. So an optimistic outlook would be a one-year catastrophe followed by a bounce back in 2021, followed by years of whittling deficits back down to size.

Government finances obviously depend entirely on the private sector economy. James’ briefing included an exhaustive list of crises in different sectors.

Roughly half the new deficit is the new spending to help people cope ($5 billion in direct aid, $1.3 billion in deferred taxes and extensions). The other half arises from a collapse in government revenues.

There is a billion less in personal income tax, another billion less in corporate income tax and $1.3 billion less in sales tax, as examples. That’s all due to retail sales dropping 24 per cent, home sales down 45 per cent, 235,000 fewer jobs, corporate profits down 36 per cent and a seven to eight per cent drop in the provincial GDP, all in the last five months.

“No one has a playbook for dealing with this,” James said. So the plan they’ve fashioned is based on the fervent hope this is a one-year nightmare.

She has plans to announce a “recovery plan framework” in September, which would outline the expectations for how $1.5 billion in stimulus spending might be used.

But all the “scenarios” depend on the COVID-19 daily counts. Any sustained increases or outbreaks could delay recovery plans. That would make economic calamity even grimmer and more protracted than it already is.

Whatever the virus does in the next while, COVID-19 will be around for years as an economic factor.

Just So You Know: James spent 60 minutes detailing the extent of the economic catastrophe. She ran through 24 slides showing devastating impacts on every single aspect of the economy.

But the official news release covering her update was a study in deliriously-upbeat positivity. It was headed: “B.C.’s strong fiscal response, economic foundation support people.”

It rehashed all the previous good news announcements, ignored all the alarms and buried the stunning news there “could be” a $12.5 billion deficit.

It’s probably a firing offence for communications staff to write anything that leaves a negative impression in these sorts of releases.

But in a world where governments are spending more than ever, getting their own news out and covering themselves on all platforms as they see fit, the release is a reminder: It’s good to get an independent view.

Amendments to the Workers Compensation Act would increase the maximum insurable earnings to $100,000 from $87,100.

article continues below

The government says it is aiming for at least 90 per cent of workers to have 100 per cent of their earnings covered if they are can't work because of an injury suffered on the job.

The bill would also allow the safety agency to obtain search and seizure warrants when it investigates workplace safety infractions, if authorized by a court.

As well, it would allow victim impact statements to be heard in court in serious workplace prosecutions.

Labour Minister Harry Bains said the changes will help injured workers and their families, while also giving WorkSafeBC more tools to investigate workplace incidents.

""This bill makes modest but important improvements to several aspects of British Columbia's workers compensation system,"" Bains told the legislature.

The legislation would strengthen the way occupational diseases caused by viral pathogens are handled by fast-tracking the presumption for when a virus was contracted on the job, if established by WorkSafeBC's board of directors.

The government says this would mean people who are at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 at work are able to get benefits more quickly.

It would also expedite health care for a worker before a claim is accepted in cases when treatment would likely prevent a significant deterioration in health.

The government says in a statement that the legislation would allow WorkSafeBC to adjust a one-year time limit on mental health claims because it ""is not realistic for most workers, given the delay or gradual onset of some mental disorders.""

The amendments to the Workers Compensation Act were developed after three expert reviews, which included consultations with employer, labour and Indigenous organizations.

The government says it also considered systems that are in place elsewhere in Canada and took into account the possible effects of the changes on employer premium rates.

More than 100,000 new claims are made in B.C. every year due to workplace injuries or fatalities, the government says.

There were 140 workplace fatalities last year, with 84 of them caused by occupational disease, 40 by traumatic injury and 16 the result of a motor vehicle incident.

The province says WorkSafeBC conducted 141 investigations in 2019.

Exactly one week ago, on July 7, the province recorded 12 new cases. What followed was an uptick in recorded cases:

• 18 new cases on July 8;

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12; and

• 21 new cases on July 13.

""I know it was distressing to me to see 20, especially 25 [new cases] one day,"" Henry said. ""That's way above my comfort zone.""

She added, however, that the slight rise in cases was not unexpected, given that the province has been allowing restaurants and other indoor businesses to reopen.

""We do know where those cases are,"" she said. ""We're testing the people who need to be tested.""

It would be more concerning, she said, if the cases were spread out across the province in an unlinked way. The most recent cluster of cases is linked to the Krazy Cherry Fruit Company in Oliver, she announced yesterday (July 13).

Given B.C.'s population, 20 cases in one day is also better than some other jurisdictions, she said.

The province has identified 3,128 infections since the virus first appeared in the province in late January.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,015 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1649 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 212 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 52 people who reside outside Canada.

Of the 209 people currently fighting COVID-19 in B.C., 14 people are in hospital with five of those in intensive care units. That leaves 2,730 people who have recovered from the virus.

No new deaths from the virus were identified in the past 24 hours, leaving the death toll at 189 people.

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

So far 399 residents and 252 staff at seniors' care facilities have been infected by COVID-19 in B.C.

Health Minister Adrian Dix said that it is his understanding that the federal government and the U.S. government have agreed to extend the closure of the two countries' border for one additional month, until August 21.

""This is obviously positive and necessary news,"" he said. ""Everybody who lives in B.C. knows how inconvenient and how difficult that is for many businesses and many individuals for a variety of circumstances.""

She said B.C. had entered the pandemic perhaps better situated than other provinces, as it had a balanced budget, a triple AAA credit rating and one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country.

B.C. also managed to contain the pandemic and flatten its growth curve better than some other provinces, and it has been able to move earlier on a phased economic restart plan.

She said the province is expecting a loss of $4.2 billion in tax revenue, including $1 billion less in personal income tax revenue, $973 million less in corporate taxes, $1.3 billion in provincial sales tax revenue, $300 million in natural resource revenues and $882 million less in Crown Corporation income.

The province is also spending $5 billion in emergency spending, and has approved $1.3 billion in tax credits and deferrals. In total, the increased spending, lost tax revenue and foregone revenue will bring the deficit to $12.5 billion.

In February, James brought down, but never passed, a balanced budget and modest surplus of $227 million and provincial GDP growth projections of 2% in 2020.

""Mere weeks after the budget 2020 was tabled, our entire world changed,"" James said.

James said the B.C. economy is now expected to contract 6.8% in 2020, according to some forecasters.

Since February, B.C. lost 235,000 jobs, and saw retail sales declined by 23.6% in April compared to February. Overall, home prices dropped 4%.

Home sales declined 45.4% in May, compared to February, and B.C. merchandise exports are down 14.7% year-to-date, compared to January to May 2019.

""While the job losses in March and April were record-breaking, figures for May and June in fact have seen some recovery of the losses that we experienced in the previous two months,"" James said.

Asked if her government planned to resort to spending cuts to address the deficit, James said ""now is not the time to be able to cut back on services and support for people and business in British Columbia.""

As for any long-range plans for dealing with debt and deficits, James said: ""I do not believe that it's going to be a quick fix.""

Asked if the $5 billion that her government has already approved could be added to later this year, James said ""I believe the $5 billion is enough now.""

However, she added no one can predict what might happen should there be a second wave of COVID-19.

As for the $22 billion in capital spending allocated in the 2020 budget over three years for big capital works projects, like new schools, hospitals, bridges and roads, that will continue to be spent.

""This is going to serve us very well because it translates into huge investments,"" James said.

According to the survey released on Tuesday, 19.3 per cent of businesses could operate at their current level of sales and spending for less than six months but would have to take additional action if it lasts for a longer duration. Nearly 35 per cent of hotels and restaurants only have the runway for six more months of lockdown measures, says the survey conducted May 29 to July 3.

The results come as many businesses are looking at government programs or credit to remain afloat.

Almost 64 per cent of survey respondents said they were approved for outside credit or government funding programs such as Canada Emergency Business Account loans or wage subsidies. Less than 24 per cent of businesses said in the survey that their rent or mortgage payments were deferred during the pandemic.

While working from home has increased during the pandemic, only about a quarter of survey respondents indicated they would likely offer teleworking as an option going forward after COVID-19 spread is contained.

The version released on Tuesday was a follow-up to a crowd-sourced questionnaire on the Statistics Canada website, a collaboration launched in April, with the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, that surveyed 12,600 businesses. The sample was not designed to reflect the overall Canadian economy.

The Canada-U.S. border has been closed to ""discretionary"" travel like vacations and shopping trips since the pandemic took hold of the continent in mid-March, a rolling 30-day agreement that's currently set to expire July 21.

article continues below

Officials on both sides of the border who are familiar with the ongoing talks, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss matters not yet public, say another extension until late August is all but inevitable, thanks to a towering wave of new COVID-19 cases that's swamping efforts to restore a modicum of normality in the U.S.

New York Rep. Brian Higgins, one of several members of Congress from northern states keen to see a plan for reopening the border, expressed dismay Tuesday at news he called disappointing but hardly surprising.

""With no leadership from President Trump to address the pandemic, cases in the United States are spiking and as a result U.S. citizens are not welcome in several countries around the globe, including many of our allies,"" Higgins, a Democrat, said in a statement.

Recent calls from Higgins and others for a plan to start easing border restrictions have been greeted with social-media scorn and derision in Canada, where recent polls make clear the idea of allowing entry to Americans any time soon is a non-starter.

The novel coronavirus has been particularly resurgent in southern states like Florida, Texas, Georgia and Louisiana, where businesses tried to reopen early, contrary to the advice of public health officials, and the wearing of face masks became a partisan issue.

""The U.S. and Canada should be developing a plan that lays out what continued, nuanced management of the border during a prolonged pandemic will look like,"" Higgins said.

""But the administration's failure to develop a national plan for widespread testing, (personal protective equipment) distribution and the rejection of social distancing and mask-wearing to slow the spread doesn't inspire confidence that such a plan is in the works.""

Wearing a mask, perhaps the simplest way to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus, has evolved into one of the most complex and flummoxing points of division in the U.S., thanks in part to conflicting signals early in the crisis about its effectiveness and the obvious reluctance of the commander-in-chief to embrace the idea.

It was only just this past weekend — nearly four months into the crisis — that Trump himself was photographed wearing one in public, during a visit with wounded service members at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.

Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, urged Americans to mask up Monday, saying facial coverings for everyone in the country would break the pandemic's back in less than two months.

""It's our major defence to prevent ourselves from getting this infection,"" Redfield told a news conference in Charlotte, N.C. ""If all of us would put on a face covering now for the next four weeks, six weeks, I think we could drive this epidemic into the ground.""

Paradoxically, new online polling from Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies suggests the idea of mandatory masking in public is more popular in the U.S. than it is in Canada.

Leger's latest online poll, conducted July 10 to 12, found 72 per cent of 1,001 American respondents supported the idea of mandatory masks indoors, compared with 67 per cent of the survey's 1,523 Canadian participants. Of those surveyed in the U.S., 41 per cent said they would consider it a violation of their personal freedoms, compared with 27 per cent of those in Canada.

""Americans are far more likely to agree that rights are at issue,"" said ACS president Jack Jedwab. ""Yet, despite the fact that Americans strongly agree that the mask requirement is a rights infringement, they nonetheless believe that mask wearing should be mandatory.""

Trump appears to be capitulating on other border issues as well: on Tuesday, facing a lawsuit from Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the administration abandoned a controversial measure that would have forced international students whose courses move entirely online to either transfer schools or leave the country.

That news likely comes as a relief to untold thousands of Canadian students studying south of the border, many of whom have been forced into virtual classrooms with colleges and universities having cancelled in-person classes.

Dr. Howard Njoo, Canada's deputy chief public health officer, was reluctant Tuesday to discuss the worsening COVID-19 situation in the U.S. in any detail.

But he said cross-border travel in a public health emergency is usually a matter of ensuring that both countries have a similar grip on the circumstances, taking into account factors like their respective health-care systems, testing and contact-tracing regimes and strategies for preventing transmission.

Given that a number of U.S. states are experiencing community transmission of COVID-19 and don't have the situation under control, it will likely be weeks or even months before the benefits of additional preventative steps become apparent.

""It will take some time,"" Njoo said. ""If I were to travel anywhere, I would stick to Canada for the time being.""

Bruce Clark, president and CEO of the biopharmaceutical company Medicago, cautions observers against holding unrealistic assumptions that his product — or any of the numerous vaccine hopefuls in development globally — can bring the pandemic to a screeching halt if proven viable.

article continues below

Clark notes more than 120 companies are trying to come up with a COVID-19 vaccine, many of which have never been in the vaccine space before.

He doesn't doubt that ""something's going to come out of this,"" but he questions how effective it may be.

""Whatever vaccine we get in this first round — unless it's a miracle — it's not going to be perfect,"" says Clark, whose company began trials for its proposed vaccine Monday in Quebec City.

""It's going to have to undergo development, it's going to take probably years to come up with an understanding of the right vaccine, the right approach. It's not the panacea.

""To assume that we can have, in 18 months, the solution to a pandemic that comes around once in a generation, is naive.""

Canada's deputy public health officer Dr. Howard Njoo expressed similar cautions Tuesday, while acknowledging the need to develop viable vaccines and therapies.

""Lots of different steps are still ahead of us before we might even anticipate that there might be a safe, effective vaccine that would be available for use in the general population,"" said Njoo.

So much is still unknown about COVID-19, notes Clark, including how it may manifest during the flu season later this year.

He suspects a more likely scenario is that a vaccine will offer only part of the solution, along with new therapeutics and ongoing public health interventions.

Medicago's first phase of clinical trials will test the safety of a plant-based product on 180 healthy men and women, aged 18 to 55.

The randomized, partially blinded study uses technology that does not involve animal products or live viruses like traditional methods.

Clark notes that vaccine developers typically use chicken eggs to propagate a virus, but Medicago uses recombinant technology involving the genetic sequence of a virus, with living plants as the host.

The resulting virus-like particles mimic the shape and dimensions of a virus, which allows the body to recognize them and spark an immune response.

Clark says the plant-based approach is significantly faster and offers more consistent results than egg-based or cell-based methods.

It's the same method Medicago has used for a proposed seasonal flu vaccine that Clark says is currently being reviewed by Health Canada. If approved, Clark says it would be the first plant-based vaccine in the world.

While it takes five to six months to propagate a virus in eggs, the plant-based technique requires just five to six weeks, he says.

""In a pandemic, something like COVID, if you're able to cut that much time off development, you have a substantial impact on public health.""

Meanwhile, Clark says viruses are prone to mutations as they adapt and grow in an egg, which could result in a vaccine that doesn't exactly match the circulating virus. In contrast, ""a plant is a plant,"" and that makes production easily scalable.

""One plant behaves like 100,000 plants,"" he says.

The trial will evaluate three different dosages alone, or with one of two adjuvants provided by GlaxoSmithKline and Dynavax. An adjuvant can boost the effectiveness of a vaccine for a better immunological response, thereby reducing the required dose, Clark adds.

He hopes to know the safety of the product, as well as effectiveness of the adjuvants and dosing by October. Based on that, researchers would kick off a second, more targeted trial phase involving about 1,000 participants.

If that's successful, Clark says a third phase would involve about 15,000 to 20,000 subjects, include older cohorts, and may be a global study, depending on circumstances of the pandemic by then.

If the vaccine proves effective, Clark points to another uncertainty.

Because the company's commercial plant is across the border in Durham, N.C., he says there's no guarantee of a Canadian supply.

""'Guarantee' is a strong word,"" says Clark. ""Strange things happen to borders in the context of a pandemic.""

Such border complications were made clear to Canadians in April when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau complained about problems with incomplete or non-existent deliveries of critical COVID-19 supplies. At the time, U.S. President Donald Trump ordered U.S. producers to prioritize the domestic market.

Clark suggests similar hurdles could impact vaccine distribution, putting immediate pressure on Medicago to complete construction of a large-scale manufacturing facility in its home base of Quebec City.

""Certainly, we need a facility in Canada,"" Clark says.

""There's no guarantee on the easy flow of materials back and forth across the border should we have a successful vaccine. We have to keep the focus on completing the Canadian facility so that we have domestic capacity. I think this is what most countries are concerned about.""

By the end of 2023, the Quebec City plant is expected to be able to produce up to one billion doses of a COVID-19 vaccine annually.

Until then, Medicago says it expects to be able to make approximately 100 million doses by the end of 2021, assuming its trials are successful.

Clark says countries must temper any nationalist agendas that might emerge with a viable vaccine and acknowledge that the fight against COVID-19 is global.

Meeting that demand would require multiple manufacturers, multiple distribution routes, and lots of co-operation, he says, possibly through the World Health Organization.

""There has to be some ability to share those around and distribute, whether that's through an entity like the WHO, or something equivalent.""

The Liberals last week revealed this year's projected deficit sits at $343 billion, driven by an estimated $231.9 billion in COVID-19 spending, so far, and a massive drop in government revenue.

article continues below

With the deficit at levels not seen since the Second World War, Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies asked 1,523 Canadians whether they felt the government ought to immediately and quickly begin to scale back pandemic support programs to Canadians and to business.

Forty-one per cent said yes to that question, 44 per cent said no and 15 per cent said they didn't know or preferred not to answer.

The survey was conducted between July 10 and 12, just after the Liberals released their projections.

It cannot be assigned a margin of error because online polls are not considered truly random.

This week, the Liberal government announced that one of the biggest benefit programs — a federal wage subsidy — will be extended until the end of this year.

It covers 75 per cent of wages, up to a weekly maximum of $847, for eligible companies and non-profits that have lost at least 30 per cent of their revenues.

""Over the last three months you have seen me come out to talk with Canadians about what we're doing to help you and your family, your employer, your local businesses deal with this pandemic,"" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Monday in announcing the extension.

""We're going to continue to do that vital work.""

As of July 6, the wage subsidy had paid out $18.01 billion to 252,370 companies. Last week's fiscal and economic update from the Liberals increased the overall budget to $82.3 billion.

The other marquee support program, the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit, is set to expire in the fall.

The $500-a-week benefit had, as of July 5, paid out almost $54.8 billion to 8.25 million people.

Of those surveyed, 78 per cent said they were worried about the size of the deficit and how it may affect things in Canada in the long term.

In releasing the deficit projections, the Liberals didn't set out a plan for how or when they might get the books back to balance.

The survey asked respondents which of two routes traditionally use to cut deficits they would support.

In the survey, 60 per cent said the government ought to focus on cutting government spending, while 21 per cent said the focus should be on raising taxes.

Finance Minister Carole James said the numbers are staggering with job losses of 235,000 since February and a predicted GDP decline of 6.8 per cent by the end of this year.

article continues below

“We were preparing for economic moderation, we were well-equipped to be able to weather the challenges,” James said at a news conference Tuesday.

“What came next was unprecedented. Mere weeks after Budget 2020 was tabled, our entire world changed.”

The government has provided $6.26 billion in financial aid to businesses and individuals. Among the losses it anticipates this fiscal year because of the pandemic are close to $1 billion in personal income tax, $973 million in corporate income tax and $1.3 billion in provincial sales tax, James said.

The projected GDP decline in 2020 would be the worst on record going back to the 1980s, although it is also projected to increase by 3.1 per cent in 2021.

James said for context, B.C.’s real GDP has only declined twice in the past 40 years, falling by 2.4 per cent in 2009 and 6.4 per cent in 1982.

“As those numbers remind us, this could be the worst downturn experienced in our province recent history,” she said.

B.C.’s restart plan is showing signs of hope for the economy as consumer confidence increases, she said. The unemployment rate is slowly rebounding and fewer wildfires and floods have helped the bottom line.

However, she warned that the province’s financial forecast could change depending on many risk factors, including the possibility of a second wave of infections, the possibility of a vaccine, as well as the success of relief measures and central bank policy.

Regardless of how B.C. copes with the pandemic, James said its economy is also subject to the economic health of other jurisdictions, particularly those that buy from the province.

James said it wouldn’t help the economic recovery to pull back on spending, but the government will review every cent spent as it heads into the next budget year.

The B.C. government has tabled legislation giving itself room for three years of deficits, which James said will be re-examined each year.

James said she believes people care about provincial deficits because they understand it’s taxpayer money, but they also understand the emergency the pandemic created.

She declined to predict how long the recovery would take, given the many moving pieces at play.

“There is no question that COVID-19 has had a profound impact on the economy of British Columbia and that’s not short term,” she said.

The job losses have been widespread but some have been disproportionately affected, depending on a worker’s age, gender or which sector they work in, James said.

Young workers are among the hardest hit, with the unemployment rate rising sharply from 9.1 per cent in February to 29.1 per cent in June for those aged 15 to 24.

Women, who dominate the service industries and many of whom have also left jobs to care for family members, are another group more affected. Their unemployment rate rose from 4.8 per cent in February to 13.4 per cent in June.

The hardest hit industries include wholesale and retail, accommodation and food services, construction, culture and recreation.

The overall unemployment rate of 13 per cent remains at its highest level since 1987. While the job losses in March and April were record breaking, the figures for May and June have seen modest recovery as the economy started to reopen.

“The projected numbers are staggering but they’re not without hope. Things are getting better each and every day when we follow the provincial health officer’s advice,” James said.

The NDP government’s fiscal update was met with calls for an economic recovery plan by its political opponents, with the Opposition B.C. Liberals asking what happens when federal benefits like the Canada Emergency Response Benefit run out.

Liberal Leader Andrew Wilkinson also suggested the government should reconsider its pre-pandemic spending priorities.

“People in every corner of B.C. have had to adjust to a new normal and adapt their household budgets, so why is this government pretending it’s business as usual?” he asked in a statement.

The Green party said the province should transition to a green economy by helping traditional industries become more sustainable, spending on training and building local businesses into the supply chain.

“We can seize the once in a generation opportunity to strategically drive stimulus spending towards a future British Columbians want: an innovative, low-carbon, sustainable, just and inclusive economy for all,” interim leader Adam Olsen said.

The agency previously reported that year-over-year inflation declined by 0.2 per cent in April, then took a further drop of 0.4 per cent in May as lockdowns put a damper on consumer spending.

article continues below

But a look under the headline figures showed consumers were spending more on items that don't weigh as much in the consumer price index, which tracks inflation. And they were spending less on things that weigh more in the calculation.

In a numbers experiment to better reflect pandemic spending, Statistics Canada found the annualized inflation figures for April and May would have been 0.0 and -0.1 per cent.

The research paper made public Monday says a specific consumption pattern, such as that happening during the pandemic, would need ""to be sustained in order to have a subsequent impact"" on year-over-year headline numbers.

The research was aided by data from the Bank of Canada, which targets an annual inflation rate of two per cent as measured by Statistics Canada's consumer price index.

The bank has warned that the economic shock wrought by COVID-19 and structurally low interest rates is having a deep effect on the inflation rate, which is far below the target.

The basket of goods used to form the consumer price index has been shaken by a shift in consumer spending habits during the pandemic.

People are buying less gasoline, which usually receives a heavier weight in calculating inflation, as its price has plunged and the frequency of car travel has dropped. Canadians are travelling much less, while grocery-buying is up.

Statistics Canada is to report June's inflation rate next week.

The Bank of Canada said in April that it expected inflation to be close to zero in the second quarter.

Beyond the end of June, the bank was less clear, citing the high level of uncertainty around the course of the pandemic.

The federal government's economic ""snapshot"" last week pegged inflation at 0.5 per cent for this year, then rising back to two per cent in 2021.

The reading was based on the average of forecasts from 13 private sector economists.

On Wednesday, the central bank will release its updated outlook. Governor Tiff Macklem has described what's coming as a ""central planning scenario"" for the economy and inflation, as well as related risks — such as local, but not national, lockdowns.

Indigenous communities closed during pandemic but at economic cost,['Nick Wells'],,"Indigenous bands along the west coast of British Columbia say their borders will remain closed to tourists and non-residents, despite the economic impact, as they work to raise awareness about the threat COVID-19 poses to their communities.

The Nuu-chah-nulth, the Heiltsuk Nation and the Haida Nation have all closed or restricted access to their territories and reserves.

""Of course it's negatively impacting. But our directors have said, our chiefs have said, people before economics,"" said Judith Sayers, the president of the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council, in an interview. ""I think everyone is slowly realizing the impact economically, but right now we just really feel that we want to protect the members first.""

Members of the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council, made up of 14 First Nations along the west coast of Vancouver Island, have deployed a variety of tactics to help ensure their borders are kept sealed from non-residents.

Members of the Ahousaht First Nation, who live in the remote area of Flores Island, have deputized citizens to act as peacekeeping officers, Sayers said.

The Ahousaht issued a notice on July 2 that their territory, which covers a large area of land and water north of Tofino, including provincial parks, will remain closed to tourists and non-residents as there ""is still no vaccine, no anti-serum and no cure for COVID-19.""

Others, like the Tla-o-qui-aht in Tofino, had been stopping cars in an effort to convince them to turn around.

While Tofino is now welcoming back visitors, the Tla-o-qui-aht communities of Ty-Histanis, Esowista and Opitsaht remain closed to those who haven't been invited. The closure includes part of Long Beach in Pacific Rim National Park.

The concern, Sayers says, lies in the ability to test and contain any potential COVID-19 outbreak.

""A lot of our communities are remote and testing is not easily available,"" she said. ""If you're in Port Alberni, or Nanaimo, or Victoria, or somewhere (else), you can get testing and get results in 24 hours. It's not the same with our communities.""

The closures have resulted in disputes between Indigenous groups and local businesses.

The Haida Nation in Haida Gwaii have turned away non-residents at the ferry terminal, discouraged leisure travel and called on two local fishing lodges to rethink their reopening plans.

""We're such a close-knit community, I think that once we get a case of COVID, I think that it'll spread like wildfire,"" said Duffy Edgars, the chief councillor of the Old Massett Village council in Haida Gwaii.

Edgars said many local fishing lodges are respecting the Haida Nation's state of emergency, but is frustrated by others who want to open up.

""It's disrespectful,"" he said. ""These bigger (lodges) are coming in and just doing whatever they want.""

The fishing lodges that have opened say visitors and staff will not have contact with the Haida Gwaii communities, and they have emergence evacuation plans in place if a COVID-19 case were to develop.

Leaders and representatives from the Nuu-chah-nulth, Heiltsuk and Haida all say they would like to see more co-operation from the provincial government in working with Indigenous communities.

""It's really frustrating,"" said Marilyn Slett, the chief councillor of the Heiltsuk. ""We have a limited amount of time here, we think, before that anticipated second or third wave so right now is the time for us to be sitting down and having those discussions so going forward we're all working collaboratively together.""

Part of the issue, she says, lies in B.C. politicians encouraging residents to take part in inter-provincial tourism.

""We're seeing a lot more vessel traffic on the coast, we're seeing a lot more recreational boaters, and that's a really high concern for our community,"" said Slett.

The closures — many of which began in March — have been felt at a variety of levels.

The pandemic forced the cancellation of the Heiltsuk's Spawn-on-Kelp fishery this year, an event Slett says employs 700 people and is a hugely important economic driver for the community.

""Certainly our community put forward the health and safety before the economic driver,"" she said. ""So our community has been hit hard.""

Sayers says when the pandemic first broke out and restrictions were placed on communities, First Nations were bringing in food for members so they didn't have to leave their reserves and face possible exposure at grocery stores.

The Heiltsuk, Nuu-chah-Nulth and the Tsilhqot'in issued a statement in late June, criticizing the provincial government's reopening plan and what they saw as a lack of dialogue with First Nations groups.

All three want the province to commit to four conditions, which would allow border restrictions being lifted: COVID-19 information sharing, screening, rapid testing and culturally safe contact tracing teams.

Until those are met, Slett says, she can't see Indigenous communities fully opening their borders.

But the provincial government says it is committed to working with Indigenous communities.

""Many tourist-depending communities are now safely welcoming the gradual return of out-of-town visitors,"" said Sarah Plank, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation. ""At the same time, we acknowledge some smaller and more remote communities and First Nations continue to be concerned about visitors to their communities.""

The government is also working on scheduling a meeting with the Nuu-chah-nulth, Tsilquot'in, Heiltsuk and Haida Nations and other communities, she added.

Why it matters: The program brings cost relief to businesses hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, and is intended to support employment.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologized on Monday for not recusing himself from discussions about the administration of Ottawa's $900 million student volunteer program.

WE Charity was initially selected to deliver the initiative under a nearly $20 million contract. Trudeau said he was aware of his family's ties to the organization, but unaware of the honorariums his mother and brother received for their involvement.

""It is not a surprise to me that they got paid by WE, but I did not know that they got paid by WE,"" Trudeau said.

""In this situation, I should have recused myself,"" he added, acknowledging that his involvement in Ottawa's student volunteer program has created controversy. Members of the Conservative Party of Canada have called on Trudeau to address his involvement before Ottawa's ethics committee.

""I get that. I made a mistake in not recusing myself immediately from the discussion.""

Trudeau said he will evaluate any requests to address the issue before parliament. He also said that, because of his involvement, the rollout of the student volunteer program has been a bit delayed – an outcome he deeply regrets.

In addition to addressing the issue, Trudeau said on Monday that the federal government will extend its wage subsidy program until the end of the year. More information on the extension is expected this week.

The prime minister also said he spoke with U.S. president Donald Trump earlier in the day about the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement – which took effect July 1, – Black Lives Matter, China, the two Canadians who remain detained in China and U.S. aluminum tariffs.

""I highlighted to the president that the pandemic has disrupted usual manufacturing processes and supply chains,"" said Trudeau. ""It would be a shame to see tariffs come in between our two countries at a time when we're celebrating the new NAFTA.""

Trudeau briefly told reporters to expect a joint announcement regarding the closure of the Canada-U.S. border.

Non-essential travel across the border is banned until late July.

But the government is being warned it may have to move the end date into 2021.

article continues below

The program is the heart of the Liberals' promise to help Canadians get back to work, even if has to be at a slower pace, as the pandemic wanes.

Speaking outside his Ottawa residence, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the extension to give ""greater certainty and support to businesses as we restart the economy.""

Trudeau didn't say how the government will reshape the eligibility rules for the program that critics have said stop some employers from getting aid they need.

He promised more details in the coming days.

While some companies are back open with restrictions easing, other parts of the economy are still reeling from the effects of COVID-19.

Some sectors will only start up in the fall or even the winter and will need help into next year, said Ross Laver, senior vice-president for strategy at the Business Council of Canada. He pointed to airlines as one example where rehiring may be slow.

""I don't think anybody expects that those industries that have been really hard-hit, that everything is going to be fine by Dec. 31,"" he said.

""We need to bear in mind that some of them are going to need help for an extended period of time.""

The wage subsidy previously was to expire the first week of June but the Liberals announced an extension to the end of August in mid-May.

The government has yet to share eligibility requirements for July.

Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said the extension would be welcomed by many small companies that have seen costs return faster than revenues.

He also pressed the need for eligibility rules to understand how to qualify.

""Not a single employer in Canada understands whether they qualify for the July wage subsidy and we're in mid-July. So they need to do an awful lot better,"" Kelly said.

""It sounds great to have an announcement to extend the subsidy, but businesses in order to use it really need to understand whether they would qualify and what the rules of the game are.""

The program covers 75 per cent of wages, up to a weekly maximum of $847, for eligible companies and non-profits. Companies must show a 30-per-cent drop in revenues, a cliff that may discourage companies from growing, lest they find themselves suddenly cut off from federal aid.

""You don't want people to think that you get over the threshold and then automatically lose"" the subsidy, said Hassan Yussuff, president of the Canadian Labour Congress.

Yussuff also said the extension would bring some stability to reopening phases, and likely bolster job gains seen over May and June.

Last week, Finance Minister Bill Morneau hinted at changes to revenue-reduction thresholds when he spoke about reducing ""disincentives to growth"" in the program.

Kelly said the government could consider a graduated approach with smaller subsidies at lower levels of revenue loss, or dropping the requirement altogether, either of which would give employers the confidence to rehire faster, Kelly said.

The Liberals originally saw the wage subsidy as the key tool in helping cushion the economic blow from COVID-19 by helping workers stay tied to their employers so businesses could get back to normal quickly once lockdowns lifted.

The pace of spending on the program has been below expectations, with $18 billion paid to 252,370 companies as of July 6.

Instead, the budget for the program dropped as more workers accessed the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) for people who lost their jobs or nearly all their hours.

The $500-a-week benefit had, as of July 5, paid out almost $54.8 billion to 8.25 million people.

The budget for that program is now at $80 billion, but it's scheduled to end in the fall. Yussuff said the government needs to soon release details on how workers without jobs will transition to the employment insurance system, which was largely supplanted by the CERB.

The government's fiscal and economic ""snapshot"" last week boosted the cost of the wage subsidy program to $82.3 billion from $45 billion, in a sign of impending changes.

Perrin Beatty, president of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, said changes to the wage subsidy ""must encourage Canadians to transition"" off the CERB, and ""create a positive incentive to return to work.""

The July 8 fiscal update noted that small employers make up the largest share of approved wage subsidy applications, with the largest numbers of employees covered in manufacturing, accommodation and food services.

The ""snapshot"" also said men may be ""slightly more likely"" to be covered than women although there aren't firm numbers to rely on.

Adrian Dix said during a news conference Monday that warnings of possible exposures at a restaurant, spin studio, bed and breakfast and resort are believed to stem from ""private parties"" at the hotels.

Eight positive tests for the disease are linked to visits to downtown Kelowna and the city's waterfront between June 25 and July 9, said an email from Interior Health, the regional health authority.

""When people come together for private parties — in this case it was primarily people in their 20s and 30s — the risks are considerably higher,"" Dix said.

The exposures follow the move to a new phase of reopening in B.C. that allows for tourism within the province. Although the accommodation industry was not ordered to close during the pandemic, many operators did so voluntarily but began welcoming guests again as part of the new phase.

Infections in B.C. inched up on Monday as health officials announced 62 new cases since Friday.

Two more people also died for a total of 189 deaths in B.C.

The new figures bring the total number of confirmed cases in the province to 3,115, while 2,718 people have fully recovered from COVID-19.

Interior Health also issued an isolation order for Krazy Cherry Fruit Co. in Oliver after two positive tests associated with the farm. Public health officials are monitoring the situation and placed restrictions on those living and working on the farm, the government said in a news release.

The cases linked to Kelowna involved people who live in three regions of the province, including the Interior, Fraser and Vancouver Coastal Health regions, said Dix. He credited contact tracers with making the connections.

He said the tourism industry has done a good job of creating safe environments for guests, but it's also up to guests to ensure they respect physical distancing guidelines and group size limitations.

""Whether it's a trip or a party at home, the same risks and the same rules apply,"" Dix said.

If you're gathering with friends and family, you should consider the increased risk that indoor locations pose and determine how many people can maintain a safe distance accordingly, he said.

""We have got to live with COVID-19 for the next year so that means the responsibility is on all of us to understand the risks and understand our responsibilities to one another.""

Interior Health issued an exposure advisory for the resort and bed and breakfast on Friday and added the restaurant and spin studio in a statement on Sunday.

Visitors to the Boyce Gyro Beach Lodge on July 1 or the Discovery Bay Resort from July 1 to July 5 were advised to self-isolate and monitor themselves closely for symptoms.

The health authority is now urging visitors to Kelowna's Cactus Club restaurant on Water Street between July 3 and July 6, or the Pace Spin Studio on July 2, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9 to self-monitor and get tested if COVID-19 symptoms appear.

The B.C. Centre for Disease Control also warns that a case or cases were confirmed on an Air Canada flight from Kelowna to Vancouver on July 6, but Dix could not say if that warning was linked.

Public health contact tracing is underway and the health authority said it's reaching out directly to anyone who has been exposed, where possible.

Testing is recommended for anyone with novel coronavirus symptoms, including fever, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, or a loss of taste or smell, said Interior Health.

""Milder symptoms may include runny nose, fatigue, body aches ... diarrhea, headache, sore throat, vomiting and red eyes,"" it said in a statement.

Anyone with even mild symptoms is urged to stay home and avoid travel.

Efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19 include physical distancing, regular hand washing, not touching the face and avoiding gatherings of more than 50 people, the health authority said.

Powell River-Sunshine Coast MLA Nicholas Simons has been adapting to new ways of carrying out democracy, mandated by regulations required to cope with the pandemic.

article continues below

Simons said he is going to be attending the legislature next week for the first time in what is being called a hybrid session. He said this means some people are in Victoria and others are functioning in their communities via videoconferencing.

“It’s very busy and there are a lot of issues that are related directly to the pandemic that I assist with when I can,” said Simons. “There continue to be issues for me relative to other sectors, including, of course, ferries, forestry and other ongoing interests.”

Simons said up until now, every day the legislature sits, he has been going onto Zoom and participating in the debate. He said if he is rostered to be doing his chamber duty in the legislature, such as next week, he simply attends in Victoria, where the number of MLAs has been substantially reduced due to physical distancing and maximum assembly numbers.

He said one significant change in legislative business has been the voting schedule. Rather than votes taking place during the day, they all get lined up and voted on at the end of the day, negating the need for everyone to be at their computer constantly from 10 am to 6:30 pm. The system, for the most part, has been working well, although there is the occasional glitch, said Simons.

There was one situation where the MLA who was voting remotely could not be heard, and so the clerk at the table phoned the member and got confirmation regarding the member’s vote.

Simons said those running and coordinating the hybrid system have done an “amazing job.” There are four screens in the legislative chamber and those in that setting can see members participating from their constituencies.

Simons said this is the first time a hybrid form of parliament has been conducted, so once again, BC is leading the way.

He said Question Period has taken on a new dimension because the chamber is not packed with close-together bodies “stuffed like sardines.” He said the opposition still has the opportunity to ask questions and the government has the chance to explain its actions on issues.

“It’s important for democracy,” said Simons.

When asked if British Columbians were being well served by the new system, Simons said: “I hope so. We’re making every effort to adjust the needs of our communities. There are challenges that everybody is facing.

“What we have to continue to do is figure out how government can best help our communities, our businesses, our industries and get to the challenges that are lying before us.”

Simons said with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the incredible focus by health minister Adrian Dix, and his dedication to the issue, has served the province well. He added that Dr. Bonnie Henry, as provincial health officer, has all of the necessary abilities to give confidence to the public.

“In this kind of situation, when you have dedicated people, incredible changes have been made to our health system,” said Simons. “We were prepared for the worst and we managed to relay good medical advice and the vast majority of people adhered to the recommendations and continue to do so.

“The message is as important today as it has always been. I’m completely confident that our government and our health officer have done their absolute best and the statistics indicate that we have been an outlier in our success.”

The new normal in the legislature has no horizon. Simons said the impact of COVID-19 will be present for a while.

“We are doing what we need to do,” he added, “and everybody recognizes that British Columbia can continue to stay strong.”",[]

The province said in a document released in late April that Stage 3 would include ""opening all workplaces responsibly"" and ""further relaxing the restrictions on public gatherings.""

The document didn't get into specifics, though it did say restrictions would remain on large gatherings such as concerts and sporting events.

Meanwhile, health officials in Quebec, the epicentre of the pandemic in Canada, are concerned about a spike in COVID-19 cases in Montreal linked to the reopening of the city's bars.

Over the weekend Montreal's public health authority urged patrons and employees who have frequented bars since Canada Day to get tested for the coronavirus.

Quebec reported 114 new COVID-19 infections Sunday, boosting its total to 56,521 cases.

The province is to introduce mandatory masks on public transit starting today, with a two-week grace period before users will be denied service as of July 27.

Montreal has also indicated that it intends to bring in mandatory masks for enclosed public spaces as of that date.

On the East Coast, Prince Edward Island is reporting another new case of COVID-19 — a woman in her 80s from Queens County tested positive and is self-isolating at home.

P.E.I. has reported four new cases of the infection since July 4 after being COVID-free during the months of May and June.

""I can't say no to a good time,"" said Edmonton Oilers fan Jeet Jermana. ""I'd be hard-pressed not to jump into a big party.""

article continues below

On Friday, the NHL board of governors and NHL Players' Association said they had ratified the return-to-play plan, paving the way for the league to resume its pandemic-hit season later this summer.

Toronto and Edmonton were also officially unveiled as hub cities where all games will be played, beginning Aug. 1. Training camps start Monday in the 24 cities with teams still in the running for the Stanley Cup, including six in Canada.

In 2017, when the Oilers nearly advanced to the Western Conference final, Jermana was among the thousands of fans who partied in Ford Hall at Rogers Place arena and in bars along the popular Whyte Avenue district.

But with COVID-19 this year, where teams will play in empty arenas, Jermana said he'll likely watch more games at home, maybe with just a few friends.

That is, he said, until the Oilers advance and he and other fans won't be able to resist going out.

""Once it becomes the 'real playoffs' I think more and more the momentum will grab,"" he said.

Matt Black of Hotel X Toronto, located west of the city centre where multiple media outlets have reported that several teams will be based, said the prospect of any accommodation for celebratory fan gatherings, even outdoors, seems unlikely.

Nevertheless, Black said he expects citywide excitement will be palpable, even with empty arenas.

""You look back to those scenes of Jurassic Park and Maple Leaf Square and all of that ... it would be great for people to be able to get together again but you just need to make sure that you're doing it in a safe manner,"" said Black.

The players themselves aren't to have any contact with the general public.

Dr. Vinita Dubey, Toronto's associate medical health officer, said in an emailed statement that players and staff arriving from abroad will also have to serve a modified 14-day quarantine as well as undergo rigorous screening and daily testing protocols, wear masks in indoor settings, physically distance and wash hands often.

An Edmonton police spokesperson said the service wouldn't be able to comment over the weekend on what sorts of preparations they might make for crowds when the season resumes.

Geoff Grimble with the City of Edmonton said the city's civic events management team would likely discuss the issue during a scheduled meeting on Monday.

""The City of Edmonton's first priority is public safety and we'll continue to follow the advice and requirements of the Chief Medical Officer of Health to ensure fans, players, coaches and staff remain healthy,"" Grimble said.

Oilers fan Brendan McLeod admitted he may be lured to a street celebration when — not if — his team advances, but said he still wants to maintain physical distancing.

""We have to get through this together or else it's not going to change,"" said McLeod.

But Shadi Merhej, who said he enjoys both hockey and the Oilers, noted the sport doesn't have quite as strong attraction for him in the summer.

""It's daylight 'til 11 o'clock. You don't want to spend half your day watching hockey,"" Merhej explained.

""I'd rather go for a bike ride, or rollerblade or golf.""

Shaw told reporters on a Zoom conference call that he was ""a little tone deaf"" with the tweets last Friday that were ""out of frustration"" and that he took responsibility for them and didn't want them to become a distraction.

""I apologize for that, at no point was I saying I was going to break the rules or we're going to break the rules,"" Shaw said. ""We know as a team that's not an option and to get through this season, everybody is going to have to buy in and everybody is going to have to adhere to whatever protocols we're set under.""

He noted if other teams don't follow public-health guidelines, the season may be derailed in any case.

Shaw had raised concerns about the length of time players may need to stay in their current environment. He replied to a tweet from TSN reporter Scott Mitchell, who reported that multiple sources told him players could face a $750,000 fine and potential jail time if seen outside the ballpark — which also are the same maximum punishments in the Quarantine Act.

""We were told two weeks... not all summer... all summer is a bit much,"" Shaw tweeted.

In an email reply, the club said arriving in Toronto, players understood the maximum penalties for leaving the Rogers Centre footprint during camp.

""The rules have kind of changed a little bit from when we first got up here, it was the first I was hearing about that we could be possibly be in here all summer,"" Shaw said, adding he should've chosen his words differently.

He explained he'd rented a place one block from the Rogers Centre and had looked forward to taking walks by the water to get away from the game. Living in a hotel was not an ideal situation, he said.

Shaw said Blue Jays management — president Mark Shapiro and general manager Ross Atkins — spoke to players on Saturday about the situation.

""I was a little bit tone-deaf to the situation, I should have said what I said, should have worded it a little bit differently,"" Shaw said. ""I apologize for that, take full responsibility.""

The Blue Jays are training in Toronto while figuring out where to play this coming season as the shortened 60-game schedule starts in less than two weeks.

Ottawa has given the ball club the green light to hold training camp in Toronto, but hasn't made a call on games. No fans will be in the stands.

The Buffalo News reported over the weekend the club had checked in with that city about playing in that city, usually the home of the their triple-A club. Blue Jays officials have said Dunedin, Fla., the club's spring-training facility, is the most likely venue for home games if the team can't play in Toronto.

For his part, Shaw said he and his teammates are hopeful Toronto is the club's home this season.

He noted that weather and the COVID situation in Florida means that Dunedin would put the Blue Jays at a competitive disadvantage.

The Blue Jays are slated to open the season July 24 at Tampa Bay. The home opener is July 29 against the Washington Nationals.

Shaw said he doesn't foresee opting out of the 2020 season, given he was looking to this year as a bounce-back season on a one-year contract after an admittedly poor 2019.

Meanwhile, Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoyo said right-hander Chase Anderson is day-to-day with an oblique strain.

Anderson was projected to be a member of the Blue Jays' five-man starting rotation.

PETERSBURG, Fla. — Florida shattered the national record Sunday for the largest single-day increase in positive coronavirus cases in any state since the beginning of the pandemic, adding more than 15,000 cases as its daily average death toll continued to also rise.

According to state Department of Health statistics, 15,299 people tested positive, for a total of 269,811 cases, and 45 deaths were recorded.

California had the previous record of daily positive cases — 11,694, set on Wednesday. New York had 11,571 on April 15.

The numbers come at the end of a grim, record-breaking week as Florida reported 514 fatalities — an average of 73 per day. Three weeks ago, the state was averaging 30 deaths per day. Since the pandemic began in March, 4,346 people have died in Florida of COVID-19, the state says.

Testing has doubled over the last month, going from about 25,000 tests per day to almost 50,000, but the percentage of people testing positive has risen even more dramatically. A month ago, fewer than 5% of tests came up positive on a daily average. Over the past week, the daily average exceeded 19%.

About 10.7% of Saturday’s 143,000 tests came up positive, with an average age of 38. ""I still think we need to increase our testing a little bit more,"" said University of Florida epidemiologist Dr. Cindy Prins, adding that the state and local health departments should ramp up their contact tracing.

Prins said that she's still concerned about large crowds, gyms and some restaurants as being places of mass transmission. Reports of illegal clubs and raves in South Florida is also a worry, she said.

""I really do think we could control this, and it’s the human element that is so critical. It should be an effort of our country. We should be pulling together when we’re in a crisis, and we’re definitely not doing it,"" she said. ""I know people want to live their lives. There have been a lot of other times, people have made those sacrifices in order to benefit our society. It’s almost like a war effort. That’s what we need right now.""

Terry Shaw, AdventHealth’s president and CEO, said Sunday on CBS’ Face the Nation that the peak of COVID-19 hospitalizations in Florida will be ""sometime in front of us in July.""

While on the program, he said that the health system, which has hospitals in nine states including 30 in Florida, has adequate PPE, a stockpile of ventilators and a clinical team that’s learned how to better treat the disease.

""I give you an example. Our length of stay in our ICU for COVID patients has dropped in half. The number of people coming in to our hospital with COVID that need a ventilator, we’ve also been able to cut that in half. And because of those things, our death rate has also been cut in half"" since the beginning of the pandemic,"" he said

The health system’s ICU capacities in Florida are currently running at about 85% to 90%. He said the system could turn some ""progressive care units"" into ICU units if needed.

Hospitals in several counties have stopped doing elective surgeries. HCA West Florida have ceased inpatient elective procedures at hospitals in Hillsborough, Pinellas and six other nearby counties, said an HCA spokeswoman on Sunday. Florida ceased elective surgeries statewide from March until early May in order to free up beds, and to reserve personal protective equipment for health care workers caring for COVID-19 patients.

Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach are the top three counties for hospitalizations, with 3,232 people hospitalized — 42 per cent of the 7,542 people in hospitals statewide for coronavirus.

Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez told CNN on Sunday that his county's hospitals will soon reach capacity, but he said more beds can be added, including for intensive care.

""We still have capacity, but it does cause me a lot of concern,"" he said.

Throughout May and into June, the state reopened much of its economy with some restrictions — and the number of positive cases began rising, but it wasn't until the last week that the daily death total began rising, too.

Because of the increase in cases and the positivity rate, doctors have predicted a rise in deaths, saying the mortality rate usually increases two to four weeks later as some of those infected get sicker and eventually die. Health experts are concerned that people are gathering in crowds, and have expressed concern that the Republican National Convention's nomination party for President Donald Trump will be held in Jacksonville in August.

On Saturday, the Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom reopened at Walt Disney World in Orlando, concerning health experts who urge people not to gather in groups. Guests at the park said that people were wearing masks and social distancing, and videos showed near-empty parks.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said that even with the rising rates, he still wants the schools to reopen as scheduled next month, saying children have not proven to be vectors for the disease in states and countries where campuses are open. He said while each county will have to come up with procedures, depending on their local infection rate, not opening the schools would exacerbate the achievement gap between high- and low-performing students.

""We know there are huge, huge costs for not providing the availability of in-person schooling,"" he said. ""The risk of corona, fortunately, for students is incredibly low.""

Helen Ferre, a spokeswoman for DeSantis, said Sunday that the state has tested more than 2.4 million people for COVID-19.

Ferre said the important statistic isn’t the raw number of positives, but the percentage — on Sunday, it was just over 11%, about 8 percentage points lower than the weekly average.

""The more people who get tested and are proportionately reporting negative for this virus is meaningful,"" she wrote in an email to The Associated Press.

Meanwhile, a commissioner for a county near Jacksonville is seriously ill with the virus, according to a posting by his daughter on Facebook.

St. Johns County Commissioner Paul Waldron had recently voted against a county ordinance requiring masks, but not because he opposed them. He said he wanted more answers from county administrators about which masks are most effective and whether the county had enough for employees and visitors at government buildings.

So what about 142 days?

""Every game might end 0-0,"" the Calgary Flames general manager quipped.

With summer training camps set to open Monday as the NHL lurches forward in its plan to restart a season stopped in its tracks four months ago by COVID-19, the temptation might be to spring a surprise or two — maybe a new power-play setup or a tweak to the penalty kill — when the games return Aug. 1.

Coaches for the 24 teams set to feature in the league's return have had ample time to plan, brainstorm and re-assess their systems and rosters. The 16 taking part in the best-of-five qualifying round have known for nearly seven weeks which opponent they'd be lining up against if the league got back up and running.

But don't expect to see massive changes — especially early — from the men standing behind the benches in those empty arenas in Toronto and Edmonton once the puck is dropped.

They have enough to worry about when it comes to their own players.

""Every coach is going to look at and break down the opponent and have a game plan to attack,"" continued Treliving, whose club will take on the Winnipeg Jets in the qualifying round. ""But because of the uniqueness of this time, there's more of a focus to get your team ready. I remember last year preparing for the playoffs and we're sitting there going, 'What are we going to do with the four days between our last regular-season game (and the playoffs)?'

""We thought we had two months to prepare last year and we were dealing with four days. You're dealing with four months here. So the focus for the 24 teams is how do we get up to speed? How do we get to our 'A' game when we haven't played for so long?""

Like most teams, Montreal Canadiens head coach Claude Julien and his staff met remotely via video conference on a regular basis after the NHL suspended the schedule because of the pandemic in mid-March.

And after it was announced they'd be facing the Pittsburgh Penguins in the qualifying round, those preparations ramped up significantly.

""I'm a believer that as a coach you can never get too much information — as much as you can get is great,"" Julien said. ""The important part is what you share with your players. That's where you have to be careful.""

Penguins head coach Mike Sullivan said his focus will be shaking off the rust and getting his group prepared for a situation that will see teams go from zero to 100 in short order.

""There are significant challenges from a mindset standpoint and making sure that we get out of the summer hockey mode or the social distancing skates into real competitive hockey,"" he said. ""Because that's what we're going to be faced with in a short period of time.""

But Toronto Maple Leafs winger Zach Hyman, whose club is set to face the Columbus Blue Jackets in the qualifying round for a spot in the usual 16-team playoffs, still believes there could be some subtle changes around the league.

""This is the unknown,"" he said. ""When you go in from the regular season into playoffs, you don't really tweak too much, you just kind of roll into the playoffs, rolling off your momentum from the regular season. This is a completely different beast, where what you watched a couple months ago may not be the team that you're playing against in the summer. It's almost like a brand new year with the same rosters.

""It'll be interesting to see how everything turns out around the league with the long layoff.""

Canucks defenceman Christopher Tanev said he expects Vancouver's coaches to have plenty to share about the Minnesota Wild.

""I'm sure they'll have a lot of information,"" he said with a smile. ""They'll know every little detail about the team and every player.""

The Wild, however, shouldn't expect more than the basics on the other side.

""It's unique that we've known who we're playing here for a while,"" Minnesota interim head coach Dean Evason said. ""The challenge, at least for our group, is we don't want to overload them.""

The Boston Bruins are in a slightly different position as one of the top-4 teams in the Eastern Conference. They'll take part in round-robin games against Washington, Tampa Bay and Philadelphia to determine the No. 1 seed on that side of the playoff bracket, but the Bruins won't know their first-round opponent until after the qualifiers.

""We're not going to introduce a whole lot of new concepts,"" Boston head coach Bruce Cassidy said. ""Even though you've had a lot of time to dream up a lot of different things, I don't know if it's the best time — a short turnaround with a lot of the line — to start messing too much with your game.

""We're going to try to keep it as simple as we can.""

For all the time coaches have had, that might end up being their best play.

Ferries loosens restrictions",['Roxanne Egan-Elliott'],,"B.C. Ferries is loosening some restrictions and increasing capacity as summer travel within the province grows.

Passenger numbers have risen to about 70 per cent of what they were at this time last year, said Tessa Humphries, communications manager for B.C. Ferries. In the early days of the pandemic, they were about 20 per cent of normal.

article continues below

Passenger capacity had been capped at 50 per cent, but that restriction is being phased out to increase service, Humphries said.

That level was set by Transport Canada, which gave operators a choice between limiting capacity and implementing enhanced cleaning and physical- distancing measures.

Humphries said B.C. Ferries implemented both measures at first but has now decided to phase out the capacity limit. B.C. Ferries consulted with Transport Canada on the change, she said.

Enhanced physical-distancing and cleaning protocols, including clear plastic barriers and face- coverings, remain in place. Passengers are asked whether they’re experiencing COVID-19 symptoms prior to travel, and those in vehicles are allowed to remain inside their cars.

More than 300 sailings per month have been added on major routes between the Island and the Lower Mainland since the start of June. The company is aiming to keep capacity about 20 per cent above demand, Humphries said.

“We will have fewer sailings than in summer schedules of the past, but significantly more than what was available as a result of the service cuts in April,” she said.

The company has also added an additional vessel on the route between Departure Bay and Horseshoe Bay on Fridays and Sundays, and a second vessel on the route that services the southern Gulf Islands on Thursdays through Mondays.

“We did also hear from the communities that there was a struggle for capacity there,” Humphries said, adding that it wasn’t uncommon for sailings on Gulf Islands route to be completely booked.

Passengers travelling by car are encouraged to book in advance or choose less busy times to travel.

Humphries said B.C. Ferries expects it will take a couple of years before passenger numbers return to pre-pandemic levels.

Onboard food services have resumed on some minor routes, including between Swartz Bay and the Gulf Islands, and the Passages gift shop reopened Friday on sailings between Swartz Bay and Tsawwassen. Packaged food and limited hot food resumed on three major routes between the Island and the Lower Mainland in June.

The Lands End Café in the Swartz Bay terminal also recently reopened. Markets in the Departure Bay and Tsawwassen terminals reopened in late June.

The drop in ferry traffic has cost B.C. Ferries millions of dollars in lost revenue.

Humphries said the company is evaluating the financial situation daily and reopening onboard amenities will provide another revenue stream.

“But we’re all doing all of that carefully and gradually, as well as safely reintroducing these services,” she said.

But even the best efforts have left doctors stymied about the source of more than one-third of this country's known COVID-19 infections. Not knowing where cases come from makes outbreaks that much harder to stamp out.

article continues below

Now medical researchers and supercomputers are turning genetics labs into virus detective agencies, looking first to find the novel coronavirus itself within blood samples from thousands of infected patients, and then comparing all of those isolated viruses to each other looking for places they differ.

Every close match will draw a line from patient to patient, ultimately painting a picture of how the virus spread.

""This is the big effort over the next four weeks,"" said Andrew McArthur, director of the biomedical discovery and commercialization program at McMaster University.

""What's going to come out of there pretty soon is a glimpse of what just happened, how did it move around the province, how did it move between provinces or how big was Pearson (airport) in the early days of the airport being open.""

Knowing how the virus spread will show where there were weaknesses in public health measures early on, said McArthur. Being able to keep divining genetic codes from samples will mean when there are flare-ups of cases, they can be quickly compared to each other to see if they're all related or are coming from multiple sources.

It means, for example, a long-term care centre should be able to quickly know if its 10 new cases are because one case spread widely or arose from multiple carriers coming into the facility.

""That's a very different infection-control problem,"" said McArthur.

It also means that maybe, just maybe, the second COVID-19 wave most think is coming won't be as bad, or as hard to control, as the first, because the sources can be isolated very quickly.

""A second wave is likely,"" McArthur said. ""But we've never spent this kind of money and effort before, either, so maybe we'll beat it.""

The kinds of genetic technology being used for this project did not exist when SARS hit Canada in 2003.

This genetic mapping is constantly on the look-out for mutations. Thus far, SARS-CoV-2, the official name for the virus that causes COVID-19, has not mutated as quickly as many others do. Influenza, for instance, changes so much over a year the vaccine has to be retooled every summer to keep up.

But there are enough subtle changes still happening among the 28,000 individual markers that make up a genome for SARS-CoV-2 that cases can be traced backward and linked to the ones that came before. McArthur said it takes a lot of data storage, a lot of high-capacity computer analysis, and a lot of money, to run the comparisons among them all.

The federal government put $40 million on the table in April for genetic research on COVID-19. Half is to keep tabs on the virus as it spreads, look for any changes it undergoes, and map its pathway across the country. The other half is to look at the genetic structures of the patients who get infected, trying to answer the puzzling question of why some people die and others have symptoms so mild they never even know they are sick.

Genome Canada is administering the project, with six regional genomics agencies overseeing the work locally and labs like McArthur's doing the testing and analysis. The funding is intended to create genetic maps from 150,000 patients. Canada thus far has had about 108,000 positive cases, and the expectation is that almost every one of them will be gene-mapped.

The results will be loaded into a global site comparing all known infections of COVID-19, but also be analyzed for national and regional reports.

In New York, genetic sequencing was used to figure out that COVID-19 in Manhattan wasn't coming from China and Iran as imagined, but from Europe. In Canada, it is suspected that much of the virus came into this country from travellers returning from the United States in early March. But the work is only now beginning to confirm that belief.

McArthur estimates the first data will be available for Ontario in about four weeks, but warns it will take many more months to complete all of the tests. His lab sequenced 600 samples on Wednesday alone.

Overall, McArthur expects the genetics project to last for two years.

Trump flew by helicopter to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in suburban Washington to meet wounded servicemembers and health care providers caring for COVID-19 patients. As he left the White House, he told reporters: ""When you're in a hospital, especially ... I think it’s a great thing to wear a mask.""

article continues below

Trump was wearing a mask in Walter Reed's hallway as he began his visit. He was not wearing one when he stepped off the helicopter at the facility.

The president was a latecomer to wearing a mask during the pandemic, which has raged across the U.S. since March and infected more than 3.2 million and killed at least 134,000. Most prominent Republicans, including Vice-President Mike Pence, endorsed wearing masks as the coronavirus gained ground this summer. Republican governors have been moving toward requiring or encouraging the use of masks as the pandemic has grown more serious in some states in the South and West.

Trump, however, has declined to wear a mask at news conferences, coronavirus task force updates, rallies and other public events. People close to him have told The Associated Press that the president feared a mask would make him look weak and was concerned that it shifted focus to the public health crisis rather than the economic recovery. They spoke on condition of anonymity to describe private matters.

While not wearing one himself, Trump has sent mixed signals about masks, acknowledging that they would be appropriate if worn in an indoor setting where people were close together. But he has accused reporters of wearing them to be politically correct and has retweeted messages making fun of Democratic rival Joe Biden for wearing a mask and implying that Biden looks weak.

Questions remain whether Trump will wear a mask with any regularity.

The wearing of masks became another political dividing line, with Republicans more resistant to wearing them than Democrats. Few masks were seen at recent Trump campaign events in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Phoenix and South Dakota’s Mount Rushmore.

The only time Trump has been known to wear a mask was during a private part of a tour of a Ford plant in Michigan.

A spokesman for the Biden campaign cast the president's action as too little, too late.

""Donald Trump spent months ignoring the advice of medical experts and politicizing wearing a mask, one of the most important things we can do to prevent the spread of the virus,"" spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement. ""Rather than taking responsibility and leading, he wasted four months that Americans have been making sacrifices by stoking divisions and actively discouraging people from taking a very basic step to protect each other.""

On its website, Walter Reed carries this recommendation: ""Whenever you’re out in public, like at your local grocery store or pharmacy, where it’s difficult to maintain 6 feet of social distance, you should wear a cloth face covering."" The facility also notes that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends wearing cloth face coverings to slow the spread of the coronavirus.""",[]

While hundreds of people could be employed in positions relating to the games and hubs — such as security jobs, rink staff, food services and hotel housekeeping — the financial benefit of two bubble communities under tight seal would be ""modest"" at best, suggested Bank of Montreal chief economist Douglas Porter.

""When you think of how many tourists would normally be in Toronto during peak tourist season, I'm quite sure this is less than one per cent,"" he said.

""The reality is, it's not going to move the needle.""

But Porter, a lifelong hockey fan, said he anticipates a ""reasonably meaningful positive"" morale boost to Canadian sports fans who've been eagerly anticipating players returning to the ice in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The games are slated to start Aug. 1 with six Canadian teams qualifying for the 24-team resumption of play. No fans will be in the seats.

Edmonton and Toronto were confirmed as the NHL's hub cities on Friday night.

""The fact that part of our world is getting back to some kind of normal will help reinforce the sense that things, generally, are moving in that direction and could help support the recovery,"" Porter said.

The gradual comeback of major sporting events has drawn plenty of interest in recent weeks, with debates raging over the risks of putting players back into the games, even if spectators aren't allowed in the facilities.

Further questions have been raised over whether rigorous testing is enough to prevent outbreaks within the isolated community, which could potentially throw the whole plan into a costly disarray.

Many of these factors make placing a value on hockey's return especially difficult.

Michael Naraine, a professor at Brock University in St. Catharines, Ont., said the largest amount of money is on the line at large corporations, which he said is driving the return of major sporting events.

""The primary revenue driver for sports is broadcasting,"" said the assistant professor of digital sport management and marketing.

""They need television advertisers come back. The league itself needs to gain its revenue from NBC and Sportsnet here in Canada.""

Politicians have preferred to emphasize the positive aspects of a deal with the NHL.

Alberta Premier Jason Kenney eagerly promoted Edmonton as the ultimate hub city for the hockey league, posting videos on Twitter that prominently featured the Rocky Mountains and other popular destinations in the province.

Naraine said those public expressions by leaders are more an attempt to ""pander"" to their constituents than actually drive any meaningful economic impact. He said this is especially the case in Edmonton.

""Having major events come to town allows them to beat their chests and say, 'We exist. We're on the map. Come look at us,'"" he said.

""But the fact that the hub city will be in Edmonton is no different than whether the hub city would be in Toronto or Vancouver or elsewhere. It's not going to significantly drive tourism all of a sudden.""

Patrick Rishe, a sports professor at Washington University in St. Louis, said he sees value in showcasing a lesser known Canadian city on broadcast television with ""beauty shots"" of the locale. He said it may also sit well with NHL executives.

""You never know,"" he said. ""Doing and serving a good deed for the league now, this could pay dividends down the road.""

Any semblance of a regular hockey season would be welcomed by Dana Parris, owner of the Lockeroom sports bar in Barrie, Ont.

Even though her business is over 100 kilometres away from downtown Toronto, she anticipates the excitement would reverberate to her customers.

""If we could have sports come back and we hit Stage 3 (of Ontario's COVID reopening plan) around the same time, I will probably stop crying myself to sleep,"" she said.

""If those two come together it's just going to be the most beautiful thing.""

Collins made the comments in a July 8 update on summer travel and the impact of COVID-19 on the ferry service.

article continues below

Local governments on the Sunshine Coast and the Southern Sunshine Coast Ferry Advisory Committee have been pressing Ferries to add more trips to the Langdale-Horseshoe Bay route to meet the anticipated demand from residents, businesses and tourists now that travel within the province is no longer being discouraged.

Although BC Ferries is now running eight round-trips a day on Route 3, with two additional sailings on Fridays and Sundays starting July 10, there have still been frequent overloads and delays.

In a recent letter to BC Ferries, Sechelt councillors pointed out that the Sunshine Coast economy is “heavily reliant on tourism” and reduced capacity on the Langdale route could “limit our community’s recovery.”

“Our vision for Route 3 this summer is simple – provide the same level of service as last summer,” the letter said. “This would include the additional sailings we had last summer and maintaining increased time between sailings to ensure ferries run on time.”

Councillors in Gibsons are also sending BC Ferries a letter, asking the ferry company to “recognize the needs of small businesses on the Coast requiring deliveries of materials, including perishable goods, for their operations.”

In his update, Collins said traffic is beginning to grow again after dropping around 80 per cent in March and April and is expected to continue to increase throughout the summer.

“This summer, we are going to need your help, your patience and your understanding,” Collins said. “While we’re adding sailings as fast as we can, there still will be some sailing limitations this summer as we weren’t able to hire and train summer seasonal staff in March and April due to COVID-19. We are planning for summer service to exceed demand, but we won’t have the same number of sailings as last summer.”

Collins also acknowledged the inconvenience caused by schedule changes, some of which have happened on short notice. Sunshine Coast residents in particular have complained about trouble with rebooking reservations and long waits on hold with customer service.

“Over the past month or so, we’ve revised our schedules more often than normal, as we bring more sailings back into service,” he said. “I know this has impacted some of our customers, but every time we add more sailings, we need to revise the schedules one more time.”

Collins said BC Ferries is putting the bulk of its efforts into brining back service and is working with the province “to examine the impact COVID-19 is having on the ferry system.”

“We need to protect the core of the ferry system and continue to provide safe, reliable service to British Columbians.”",[]

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreaks at Tabor and at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred to those homes from the hospital. The outbreak at the Tabor long-term care home was declared over on July 7.

B.C.'s provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix said in a July 10 joint statement that the province recorded 25 new cases in the past 24 hours, for a total of 3,053 cases since the virus that has caused a global pandemic first appeared in B.C. in late January.

North Island-Powell River MP Rachel Blaney has been working through her parliamentary commitments to ensure the reshaped government is being responsive to Canadians.

Blaney, in an interview on July 8, said she had just sat through a hybrid sitting of the House of Commons, which was “one for the record books.”

“We’ll see what happens next but it was interesting,” said Blaney. “There were some parliamentarians in parliament and the rest of them were across the country. When we are sitting in front of our screen, we are seeing our colleagues from all over in their offices and their homes. We are participating in our democracy in a completely different way.”

Blaney said as the parliamentarian who represents the NDP on the procedural and house affairs committee, what is being done by the committee is looking at what the House of Commons can look like in the fall, and how to address the issue of being able to do the full spectrum of work that is usually done, understanding that everybody cannot be in the house simultaneously. She said a report will come out and will be made public.

Blaney said there have been a lot of discussions at the committee level about security, such as with online platforms, and what kinds of methods should be looked at in terms of voting.

“We all know that is very important,” said Blaney, about voting. “If there is any voting happening now, it’s just the members in the house, percentage wise, representing each party. It’s definitely been an experience doing the work that you’ve done for your career but doing it in a very different way.”

Running the federal government in a hybrid system has many complexities. There are 338 parliamentarians, so accommodating the sheer number of people in the House of Commons and online is an issue. Blaney said one intricacy is that as parliament does its work, everything has to be simultaneously interpreted in French and English.

She said one of the things being looked at in the report is around the reality that in the last parliament, there was also some indigenous language spoken with an interpreter present, so there is a process that has to happen to allow that in the revised House of Commons.

“Now that we are in a different format of parliament, we are trying to find a way to follow the rules we’ve set for ourselves for that kind of flexibility,” said Blaney.

She said the committee has looked at other parliaments across the planet, seeing how other governments are coping with administration of democracy during the pandemic.

“I’m not sure what the final recommendations will be but I do believe there has to be a way to allow people who can only participate virtually to have a voice,” said Blaney. “It’s really important to honour those voices and make sure they have the capacity to represent their regions.”

In more remote areas of the country, where internet service is not as robust as it is in other areas, there may also be some issues with connectivity, said Blaney. She said the committee has worked closely with the House of Commons to make sure those issues are taken into consideration.

“If we’re in a position of taking a vote, how do we make sure those folks don’t miss out because of some sort of technical challenge that has happened?” said Blaney. “The committee has been looking long and hard into those issues, wanting to make sure we really honour parliament and the history of parliament, but recognizing that sometimes we have to adapt to these new circumstances.”

She said she is ultimately looking forward to going back to Ottawa and participating in parliament and seeing all of her colleagues there, because she thinks that part of the work is very important. Blaney acknowledges that a return to the old method of governance is an unknown. COVID-19 is the reality and everyone has seen how things have fundamentally changed, she added.

The work of the all-party COVID-19 committee in parliament is done, said Blaney, so parliamentarians will continue to meet through the hybrid system.

She said the hybrid parliament will be meeting at least four times this summer and it is something the NDP fought for during negotiations.

“We wanted to make sure, during changing times, the government was held to account twice a month over the summer months because things are changing quickly and we need the ability to ask questions and to hold the government to account during these very challenging times,” said Blaney.

She said the parliamentary structure is fundamental to Canada, and if it is going to be changed or altered, she said she hopes the government is thoughtful in how it is going to change it, and that parliament is not taken for granted.

“We need to focus on how we are going to do the work,” said Blaney, “in the middle of a pandemic.”",[]

Metro Inc. was aware of Loblaw Companies Ltd.'s decision to stop its so-called pandemic pay program before it made a similar decision, chief executive Eric La Fleche told the House of Commons standing committee on industry, science and technology Friday.

article continues below

La Fleche said that a Metro competitor's move was one of several influencing factors in its decision-making process.

He joined the Loblaw president and Empire Co. Ltd. chief executive at a two-hour session about why they stopped paying a temporary wage bump to employees as of June 13.

""Let me be absolutely clear, we did not co-ordinate our decisions,"" said Michael Medline, Empire CEO, in his opening statement before the committee. Medline, whose company owns the Sobeys and Safeway brands, was the first of the trio to give his opening remarks.

""The decision was our own.""

Loblaw president Sarah Davis echoed the sentiment, but noted she sent a ""courtesy email"" to both competitors, as well as Walmart and Save-On-Foods, on June 11. The latter two did not appear at the hearing.

The email notified competitors of Loblaw's decision to end its pandemic pay program on June 13. The company had already informed its roughly 200,000 employees, she said, and recognized ""the news would be public immediately.""

La Fleche said in later questioning that he was aware of the email when Metro made its decision to end its bonus pay program on the same day.

""We made our own decision based on the information we had, which included that last piece of information, yes,"" he said.

He called it ""one factor among others"" contributing to its decision. Other factors included the broader economic reopening, other retailers starting to open their doors, lower business volumes and a gradual return to more normal conditions.

Empire had not received Davis's email when the company made its decision to terminate the extra wages, said Medline, but had heard through the grapevine that Loblaw was considering doing so.

Davis received a reply to her June 11 email, and said she would provide copies of the original and all answers to the committee.

She also sent a courtesy email to competitors when Loblaw decided to begin its extra pay program. Davis said she doesn't recall sending courtesy emails to competitors on other topics, including executive compensation.

In addition to receiving the email, La Fleche said he made several phone calls to competitors in May and June to ask whether they planned to extend their bonus pay programs or end them on previously announced dates.

""In perfect compliance with The Competition Act, I asked my counterparts their intentions regarding whether or not they would maintain the temporary bonus,"" he said, in a translation from French, during his opening remarks.

In each case, competitors, including Medline from Empire and Davis from Loblaw, told him they had not yet decided.

""Whatever the case, those calls were made in a decisional process that was much larger and ... did not inform our decisions.""

When asked why he made the phone calls, La Fleche answered he ""wanted as much information as I could have in order to make a best decision for our company, our employees at the right time.""

He said he would ""absolutely not"" characterize those conversations as trying to obtain a tacit agreement on wages.

Those who sent emails and made phone calls said they consulted with company counsel before doing so and lawyers were present during at least one phone discussion.

The appearance was a chance for the executives to admit they were wrong to end the pay increases, said Jerry Dias, president of Unifor, a private sector union.

""What we got instead was highly paid grocery executives insisting they did not collude, and then going on to say — remarkably — virtually the same thing over and over again,"" he said in a statement.

""The executives all admitted to exchanging 'courtesy emails' and 'courtesy calls' on pandemic pay, and yet insist there was no collusion. I look forward to the committee's ruling on that.""

Unifor has been critical of retailers ending temporary wage increases while the pandemic continues and has called for the pay bump to be permanent.

The matriarchs, known as Gaandlee Guu Jaalang or ""daughters of the river,"" say in a statement the Queen Charlotte Lodge and West Coast Fishing Club reopened as a local state of emergency remains in effect because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

article continues below

""Haida Gwaii is a remote community with limited health-care services and only two ventilators,"" the statement says. ""One case would devastate our communities.""

The statement says the matriarchs are upholding Haida law through the occupation of the villages, Jung and Sk'aawats.

Both the fishing lodge and club say they are fully complying with orders and guidelines issued by the B.C. government, health authorities and WorkSafeBC.

Brian Clive, vice-president of sales and corporate development for the lodge, said it has had several meetings with Haida leadership and developed plans so that workers do not go into town or anywhere near a Haida community. It also has medical staff on site and if a COVID-19 case were to develop, there's a plan in place to evacuate the affected person by air to Vancouver.

""We have gone to incredible lengths to avoid any contact with the communities and therefore have created what we call a zero-risk chance of contamination in the communities,"" he said.

The lodge expects about 80 guests at a time, down from the typical 125, he said. None will be travelling from the United States because the border is closed, he said.

President Brian Legge said the West Coast Fishing Club is remotely located about 83 kilometres from the nearest community and only accessible by boat or air. It also has an emergency evacuation plan in place.

""First and foremost we would never put the health and well-being of Haida Gwaii communities and residents at risk and equally as important our staff and clients,"" he says in a statement.

""That's why we have worked hard and gone to significant expense to eliminate all contact with the residents of Haida Gwaii and their communities through direct helicopter transportation from the mainland to our remote island and back.""

Without the plan, the club's employees would have been out of work and the business faced possibly unsustainable losses, Legge said.

The club is continuing to speak with the council of the Haida Nation, he added.

Duffy Edgars, chief councillor of Old Massett Village, said he supports the matriarchs and expected 20 to 30 people to occupy the villages. He said he didn't expect any interactions with lodge staff.

""We're just occupying our land and doing some fishing,"" he said.

Haida member Deana Young, who was on her way to support the matriarchs, said the community is following physical distancing protocols, while children have not returned to school and are not seeing their elders.

""One person coming from outside our region is one person too many,"" said Young.

The occupation of the land is an exercise of Haida rights to the land, she said.

""What we are doing is occupying our lands, asserting our rights to harvest the foods that we live on and to ensure food security for our communities,"" she said.

The new listing did not specify which seats were affected on the flights, meaning any passengers aboard the flight should “self-isolate and monitor for symptoms for 14 days after the flight.”

Travellers arriving to B.C. from outside of Canada are already required to file a 14-day self-isolation plan upon their return. For flight 696, that period of quarantine ended Thursday, July 9.

Cargill's beef plant near High River, south of Calgary, employs about 2,200 people. It shut down for two weeks in April because of an outbreak that affected 350 staff.

article continues below

It reopened after bringing in safety measures that included temperature testing, physical distancing, cleaning and sanitizing.

Eventually nearly half of the workers contracted the virus and two employees died.

The lawsuit, which needs to be approved by a judge, was filed by Guardian Law Group and seeks damages for the harm done to family members, friends and other people who were in close contact with Cargill employees who contracted the novel coronavirus.

The plaintiffs do not include the employees themselves, who are covered by labour and worker compensation laws.

The statement of claim alleges that despite warnings and guidelines issued by the Alberta government, Cargill Ltd. failed to take ""reasonable precautions"" at the beginning of the outbreak to limit its spread.

""This is a sophisticated facility and a company well-versed in proper safety procedures. That's why it's so shocking to see them fall so far below the standard of acceptable behaviour that we expect from employers in this situation,"" said Mathew Farrell of Guardian Law Group Friday.

""Businesses bear a responsibility to the community to take reasonable measures to limit the spread of this disease, and where they fail to do so, we will hold them to account for the harms that result.""

The allegations have not been proven in court.

Daniel Sullivan, a Cargill spokesman, said the company does not have a comment to make at this time regarding the class action. He gave a general statement in an email.

""At Cargill, we take seriously our responsibility to feed the world and that keeping people safe is core to our values.""

The High River plant is back at full operation and processes about 4,500 head of cattle a day — more than one-third of Canada's beef-packing capacity.

Cargill Ltd. is a subsidiary of U.S.-based Cargill Inc., one of the largest privately owned corporations in the United States by revenue.

The league and NHL Players' Association announced Friday the return-to-play protocols — featuring Toronto and Edmonton as hub cities — and a four-year extension to the current collective bargaining agreement have been ratified.

article continues below

The NHL board of governors and the union's full membership gave the documents, which were tied together in an all-or-nothing bundle, the thumbs up in separate votes.

""It was pretty civil,"" Vancouver Canucks captain Bo Horvat said of negotiations on the deal that was tentatively agreed to Monday. ""We're happy to get things going.""

Bringing the hubs to Canada, where coronavirus infection rates are largely under control, proved to be the logical choice after a significant spike in cases across the United States in recent weeks.

""While we have all worked very hard to try to address the risks of COVID-19, we know that health and safety are and will continue to be our priorities,"" NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said in a statement. ""We know that all of our fans are excited about our return to the ice.""

Training camps for the 24 teams primed to compete in the league's restart to a 2019-20 campaign that was suspended March 12 are scheduled to begin Monday — also the deadline for players to opt out of participating with no penalty — in each franchise's home market.

The plan will then see Eastern Conference clubs report to Toronto on July 26, while those from the Western Conference head to Edmonton before the games resume Aug. 1. The conference finals and Stanley Cup will be held in Edmonton as part of a first-of-its-kind NHL Final Four that could stretch all the way to Oct. 4 and result in next season being pushed into December or early January.

Once in Canada's largest city and Alberta's capital, players are set to be kept away from the general public in so-called ""bubbles"" that include strict health measures, daily testing, and mostly confine teams to hotels and empty arenas.

The extension of the current CBA, which was slated to expire in September 2022 and now runs through at least the 2025-26 season, provides both players and owners clarity on a number of challenging financial realities caused by COVID-19.

It also give the green light for negotiations with the International Olympic Committee and the International Ice Hockey Federation on participation at the 2022 and 2026 Winter Games. The NHL skipped the 2018 Olympics after taking part in five straight between 1998 and 2014.

The salary cap's upper limit will remain at US$81.5 million in 2020-21 and stay there until hockey-related revenue returns to $4.8 billion — this season's projected total prior to the pandemic. Players have agreed to defer 10 per cent of next year's salaries, and have owners pay that back over three consecutive seasons starting in 2022-23.

""This agreement is a meaningful step forward for the players and owners, and for our game, in a difficult and uncertain time,"" NHLPA executive director Don Fehr said. ""We are pleased to be able to bring NHL hockey back.""

Escrow payments, a consistent thorn in the side of players that guarantees a 50/50 split of HRR with owners, will be capped at 20 per cent in 2020-21, and decrease throughout the deal. If teams are still owed money following the 2025-26 campaign, the CBA will be extended another season.

The agreement marks the first time in Bettman's 27-year tenure as commissioner the NHL has bridged two CBAs without a work stoppage. Both the 1994-95 and 2012-13 seasons were cut to 48 games because of lockouts, while the 2004-05 campaign was cancelled.

Alberta Premier Jason Kenney was the most outspoken politician with regards to having his province host one of the hubs, pointing to a low infection rate and Edmonton's facilities.

He also penned a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in hopes of securing a waiver for the NHL when it came to Canada's mandatory 14-day quarantine for anyone arriving in the country. The federal government approved the league's proposal of a cohort quarantine last month, granting an exception that paved the way for Toronto and Edmonton to get the nod as hubs.

Speaking outside Rogers Place, Kenney said Friday's news will create jobs and millions of dollars in economic activity.

""The Stanley Cup is coming back to Edmonton, to Alberta,"" Kenney said in a video posted to Twitter as he stood next to a statue of Wayne Gretzky. ""We are going to get an unbelievable amount of free advertising across North America and around the world that will set us up well for the future relaunch of our tourism industry when travel comes back post-COVID.""

The Cup was last awarded in Edmonton when Gretzky hoisted it over his head for a fourth and final time on May 26, 1988.

Each team will be permitted to bring a maximum of 52 people into the bubbles, including a maximum of 31 players.

Meanwhile, it was also announced the NHL draft lottery's second phase has been tabbed for Aug. 10. The eight losing teams from the qualifying round will have an equal shot at the first pick in the draft, which is tentatively scheduled for Oct. 9-10.

Much like Kenney, Ontario Premier Doug Ford and Toronto Mayor John Tory supported their city's hub potential.

""There is no better place for the NHL season to continue,"" Tory said. ""We will make sure we put on a great show for the game of hockey ... while following all proper health and safety protocols.""

Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist at Toronto General Hospital, said choosing to hold the NHL's restart in Canada reduces the overall risk, but it's far from a fool-proof endeavour.

""We'd be blind to think that there isn't COVID-19 in Canada, there's just significantly less of it here compared to parts of the U.S.,"" he said. ""Everyone has to pay close attention to COVID-19 because even with the best laid plans, there still can be small weaknesses that might be exploited by this virus.""

Vancouver was the other Canadian city originally in the running to host, along with seven American markets, before the provincial government expressed concerns about the NHL's health and safety protocols.

Ford was asked prior to Friday's announcement why the plan worked for his province when it didn't for British Columbia.

""They have very stringent rules and regulations for their players,"" Ford said of the NHL. ""When they told me (players are) getting tested every single day, I'm no medical professional, but I don't think they need testing every day.""

The 24-team format — which includes every Canadian franchise, save for Ottawa — will see the top-4 clubs from both the East and West play mini-tournaments to determine playoff seeding, while the other 16 will battle in a never-before-seen qualifying round.

Boston, Tampa Bay, Washington and Philadelphia are set to compete for the No. 1 slot in the East, while defending champions St. Louis, Colorado, Vegas and Dallas will do the same out West.

The East's best-of-five qualifying series include Pittsburgh vs. Montreal, Carolina vs. New York Rangers, New York Islanders vs. Florida and Toronto vs. Columbus. In the West, the matchups are Edmonton vs. Chicago, Nashville vs. Arizona, Vancouver vs. Minnesota and Calgary vs. Winnipeg.

In all, there will be as many as 52 games played over the first nine days before the teams get a break on Aug. 10.

The four winners of the best-of-five series in each conference will then be pitted against the top-4 seeds to fill out the usual 16-team playoff bracket.

There could, however, still be choppy waters before the 2019-20 season can actually resume.

Players won't be quarantined during training camp, but instead asked to practise physical distancing when not at the rink in hopes isolation and testing will be enough to avoid any outbreaks.

Of the 396 NHLers tested at team facilities between June 8 and Monday during voluntary workouts, 23 results came back positive. The league said it's also aware of 12 other positive tests for players not taking part in those optional sessions.

The Stanley Cup has been awarded every year since 1893, except for 1919 because of the Spanish flu outbreak and in 2005 when the lockout scratched the entire season.

There's now a firm plan in place to — hopefully — see it handed out this fall.

The Burnaby Community Action Team (BCAT) on the Overdose Crisis penned a letter to council in late May with two calls to action for the city, including providing overdose response training and supplies to warming centre staff.

article continues below

“As illicit drug overdoses continue to rise, it is imperative that facilities supporting the homeless population in our city follow best practice measures,” reads the letter. “This means ensuring warming centre staff have access to overdose response supplies and basic training in relation to overdose recognition and response.”

The letter is cosigned by Michel Pouliot, executive director of Burnaby Family Life, and Dr. Lindsay McCaffrey with the Burnaby Division of Family Practices, along with several BCAT member organizations, including the Progressive Housing Society, Mosaic Burnaby Centre for Immigrants and the Burnaby Society to End Homelessness.

“In the event of an overdose, the wait time between a call to first responders and their arrival can cause permanent brain injury or death. Such experiences can be incredibly upsetting for witnesses and for staff,” reads the letter.

“Frontline workers who are not provided with the training and tools to respond often feel traumatized and powerless.”

The letter notes staff have taken sick leave in other jurisdictions as a result of that trauma, and some Burnaby warming centre staff are already taking naloxone to work.

In a report to council this week, staff said the city would need to “evaluate the operational implications of the request and would have to determine the advisability and feasibility of the request in order to evaluate whether or not this would be an effective additional measure to prevent overdoses in this context.”

Asked why the city would need to study the measure when naloxone training has been widely available for years, city spokesperson Chris Bryan said it is “standard for the city’s risk manager to review all procedures which may affect the health and safety of our patrons and staff, and which may result in liability exposure.”

The BCAT letter also called on the city to expand its resources for the homeless community in Burnaby during the pandemic, including keeping the warming centres, the last of which closed on July 1, open until an emergency shelter has been established in the city.

An emergency shelter is currently planned for the Burnaby Lake Sports Complex, and in the meantime, BC Housing has secured more hotel rooms to house local homeless individuals.

That Burnaby Lake emergency shelter, however, is only expected to be open until December, when construction of the Burnaby Lake complex replacement is set to begin.

“As the health of this population is already compromised, a COVID-19 outbreak would have a devastating impact,” reads the letter. “We know that the proposed locations for the ERC may serve as recreational sites when restrictions are lifted but the need to support vulnerable people and save lives must absolutely supersede residents’ access to such facilities.”

Staff also suggested the city work with community partners to develop short- and long-term actions to address homelessness.",[]

Finance Minister Carol James said Friday the latest numbers paint a picture of cautious optimism with a long road ahead on B.C.'s path to recovery during the COVID-19 pandemic.

article continues below

Gains in May and June bring back about 40 per cent of the total number of jobs lost since the start of the pandemic in February, when B.C.'s jobless rate was five per cent, she told a news conference.

The greatest losses have been in the service sector, but James said that's also where jobs are being added as accommodation and food services accounted for half of last month's gains.

Despite positive signs, James said thousands of people and businesses are still struggling, and net job losses stand at 235,000.

She said youth unemployment in particular stands out at 29.1 per cent, up slightly since May, while 45,000 young people did find jobs last month.

Women in B.C. are also more likely to have lost their job due to COVID-19 than men, James said.

She said the high jobless rate in June reflects increased demand for jobs and confidence that people will have the opportunity to return to work once they start looking again.

James also mentioned the loss of international visitors in the tourism sector, particularly in Metro Vancouver and Victoria, as a factor.

Businesses are restarting cautiously, she added.

""They're making sure that their employees are safe, they're making sure their customers will be safe, and people are starting to see that confidence by going back to businesses.""

James is set to provide more information next week on the post-pandemic spending B.C. has made so far, as well as updated revenue and deficit forecasts.

B.C. health officials reported 25 new cases of COVID-19 on Friday, as well as one additional death.

That brings the death toll to 187 among 3,053 people who have tested positive for the disease so far, Health Minister Adrian Dix and provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said in a joint statement.

Of 187 active cases, 16 people were in hospital, and there were ongoing outbreaks at two long-term care or assisted living facilities and one acute care facility.

While there are no active community outbreaks, Dix and Henry said exposure is still happening.

""When spending more time with friends and family, whether that is close to home or on vacation elsewhere in the province, we remind all British Columbians to avoid closed spaces, crowds and close contact with others,"" read their statement.

For the past four months, the legendary Toronto stage that's hosted the likes of the Rolling Stones and the Police has gone dark, and its famed checkerboard floors immortalized in the Tragically Hip's ""Bobcaygeon"" left empty.

article continues below

Like most smaller Canadian music venues, the future is anything but certain.

""The live-venue industry right now in Canada is on the verge of bankruptcy,"" Cohen said.

""We're not opening, probably, until the end of this year — maybe next year... We have no income coming in whatsoever. It's a bad scene.""

Along with several other indie concert venue owners, Cohen has been making noise about the troubling years ahead for Canada's live music scene in hopes the federal government will take more action.

There was a glimmer of hope on Tuesday when Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault outlined a program that lets owners of for-profit venues apply for a piece of $20 million promised to support the live music sector.

The money will be divided among numerous corners of the industry, including venues, concert promoters, booking agents, managers and music festivals. The funding is part of the second phase of support in the $500-million emergency support measures introduced in May for Canada's arts and culture organizations.

Anyone who's granted approval will receive a minimum contribution of $5,000 that's supposed to last until the end of September.

Beyond the live music business, the federal government has earmarked $5 million for the recording industry that will be administered by Factor and Musicaction, which specialize in developing and supporting Canadian music talent.

Erin Benjamin, chief executive of the Canadian Live Music Association, which advocates for the industry, called the move by Canadian Heritage to support venues ""a good start"" that needs to be built upon in short order.

""It's better than nothing,"" she said.

""It'll help some companies for a very short amount of time...but we're not done here. We can't be done.""

While Cohen doesn't know if he'll qualify for a portion of the venue funding, he's skeptical about how much it'll actually help the Horseshoe.

""I'll be able to pay two weeks of rent,"" Cohen said, pointing out it's roughly $40,000 a month for the downtown location.

""It'll be something, and we'll be grateful for it... but I'm skeptical until I actually see the payments.""

He suspects the Horseshoe may also fail to meet some of the requirements outlined on the Factor website. Among them, a venue must have booked at least 50 per cent Canadian musicians at its venue last year to qualify.

""Horseshoe Tavern was open 360 days last year, I don't think we wrote down which bands were Canadian and weren't. I don't think we even know,"" Cohen said.

""The eligibility makes no sense.""

Smaller venues have been able to tap into other financial support measures, which include the Canada Emergency Response Benefit and the emergency wage subsidy.

In Toronto, city council recently passed legislation that allows property owners to claim a tax break of 50 per cent tax on spaces that operate primarily as live music venues. The intention is for those savings to trickle down to the tenants who are still not allowed to reopen.

Live venues in other Canadian cities are at different stages in a process many anticipate could stretch well into next year.

Vancouver bars were some of the first to reopen, though several clubs in the city warned that patrons may have been exposed to COVID-19 in recent weeks.

Montreal's music venues were allowed to legally reopen in late June, but concertgoers have to remain seated and dancing is forbidden.

In Halifax, Karen Spaulding reopened the Carleton Music Bar and Grill in the final days of June, but it hardly feels the same to her.

""It is at half capacity for three days a week, instead of normally five to seven, and it's acoustic shows only,"" she said.

The Carleton operates as a restaurant, which helped Spaulding's attempt to get the business back on its feet, though she said overall revenues have dropped somewhere between 50 to 75 per cent.

But as much as she's concerned for her business, she's also worried about local Canadian musicians who relied on these venues to make a living. That's motivated her to look for solutions as she faces a long winter that brings a whole new round of questions.

Spaulding said she's been in conversations with lenders, while also tapping into other government programs that help support her staff. She's also looking into whether it would be worthwhile to launch streaming online concerts that would ""put more money in the artists' pockets"" over the coming months.

""I'm going to personally go out on a limb to keep the venue going,"" she said.

""We're huge believers in live music.""

Rep. Adam Schiff couldn't resist: ""We may all be moving to Canada soon,"" he deadpanned.

But as a resurgent COVID-19 ravages the U.S., fuelled by cavalier openings in states like Florida and Texas and a White House determined to resurrect the economy at all costs, the red-alert status spreading across the continent's lower half has more Canadians than ever ignoring America's increasingly persistent knock.

An online poll by Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies released this week found a whopping 86 per cent of respondents in Canada opposed to letting U.S. tourists north of the border, compared with 11 per cent who supported it. An Abacus Data poll out Friday found much the same thing.

And when Rep. Brian Higgins, a New York Democrat, updated his bipartisan call for a plan to reopen the border, the ensuing Twitter barrage of sarcasm, satire and outright anger belied Canada's reputation as a bastion of civility, replete with memes of building walls, slamming doors and Bugs Bunny taking a handsaw to the 49th parallel.

Higgins took it all in stride.

""I don't blame them for wanting us out of there,"" the congressman said Friday of the Canadian reaction.

""I have an obligation to be honest, and I have an obligation to always keep trying. And if anything, what I hope will come from all of this is an appreciation for the tale of two neighbouring countries' response to COVID-19: America's has been deplorable, and the Canadian response has been fast, strong and united.""

When the outbreak first took hold in North America in March, Canada and the U.S. agreed to close their shared border to discretionary travel while allowing the movement of goods and essential workers to continue. That initial 30-day agreement has been extended three times now, and will surely be extended again before its next July 21 expiry date.

Since March, the U.S. has seen more than 3 million cases and 133,000 deaths, and the crisis is accelerating in states across the union. Florida is breaking records daily for new COVID-19 cases and deaths. In Arizona and Texas, one in four tests is coming back positive. Further north, states like Wisconsin and Michigan are seeing fresh spikes in their active caseloads. Hospitals are again rapidly nearing capacity.

In their letter last week to acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf and Canada's Public Safety Minister Bill Blair, Higgins and 27 other members of Congress, Democrat and Republican alike, urged the two countries to stop kicking the can down the road and draft a detailed plan for the gradual reopening of the border.

""The continual 30-day extensions without a plan for how restrictions will be modified prolongs uncertainty for both communities and creates unnecessary tension as we approach each new expiration,"" they wrote.

""We are asking that the United States and Canada immediately craft a comprehensive framework for phased reopening of the border based on objective metrics and accounting for the varied circumstances across border regions.""

That doesn't mean throwing open the border to Americans, Higgins said. But it could mean redefining essential travel to include foreign property owners and people with business interests or family members on the other side, provided they wear masks and practice physical distancing.

""Never in our lifetime have we had a situation where the health of you and your family is dependent on your fellow citizens to do the right thing,"" he said.

""A phased opening could expand the category of 'essential traveller,' but (include) certifying some way that you are adhering to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's protocol as it relates to stopping the spread of COVID-19.""

Ontario Premier Doug Ford, a pro-trade conservative and longtime champion of Canada-U.S. ties, has been among those urging zero tolerance at the border until the crisis in the U.S. has passed — a position spokeswoman Ivana Yelich reiterated Friday.

""The premier has been clear: the border must remain closed to non-essential travel until the U.S. has made significant progress in containing COVID-19,"" Yelich said. ""The recent spike in the number of COVID cases in the U.S. is very concerning. As such, the premier will continue to support restrictions at the U.S. border beyond the July 21 deadline.""

The worsening public health situation in the U.S. has not diminished the importance of cross-border business travel, including face-to-face meetings or technical on-site visits, to the health of Canada's economy, said Mark Agnew, director of international policy with the Canadian Chamber of Commerce.

Despite the best efforts of both countries, the current border measures have been confusing for some, causing stress and delays even for those who have work permits that allow them to cross, Agnew said.

""It would be helpful for the government to set out the circumstances under which border measures will start to normalize, to enable companies to plan.""

Despite the political challenges the U.S. outbreak now poses for the federal Liberal government in Canada, it's past time to start thinking about how to ease the border restrictions, said Laurie Trautman, director of the Border Policy Research Institute at Western Washington University in Bellingham, Wash.

""There is an immediate need to be more thoughtful and strategic about how our countries go about doing that,"" Trautman said, floating the idea of wider family exemptions and allowing homeowners to visit their foreign properties.

In northern Washington state, law enforcement is growing concerned about the challenge of protecting vacant homes owned by Canadians, she added.

""Grandparents should be able to see their grandkids,"" Trautman said. ""Exempting these two groups from the restrictions would not ‘open up the floodgates’ and seem reasonable and empathetic to me.""

Statistics Canada's labour force survey released Friday showed 953,000 jobs were added last month, including 488,000 full-time and 465,000 part-time positions. The unemployment rate fell to 12.3 per cent after hitting a record-high of 13.7 per cent in May.

article continues below

As in May, even though more people found jobs, more people were also looking for work as the labour force grew by about 786,000 after a gain of 491,000 in May, bringing it to within 443,000 of its pre-pandemic level.

Statistics Canada said the unemployment rate would have been 16.3 per cent had it included in unemployment counts those who wanted to work, but did not look for a job.

Job gains were made in every province, including by 378,000 in Ontario, marking the first increase since the COVID-19 shutdown, Statistics Canada said. It didn't include any gains in Toronto as restrictions in that city loosened after the survey week.

Despite the good news, economist Jim Stanford said there remains a historic crisis in the job market with high unemployment and hundreds of thousands who have left the labour force altogether.

Also, gains nationally were not shared equally among groups, with women, youth and low-wage workers still slower to rebound, which Stanford said could be problematic if those jobs don't ever come back.

""I worry about a coming second round of layoffs motivated not by health restrictions, but by companies deciding their businesses are going to be permanently smaller. So that would be qualitatively different and in a way worse,"" said Stanford, director of the Centre for Future Work in Vancouver.

""We aren't remotely out of the woods yet, but this was a really encouraging step forward.""

Some three million jobs were lost over March and April due to the pandemic, and 2.5 million more had their hours and earnings slashed. By last month, some 3.1 million were affected by the pandemic, including 1.4 million who weren't at work due to COVID-19.

Brendon Bernard, an economist at Indeed Canada, said recapturing jobs at the same pace in the coming months will be tougher.

""A lot of areas of the economy still aren't running at full capacity,"" Bernard said. ""So while doors may be open and customers might be coming in, business hasn't come back to normal.""

Despite the overall improvement, the oil and gas industry continues to struggle.

The PetroLMI Division of Energy Safety Canada says direct oil and gas employment fell by more than 6,700 positions in June compared with May, with about 70 per cent of the net job losses in Alberta.

Compared with a year earlier, employment in the oil and employment sector was down 17 per cent.

The overall job losses were unprecedented in speed and depth compared with previous recessions, Statistics Canada said, and the rebound to date sharper than previous downturns.

Ottawa's response has been equally unprecedented: a deficit of at least $343.2 billion this fiscal year as the Trudeau Liberals dole out some $230 billion in emergency aid.

In June, 28.3 per cent of Canadians aged 15 to 69 reported receiving some form of federal aid since mid-March, Statistics Canada said. Meanwhile, the proportion of households reporting difficulty paying the bills dropped to 20.1 per cent in June from 22.5 per cent in May.

""Without the federal government being there to support Canadian workers, Canadian businesses and the Canadian provinces and territories, we would be in a bigger mess in this country right now,"" Hassan Yussuff, president of the Canadian Labour Congress said in an interview this week.

The Bank of Canada and federal government believe the worst of the economic pain from the pandemic is behind the country, but Canada will face high unemployment and low growth until 2021.

In a statement, federal Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough touted the overall jobs numbers as a sign the government's plan was working, before adding many Canadians still ""face real challenges during this time.""

She and other ministers are now reshaping programs so fewer workers stay on the $80-billion emergency benefit, and more get tied to jobs through the $82-billion wage subsidy program.

""We understand the need for those emergency programs. We also understand as we reopen and recover, we have to move away from emergency programs and into stimulus and recovery,"" said Leah Nord, senior director of workforce strategies for the Canadian Chamber of Commerce.

She said there are other issues to resolve around health and safety in the workplace, transit, and child care to help more Canadians get back to work.

In provinces where daycares reopened for children five and under, employment levels returned to pre-pandemic levels for fathers in June, but not for mothers. Similarly, mothers with children under 18 were more likely than fathers to work less than half their usual hours in June, Statistics Canada said.

Job gains have come at a faster clip for men. Their unemployment rate hit 12.1 per cent in June compared to 12.7 per cent for women. And the underutilization rate — which counts those who are unemployed, those who want a job but didn't look for one, and those working less than half their usual hours — was 28.3 for women and 25.5 per cent for men.

Economist Armine Yalnizyan said the numbers underscore the need to provide child care as well as options for schooling in the fall so mothers can work.

The alternative, she said, could pull back any economic gains.

""It means that even if there are jobs, some women won't be able to take them because there's no way they can leave their kids,"" said Yalnizyan, a fellow on the future of workers at the Atkinson Foundation.

""So we are looking at the potential for an economic depression instead of talking about paces of recovery and pivoting to building to better.""

Three Cabinet ministers in the administration of Bolivian leader Jeanine Áñez have also tested positive for the virus, including Health Minister Eidy Roca and Presidency Minister Yerko Nuñez, who is hospitalized.

article continues below

The infections in Venezuela, Brazil and Bolivia, which is seeing a spike in cases, come after Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández tested positive in June and was briefly hospitalized.

Áñez said she will remain in isolation for 14 days when another test will be done, but she will continue to work remotely from the presidential residence.

""I feel good, I feel strong,"" she wrote on her Twitter account.

Bolivia’s Health Ministry says the Andean country has 42,984 confirmed coronavirus cases and 1,577 deaths, and is seeing a rebound in the number of new cases amid reports that hospitals are being overwhelmed in some regions. In the highland city of Cochabamba, scenes have emerged of bodies lying in the streets and coffins waiting for days in homes to be taken away.

Bolivia is scheduled to hold a presidential election Sept. 6. Áñez is running third in opinion polls. Former Economy Minister Luis Arce, who represents the party of ousted President Evo Morales, is in front, with ex-President Carlos Mesa in second.

In Venezuela, meanwhile, socialist party chief Diosdado Cabello revealed that he had tested positive for COVID-19, making him the highest-ranking leader in the distressed South American nation thus far to come down with the virus.

Cabello is considered the second-most powerful person in Venezuela after President Nicolás Maduro and made the announcement on Twitter, stating that he is isolated, getting treatment and will overcome the illness.

""We will win!"" he wrote in conclusion.

Economically struggling Venezuela is considered one of the world’s least prepared countries to confront the pandemic. Hospitals are routinely short on basic supplies like water, electricity and medicine.

The nation has registered considerably fewer COVID-19 cases than others in the region, but the number of infections has grown in recent weeks. As of Wednesday, the government had reported 8,010 confirmed cases and 75 deaths.

Cabello was last seen Tuesday, when he met with South Africa’s ambassador, Joseph Nkosi. Photographs released by the government showed him standing alongside and bumping fists with the diplomat while wearing a black mask.

The 57-year-old politician is head of the National Constituent Assembly, an all-powerful legislative body created by Maduro’s government in 2017. He had missed his weekly television program Wednesday, stating at the time that he was ""fighting against a strong allergy"" and resting.

Maduro said in a broadcast Thursday that Cabello’s diagnosis was confirmed with a molecular exam — a test that is usually conducted with a nasal swab sample. Venezuela has done far fewer of these tests than neighbouring countries, instead largely deploying rapid blood antibody tests. Some experts fear that relying so heavily on the rapid tests, which don’t detect signs of illness early in an infection, means cases are being missed.

""Venezuela is with Diosdado,"" Maduro said. ""I am sure soon enough we will continue on in this fight.""

In Brazil, President Jair Bolsonaro was diagnosed with COVID-19 on Tuesday.

He appeared Thursday on an online broadcast from the presidential residence as defiant as on previous occasions. He coughed once, but did not show other symptoms of the disease that has killed more than 69,000 people in the South American nation.

Bolsonaro repeated his view that the economic crisis brought on by the pandemic is more dangerous than the coronavirus itself. He insisted that mayors and governors need to reopen the country for business.

""We need governors and mayors, within their responsibilities, to reopen commerce. Otherwise the consequences will be harmful for Brazil,"" Bolsonaro said, wearing a gray shirt and sitting comfortably in front of two national flags.",[]

The Montreal-based company announced Thursday that it is sending notices to terminate the leases at the 124 stores to take effect in 30 days. The move would affect about half of its workforce of nearly 2,500, including all 366 employees in the United States.

It will also seek more favourable lease terms for the remaining 100 stores in Canada and may permanently shut additional locations if landlords are unwilling to negotiate suitable leases.

It had warned in mid-June that it could begin a formal restructuring depending on the outcome of its talks with landlords.

The company said at the time that it hadn't paid rent on any of its stores for April, May and June.

The store closures are part of its restructuring plan after it obtained court protection from creditors under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act and Chapter 15 in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.

""With the upcoming closure of 124 unprofitable stores across North America, we are certainly making good progress in creating a stronger business model for the future and ensuring the long-term success and sustainability of DavidsTea and our beloved brand,"" company founder and interim CEO Herschel Segal said in a news release.

Chief financial officer Frank Zitella said that with the closure of ""a significant number of money-losing stores"" it will focus exclusively on e-commerce sale which had a penetration rate of close to 43 per cent in the market before COVID-19.

""All 100 remaining DavidsTea stores have been closed since March 17 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and will remain so until further notice,"" he stated.

DavidsTea last month reported that it lost $23.2 million last year on $146.5 million in revenues. That includes a US$4.3 million loss in its fiscal fourth quarter on US$54.8 million of revenues.

The move by DavidsTea comes three years after Starbucks announced the closure of all of its Teavana brand stores. The coffee giant acquired Teavana Holdings in 2012 for US$620 million.

The cancellation of the 2020 national football championship game because of COVID-19, and U Sports not altering an age eligibility rule, accelerates the swan song of roughly 300 football players.

article continues below

U Sports has said student-athletes whose championships are cancelled in 2020-21 because of the pandemic will not lose a year of eligibility.

But football players have seven years after graduating from high school to complete their five-year eligibility. Many play junior football before entering the university ranks.

The only U Sports sport with an age limit is football.

University of Calgary quarterback Josiah Joseph of the defending Vanier Cup champion Dinos is among those caught in a rule designed to limit the age of players in Canadian university football to under 25.

Players who turn 25 before Sept. 1 age out of university football. Joseph turns 25 on July 10, 2021.

Approximately 300 players out of 2,335 will be similarly impacted in 2021, according to U Sports.

Joseph hoped U Sports would make an exception for players like him.

""All they would have to do is amend the rule and push it to maybe January first due to extreme circumstances,"" he told The Canadian Press.

""It's devastating there's that many players in my position.""

U Sports adopted a football age cap to prevent large gaps in physical maturation and experience between players in a collision sport, and also to create room on rosters for younger players, according to U Sports interim CEO Dick White.

""I really understand the disappointment of the players that this affects,"" said White, who took over for departed CEO Graham Brown last month.

""Our legal advice that we received was very firm. If we believe the age cap should be 25 for the health and safety of athletes then we should not under any circumstances alter that.

""The reasons for having that age cap have not changed even though we've had the tragedy of COVID.""

Joseph argues there is no physical or experience difference between a player who turns 25 in March and one who turns 25 in October.

""There's already 25 year olds playing in the league so what's the difference of a couple months?"" he asked. ""There is none.""

U Sport cancelling the 2020 Vanier Cup and the two bowl games — Mitchell and Uteck — that serve as semifinals doesn't stop conferences from playing football in the fall.

But Canada West, Ontario University Athletics and Atlantic University Sport have already declared there won't be football in 2020 because of the pandemic.

The Reseau du sport etudiant du Quebec is still working on running football this fall.

University of Bisons head coach Brian Dobie points out fifth-year players aren't the only ones impacted.

Any current university football player whose birthday falls before Sept. 1 will lose a year of football eligibility because of the combination of the pandemic and the current rule.

""What about that kid who had two years left and he just got a starting spot? Now Johnny has one year left. What about Billy who had three years left and now has two years left?"" Dobie asked.

""If you have one kid in your program that is negatively affected by this, as a coach you should be outraged. Every kid should count just the same and you should be outraged.""

Losing a year of football eligibility also means losing a year of athletic scholarship to pay for school, Dobie added.

""The reality is the age cap is 25 and it's not 26 and somewhere you draw the line,"" White said.

""If the football institutions wish to re-address the age cap to 26 or no age cap, that's up to our member institutions. There's a process to do that.

""The big picture here was there was a very good reason we put the age cap in. Our board of directors, supported by the legal opinion, said 'don't move it.'""

Joseph doesn't buy that rationale.

""It doesn't seem like it's reflecting the interests of a lot of coaches and players that make up U Sports football that make it successful, the guys that are going to be there for five years who are going to graduate that are going to be proud alumni,"" he said.

""That's what makes up university football in Canada.""

In addition to the impact on each individual’s care, test data is critical to strategic planning and public policy.

As well as informing us, however, testing issues have also created a great deal of confusion and frustration. The terminology and specifics are new to most, and the criteria for and access to testing has fluctuated a great deal in a short period of time. After four months, here’s where we stand:

article continues below

Summary points

* Testing is now available to anyone with symptoms of COVID-19, however mild;

* Those needing COVID-19 assessment are encouraged to call their family doctor or nurse practitioner's office, call 811, or attend the hospital emergency department (ER);

* Powell River and qathet Region District have had very few confirmed cases of COVID-19 to date, but remain at risk for future outbreaks. Ongoing attention to public health measures is still critically important.

Criteria for testing

Most COVID-19 patients have cold or flu-like symptoms, though onset may be gradual over days. Those with severe symptoms should attend the ER without delay. Common symptoms include fever, fatigue, cough, shortness of breath, muscle aches, sore throat, lack of appetite, and loss of taste or smell. Headaches, confusion, runny nose, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and rashes are less typical, but may occur.

People without any symptoms (asymptomatic) are not generally tested in BC, except in special circumstances such as a public health investigation of an outbreak. In addition to using limited resources, testing asymptomatic individuals can lead to high rates of false positives (test is positive, but the person doesn’t actually have the virus). An online symptom checker is available at https://bc.thrive.health/covid19/en, or through 811.

Where to get tested

People are encouraged to call their nurse practitioner or family doctor if they feel they may have COVID-19. In addition to reviewing criteria for testing, a primary care provider knows their patient's medical history and can direct them accordingly. Some clinics offer testing on site, including drive-through testing, while others will refer to another office or to the hospital.

Assessment and testing for COVID-19 at Powell River General Hospital is located in the ambulance bay of the ER. There is a separated space for one patient at a time, and it is cleaned after each use. Efforts are being made to reduce wait times, but these do vary.

Those coming to the ER for respiratory symptoms or COVID-19 assessment are encouraged to call ahead (604.485.3211), and will be directed outside to the ambulance entrance where there is a buzzer to advise staff on arrival. Testing is available 24/7, if needed.

People being assessed and tested for COVID-19 will only be brought into the main ER department if they need further investigations or treatment. Dedicated areas are used for this purpose.

Procedure for outpatient testing

Testing for COVID-19 involves essentially a small cotton swab on a plastic stick that is inserted into one’s nose, turned a few times, then removed and placed in a tube. Nasal swabs may make one’s eyes water, but are generally described as uncomfortable rather than painful.

Locally, all COVID-19 swabs are packaged at the hospital and flown to Vancouver once or twice daily for processing. Results are typically by 8 am the day after they are received in Vancouver.

Powell River Hospital has secured a small supply of rapid tests that can identify a COVID-19 result within an hour. Owing to the very limited supply, these are generally reserved for critical situations.

Most people with COVID-19 (over 80 per cent) will be well enough to stay at home during their illness.

After being tested, patients are given instructions and an information sheet on how to self-isolate until test results are available. Staying home when sick is considered by many experts as the single most effective strategy to limit COVID-19 in a community.

Results

To confirm a negative test people may wish to speak with their primary care provider, use myehealth.ca, or call the BCCDC negative results line between 8:30 am and 4:30 pm, seven days per week, at 1.833.707.2792.

Those with positive test results will be notified rapidly by Public Health. In BC thus far, over 98 per cent of positive cases were reached in under 24 hours. The family doctor or nurse practitioner will also receive the result.

If someone tests positive for COVID-19, a public health staff member will call them daily until they are cleared (usually 10 days if minimal symptoms). They will offer direction on self-isolation and help advise how to manage symptoms, including when to seek further care.

The public health team will also take a detailed history to identify who has had close contact with a positive case, including up to 48 hours before that person's symptoms first developed.

Those people identified by public health as having a significant risk of exposure (e.g. sustained close contact, household members, no physical distancing or protective equipment) will be notified as soon as possible, and will be advised to self-isolate (and to test if they develop symptoms). Contact tracing is not generally done for very brief, distanced, or other low risk encounters.

Future plans

Blood testing for immunity (i.e. past infection) is not yet available for routine use. It is still unclear how accurate these tests are, and how long immunity from natural infection can be detected.

As we move into the fall, we expect an increase in respiratory viruses of all types. Detailed plans for additional testing sites have been developed and will be implemented based on capacity and need.

Powell River data

Local medical officer of health Dr. Geoff McKee reported last week that the lower Sunshine Coast has had a total of six cases thus far in the pandemic, and that Powell River region has had fewer than five cases to date (because of the low number and the potential privacy risk for so few cases, the exact number was not given).

Dr. McKee also noted that there were no active cases being followed on the Sunshine Coast. Unfortunately, there could be cases that simply aren’t identified yet, or new cases that may arise at any time. For this reason, regardless of the exact number of confirmed cases, we all need to follow public health recommendations if we hope to protect our community from this virus.

A recent survey completed by the Powell River Division of Family Practice identified that roughly three per cent of people surveyed in our region have been tested for COVID-19. Several barriers to testing were identified by community members, which we are working to address.

Conclusion

While our region has had relatively little COVID-19 activity thus far, global cases continue to rise rapidly. Until there is widespread immunity or a universally effective treatment, we are all vulnerable.

Local physicians will continue to prepare and behave as if there are active cases in the community. Staying home when sick, washing hands, physical distancing with most people, and wearing masks or protective equipment when needed, continue to be the cornerstones of defence for all of us.

In addition public health measures, testing (and contact tracing) is an extremely powerful tool to limit the spread of COVID-19. Anyone who thinks they may have symptoms should call their family doctor or nurse practitioner, call 811, or attend our local emergency department.

Be smart, be safe, and be kind. We are in this together.

Seniors, in particular, are a focus of the report from the Senate's social affairs committee, from those in long-term care homes to those with low incomes.

article continues below

Just this week, the Liberals rolled out one-time special payments of $300 to the more than six million people who receive old-age security, and $200 more for the 2.2 million who also receive the guaranteed income supplement.

The income supports are meant to help seniors facing increased costs as a result of the pandemic, such as more frequent prescription fees and delivery charges for groceries.

Senators on the committee wrote of evidence of ""financial insecurity and increased vulnerability"" for low-income seniors as a result of the first wave of the novel coronavirus.

A potential second wave, which could coincide with the annual flu season that starts in the fall, would make the situation even worse for these seniors ""without concrete and timely government action,"" the report says.

Senators say the Liberals should deliver a plan to help low-income seniors, among other populations vulnerable to economic shocks like new immigrants, no later than the end of August, and contain short- and long-term options.

The report also says the federal government needs to pay urgent attention to seniors in long-term care homes where outbreaks and deaths in the pandemic have been concentrated.

The document made public Thursday morning is the committee's first set of observations on the government's response to the pandemic, with a final report expected later this year.

Before then, the Liberals are planning to provide another economic update like the one delivered Wednesday, or possibly a full budget. The government shelved plans to deliver one at the end of March when the House of Commons went on extended hiatus due to the pandemic.

The long-awaited economic ""snapshot,"" as the Liberals styled it, said federal spending is closing in on $600 billion this fiscal year. That means a deficit of $343 billion, fuelled by emergency pandemic aid that the government budgets at over $230 billion.

The Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada said the spending figures demand a ""full and transparent assessment"" to see what worked, what didn't and what needs to change for an economic recovery.

Hassan Yussuff, president of the Canadian Labour Congress, said the Liberals should take back up their promise to create a national pharmacare system as the government considers its next steps.

A federal advisory council last year calculated the cost of a program at over $15 billion annually, depending on its design.

""The last thing we want to have is Canadians in frail health as we're dealing with this pandemic and I think the government really needs to think of that,"" Yussuff said in an interview Wednesday.

""Had it not been for the health care system we have right now,"" he added later, ""think of how this country would have fared in this pandemic.""

The Senate committee's report also notes the national emergency stockpile of personal protective gear like masks, gowns and gloves wasn't managed well over the years, nor sufficiently stocked when the pandemic struck.

Committee members added concerns that military members could be deployed without sufficient personal protective equipment because of ""inconsistencies from international procurement.""

The stock market crash in March and the plunge in interest rates left many investors feeling uncertain and vulnerable, while still more have been left without work.

Tina Cheung, a wealth adviser at Vancity, says it is always important to review your financial plan on a regular basis, but a review can be especially important during times like these.

""During these times of uncertainty it is important to have peace of mind, and to have that peace of mind, to achieve it, is to get a financial check up,"" she said.

Investors who were shocked at the state of their investment portfolios at the end of the first quarter might breathe a sigh of relief when checking their statements for the second quarter as stock markets have rallied off their lows seen near the end of March.

However, Canada's main stock index is still down from where it was a year ago and well off the highs it hit in February before the pandemic struck the markets.

""The effects of the pandemic on the market will eventually pass, like the global financial crisis did, but if these few months created any stress or loss of sleep, we need to go back and talk about your risk appetite,"" Cheung says.

But she says if your risk appetite has not changed and your goal hasn't changed, then it is critical to think long term and stick to your plan.

Before heading into a meeting with your adviser, it is important to have a firm grip of your budget and what your goals are for the meeting.

Cheung says you need to be prepared to have an open discussion and be ready with information like your monthly income and expenses.

For some, reviewing their financial plan may mean difficult decisions, facing depleted emergency funds due to the loss of a job and little prospect for a return to work at a level seen before the pandemic.

A poll done for TD Bank found that 38 per cent of those surveyed identified as financially vulnerable in April 2020 compared with 15 per cent in November last year. The poll also found that 13 per cent of those asked in April felt confident in their financial future compared with 20 per cent in November 2019.

If you have taken advantage of the payment deferrals offered by many lenders, you need to have a clear plan for when those deferral periods come to an end and you need to resume making payments.

Gio Bazile, a district vice-president at TD Bank, says some borrowers may start to struggle once the deferrals come to an end if their income hasn't picked back up again.

""Part of what is going to be really critical is understanding what your future cash flow is going to look like and how do you work with your financial adviser with an impending financial hardship, how do you best balance your wants and needs,"" he said.

Bazile says everyone is going to face their own situation, but it's key to have a candid conversation with your partner or family to understand where you are financially.

""If your cash flow is low or if you are kind of over-leveraged from a debt perspective, then that's probably a time to actually spend some time with your financial adviser,"" he said.

""If you're looking at your savings account and realizing, wait a minute, I may not be able to get through this next two, three months and beyond, that's probably another really big trigger.""

That is, if they can survive long enough to see daylight again.

Those were two of the conclusions in the most recent Restaurants Canada survey of its member businesses.

article continues below

The survey, which heard from nearly 1,000 restaurant owners representing more than 11,500 restaurants, found 56 per cent of restaurant owners believed it would require a year or more to recover from the pandemic, and that at least 50 per cent of them are currently operating at a loss. “Restaurateurs are eager to help rebuild the economy and revive neighbourhoods, but they’re going to need continued assistance from government to remain operational under ongoing restrictions,” said the organization’s vice-president, David Lefebvre.

The results of the survey come as no surprise to Ian Tostenson, president of the B.C. Restaurant and Foodservices Association.

While Tostenson said the provincial situation is a bit of a “mixed bag” of results as B.C. continues to open up its economy, he made it clear there is trouble in the industry.

“Of the nearly 15,000 restaurants in B.C. maybe 60 per cent are actually up and running,” he said, noting many have decided to remain closed temporarily as there’s no business for them and others have closed for good. “Some may never come back. We expect to lose between 20 and 30 per cent of the industry … it’s just too much to expect some of these small businesses to hold on.”

That is especially true in the major markets.

“Downtown Victoria and downtown Vancouver are just disasters,” he said. Downtown restaurants rely heavily on tourism and office workers to stay afloat. “Volumes in those two big markets are tracking 20-30 per cent of where they were at this point last year.”

On the upside, Tostenson said suburban operators and restaurants in small cities and towns around B.C. have reported doing alright.

Overall, he said, they are still dealing with the fact people aren’t yet feeling safe about going out to eat despite the myriad safety precautions the industry has taken.

The survey results have spurred Restaurants Canada to call for the federal government to extend and strengthen support for food-service businesses by maintaining the federal wage subsidy, extending and expanding rent-relief programs and expanding loans for small business.

The first time, he showed up an hour before the public testing site was set to close and was told they had reached capacity. He was turned away from a second centre when rain shut it down, and voluntarily left a third after someone ahead of him said they had been waiting in line for more than three hours.

article continues below

""If you have symptoms and you are just driving around the city trying to figure out how you can get a test, for people who are positive, it is not ideal,"" said Lee, who finally got a test on June 29 after he showed up at a site before dawn and waited for more than two hours. Another five days passed before he was able to view the results online, and he didn't receive a text with the results until seven days after being tested.

Four months, 3 million confirmed infections and over 130,000 deaths into the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S., Americans confronted with a resurgence of the scourge are facing long lines at testing sites in the summer heat or are getting turned away. Others are going a week or more without receiving a diagnosis.

Some sites are running out of kits, while labs are reporting shortages of materials and workers to process the swabs.

Some frustrated Americans are left to wonder why the U.S. can't seem to get its act together, especially after it was given fair warning as the virus wreaked havoc in China and then Italy, Spain and New York.

""It’s a hot mess,"" said 47-year-old Jennifer Hudson of Tucson, Arizona. ""The fact that we’re relying on companies and we don’t have a national response to this, it’s ridiculous. … It’s keeping people who need tests from getting tests.""

It took Hudson five days to make an appointment through a CVS pharmacy near her home. She booked a drive-up test over the weekend, more than a week after her symptoms — fatigue, shortness of breath, headache and sore throat — first emerged. The clinic informed her that her results would probably be delayed.

Testing has been ramped up nationwide, reaching about 640,000 tests per day on average, up from around 518,000 two weeks ago, according to an Associated Press analysis. Newly confirmed infections per day in the U.S. are running at over 50,000, breaking records at practically every turn.

More testing tends to lead to more cases found. But in an alarming indicator, the percentage of tests coming back positive for the virus is on the rise across nearly the entire country, hitting almost 27% in Arizona, 19% in Florida and 17% in South Carolina.

While the U.S. has conducted more tests than any other nation, it ranks in the middle of the pack in testing per capita, behind Russia, Spain and Australia, according to Johns Hopkins University.

""I am stunned that as a nation, six months into this pandemic, we still can’t figure out how to deliver testing to the American people when they need it,"" said Dr. Ashish Jha, director of Harvard’s Global Health Institute. ""It is an abject failure of leadership and shows that the federal government has not prioritized testing in a way that will allow us to get through this pandemic.""

Testing alone without adequate contact tracing and quarantine measures won't control the spread of the scourge, according to health experts. But they say delays in testing can lead to more infections by leaving people in the dark as to whether they need to isolate themselves.

In other developments:

— While the number of confirmed cases in the U.S. hit 3 million Wednesday by Johns Hopkins' count, health officials have said that because of inadequate testing and the many mild infections that have gone unreported, the real number is about 10 times higher, or almost 10% of the U.S. population.

— A crowd of thousands attending President Donald Trump’s campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in late June, along with large groups of people who showed up to protest, ""likely contributed"" to a dramatic surge in new coronavirus cases in the area, Tulsa City-County Health Department Director Dr. Bruce Dart said Wednesday. Tulsa County reported 261 confirmed cases on Monday, a new record one-day high, and another 206 confirmed cases on Tuesday. A spokesman for the Trump campaign didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

— Most New York City students will return to school in the fall two or three days a week and learn online the rest of the time under a plan announced by Mayor Bill de Blasio. He said schools can’t accommodate all their students at any one time and maintain social distancing. The school system in New York is the biggest in the nation, with 1.1 million students. It has been closed since March.

In New York City, the most lethal hot spot in the nation during the spring, testing was scarce early on but is now widely available. As many as 35,000 tests are conducted daily through a combination of private health organizations and city agencies, according to the city Health Department.

""Widespread testing holds the key to reopening our city safely,"" de Blasio said.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services this week said it will open free ""surge testing"" sites in three hard-hit cities: Jacksonville, Florida; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; and Edinburg, Texas. The sites will be able to conduct as many as 5,000 tests a day in each city, with results in three to five days, officials said.

In Georgia, one of the states where cases are surging, officials are rushing to expand testing capacity as demand threatens to overwhelm six major sites around Atlanta, said DeKalb County CEO Michael Thurmond.

""If you project this out over the next three weeks, we can’t handle it,"" he said.

In New Orleans, people were turned away from a free testing site for a third consecutive day after it reached its daily allotment of tests. Health care providers are running low on trays and chemicals needed to run machines used in the tests.

Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego called the situation there ""desperate"" as residents have sat in sun-baked cars for up to 13 hours to get drive-thru testing. Robert Fenton, head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said FEMA is doubling the testing supplies it plans to ship to Arizona.

Patrick Friday, a United Methodist minister in Alabama, went to several hospitals and clinics in Birmingham this week to get checked after his school-age son tested positive. But he was told that unless he had a preexisting condition, he didn’t qualify.

Finally, he ended up at a site offering rapid-result tests and his negative result came back quickly.

""We are several months into this,"" he said. ""How can it be that we can’t go in and get a test?""

""Unfortunately, as we don't anticipate ridership to be back to pre-COVID-19 levels in the foreseeable future, we had to make difficult decisions to deal with the situation as we gain a better understanding of the impacts of the pandemic on our operations,"" Cynthia Garneau, Via's president and CEO, said in a statement Wednesday.

The layoffs take effect on July 24. Affected employees will receive a temporary written layoff notice that respects their collective agreement's terms, the Montreal-based company said. It will maintain access to different programs for the employees.

The company is working to advance its service resumption plan and has seen some recent positive developments, though many routes remain interrupted.

Winnipeg to Churchill is the sole route in service, according to Via Rail's website, which was last updated June 26.

Several routes have partially resumed, while Toronto to Niagara Falls, Toronto to Vancouver, and Montreal to Halifax remain interrupted with all trains cancelled. Some of those routes are slated to resume service Nov. 1.

Via Rail said it plans to bring back employees ""as soon as the customer demand allows it.""

The passenger rail service has faced a rough year with rail blockades impacting service earlier in 2020.

""The current year has been filled with unprecedented challenges,"" said Garneau.

The company temporarily laid off roughly the same number of employees in B.C. and Ontario during rail blockades in the winter. The company said in March that most of those employees would be brought back early that month.

Some routes in those provinces were halted when protests in solidarity with the Wet’suwet’en First Nation blocked railways across Canada.

Morneau delivered a ""snapshot"" of the federal finances Wednesday, for the first time since the pandemic brought much of Canada's economy to its knees.

article continues below

In the update, he said the government is well aware some segments of the population are hurting more than others.

""This crisis has exposed and amplified many inequalities in Canada,"" Morneau said.

The same people have in many cases also been affected more by the virus itself, in part because women, new immigrants, racialized Canadians and Indigenous people are more likely to work in the jobs where contagion is a risk, such as health care, retail and warehouse work.

The documents are careful to note that while racialized Canadians are more likely to work in economic sectors hit hard by the virus — including health care, accommodation and food services — little data has been collected to truly understand the impact on visible minorities and other marginalized communities.

So for example, there is no racial breakdown of who applied for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.

Nor has much data been collected on the ethnicities of people diagnosed with COVID-19. One recent report from Ottawa Public Health said two-thirds of cases over the previous six weeks in its territory were racialized Canadians or new immigrants, but that report was limited in scope and for just one city.

The fiscal snapshot shows women, youth, low-wage workers, racialized Canadians, Indigenous people and new immigrants all saw higher rates of job loss or reduced working hours, and are also seeing slow, and in some cases no, benefits as the economy begins to recover.

Jobs in sectors dominated by men, such as construction and manufacturing, were faster to come back than those in service industries, tourism, and accommodation, where women and immigrants tend to be employed in bigger proportion.

New Canadians in particular have seen very little job recovery thus far, the report says.

Businesses owned by women and racialized Canadians were more likely to report declines in orders and clients, and a higher need for rent relief.

Women were also hit harder by the closing of schools and daycares, with women who have kids under the age of six reporting significantly larger declines in hours worked than women with no children or older ones.

""Going forward, anything we do must be about growth, resilience, and creating opportunity for those who were most impacted by this crisis,"" said Morneau.

""This pandemic has identified clear gaps and it’s giving us a chance to reset.""

Exactly how he plans to do that is not clear. The government has said some of the $14-billion aid package offered to provinces to help them safely reopen their economies needs to include child care investments.

""We've been very clear that having access to child care is going to be critically important for us to get back to work,"" Morneau said in a news conference with reporters. ""Women have been harder hit through the course of this pandemic and our measures therefore need to consider that challenge.""

But a month after Ottawa put the $14 billion on the table, the provinces have not yet accepted Ottawa's requirements for getting access to that money.

There is also little information about how the government intends to try to level the economic playing field so the gaps that led to inequalities going into the pandemic are closed.

Morneau said for now the government is focused on the safe restart of the economy and the longer-term recovery plan is still in development.

Green MP Elizabeth May said governments have to make child care and safe school reopenings a bigger priority because without those things, parents — and most often mothers — are not going to be able to return to work.

""We know that's an economic blow we can't risk and we know that's a step back for women's rights we can't accept,"" she said.

May said the snapshot was ""exception"" for the depth of its gender-based analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on women. She said the answer to stopping the damage is three things: ""Child care, child care, child care.""

“The court has gradually resumed some regular operations, including trials, chambers applications and other hearings and conferences, many of which proceed remotely,” B.C. Supreme Court Chief Justice Christopher Hinkson said in a July 7 directive.

“While the court has expanded the scope of its in-person operations, counsel, parties, litigants and members of the public are discouraged from attending courthouses unless their personal attendance is necessary or the court so directs,” he said.

B.C. Court of Appeal

In B.C.’s high court, the suspension of service and filing deadlines for existing appeals and chambers applications started March 18 and has been extended to July 27. As of July 14, parties may now request that appeal hearings proceed in a courtroom or by Zoom videoconference.

The court registry is accepting filings in all matters. In civil appeals, electronic filing remains mandatory for lawyers and optional for self-represented litigants.

The time periods for filing cases remains suspended.

“You can wait without concern that the limitation period to start civil or family proceedings will expire,” a July 7 directive from Chief Justice Robert Bauman said.

“Persons in the courtroom are not required to wear masks, but everyone may of course do so, except when addressing the Court at the hearing,” Bauman said. “Counsel/litigants must bring their own water supply and present their arguments from their own table (individual lecterns will be provided). Furniture will be cleaned and disinfected between hearings.”



B.C. Supreme Court

Effective July 13, in-person registry services will resume at all Supreme Court registries and the interim process for requesting a hearing of an urgent or essential matter will no longer be available, Hinkson said.

In criminal matters, bail and bail review hearings, detention review hearings, regular fix-date appearances and regular pre-trial conferences, COVID pre-trial conferences and case management conferences will continue by phone, a directive from Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes said.

Those using registries are recommended to continue using electronic, mail or fax filings where possible.

For family law matters, parties are no longer automatically relieved of the requirement to attend a judicial case conference before making an application by written submissions but that can still be done via phone.

Judicial case conferences already scheduled to occur on or after June 1 will resume by phone.

Civil and family trials scheduled to begin on or after June 8 have resumed unless otherwise directed.

“The resumption of civil and family trials may be subject to change as a result of limitations on available facilities or public health recommendations,” Hinkson said.

Jury selections remain cancelled until September. In civil cases where a jury notice has been filed and served, if all parties consent to proceeding by judge alone, they may seek such an order at a trial management conference.

Effective April 15, a ministerial order suspended limitation periods and mandatory time periods for the commencement of a civil or family proceedings from March 18, 2020 to the date on which the last extension of the declaration of the state of emergency.

“Once this suspension is lifted, more directions will be provided by the court,” Hinkson said.



B.C. Provincial Court

Chief Judge Melissa Gillespie announced July 8, provincial court would return to receiving all filings at the applicable court registry either in-person or remotely.

The provincial court had already begun re-opening June 15 courtrooms on a limited basis outside hub centres of Surrey, Vancouver Victoria, Prince George, and Kelowna where limited in-person hearings began a week earlier.

As of July 8, 2020, registries will accept all family cases filings. Small claims filings will be accepted July 13 while urgent small claims matters will only be heard by telephone.

237,newwestrecord,https://www.newwestrecord.ca/covid-19/federal-website-advertising-hundreds-of-non-existent-student-volunteer-positions-1.24166955,Federal website advertising hundreds of non-existent student-volunteer positions,[],,"OTTAWA — The federal website advertising volunteer positions for students hoping to earn money for their educations through a $900-million government aid program contains hundreds of positions that do not actually exist.

Among the student-volunteer positions advertised as available on the I Want to Help website are 1,500 spots with YMCA Canada to help create online exercise regimes for kids and seniors in their communities.

Yet the YMCA says those positions were actually the brainchild of WE Charity, the organization originally tapped by the Liberal government to administer the Canada Student Services Grant, and that the YMCA never agreed to them.

Both the YMCA and WE blame a miscommunication as WE scrambled to get the grant program — through which students can get up to $5,000 toward their schooling if they volunteer the maximum 500 hours — up and running as quickly as possible.

WE has since withdrawn from running the program.

In an interview, YMCA Canada president Peter Dinsdale said his organization proposed hosting 391 volunteers through dozens of YMCA locations. They would focus on three areas: helping local branches with marketing and website design; data analysis; and assisting seniors with tech questions.

The YMCA arrived at the number after reaching out to branches across the country, Dinsdale said, after which the national office drew up a draft memorandum of understanding with WE to formalize the arrangement.

""We sent a draft in and they sent a draft back and that's when we saw these other positions and we asked to separate them,"" he said of the 1,500 positions for online exercise regimes. ""And they said great. And we haven't heard from them since all this has gone down.""

""These discussions (with the YMCA) took place quickly, given our short timeline for delivery, and some confusion arose around the two separate agreements,"" WE said in a statement to The Canadian Press.

""That confusion contributed to a misunderstanding on our part which led to one group of service positions being posted, rather than the other group of service positions.""

It nonetheless means those advertised positions are not actually available.

The status of thousands of other positions apparently created by WE to meet the requirements of the volunteer program remains uncertain.

Youth Minister Bardish Chagger's spokeswoman Danielle Keenan stood by the Canada Student Services Grant program on Wednesday, saying that while there will be delays in its rollout following WE's departure, the government remains committed to it.

""The Canada Student Service Grants program provides opportunities for students who want to help with their communities COVID-19 response,"" Keenan said in an email to The Canadian Press.

""Although the delivery of the program will change, our objective has not changed which is to ensure students, not-for-profits, and communities are supported throughout the pandemic.""

WE and the Liberal government announced last week that they were ending a sole-sourced contract to have the charity manage the grant program after questions were raised about a potential conflict of interest between Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the organization.

Dinsdale said the YMCA did not know the 1,500 positions had been posted, noting the agreement with WE was never signed. At the same time, the 391 positions that the YMCA does want to fill have yet to be advertised. Dinsdale said the YMCA is waiting to hear from the government on those.

""The 391 that we're actually putting forward, our Ys are ready and willing to engage in it and there are some really interesting opportunities that could exist for youth and our YMCAs and communities,"" he said. ""So we're certainly hopeful those go ahead.""

Thousands of other positions posted on the federal website involve the creation of online content or the mentoring of other students on such topics as COVID-19's impact on the environment, nutrition and cyberbullying.

Some of those are posted in huge batches, such as a call for 1,000 volunteers to be trained to hold one-to-one sessions with people on ""the impact of COVID-19 on food security in your community.""

Another seeks 1,250 volunteers to devise ""social-media assets"" such as captions, memes and videos, for local and regional awareness campaigns to help stop the spread of COVID-19.

None of those postings includes the name of a hosting organization: they're listed as ""supporting local non-profits in your community"" rather than with a specific agency.

WE did indicate that it was behind many of them as it sought to meet the government's requirement that in order to be eligible for the student grant, positions must be linked to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""The purpose of the CSSG was to engage tens of thousands of post-secondary students in service programs to assist with the impact of COVID-19,"" WE said in its statement.

""COVID-19 has been in Canada for a relatively short period of time and there are limited new service opportunities related to addressing (it). This is partly why WE was brought in (to) develop and co-ordinate service roles that fulfil the program guidelines and deliver a meaningful impact.""

Employment and Social Development Canada, which will now administer the grant program instead of WE, did not respond to repeated questions about the positions, including whether they would move ahead or not.

Conservative employment critic Dan Albas said the questions about the federal website underscore the need for answers when it comes to the student grant program, including how positions have been chosen or created and what benefit they are expected to have.

""To find out that perhaps hundreds of positions have been put forward and in good faith maybe people have applied for those positions without having a correction from the government?"" he said.

""This is public money. They need to come clean and clean up this program so that any dollar that is spent gets the maximum opportunities for young people and value for money for taxpayer dollars.""

The service industry — which includes businesses such as hair salons, schools, hospitals, gyms, hotels and restaurants — have racked up 104 orders out of 334 issued to up to July 3.

The next most common industry to receive an order as of July 3, is the manufacturing sector, which includes meat processing plants, which have been hard hit by COVID-19, including a poultry plant in Coquitlam, as well as breweries, sawmills and pharmaceuticals.

In mid-May, an outbreak at Superior Poultry was declared over, and the plant allowed to re-open after instituting safety protocols.

Still, WorkSafeBC reports that most employers are doing their due diligence when it comes to meeting industry-specific guidelines.

However, when employers aren’t taking measures to protect workers from COVID-19 exposure, they could be issued an order for health or safety violations.

For the most part, though, employers have been taking the proper steps to re-open their businesses safely during the provincial re-start plan.

“Overall, the vast majority of employers are taking health and safety very seriously during the re-opening. Our inspections are finding that businesses want to be in compliance, and our prevention officers are providing support to help them have an effective COVID-19 Safety Plan,” stated Ivy Yuen, media relations representative in an email to The Tri-City News.

Data is not broken down regionally, so it is difficult to ascertain how many Tri-City businesses were given an order to beef up health and safety protocols.

Since, June 26, WorkSafeBC has conducted more than 12,000 worksite inspections in B.C. related to COVID-19.

The focus of these inspections has been to ensure employers have a COVID-19 Safety Plan in place, according to Yuen, who noted: “This plan needs to assess the risks to workers, and implement measures to prevent the transmission of COVID-19 in the workplace.”

Orders are usually issued as a result of an inspection or can be part of a follow-up activity.

Data posted by WorkPlace BC online shows that employers have a lot of questions about how to manage in the new pandemic reality. In recent weeks, it has has fielded 9,823 questions, 1,728 reports of potential violations and 21 workplace incidents.

There have also been 12,646 inspections, with the large service sector receiving the most at 4,615, followed by 2,988 for trade-related businesses, which includes supermarkets, retail stores and gas stations, 1,256 for the manufacturing sector, 886 for primary resource companies, such as oil and gas, 234 for transportation and warehousing, and 180 for the public sector, including government and law enforcement.

Other industries are being ordered to improve their safety protocols, according to the data.

Inspectors have issues 65 orders for the trade sector, 60 for construction, 18 for primary resources, three for public sector and two for transportation and warehousing, which includes taxis and ride hailing.",[]

Golf Canada reports that there were 17 per cent more scores registered with the national sport body this June compared to the same month last year. A total of 1,483,506 rounds were submitted to Golf Canada's handicap calculator last month compared to 1,271,782 in June 2019.

""It was a pretty big jump from last year, comparing 2019 numbers to this year,"" said Adam Helmer, senior director of golf services for Golf Canada, on Wednesday. ""We were expecting that as golf has emerged as one of the safest activities, where people can be physically distant and we've reduced touchpoints.""

The surge in June ended a streak of three months when recreational rounds played in Canada dropped precipitously due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

As restrictions were lifted across the country in May, the number of scores registered increased.

In May, 165,026 rounds were registered between the 1st and the 15th but 265,480 scores were submitted in the final two weeks of that month. The May 1-15 numbers are a nearly 40 per cent drop from the same period in 2019 (211,809) but the May 16-30 numbers are just five per cent lower than last year (269,266).

Helmer said he expects the number of rounds submitted to Golf Canada to continue to climb through July and into August.

""We've heard anecdotally that a lot of newcomers have joined the sport, especially now that school is done we're going to see an increase in juniors too. We think the trend is going to continue,"" said Helmer. ""Golf has seen a pretty big lift and it's emerged as the sport of the summer.""

The upward trend comes even as Golf Canada had to cancel all of its amateur and professional championships due to travel restrictions put in place to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.

A shift in how scores are registered has also been seen, with most recreational players entering their scores online instead of in the course's clubhouse or pro shop, which have largely been closed this summer because of physical distancing protocols.

Golf Canada plans to launch an updated version of its scoring app later this month, helping to keep players physically distant and improve their game.

He cautioned Wednesday (July 8) some “hotspots” still remain in long-term care and some agricultural setting.

article continues below

The prime minister made the comments in a media briefing ahead of a scheduled fiscal update — or “snapshot” — from Finance Minister Bill Morneau later in the day.

Trudeau said he would leave the details of the snapshot to his finance minister, but added it was imperative for the federal government to have acted right from the outset of the COVID-19 crisis.

“The cost of doing nothing would have been far more,” he said, adding the pandemic has not been a time for “belt-tightening.”

He said the country has been able to slow down progression of the novel coronavirus significantly and parts of the economy have since been able to reopen.

Trudeau repeatedly touted the nation’s historically low interest rates, which he said would help pay off the accumulated debt.

“If the federal government hadn’t taken on significant debt in order to send money to Canadians to support businesses and households, what would Canadians have done?” he asked.

“They would have loaded up their credit cards, they would have scrambled to try and find ways to pay their bills, pay their groceries and figure out how to care for their loved ones.”

The prime minister said he’s confident about the federal government’s response to the pandemic, which has included hundreds of billions in spending, because of the reduced spread of COVID-19 over the past four months.

“This recession is very different from the last recession,” Trudeau said, adding the 2020 economic problems are related to a health crisis.

“There are going to be really important discussions and political debates about what our economy looks like in the coming years.”

He stated earlier in the briefing that his government was also at work at addressing racial injustices that have been brought to the forefront of conversation following the death of unarmed Black man George Floyd in Minneapolis in May.

Trudeau said fighting discrimination is a top priority and mentioned the need for more capital to help fund racialized entrepreneurs.

The prime minister also faced questions on his involvement in the government’s decision to award the handling of $900-million student grant program to the WE Charity, which has longstanding ties to Trudeau and his family.

“The recommendation to use WE to get opportunities out for young people was made by the public service, but as a cabinet we ratify those decisions,” Trudeau said, adding he did not recuse himself from any cabinet decisions related to the charity.

“I love long worked on youth issues both before I got into politics and since I’ve been in politics.”

Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump and Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador are meeting in Washington, D.C., Wednesday to recognize the ratification of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which replaces NAFTA.

Trudeau had earlier declined the invite from Trump but he was quick to reiterate his concerns over the potential for the Americans to reintroduce aluminum tariffs on Canada.

He once again said the U.S. does not produce enough aluminum to fulfill domestic manufacturing needs and any tariffs against Canada imposed by the Americans would hurt the U.S. economy by adding additional costs to customers.

Trump originally hit Canada with aluminum tariffs in 2018, citing national security concerns.

Most recently, she worked full time as a server at the Chateau Victoria Hotel’s Vista 18 restaurant for two years before being laid off due to the COVID-19 pandemic on March 17.

article continues below

“Growing up in Victoria where the hospitality sector is such an important part of our economy, I always thought that this would be a safe industry to work in,” she said Tuesday during a rally for hotel workers at the legislature. “As long as I worked hard and provided good service, I never worried about the insecurity of losing my job, until now.

“Since being laid off I constantly teeter on what tomorrow’s going to look like with financial burdens and obviously emotionally it’s impacted me heavily, as well.”

Only a few people have been called back to work at Chateau Victoria since the pandemic started, Spiteri said.

“And there’s no word on when the rest of us are going to be brought back to the hotel.”

Spiteri was among about 60 people demonstrating for a legal right to return to their jobs as the recovery from COVID continues. Participants were from Victoria, Vancouver and other parts of the Lower Mainland.

Spiteri said the level of insecurity she is feeling is “overwhelming.”

“I’ve been on [Employment Insurance] for a really, really long time and at this point I’m barely scraping by.”

The industry will eventually improve, she said. “Why won’t the industry promise to bring us back? Why won’t the government make that guarantee for us?”

Spiteri said she and other hotel workers at the rally have built careers in the hospitality industry.

“These aren’t just jobs, they’re a vital part of B.C.’s economy.”

Unite Here Local 40 organized the rally. The union has 6,000 members in B.C., including 500 in the capital region working at establishments such as the Chateau Victoria Hotel and Coast Victoria Hotel and Marina, said Stephanie Fung, union spokesperson. They are among more than 50,000 hotel workers in B.C.

The B.C. Hotel Association is seeking support from all levels of government to keep its businesses — and its jobs — alive, at a time when hotels are not profitable, even if many are open.

Ingrid Jarrett, hotel association chief executive, said it is critical that province extend the temporary layoff provision past the Aug. 30 end date and for the federal government to extend the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit in tandem. It proposes that those supports last until the sector regains 70 per cent of its historic revenues.

The association wants B.C. to allow municipalities to grant property tax relief for hotels.

Without this kind of help, Jarrett predicts a third of B.C.’s hotels could shut down.

“It is a very, very dire time and we have very limited confidence that the summer is actually going to allow many of the businesses to survive.”

B.C. has 83,000 hotel rooms in 1,252 hotels. Of those hotels, 25 per cent remain closed, she said. Those that are open are running at about 30 per cent capacity.

More than 80 per cent of hotels in B.C. are small and medium-sized businesses, she said.

Jarrett would like to see B.C. opened to travellers from elsewhere in Canada this summer.

The association is proposing that B.C. allow meetings and conferences, possibility by fall. They would follow health and safety protocols, and allow attendees from elsewhere in Canada and from international locations where the infection rate is low.

Frank Bourree, tourism consultant and vice-chair of the South Island Prosperity Partnership, pointed to the relationship between jobs and a healthy industry.

“The problem is that very few tourism businesses are going to be up to full capacity in order to bring everybody back, even through the fall. So is there even a job for them to come back to?

“I think it is great that they [workers] are bringing profile to the loss of tourism jobs here but there has to be an employer there to employ them. And the industry is really precarious right now.”

Employees need to be supported until their jobs come back, Bourree said.

Another key factor is that when the temporary layoff period winds up, employers have to pay severance. “For the employers, if they’ve got a huge severance hit, that might push them right over the edge into bankruptcy,” Bourree said.

Tourism represents 10 per cent of the employment base in the capital region, Bourree said.

Greater Victoria hotels are running at about 25 per cent occupancy, down from 80 per cent a year ago, he said.

“Nobody believes that we are going to see international travel into B.C. for the balance of this year.”

Even when a hotel is open, it is unlikely to be profitable, Bourree said. Most open hotels are operating on a “shoestring,” he said.

The challenge locally and within the rest of the province, is that B.C. visitors stay on the weekends and not during the week, meaning the industry is not filling enough rooms. Travellers from elsewhere in Canada and internationally typically stay long and stay during the week, Bourree said.

It’s easy for Canadians to look southward and shake their heads in bemused smugness at the daily penchant of Americans to indulge in conspiracy theories and demonizing of disfavoured segments of society.



But I’m getting a whiff of that attitude here in Canada now. It serves as a reminder how easily irrationality and fear can spark reactions leading to full-blown witch hunts and targeting of the “others.”

The past few days I’ve seen multiple news reports of people reporting cars with U.S. plates. For some, the immediate reaction was to assume the owners of those cars have no right to be where they are, and then make the irrational link that anyone who comes from the U.S. must be dripping with coronavirus that will spread to anything they touch.

article continues below

These fears were stoked by some unfortunate remarks by the premier, which were fortunately walked back by more measured remarks by Dr. Bonnie Henry.

This jump to conclusions affects me personally. Last month, my wife and I moved to Victoria from California. It is a move we have planned for five years and was irretrievably set in motion a year before anyone ever heard of the novel coronavirus.

But now that we are here — thoroughly inspected and interrogated by both CBSA and provincial health officials at the border and after completing our 14-day isolation (which confirmed our symptom-free condition during the three months of lockdown in California) — we are now faced with a very un-Canadian attitude of guilt-by-association for anyone whose car (as does ours) bears U.S. plates.

Leave aside the fact that COVID-19 spreads generally by transmission of fluids during close (usually confined, indoor) contact with someone else; leave aside the fact that wearing a mask and keeping distance are the two most effective ways to avoid transmission, wherever the suspected carrier hails from; leave aside the fact that the incidence of mask-wearing in B.C. seems far below what my wife and I expected and practise ourselves.

The mere fact someone belongs to a “suspect group” (owners of cars with U.S. plates) does not make them public-health pariahs; that is the heart of the conspiracy-driven, fear-mongering in the U.S. we Canadians rightfully disparage.

The news reports invariably actually talk with the car owners and discover that they are here legitimately.

But they fear reprisal from the unthinking, who are quick to grab their pitchfork and call for a witch-burning.

I know my wife and I are concerned about that as well, wondering if our car will be keyed by some anonymous COVID-19 vigilante; that’s why I ask my name not be reproduced with this letter.

While we all need to remain vigilant and compliant in fighting the pandemic, turning on superficial scapegoats without knowing their full story is no solution and just imports northward a different epidemic we should work equally hard to keep out.

The CFL is reportedly looking at playing in a single hub or two hub cities to limit teams' exposure to the virus. But Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases expert at Toronto General Hospital and associate professor of medicine at the University of Toronto, said positive tests remain possible and could threaten play — just like in other leagues.

article continues below

""The short answer is nothing in this era is going to be without risk,"" Bogoch said during a telephone interview. ""There are certain things we can do to minimize the risk but as with anything, there's going to be some element of risk of acquiring this infection.

""The league and players can work with medical professionals to make this as safe as possible but at the end of the day they'll have to sit down collectively and decide, 'Is this worthwhile.' As individuals they'll have to ask themselves, based on the protocols in place and individual risk perception, risk tolerance and risk threshold, 'Am I willing to play?'""

The CFL and CFL Players' Association continue to discuss amendments to their current collective bargaining agreement that would allow for a partial '20 season. The earliest action would begin is September, but commissioner Randy Ambrosie has said a cancelled campaign also remains possible.

In March, the COVID-19 pandemic forced a global shutdown of sports. In Europe, pro soccer has resumed while domestically Major League Soccer, Major League Baseball, the NHL and NBA are all attempting to either restart or open their seasons.

But it hasn't been easy as all four North American circuits have had players or team officials contract the virus. FC Dallas was forced to withdraw from the MLS is Back Tournament in Orlando after 10 players and one coach tested positive.

The NHL hopes to open training camps Monday and resume play in Edmonton and Toronto on Aug. 1. Players would stay in tightly controlled bubbles and play games without fans.

Teams can bring 52 personnel, with no more than 31 players, to their hub. Everyone in the bubble will be tested daily — including players, staff, hotel workers, food service employees and bus drivers.

Players and team officials will remain inside the bubble except in specific extenuating circumstances. That includes medical attention, the birth of a child or death in the family.

Anyone returning to the bubble will be subject to a minimum four-day quarantine with daily nasal swab tests for COVID-19.

The NHL and NHLPA have the ability to delay, postpone, move or cancel games due to a ""risk to player health and safety"" and/or chance that ""the integrity of the competition"" is in jeopardy, including ""an uncontrolled outbreak of COVID-19.""

However, perhaps the biggest challenge the CFL faces is a financial hurdle. Unlike other major sports entities, it doesn't have a billion-dollar TV deal and thus isn't flush with money.

Ambrosie has stated often the nine-team CFL collectively lost $20 million last year. That hardly puts it in an ideal position to cover food and lodging costs for its teams as well as daily testing.

Bogoch said regardless of the measures taken in a hub or bubble, positive test results are inevitable.

""Oh, 100 per cent and there already have been,"" he said. ""If they do proceed, I think the leagues and fans should be aware that anything can happen.

""The leagues could come to a halt should there be an outbreak or safety concern, individuals or teams might be pulled out. Quite frankly, as much as we want to have high expectations we should really lower them. We're in the COVID-19 era, anything can happen.""

No league has said a specific number of positive tests will result in the cancellation of games.

Bogoch said hubs and bubbles are beneficial. With the exception of baseball, the other three North American leagues are going with hub plans.

""First, they reduce the probability of introducing infection within the bubble,"" he said. ""If (infection) is introduced, it really reduces the probability that it can be transmitted.

""If there's infection it will hopefully be rapidly identified because of the high frequency of diagnostic testing and symptom checks. Now, the best-laid plans can still have holes in them but what we've seen with basketball and soccer is these plans work in that they've identified positive cases and players have been isolated. That tells me the safety mechanisms are working and that's fantastic.""

But the mounting positive tests have prompted many to question sport's return before the discovery of a suitable vaccine.

""The key is ensuring if you're going to play pro sports, you're doing it in a safe and ethical manner,"" he said. ""Safety really means player safety, safety of the auxiliary personnel but also public safety as well.

""Ethical manner means you're not drawing resources away from the community in which you're playing. Can that occur while there's still an ongoing push to ensure safety across the country and develop a vaccine and develop programs? I personally think if it's carefully planned out, they can both be done very well.""

Bogoch, a Calgary native, is a recreational hockey player in his spare time. But he also watches at least two CFL games each year: The Labour Day Classic between the Calgary Stampeders and arch-rival Edmonton Eskimos; and Grey Cup.

""That (Labour Day game) is just ingrained in my DNA,"" he said with a chuckle. ""The Labour Day Classic is so quintessential Alberta, it's wonderful.

""There's something so Canadian about (the Grey Cup), it's 40 below in a blizzard and the guys are out on the field. It's just wild.""

While Bogoch appreciates sport isn't a priority for some, he said it can definitely provide a boost for others during a pandemic.

""When we step back and think about what's been happening the last six months and especially since our lockdown in March and throughout our gradual reopening, people have taken a tremendous hit,"" he said. ""We've taken financial hits . . . we've taken emotional and psychological hits by staying at home.

""While some people might say (sport) isn't an essential service and they're correct, I think we can also say professional and amateur sports and other forms of entertainment like the arts are extremely important to the psychological and emotional well-being of our society. This may help provide some intangible benefits as well.""

Mercifully, Bogoch sees light at the end of the COVID-19 pandemic tunnel.

""I think we'll gradually see this start to wind down as vaccines are developed and rolled out globally,"" he said. ""In the best-case scenario it could be as early as late 2020 . . . but more realistically needles will start going into arms in 2021.

""I think the key word there is globally because if there's an infection in one part of the world, there's a problem in all parts of the world. This thing is pretty contagious and people are mobile so we need this vaccine deployed on a global level.""

The economic and fiscal ""snapshot"" from the government today lays out the Liberals' belief that there will be a slow return to a new normal, with unemployment high and economic growth low through to at least the end of 2021.

article continues below

Even though the government believes the worst of the economic harm from the pandemic is behind the country, the document says a recovery can't begin in earnest until an effective vaccine or treatment becomes widely available.

Things could, however, get worse under two alternative scenarios the Finance Department lays out.

Should prolonged shutdowns stay in place, or restrictions not fully roll back, a return to normal activity for households and businesses will be uneven and slower than hoped for, leading to a more pronounced drop in economic output than is already expected.

And should the country be hit with a second wave of the novel coronavirus during the annual flu season, the ensuing lockdowns would cause what the Finance Department describes as a ""deeper and longer-lasting negative impact on the economy.""

The Liberals have repeatedly promised to use the federal treasury as a financial shield between Canadians and irreparable harm, and the cost of that promise is now at $231.9 billion in direct spending and a deficit comparable only to those seen in the Second World War.

Whatever the costs, they're worth it, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a news conference Wednesday morning, before the snapshot was released.

""As we measure the cost of helping Canadians, we shouldn't forget that the cost of doing nothing would have been far more,"" Trudeau said, insisting that this is not the time for belt-tightening or austerity.

The document tries to make that case, saying that the $80-billion Canada Emergency Response Benefit, which had paid out $53.5 billion in benefits as of late June, has covered Canadians' estimated $44.6 billion in lost labour income through the first half of the year.

The $2,000-a-month benefit is estimated to have covered the monthly housing, food, phone and internet costs for the bottom and middle thirds of households, according to Finance Department calculations.

Historically low interest rates mean all the hundreds of billions in borrowing comes with ""manageable"" costs, Trudeau said, and the alternative would be for individuals and households to load up with debt themselves to cope with months of no or little work.

Adding to the deficit is a $37.3 billion boost to the federal wage subsidy program to bring its budget to $82.3 billion, signalling an expansion and coming changes to the benefit that covers up to 75 per cent of wages to a maximum of $847 a week for eligible companies.

The Liberals expect more workers to move onto the wage subsidy and off the Canada Emergency Response Benefit as that $80-billion program winds down.

Those who fall through the COVID-19 financial safety net are expected to be caught by the employment insurance system that has been largely dormant since the CERB replaced it in late March.

Government officials admit there will still need to be policy changes to the EI system to help some self-employed workers qualify, and capture EI-eligible workers who, due to the pandemic, haven't been able to work the necessary qualifying hours.

For this calendar year, the government expects the unemployment rate to hit 9.8 per cent, dropping to 7.8 per cent next year based on forecasts by 13 private sector economists.

Although that's a bump from the record-high unemployment rate of 13.7 per cent in May for a labour force of just over 19 million, it is still almost double the record low of 5.5 per cent pre-pandemic.

The document doesn't contain the five-year forecast traditionally part of federal budgets owing to the uncertain path the pandemic will take and the state of the economy beyond that.

""Even when the pandemic is over, lasting consequences may cast a long-term shadow over economic developments, for example via more indebted businesses and households, persistent unemployment and substantial structural changes in the economy that have been accelerated through the crisis,"" the government's update says.

""In the coming months and as needed the government will announce measures to support the recovery.""

Opposition parties had wanted Morneau to provide a road map for reshaping emergency aid measures that are set to expire in the fall and keeping spending and deficits under control.

In his own morning news conference, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said the Liberals mishandled the COVID-19 pandemic by being slow to close borders and by instituting too-rigid emergency aid programs.

Canada can't afford for the Liberals to mishandle the economy as well, he said, by keeping benefits in place that remove incentives to go back to work while the novel coronavirus remains a risk.

""Liberals put all their faith in government, Conservatives put our faith in people,"" Scheer said.

He said the Liberals should take up a Conservative proposal to offer a ""back to work bonus"" and send more money to the federal auditor general so her office can study the government's spending more closely.

Next week, the Bank of Canada is to again update its forecasts when it releases a monetary policy report along with a scheduled interest-rate announcement.

Last month, the central bank said it expected a decline between 10 and 20 per cent in the second quarter compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. That is an improvement from the 15-to-30-per-cent drop in the quarter highlighted in the bank's worst-case scenario in April.

There were no new deaths and there remain 16 people in hospital, with four of those in intensive care units.

article continues below

That makes 2,990 people who have tested positive for the virus that has caused a global pandemic since COVID-19 first appeared in B.C. in late January.

Of those, 183 people have died, 2,645 people have recovered and 162 people are still battling the disease. Most infected patients are self-isolating at home.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,013 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,576 in Fraser Health;

• 133 in Island Health;

• 203 in Interior Health; and

• 65 in Northern Health.

""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks and the outbreak at Tabor Home has now been declared over,"" B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix and provincial health officer Bonnie Henry said in a joint statement on July 7.

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreaks at Tabor and at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred to those homes from the hospital.

""While there are no active community outbreaks in B.C., new cases and community exposure events continue to occur in the community,"" Dix and Henry said.

""There has been a new community exposure event at Hotel Belmont bar and nightclub in the Vancouver Coastal Health region. Public health teams have issued an alert for anyone who may have been at the premises on June 27 and June 29.""

B.C. is estimated to have a population of about 5,190,000 people so it has so far had about one case of COVID-19 for every 1,735 residents, or 0.576 people per 1,000 residents. That compares with Washington State's estimated population of 7,615,000 people and 36,970 cases, for about one case of COVID-19 for every 206 people, or 4.85 people per 1,000 residents.

B.C.'s death rate, however, at more than 6.1%, is slightly higher than other jurisdictions.

Washington State, with 1,384 deaths, has a 3.7% death rate for COVID-19 patients.

Johns Hopkins University's Centre for Systems Science and Engineering has recorded 11,712,663 COVID-19 cases and 540,582 deaths globally, for a death rate of slightly more than 4.6%.

The record high of 10,028 new cases in Texas served as another alarming new measure of the swift resurgence of COVID-19 nationwide and the failures of the country’s response. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas aggressively began one of America’s fastest reopenings in May but has begun reversing course in recent weeks, ordering bars closed and mandating face coverings.

article continues below

New York and Florida are the only other states to record more than 10,000 new cases in a single day. New York hit that grim total back in April, when New York City hospitals were overwhelmed and hundreds of people were dying every day. Florida topped 10,000 confirmed cases last week.

The record mark in Texas partly reflects a lag in testing results from the Fourth of July weekend, when newly reported cases were far below what Texas has seen in recent weeks. But Abbott said the numbers should still be ""an alarm bell for everybody"" who is skeptical about whether the virus is a threat.

""We have rapid spread of COVID-19 in the state of Texas right now,"" Abbott told San Antonio television station KENS.

Later in the interview, Abbott was noncommittal about whether he would attend his own party's convention next week in Houston, which the Texas GOP has remained bent on holding even as the mayor, doctors and businesses pressure the party to cancel. Houston has emerged as one of the nation's hot zones in the pandemic. However, Republican activists, some of whom have called the fears overblown, have resolved to press forward with the indoor three-day convention.

Texas surged past 8,000 statewide hospitalizations for the first time over the long holiday weekend — a more than quadruple increase on the past month. On Tuesday, the number of hospitalizations soared past 9,000. Texas also set a new high for deaths in a single day with 60.

Mayors in some of the biggest cities in the state and U.S. — including Austin, San Antonio and Houston — have warned that hospitals could soon become overwhelmed with coronavirus patients. Along the Texas-Mexico border, some cities imposed curfew orders in hopes of cutting down on large parties or social gatherings as cases have skyrocketed.

""Many of us are running at capacity and have created new wards,"" said Todd Mann, the chief executive officer at McAllen Medical Center, which on Tuesday had more than 130 coronavirus patients taking up more than half of the facility's beds. ""The physical space is obviously limited, and most of the hospitals are running out of that pretty quickly.""

The record count was reported on a day that also saw the State Fair of Texas cancelled for the the first time since World War II. Fair organizers said the event, which draws more than a million visitors to Dallas each fall, was not feasible during the pandemic.

It also came as President Donald Trump leaned on governors to reopen schools this fall, arguing that some are keeping schools closed not because of the risks from the coronavirus pandemic but for political reasons. Texas education officials announced Tuesday that face coverings will be mandatory for students older than 10 years old and that school districts must offer on-campus learning to any family that wants their child in a classroom.

Deaths remain lower in Texas compared to other big states. As of Tuesday, Texas has confirmed that at least 2,715 people have died due to COVID-19. But fatalities have climbed in recent days, and in addition to an alarming acceleration in new cases in Texas, the seven-day infection rate has climbed to 13.5%.

The number of infections is likely far higher because many people haven't been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected without feeling sick.

Two separate photos of the bare-faced party leader sitting comfortably in a waiting area circulated online but his office says he was wearing a mask for his trip.

A spokesperson said the photos must have been taken after he doffed the covering to take a call but before he put it back on.

Toronto's Pearson airport currently has a policy that masks must be worn at all times to curb the spread of COVID-19, with limited exceptions that include being at a food or beverage service location.

The photos shows Scheer in the lounge with several others, and while they are seated spaced apart, none is wearing a mask.

In April, Scheer was criticized for bringing his family on a government flight back to Ottawa for a House of Commons sitting, reducing the ability for the other two MPs on board to keep a distance from the Scheers.

He and other party leaders have been wearing masks around Parliament Hill. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also wears them during photo ops.

Scheer is the waning days of his leadership. The ballots to select his replacement go in the mail in the coming days and a new leader will be elected in late August.

Up to 90 centres across the country will gradually reopen in July, starting with 14 on Wednesday. Further openings are to be guided by public health advice as well as how many Canadians each centre serves.

article continues below

The government has spent the past few weeks upgrading the centres to put up clear barriers at counters, signs to encourage physical distancing and reduce seating in waiting areas.

Personal protective equipment will also be provided to staff at centres that reopen.

Face masks will be offered to people visiting centres in provinces or municipalities that have mandated their use in indoor public spaces.

Anyone going to a centre that doesn't fall under any such provincial or municipal requirement will be encouraged to wear a masks and use hand-sanitizer.

While the newly reopened centres will handle queries for social insurance numbers, employment insurance and the Canada Pension Plan among others, the government says passport and biometrics services won't be available at first.

Days after public health authorities closed businesses and ordered workers to stay home to slow the spread of COVID-19, the Liberals closed the sprawling network of Service Canada centres.

Some of the offices, such as one tucked inside Ottawa's city hall, had already started to close before the official announcement in March as confirmed cases of COVID-19 increased and workers were needed elsewhere, or resisted going in.

The government says an online Service Canada portal opened in response to the closures has seen more than 700,000 requests. That's about half the number of in-person visits Service Canada locations would see in the same period in normal times.

In a release, the government is still urging Canadians to use online services wherever possible, including to book appointments online for in-person help.

The network of 318 Service Canada centres, along with almost 250 more outreach centres, received about 8.4 million visits during the 12-month period between April 2018 and March 2019. The figure, noted in a recently posted evaluation of federal services, included over 1.9 million people walking in to use a self-service kiosk.

Central 1 says it expects home sales to recover marginally in 2020 and 2021 after tumbling by 55 per cent between mid-March and April.

article continues below

Deputy chief economist Brian Yu says despite values plunging to levels not seen since the early 1980s, home prices have stayed firm because fewer properties were available for sale.

He predicts median prices could rebound to about $710,000 before slipping to around $540,000 late this year or early in 2021.

Yu says unemployment, business and health concerns will further weaken the market, while population growth, which has traditionally propped up the sector in B.C., will slow to a trickle next year, dampening sales.

He says a second wave of COVID-19 has the potential to shave home prices by 15 per cent as more owners already hit by the pandemic's first wave are forced to sell during a second downturn.

The report released Tuesday notes positive developments as B.C. enters the third phase of its recovery plan including restarts in the accommodation, spa, film and television industries.

Vacancy rates could also climb as high as three per cent over the next year, writes Yu, ""providing an opportune time for renters to negotiate rental rates before the market tightens up again.""

Housing starts are forecast to slump 33 per cent in 2020 and remain flat in 2021, which ""set the stage for a housing supply shortage in coming years,"" the report says.

The timing of a second wave and its impact on the economy would draw out the effect on the housing market, potentially carrying into 2022, it says.

Summer is officially here, with sunny weather, full ferries, and a few statutory holidays thrown in for good measure. As much as it feels like the perfect time to relax and have fun, please continue taking every measure to prevent a COVID-19 outbreak on the Coast. We don’t have to look very far south to see what can happen if we are not careful, and we need to keep working together to keep our community safe.

While there have been some welcome changes with Phase 3 of our provincial Restart Plan, it is important to remember that all of the other personal and business recommendations from Phase 2 remain in place. Phase 3 is not a return to normal and we should all continue to act as though COVID-19 is still here.

This means that businesses should be following Public Health and Worksafe BC guidelines to ensure the safety of employees and customers. This includes limiting the number of people on premises at any one time, ensuring adequate spacing, and the use of masks and barriers when physical spacing is not possible. Please respect our businesses who are doing their very best to ensure the safety of everyone who enters.

In our local health-care facilities, visitors are allowed, but are restricted to essential visits only. For the hospital, each patient may have one visitor at a time for a maximum of two hours per visitor. For our long-term care facilities, residents may have one designated person who is able to visit. Virtual visits are allowed at all facilities, and tablets are available for residents and patients who do not have access otherwise.

For individuals, our recommendations remain the same:

• Maintain physical distancing with people outside of your household (or your very limited family/friend bubble), and wear a mask whenever you can’t maintain a distance of at least two metres.

• Wash your hands frequently, especially after touching high contact surfaces.

Do not touch your face unless you have just washed your hands, and make sure you wash your hands after touching your face.

• Avoid large groups if you can, especially indoors. If you do meet up with others, please meet up outside whenever possible and maintain physical distancing.

• Exercise extra caution if you are older and have high blood pressure, obesity, diabetes, heart disease, lung disease or other significant health issues.

If you do develop new cold or flu symptoms (no matter how mild), please stay home and self-isolate until you have been assessed. Do not go to work. Do not go shopping. Do not meet up with others. Do call your family doctor or the Respiratory Assessment Clinic (Monday to Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.) to arrange for further assessment and testing, if indicated. The Respiratory Assessment Clinic can be reached by phone or text at 604-740-1252 or by email at coastrespclinic@gmail.com.

We continue to test everyone with possible COVID-19 symptoms, so please do not hesitate to call if you become ill. If you have more severe symptoms and believe you may need to be admitted to hospital, please go to the Sechelt Hospital Emergency Department. If you need an ambulance, please call 911. The Emergency Department is open and safe for anyone with a medical emergency.

With respect to non-emergent non-COVID-19 health issues, our local medical clinics remain open Monday to Friday, with virtual and in-person walk-in services available through the Gibsons Medical Clinic from Monday to Saturday. Please note that all of our family medicine clinics are currently booking people without a local family doctor.

In order to provide as safe an environment as possible for both patients and staff, the majority of medical care will continue to be provided virtually. This is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. If you have a medical issue that requires a physical assessment, an in-person appointment will be arranged.

Please check the Coast Reporter and The Local Weekly for periodic updates on COVID-19 in our community. As local parks, programs and facilities open up, please visit the SCRD, the Town of Gibsons, and the District of Sechelt websites for updates.

But just three weeks before Green and her family were set to fly from Edmonton to Sydney, N.S., on July 17, WestJet announced it was ending its policy of leaving the middle seats on its flights empty.

article continues below

""I was devastated,"" Green said, noting her family spends every summer in Nova Scotia with her 93-year-old grandmother who is suffering from severe dementia and another family member with an incurable form of cancer.

""We all knew it could very well be the last summer we would spend with them.""

When Green called WestJet to see if any accommodations could be made, she told the company she has a heart condition that puts her in the high-risk category for COVID-19.

Despite her pleas, Green said the airline told her it was unable to make any special accommodations, nor would it allow her to change the date of the flight to before July 1, when the rules were relaxed, without paying a fee.

And Green's not alone: as provinces begin to relax domestic travel restrictions, the cessation of physical distancing rules by two of Canada's biggest airlines — WestJet and Air Canada — is causing frustration and grief among some passengers.

Gabor Lukacs, head of the advocacy group Air Passenger Rights Canada, said he has fielded countless complaints from passengers during the COVID-19 pandemic, many of which are related to the same issues: airlines refusing to offer refunds or accommodations amid the abolition of physical distancing rules.

While he acknowledges the effort to fill seats is due to airlines attempting to recoup billions in lost revenue, Lukacs argues the companies risk deterring customers from flying at all.

""The question is: do we allow economic considerations to override public health? We don't allow supermarkets to sell spoiled meat because it's cheaper. Are we going to allow doctors to skip disinfecting their tools to save the cost?""

There's some evidence he's right: a new poll conducted by Leger and the Association of Canadian Studies found 72 per cent of respondents say they are not comfortable flying now that Air Canada and WestJet have culled their seat distancing policies.

Only 22 per cent said they would be OK with flying under the newly relaxed rules.

In response to criticisms, WestJet forwarded The Canadian Press a statement from a July 3 blog post regarding changes to its seat distancing policy.

""The blocked middle seat was introduced at the beginning of the pandemic before the myriad of safety measures were put in place and mandated on board,"" the statement reads.

""Seat distancing was never intended to be in place permanently or throughout the pandemic.""

The post notes a number of measures WestJet has taken to help stop the spread of COVID-19 on its flights, including mandatory masking, pre-boarding questionnaires for all passengers, temperature screening, thorough cleaning of aircraft between flights, and the restriction of in-flight dining services.

However, the company has also denied it's putting passengers and staff at risk by filling flights up, pointing to other safety measures as mitigating the risk of spreading COVID-19.

Air Canada provided a similar statement, acknowledging the inconvenience the change may have caused to customers.

""While we would all like a single measure that reduces risk, we are left to use a combination of approaches to mitigate risk as far as practical,"" the airline said.

Yet some passengers report first-hand experiences in which masking protocols were not followed.

Maureen Isabel Green, 31, flew from Vancouver to Fredericton three weeks ago with Air Canada to visit her family, and said she was shocked by the lax use of masks by both airport employees and the passengers on her two connecting flights.

""I just think of all the people who are getting on a flight and risking their life, or risking the life of the people they're going to visit, because some people don't want to wear a mask for a few hours,"" she said.

Green, who is a health-care worker, said there were numerous instances on her flight from Vancouver to Montreal where a group of young, male passengers took off their masks when flight attendants were not present.

While at the Montreal airport, Green said a man was able to board a flight without wearing a mask, simply by telling attendants he had a medical condition that prevented him from doing so.

Air travel has been at the centre of several headline-grabbing incidents throughout the pandemic — particularly since travel restrictions have been eased in some regions.

On July 2, health authorities in B.C. warned the passengers of four separate flights that they may have been exposed to COVID-19.

Just a day before — on the exact day the airlines ended their social distancing policies — the Nova Scotia Health Authority warned passengers of a Toronto-to-Halifax WestJet flight from the previous week that they may have been exposed to COVID-19.

And on Sunday, a Halifax man reportedly walked off of a St. John's-bound flight after learning he was the only passenger travelling within the so-called ""Atlantic bubble,"" sparking discussion about the effectiveness of airlines' COVID-prevention policies.

The YMCA Canada, the Boys and Girls Clubs of Canada and the Royal Canadian Legion are among those that say they are facing severe financial difficulties and been forced to permanently close some locations even as demand for their services has increased.

article continues below

A YMCA facility permanently closed its doors in Yarmouth, N.S., because of the pandemic while the Boys and Girls Clubs shuttered its operations in Edson, Alta. The legion has seen three halls close for good in Ontario and one in New Brunswick.

While the fear is those are just the beginning, the government is also being warned that failing to help now could cost more in the long run as organizations that provide child care, emergency food support and other social services disappear.

""The problem is the bill will come due later,"" said Boys and Girls Clubs of Canada president Owen Charters. ""Because as these organizations disappear, the social safety net becomes a tax burden where the government needs to step in and provide those services directly.""

The sector began to bang the drums with alarm at the end of March as Canadians started to realize the pandemic would last longer than a couple of weeks and donations and other sources of income such as the provision of child care started to dry up.

Dozens of charities signed a letter on March 25 asking Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his government for financial aid to prevent ""irreparable damage,"" particularly at a time when more people needed their services.

Ottawa has since included the sector in some of its COVID-19 supports such as wage-subsidy and rent-deferral programs. It also created a $350-million fund for organizations to provide emergency assistance to Canadians during the pandemic.

While welcome, those interviewed say the already-announced federal programs and funding fall far short.

""What we need is direct supports to make sure Ys can survive the crisis,"" YMCA Canada president Peter Dinsdale said. ""There is a real need for sector stabilization. It's not just YMCAs in this country. It is Boys and Girls Clubs, the United Way. So many entities out there require support.""

The government has been told as much numerous times, with letters written and phone calls made. Yet those interviewed say there has yet to be a real response. That silence has sparked concern and frustration.

""We sent off two letters,"" said Royal Canadian Legion dominion president Tom Irvine. ""There was no acknowledgment of receiving the letters or nothing. So I'm pretty discouraged at this time, but still hopeful. This is a Canadian institution and if we don't do something, we could lose it.""

Social Development Minister Ahmed Hussen's spokeswoman Jessica Eritou on Tuesday praised the work of the charitable and non-profit sector and touted the $350-million emergency fund, which organizations say does not address the core of their concerns.

""We are continuing to look at ways to work with charities and non-profits supporting Canadians during the crisis,"" she added.

""We continue discussions with organizations to help support the important work they're doing in communities across the country and we will keep looking for the most effective ways to help Canadians during this unprecedented crisis.""

Cardus, a charity that does research on the non-profit sector, released a paper on Tuesday urging the federal government to start matching donations from Canadians to different organizations using money set aside to cover the costs of a tax credit for Canadians who donate.

But Dinsdale and Charters said matching programs will still leave many organizations struggling, and that the only real solution is direct federal support to help the sector weather the pandemic and continue providing essential services.

A lack of safe places for children to be while their parents work is an obstacle to economic recovery, economists have warned, particularly for women.

""While the federal government's been focused on macro-economic approaches like the wage subsidy, like CERB and other initiatives, they have ignored this sector,"" said Dinsdale, whose organization runs child-care centres across the country.

""And they've ignored this sector at the risk of not having the most critical social services available to Canadians as the economy reopens.""

The figure is the upper range of the scenarios the budget watchdog was asked to research as part of a report released Tuesday morning as policy-makers consider how to shape emergency supports set to expire in the fall.

Planned federal spending to date on pandemic-related aid now tops about $174 billion, in a range of programs meant to provide a financial floor for individuals and businesses.

The idea of giving a government-guaranteed basic income to Canadians has gained steam as millions have watched their jobs or earnings evaporate in the COVID-19 pandemic.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau and other senior cabinet ministers have repeatedly been asked by senators and MPs about the concept. Advocates argue that it would be an expansion of the $80-billion Canada Emergency Response Benefit for workers who saw their incomes crash.

The CERB and a $45-billion wage-subsidy program are set to expire in October.

Providing six months of a basic income starting that month could cost between $47.5 billion and $98.1 billion, depending on how much of the benefit is clawed back from people whose other incomes increase.

Budget officer Yves Giroux's report says the average benefit to Canadians aged 18 to 64 would range between $4,500 and $4,800, with the number of recipients depending on the phase-out rate.

Sen. Yuen Pau Woo, who asked for the costing, said a basic-income program could fill in the gaps in Canada's social safety nets, a patchwork largely run by provinces, that have been exposed by the pandemic.

""It's a huge undertaking to launch a basic income for the whole country on a permanent basis. The costs are extremely high and the political resistance is likely to be fierce, but we are in a period where it is likely we will have to spend large sums of money on income support going into the balance of 2020 and into 2021,"" Woo said in a telephone interview.

""The question to my mind is how we spend it, and in what form.""

A basic income means different things to different people, but it is usually viewed as a no-strings-attached benefit that governments provide to citizens instead of various targeted social benefits.

Also known as a guaranteed minimum income, it can be delivered as a universal payment, or as a means-tested benefit that declines as a recipient's other income rises.

Giroux's report says the government could repeal $15 billion in tax measures to offset the overall cost of a basic-income program, which Woo added would likely have to wrap in existing measures to avoid duplication.

The overall cost of the program might be higher than the budget office estimates. The PBO's estimates rely on some Statistics Canada income data that doesn't include people living in the northern territories or in First Nations, or some military members.

Nor can the figures simply be doubled to determine a full year's cost because that might overstate the financial impact. The economy appears to be bouncing back slowly from a bottoming-out in April, and the cost of the program would depend on how many employees are rehired or find new jobs.

The Canadian Federation of Independent Business, which represents small businesses nationwide, said Tuesday that about one-third of members responding to a survey reported being back at full staffing levels, but suggested many believe it will take six months to get back to normal profitability.

Statistics Canada is to release June's jobs report on Friday.

Projections released Tuesday by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimate Canada's unemployment rate at 11 per cent for the second quarter of the year.

The 37-member international body predicted the national unemployment rate would decline to 7.7 per cent by the end of the year, or to 8.4 per cent should a second wave of the novel coronavirus force renewed lockdowns.

NDP finance critic Peter Julian said Tuesday that the uncertain economic path ahead requires the Liberals to say how the government plans to reshape emergency aid in Wednesday's fiscal update.

He said a more universal benefit, which the NDP has pushed, would have helped more people and cost less had the Liberals used it from the start.

""It makes more sense to make sure that everybody who needs the benefit can actually get it than the government's approach,"" Julian said.

The Liberals have said the update on Wednesday will provide an economic outlook, an accounting of spending to date and projections for the remainder of the fiscal year, including the expected deficit. The PBO and others estimate that to be at least $250 billion.

Seventy-two per cent of Canadians surveyed by Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies say they're not comfortable flying since a decision by some airlines to relax their own in-flight physical distancing requirements.

article continues below

As of July 1, Air Canada and WestJet both ended policies blocking the sale of adjacent seats.

The measure was seen to align with a guidance document for the aviation industry issued by Transport Canada in April to help curb the spread of COVID-19.

Among other things, the department had suggested passengers should be widely spaced when possible, though they did not make it mandatory.

Airlines, however, are required to make passengers and air crews wear masks.

Only 22 per cent of those surveyed said they're comfortable getting aboard with no in-flight physical distancing and a requirement to wear masks.

There's more to it to keep flights safe, WestJet said in a statement last week after critics attacked its plan.

""What makes an airplane, and the entire journey, safe is the layers of enhanced cleaning, the wearing of masks and the hospital-grade HEPA filters that remove 99.999 per cent of all airborne particles,"" the airline said.

""The hygiene standards we have now are world-class and backed by industry experts.""

Critics have also previously pounced on the airlines for another move: refusing to fully refund tickets for flights cancelled due to the pandemic.

Thousands of people have beseeched Transport Minister Marc Garneau to compel airlines to issue refunds, but he has refused, arguing that mandating reimbursements from a sector that's lost more than 90 per cent of its revenue would cripple the industry.

But 72 per cent of those polled say they totally oppose his decision.

In lieu of refunds, the airlines have offered vouchers but the poll suggests that it may take a while before people will rebook previously cancelled trips: 85 per cent of those surveyed told pollsters they have no plans to travel outside the country by the end of the year.

The survey polled 1,517 people and can't be assigned a margin of error because online polls are not considered truly random.

Pollsters were in the field between July 3 and 5, a historically popular few days for Canadians and Americans to be on the move between the two countries, given the July 1 Canada Day holiday and the U.S.'s July 4 Independence Day.

But the border remains closed to non-essential traffic, and the majority of Canadians surveyed said they feel it needs to stay that way. The current mutual closure agreement is due to expire July 21.

Of Canadians polled, 86 per cent said they totally disagreed with re-opening the border at the end of July, allowing Americans back into the country.

Americans seem more eager both to head north and to welcome Canadians south; 50 per cent agreed the border should re-open and 36 per cent disagreed.

The potential for cross-border transmission of the virus has been a key factor in the decision to keep the border closed. Currently, rates of COVID-19 infection in the U.S. continue to climb, while in Canada the curve appears to be on a downward trajectory nearly everywhere.

Still, the survey suggests Canadians don't feel they are out of the woods. Thirty-nine per cent believe the worst is yet to come, while 35 per cent believe the worst of the crisis has passed.

In the U.S., 42 per cent of those surveyed felt the darkest days are ahead, 25 per cent believe the U.S. is in the middle of the worst part now while 21 per cent think that's already passed.

The spike in deaths includes one death in June but which only recently was confirmed to be a result of the COVID-19 virus, Henry said.

""To lose six people, all in long-term care, over the last three days is a source of enormous grief,"" said BC Health Minister Adrian Dix.

There have been no new outbreaks in B.C. since Friday. There were 31 new confirmed cases since Friday, bringing the total number of cases to 2,978. Of that number, 2,629 people have recovered, leaving 166 active cases in B.C.

There are currently three long-term care facilities in B.C. with active cases of COVID-19, and one acute care facility.

Responding to a spike in cases in Seattle, and the question of whether public demonstrations may have contributed to the uptick, Henry was asked whether any cases in B.C. have been traced to large anti-racism public protests that took place in Vancouver in June. She said it appears those large gatherings did not result in any spread of the virus.

""Currently, we do not have any cases that have been associated with the protests that took place,"" Henry said. ""In talking with my colleagues in the U.S., they also have not seen surges related to those activities.""

The fact the protests were held outside may be one of the factors that limited the potential spread of the virus.

Henry, health authorities and long term care operators have been working together to relax the restrictions on visitations in long term care homes. Given the recent spike in deaths, Henry was asked if that did not raise concerns about reintroducing the virus into care homes.

She conceded that, once the virus is in a care home, the potential for it to kill elderly people is high.

""The good news is that we have reduced the amount of transmission in our community so much so that we have very people in hospital,"" she said. ""We have very few people who are transmitting in our community, and that's why we feel we're at that balance where we need to allow more people to go into long-term care.""

Here are today’s COVID-19 numbers for Monday, July 6, with numbers from Friday July 3, the last reporting period, in brackets:

New cases: 31 (13)

The league and its union announced Monday the two sides have hammered out a tentative deal on the return-to-play protocol as well as a memorandum of understanding on a four-year extension of the current collective bargaining agreement.

article continues below

The NHL board of governors, the NHLPA's executive board and full membership must now ratify the documents, which are tied together, in three separate votes. If the proposals get the green light, training camps would begin July 13, with the 24 teams set to resume heading to the two Canadian hub cities on July 26. Competitive game action would then commence Aug. 1.

The league has yet to announce the two hubs for its return-to-play plan this summer, but Toronto and Edmonton are the destinations, a person with direct knowledge of the decision told The Associated Press.

The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because the league and the NHLPA have not released this information. The person said the league is in part being cautious and allowing itself flexibility in the event of potential spikes in COVID-19 infections in not yet determining which cities will host the conference finals and Stanley Cup final.

Hashed out in the shadow of unprecedented economic conditions brought on by COVID-19 — and viewed as crucial for a resumption of play — the proposed CBA would bring at least 14 consecutive years of NHL-NHLPA harmony after lockouts wiped out the 2004-05 season, and cut the 1994-95 and 2012-13 campaigns to 48 games.

While details of the CBA, which would last through the 2025-26 season, weren't made public Monday, it's believed the salary cap, escrow payments from players to owners, and Olympic participation all figure prominently. Escrow, which guarantees a 50-50 split of hockey-related revenues, was a thorny issue for players before the pandemic significantly impacted the league's bottom line when the schedule was suspended March 12.

Getting back to the Olympics has also been a priority for players. The NHL, which would still have to negotiate with the International Olympic Committee, skipped the 2018 Winter Games after participating in five straight between 1998 and 2014.

The league and players unveiled the 24-team format for a resumption of play in late May.

The plan to resuscitate the season calls for players to be segregated from the general population in tightly-controlled ""bubbles"" — games will be played without fans — in hopes of keeping the coronavirus at bay. The NHL, which will test everyone inside the bubble daily, has consistently maintained one or more positive results wouldn't necessarily derail the restart.

The NHL and the NHLPA outlined extensive health and safety measures for training camps and resumption of play Monday — referred to as Phase 3 and Phase 4, respectively, of its return-to-play plan — in two documents totalling 47 pages.

Teams will be allowed to bring 52 personnel, with no more than 31 players, to its hub. Every person in the bubble will be subject to daily testing, including players, staff, hotel workers, food service employees and bus drivers. Every team member/player inside the bubble will be expected to remain there except in specific extenuating circumstances, including medical attention, the birth of a child or a death in the family.

Anyone returning to the bubble will be subject to a minimum four-day quarantine with daily nasal swab tests for COVID-19.

While the league is encouraging physical distancing at all times, players won't be required to wear masks when exercising or on the ice. The same goes for coaches behind the bench and off-ice officials. Masks are required to be worn inside the bubble by any individual not in their hotel room.

The NHL and NHLPA have the ability to delay, postpone, move or cancel games in the event there's a ""risk to player health and safety"" and/or a chance that ""the integrity of the competition"" is in jeopardy, including ""an uncontrolled outbreak of COVID-19.""

There is not, however, any specifics as to what would constitute ""an uncontrolled outbreak.""

Individuals leaving the bubble without permission may be subject to consequences up to and including removal from Phase 4. Teams could also be hit with steep punishments, including fines and/or loss of draft choices.

Players are allowed to opt out of Phase 3 and Phase 4 without penalty, but have to notify their team this week.

Vancouver, Las Vegas, Chicago, Columbus, Dallas, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh and Minneapolis/St. Paul were the other cities originally in the running to be hubs.

The NHL is looking to restart its season with a blueprint that includes eight best-of-five qualifying round series before pivoting to the typical 16-team playoffs. It's hoped the Stanley Cup, which has been awarded all but twice since 1893, will be handed out sometime in the fall.

Las Vegas was viewed as a hub front-runner because its massive hotel complexes could be more-easily secured in a bubble scenario until a recent surge in COVID-19 cases across large swaths of the United States — the death toll there currently stands at more than 130,000 people — likely made the destination far less appealing.

But despite Monday's good news, there remain difficult waters to navigate.

The league and NHLPA will not quarantine players during training camp, but instead ask they stay home when not at the rink in hopes isolation and testing will be enough to avoid any outbreaks.

Of the 396 NHLers tested at team facilities between June 8 and July 6 during voluntary workouts as part of Phase 2 protocols, 23 results — in the neighbourhood of six per cent — came back positive. The league said it's also aware of 12 other positive tests for players not taking part in Phase 2.

The Tampa Bay Lightning closed their practice facility last month after three players and additional staff members tested positive for COVID-19. Of the 24 teams poised to resume play, 18 are located in the U.S., including current virus hot spots like Florida, Texas and Arizona.

Four clubs previously confirmed 10 positive tests in the spring, with five coming from the Ottawa Senators, three from the Colorado Avalanche, and one each from the Pittsburgh Penguins and Boston Bruins.

Now with some destinations looking to slowly reopen, and, in an effort to catch a glimpse of future travel trends, I’m continuing to reach out to travel experts and tourism bureaus across Canada and the globe for answers to five similar questions.

And while no one can predict the future, all are hopeful travel will soon resume. But, how exactly that will look is anyone’s guess.

If you are part of a destination management organization or represent a property and want to share your thoughts, please drop me a line at writersblock5@hotmail.com.

Five questions with Lessner Gomez, director, Cuba Tourist Board, Toronto office.

How did COVID-19 impact tourism in Cuba?

Like other tourist destinations around the world, Cuba closed to international travel because of the Corona Virus. Cuba is now ready to slowly open to visitors.

In order to control and isolate any possible infection, Cuba has reopened its doors in Cayo Largo, Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo, Cayo Santa María and Cayo Cruz effective July 1.

Cuba is beginning to reopen to tourism. Who are the first international visitors Cuba will be expecting?

Cuba is looking forward to welcoming travellers from Canada and Europe. We have enjoyed a special relationship with Canada for over forty years.

We look forward to welcoming Canada back to our beautiful beaches.

How important are Canadians to tourism in Cuba?

Historically Canada has always been the biggest international inbound market for Cuba.

What does the future hold for Cuba and are there any trends we can look forward to?

As with the rest of the world, the future is hard to predict, but we are very positive.

Cuba enjoys a world class health system with particular expertise in the treatment of diseases of the lungs. In fact, throughout this pandemic we have offered medical support to countries around the world.

We believe we can offer tourists from Canada the confidence to return to our wonderful destinations and we look forward to welcoming them.

We believe that by opening gradually, tourist will feel comfortable with our planning and slowly we can begin to open other parts of our country.

What enhanced safety measures have been put in place to ensure visitors to resorts, hotels and attractions will be safe?

Over the past few months, the Cuban government has focused its efforts on the battle against the pandemic.

During this time, government officials took steps to improve all hotels and tourism infrastructure. Hygiene and sanitary protocols were put in place in order to ensure the safety of the Cuban people and its international visitors, as tourism activities are reactivated.

Hygiene and sanitary protocols will be practiced from the first phase, for example:

In order to operate, tourist facilities must obtain government certification called: Most hygienic and safest tourism (T + HS).

Workers with respiratory symptoms will not be allowed on resort premises and anyone with symptoms will be immediately directed to a health center.

International tourist circulation will only take place at the cayos (islands) where tourists enjoy their holidays.

Excursions will be offered only at the cayos for the international market.

The nautical activities and operations at international marinas of tourist centers approved for international tourism are reactivated.

As approved by the Cuban Ministry of Public Health, in the second phase, foreign tourists will undergo the PCR test free of charge upon their arrival in the country.

Bonus question

Where do Americans fit into the scheme of things in Cuba right now?

There are no changes on the Cuba-US relations and related travel restrictions.

The ferry company announced July 3 that starting on July 10 two round trips would be added to the schedule on Fridays and Sundays – a 4:20 and 6:40 p.m. departure from Langdale and a 3:15 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. departure from Horseshoe Bay.

article continues below

BC Ferries is also adding more trips on other busy routes, including Horseshoe Bay-Nanaimo.

The addition of more sailings comes as local governments are calling for a return to a full summer schedule and travellers continue to voice frustration online.

In a lengthy post on her Facebook page July 3, Sechelt Mayor Darnleda Siegers asked residents upset with the current level of service, short-notice schedule changes, and problems rebooking reservations to “cut [BC Ferries] some slack.”

“Behind the glitches and the mistakes are humans just like you and I and they are trying as best they can,” she wrote.

But Siegers is also urging Coasters to lobby the province and the federal government for more financial support for BC Ferries.

“BC Ferries needs financial assistance from the provincial and federal government as they are using their capital funds, previously earmarked for the Langdale ferry upgrade and our second ship and other capital expenditures, to cover off their operating costs,” said Siegers.

Siegers also called the $180,000 the provincial government has already committed to keep sailings from being cut on minor routes, including Earls Cove-Saltery Bay, “a drop in the bucket.”

“There is some money earmarked for B.C. from the federal government that will be provided within the next while,” she said. “I’d like to see some of it go to BC Ferries.”

The money Siegers is referring to is part of a $14-billion “safe restart agreement” between Ottawa and the provinces.

West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast-Sea to Sky Country MP Patrick Weiler has also suggested that agreement could be the source of funding to backstop BC Ferries against the financial losses caused by the sudden drop in ridership in the early phase of the pandemic.

“I believe that one of the areas that they want to make sure that funding is going to go towards is transit, which has been very much hit hard by the pandemic similar to BC Ferries, which could also be an option for that funding,” Weiler said during a June 23 update for the Sechelt and District Chamber of Commerce.

In response to Coast Reporter’s inquiry to the premier’s office about the status of the discussions on the safe restart agreement and whether some of the money would be used to support a return to normal service levels on BC Ferries, officials with the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure replied that the government is “pleased to see the federal government agreeing to provide much-needed support for a variety of important provincial issues.”

“However, the number and size of programs that have been included in this list is substantial,” the email from the ministry continued. “So we look forward to seeing the details to make sure it can adequately support our recovery efforts.”

On the specific issue of BC Ferries the ministry said, “We know ferries are vital for maintaining the critical supply chain for food, goods and medicine, and for people who live and work on our coast, and continue to work with the federal government on solutions.”",[]
260,newwestrecord,https://www.newwestrecord.ca/covid-19/public-gets-inside-access-at-gibsons-library-for-first-time-since-pandemic-hit-1.24165700,Public gets inside access at Gibsons library for first time since pandemic hit,['Sophie Woodrooffe'],,"As of July 6, people wanting books from Gibsons and District Public Library will no longer have to order them like pizza – for the first time in four months, they can walk inside and browse the shelves themselves.

“We’re looking forward to it,” said library director Heather Evans-Cullen an hour before Monday’s official 10 a.m. opening. “If I could have a ribbon cutting or slab cake, I would.”

article continues below

At least five people had already arrived before opening hours, she said. Hours of operation are now Monday to Saturday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.

Doors may finally be open again but operations are far from normal. For the first two weeks, a maximum of 20 patrons will be allowed inside at any given time, “to make sure we can maintain distancing,” said Evans-Cullen.

The layout has been modified and Plexiglas installed to maintain physical barriers, returned books are quarantined for 72 hours and staff wear face shields.

The library has been closed to the public since March, when public health restrictions due to COVID-19 took effect. In late May it began offering curbside pickup and drop-off services on site, but patrons weren’t able to enter the building.

The curbside “takeout” book service is still being offered and access to digital media “contactless services” such as audiobooks, ebooks and databases, remains available.

About 65 per cent of the Town of Gibsons residents are patrons of the library, far higher than the provincial average, said Evans-Cullen. “I think it’s a special relationship this community has with this library.” With the opening, “they’re coming back home a little bit.”

And with the opening, two other important services will now be available to the public: computers and washroom facilities. “Our washrooms will be open. That’s been a huge limitation for people who may be homeless or not have sustainable housing,” said Evans-Cullen, adding that washroom access was something B.C. provincial health officer Bonnie Henry had asked libraries to provide, if possible.

Takeout delivery remains in place at the Sechelt Public Library. Interim library director Leianne Emery anticipates opening the doors to the public to browse shelves by the start of August, but an exact date will depend on a potential building envelope project, “which will affect the library interior,” she said in an email.

In the meantime, three major interior construction projects are underway and protective glass is being installed. Those projects should be completed by July 20, at which point the library will begin adding limited public computer access and in-person tech help to the other services it is already providing, including offering materials for “takeout,” providing online and phone tech help, exam invigilation, photocopying and faxing services and reciprocal borrowing between Sechelt and Gibsons libraries.

The Sechelt library is aiming to have outdoor “under the tent programming” up and running for small groups within the next couple of weeks. And children can pick up their reading logs at either the Gibsons or Sechelt library for the Summer Reading Club.

The Roberts Creek Community Library has been open to the public since June 19 but with modified hours.

In July, the library is open Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., Sundays from noon to 2 p.m., Tuesdays from 2 p.m. to 8 p.m. and Wednesdays from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. Safety conditions apply and instructions are available at the library’s entrance. Only one patron and child are allowed inside the building at a time.

A return to in-person services kicked off quietly at the Pender Harbour Reading Centre on July 2, according to board chair Karen Dyck. It is now open Tuesdays through Saturdays from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. and will be fully staffed with volunteers until the end of August. As with the Roberts Creek library, only one person is allowed inside at a time with some exceptions for children. Masks are required for borrowers and volunteers. And because people have been dropping off materials throughout the COVID-19 epidemic, “we have lots of books on the shelf,” said Dyck.

Over the course of the pandemic, no orders have been issued by the provincial health officer requiring libraries to close.

A May 7 letter from Vancouver Coastal Health’s (VCH) deputy chief medical health officer Mark Lysyshyn stated that VCH “believes that the risk of COVID-19 transmission in these environments can be mitigated and consistent with B.C.’s Restart Plan, that it is possible to safely operate these facilities at this time.”

Libraries must operate with a COVID-19 safety plan in place that draws from WorkSafeBC protocols.",[]

Representatives from Teamsters Canada, the United Food and Commercial Workers Union Canada and Unifor point to the dozens of retail and warehouse workers who remain sickened with COVID-19 and a report Monday from CTV News in Windsor, Ont. that two workers had just tested positive in the border city.

article continues below

Some of those previously sickened have returned to work. A few workers have died from the novel coronavirus disease.

Speaking to a House of Commons committee Monday, the union leaders recommended stricter labour standards and oversight for the sector, beyond getting to the bottom of why the pay premium was abruptly rolled back by some of the largest grocery chains.

Unifor national president Jerry Dias said the fact two more workers now have COVID-19 ""is probably proof positive"" that the pandemic premium for hourly workers shouldn't have disappeared.

When the pandemic struck Canada in March, major grocery chains said they would boost front-line workers' wages on average about $2 per hour.

But late last month, one after another, the chains announced they were ending the pandemic pay bump because the pace of business had eased, giving the unions short notice about the decision.

MPs on the industry committee agreed to look into the matter and will have a chance to question retail executives at the end of the week.

""Look, the argument is nonsense and every one of us on this panel understands that and I will argue they understand that as well,"" Dias said, referring to grocery-chain executives.

""So this had nothing to do with somehow the pandemic, 'Oh we're seeing a pot at the end of the rainbow,' this was a decision made about money.""

Paul Meinema, national president of the food workers' union, said the federal government should play a more active role in boosting wages for workers in the sector.

Grocery stores were among the businesses governments deemed essential services that didn't have to close as public health restrictions forced companies to cut operations to slow the spread of COVID-19.

The pandemic pay was supposed to recognize that workers were being asked to come in to help feed a population ordered to stay home. Conservative MP Michelle Rempel Garner said she wanted to determine how to properly compensate workers who are being put in that situation.

Spending on things like gasoline and travel fell but spending on groceries has gone up — one of the few areas of the economy where things appeared positive during the lockdowns of April and May.

NDP MP Brian Masse, who represents a riding in Windsor, Ont., said the industry needs more oversight, calling the committee probe ""the first dive at this.""

To kick off the byelection, the city is supposed to appoint a chief election officer, but city staff is recommending that be put off for now, citing concerns around COVID-19. For instance, strict rules on large congregations of people could put a chill on voter turnout, while lifting those rules would create a potential hazard for voters.

According to a staff report to council, the Ministry of Municipal Affairs has deferred byelections in Victoria, Rossland and Lytton, as well as a referendum in Kamloops, to protect residents from COVID-19.

The staff report noted city clerk Kate O’Connell reached out to the ministry to ask about guidelines for votes held during the pandemic. In response, the ministry indicated it was in the process of developing those guidelines and recommended the byelection be deferred.

Staff passed that recommendation on to council ahead of Monday evening’s regular meeting, saying it is “not practicable” to hold a byelection without the guidelines.

The election guidelines are being developed by Elections BC, the Ministry of Municipal Affairs, the Local Government Management Association and the Union of B.C. Municipalities, according to the staff report, and development is still in early stages. Staff noted there is still no clear timeline for when those guidelines are expected to be completed.

Once the guideline is completed, staff will devise a safety plan for the byelection and bring a report to council.",[]

Options to do so are now on the table as members of Parliament and hundreds of behind-the-scenes staff begin to plan for what their headquarters could look like come fall, to the extent they can.

""Is it better to meet in person or virtually come September?"" House of Commons Speaker Anthony Rota said to the procedure and house affairs committee Monday.

""COVID has been changing so drastically along the way it's very difficult to predict what will happen in a month and a half or two months from now.""

But in the meantime, a mobile app could be deployed to allow MPs to vote whether they're on Parliament Hill or off, Rota said.

The app is fully bilingual, meets accessibility standards, and is secure, including providing administrators the ability to know where MPs are when they vote and authenticate their identities.

""The proposed approach for an electronic voting system respects several key principles,"" Rota said.

Finding a way for MPs to vote while limiting the risk of COVID-19 transmission has been a sticking point for the Liberal government as it has faced pressure from the Opposition Conservatives to allow for the full resumption of Parliament.

MPs have grappled with how they can do their jobs ever since Parliament, like much of the rest of the country, shut down in mid-March to slow the spread of COVID-19.

Several compromises have been reached along the way, including a hybrid model that allows MPs to participate in person or virtually in debates or committee meetings.

Those debates and meetings have been limited in scope and the Opposition Conservatives have pressed for a full return to business that would expand the powers MPs have available to press the government and get more information.

Right now, Parliament is expected to resume sitting full-time on Sept. 21, though there is a single sitting day scheduled for this week.

Summer sitting days were among the concessions opposition parties won as they've fought for greater accountability.

The virtual voting plan is best to be rolled out come fall, Rota said, citing the time needed to get the right system in place.

In addition to an app, he's presented MPs with the option of a video-conferencing approach that would piggyback on the hybrid arrangement in place now.

Rota's report, however, raised several concerns with that, including unstable internet connections, the amount of time it would take, and the sensitive issue of MPs not being present to vote.

A video-conferencing approach would need to name each MP in turn to double-check an MP isn't on mute or having trouble with the connection.

""The absence of members would be highlighted to the public, to the media and to other members of the House, contrary to current practice,"" the report said.

Conservative MPs have come under scrutiny in recent weeks for their absence from the current special COVID-19 committee of MPs that replaced the normal House of Commons sitting.

Unlike in regular sittings, for the committee it is possible to see exactly who attended, and tallies have suggested many Tories haven't shown up regularly.

When it comes to virtual voting, the Conservatives have largely opposed the approach, citing a resistance to anything that keeps MPs off the Hill.

They argue it is possible to adjust regular procedures to allow for physical distancing, and had asked for a look at how voting could take place in person.

Pandemic-safe options could include lining up outside the Commons chamber to vote, voting in shifts or voting by proxy, Rota's analysis suggested.

Among the issues in-person voting raises is the question of time and resources needed to keep the chamber clean as well as how long the votes themselves would take.

The MPs are aiming to have their recommendations in place later this month.

The league says 23 of 396 players checked for COVID-19 at team facilities have tested positive since voluntary Phase 2 workouts began June 8 — a rate of just under six per cent. In that same time period, the NHL added it is aware of 12 additional positive test results.

article continues below

That's an increase of eight players in Phase 2, and one from outside the NHL's testing system, over the last week.

The NHL says it has administered more than 2,900 tests at team facilities.

Ten additional players were confirmed to have tested positive in the spring — five from the Ottawa Senators, three from the Colorado Avalanche and one each from the Pittsburgh Penguins and Boston Bruins. That brings the total number of NHLers with confirmed positive tests to 45 since the schedule was suspended in mid-March.

The league is no longer providing details on the players or clubs with positive tests. There was no word on the health status of the 35 players in question, including whether or not they experienced symptoms or have recovered.

""All players who have tested positive have been self-isolated and are following (government) protocols,"" the NHL said in a statement released on Twitter.

The league and NHL Players' Association on Sunday night agreed on protocols to start training camps and resume the season. That includes daily testing once games get under way for players, coaches and staff.

Resuming is contingent on each side approving an extension of the collective bargaining agreement and the return-to-play protocol.

Think you might have symptoms? Take a self-assessment

On this page

Symptoms of COVID-19

Symptoms of COVID-19 can vary from person to person. Symptoms may also vary in different age groups. Some of the more commonly reported symptoms include:

new or worsening cough

shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

temperature equal to or over 38°C

feeling feverish

chills

fatigue or weakness

muscle or body aches

new loss of smell or taste

headache

gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting)

feeling very unwell



Children have been more commonly reported to have abdominal symptoms, and skin changes or rashes.

In severe cases, infection can lead to death.

Symptoms may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to COVID-19.

Recent evidence indicates that the virus can be transmitted to others from someone who is infected but not showing symptoms. This includes people who:

have not yet developed symptoms (pre-symptomatic)

never develop symptoms (asymptomatic)

While experts know that these kinds of transmissions are happening among those in close contact or in close physical settings, it is not known to what extent. This means it is extremely important to follow the proven preventative measures.

If you or your child become ill

If you are showing symptoms of COVID-19, reduce your contact with others:

isolate yourself at home for 14 days to avoid spreading it to others if you live with others, stay in a separate room or keep a 2-metre distance

visit a health care professional or call your local public health authority call ahead to tell them your symptoms and follow their instructions



Children who have mild COVID-19 symptoms are able to stay at home with a caregiver throughout their recovery without needing hospitalization. If you are caring for a child who has suspected or probable COVID-19, it is important to follow the advice for caregivers. This advice will help you protect yourself, others in your home, as well as others in the community.

If you become sick while travelling back to Canada:

inform the flight attendant or a Canadian border services officer

advise a Canada border services agent on arrival in Canada if you believe you were exposed to someone who was sick with COVID-19, even if you do not have symptoms this is required under the Quarantine Act the Canada border services agent will provide instructions for you to follow



Check if you have been exposed

Have you been on a recent flight, cruise, train, or at a public gathering? Check the listed exposure locations to see if you may have been exposed to COVID-19.

Take care of your mental health

The COVID-19 pandemic is new and unexpected. This situation can be unsettling and can cause a sense of loss of control. It is normal to feel sad, stressed, confused, scared or worried in a crisis. Make sure to care for your mental and physical wellbeing and to ask for help if you feel overwhelmed.

Diagnosing coronavirus

Coronavirus infections are diagnosed by a health care provider based on symptoms and are confirmed through laboratory tests.

Treating coronavirus

Most people with mild coronavirus illness will recover on their own.

If you are concerned about your symptoms, you should self-monitor and consult your health care provider. They may recommend steps you can take to relieve symptoms.

Vaccine, therapeutics and medical devices

At this time, a vaccine and therapies to treat or prevent this disease have not yet been identified. But research and development are underway. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a global review of therapies that may be used to treat or prevent the disease.

Health Canada is fast tracking the importation and sale of medical devices for use in relation to COVID-19.

Flu vaccine

If you have received a flu vaccine, it will not protect against coronaviruses, but will help prevent the flu. Getting the flu could make you more vulnerable to other infections.

Getting the flu vaccine will not increase your risk of illness from coronavirus. For more information, please refer to this recently published Canadian research study.

About coronaviruses

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people and others cause illness in animals. Human coronaviruses are common and are typically associated with mild illnesses, similar to the common cold.

COVID-19 is a new disease that has not been previously identified in humans. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people, and more rarely, these can then spread from person to person through close contact.

There have been 2 other specific coronaviruses that have spread from animals to humans and which have caused severe illness in humans. These are the:",[]

Limit contact

Only one healthy person should provide care.

Do not share personal items with the ill person, such as toothbrushes, towels, bed linen, utensils or electronic devices.

Use a separate bathroom from the ill person, if possible. If not possible, the ill person should put the toilet lid down before flushing.

Some people may transmit COVID-19 even though they do not show any symptoms. Wearing a mask, including a non-medical mask or face covering (i.e. made with at least two layers of tightly woven fabric, constructed to completely cover the nose and mouth without gaping, and secured to the head by ties or ear loops) can help protect others around you.

Prevent contact with animals, as there have been several reports of people transmitting COVID-19 to their pets.

Protect yourself

If possible, people who are at higher risk of serious illness from COVID-19 should not care for someone with COVID-19. These people include elderly persons, those with chronic medical conditions (e.g. heart disease, diabetes) or compromised immune systems.

If you need to be within 2 metres of the ill person, wear personal protective equipment: a medical mask disposable gloves eye protection

Wear disposable gloves when touching the ill person, their environment and soiled items or surfaces.

Avoid re-using medical masks or gloves.

Clean your hands often for at least 20 seconds, especially after contact with the ill person and after removing gloves, face masks and eye protection.

Dry your hands with disposable paper towels. If not available, use a reusable towel and replace it when it becomes wet.

You can also remove dirt with a wet wipe and then use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.

Wearing masks Medical masks are recommended for COVID-19 patients in the home and for protection for those providing direct care to COVID-19 patients at home.

N95 respirators must be reserved for healthcare workers and should not be used for caregiving at home.

If medical masks are not available, non-medical masks or face coverings (i.e. constructed to completely cover the nose and mouth without gaping, and secured to the head by ties or ear loops) can be worn by the ill person, if tolerable. This will cover their mouth and nose, and may prevent respiratory droplets from contaminating others or landing on surfaces.

A non-medical mask or face covering may also be worn by those providing direct care to COVID-19 patients at home. However, wearing a non-medical mask or facial covering in the community has not been proven to protect the person wearing it.

Strict hygiene and public health measures, including frequent hand washing and maintaining a physical distance of at least 2 metres from the ill person, will reduce the chance of being exposed to the virus.

Non-medical cloth masks should be carefully removed when soiled or damp, laundered in hot water and then dried thoroughly.

Hands must be cleaned before and after putting on and removing a mask.

Keep your environment clean

Place used medical masks, gloves and other contaminated items in a lined container, secure the contents and dispose of them with other household waste.

Place possibly contaminated laundry, including non-medical cloth masks and facial coverings, into a container with a plastic liner and do not shake. Wash with regular laundry soap and hot water (60-90°C), and dry well. Clothing, linens and non-medical cloth masks and facial coverings belonging to the ill person can be washed with other laundry.

At least once daily, clean and disinfect surfaces that people touch often, such as toilets, laundry containers, bedside tables, doorknobs, phones and television remotes.

Use only approved hard-surface disinfectants that have a Drug Identification Number (DIN). A DIN is an 8-digit number given by Health Canada that confirms the disinfectant product is approved and safe for use in Canada.

When approved hard surface disinfectants are not available, for household disinfection, a diluted bleach solution can be prepared in accordance with the instructions on the label, or in a ratio of 5 millilitres (mL) of bleach per 250 mL of water OR 20 mL of bleach per litre of water. This ratio is based on bleach containing 5% sodium hypochlorite, to give a 0.1% sodium hypochlorite solution. Follow instructions for proper handling of household (chlorine) bleach.

If they can withstand the use of liquids for disinfection, high-touch electronic devices (e.g. keyboards, tablets, smartboards) may be disinfected with 70% alcohol (e.g. alcohol prep wipes) at least daily.

Monitor yourself for symptoms

If you have always used the recommended precautions, then monitor yourself for symptoms for 14 days following your last close contact with the ill person.

Quarantine (self-isolate) at home for 14 days from your last exposure and contact your local public health authority if you have no symptoms but: cared for a person who has COVID-19 without the recommended personal protective equipment live with or had close physical contact (e.g. intimate partner) without using the recommended personal protective equipment live with or have had regular close contact (within 2 metres) with a person who has COVID-19 up to 48 hours prior to symptom onset or while they were symptomatic and not isolating had direct contact with the body fluids of a person who has COVID-19 (e.g. were coughed or sneezed on) without the recommended personal protective equipment



If you start to develop symptoms, isolate yourself as quickly as possible and contact your local public health authority for further instructions.

Maintain these supplies

Medical masks if available, or non-medical mask or face covering

Eye protection (face shield or goggles) for use by caregiver

Disposable gloves (do not re-use) for use by caregiver

Disposable paper towels

Tissues

Waste container with plastic liner

Thermometer

Over the counter medication to reduce fever (e.g. ibuprofen or acetaminophen)

Running water

Hand soap

Alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol

On Tuesday July 14, 2020, Dr. Bonnie Henry, Provincial Health Officer and Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, announced 13 new cases of COVID-19 in the province for a total of 3,128 cases in British Columbia. Of the total COVID-19 cases, 14 individuals are hospitalized, five of whom are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation. Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 1,015 cases of COVID-19 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region. There are no new community outbreaks, but there have been several exposure events particularly in the Kelowna area. These occurred when a group of people from different areas including the Okanagan, lower mainland and Alberta got together. To date, 17 of these individuals have tested positive for COVID-19. Dr. Henry says as people become more active and travel, we will see more cases. Public health teams are actively working to manage cases and clusters as they emerge and keep new cases low and slow. Of note, the first incubation period since Canada Day is now complete.



Economic and fiscal update for 2020-21

The British Columbia government is forecasting a $12.5 billion deficit due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The provincial budget for 2020, tabled just months before the global pandemic, predicted a budget surplus of $227 million for 2020-21. Carole James, Minister of Finance, says the pandemic has exposed underlying gaps in our economy and society, and reminded us of the need for strong public services and supports. Government has supported people and businesses with $6.26 billion in COVID-19 supports to date. That includes the $5 billion in supplementary spending for B.C.’s COVID-19 Action Plan supports, such as workers benefits, rent supplements, income and disability assistance supports and economic recovery funding. These are in addition to $1.26 billion in other tax and relief measures for people and businesses, including the one-time increase to the climate action tax credit and property tax reductions for businesses.

Warning about calls appearing to come from Squamish General Hospital



Vancouver Coastal Health is warning the public not to provide personal information over the phone if they receive an unexpected call that appears to come from Squamish General Hospital. Someone claiming to be a hospital employee is calling people and asking for their full names, social insurance number and date of birth. This is in no way associated with Vancouver Coastal Health, and appears to be a phishing scam, where people are tricked into providing personal information that can be used fraudulently. RCMP have been advised.



Testing

Anyone in the VCH region with cold, influenza or COVID-19-like symptoms, however mild, can now be assessed for and get a COVID-19 test. Contact your physician or nurse practitioner's office, or a local community collection centre to arrange for a test. Phone numbers and locations of collection centre can be found by visiting: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/testing or by calling 8-1-1. In Vancouver, the City Centre and REACH urgent and primary care centres can provide testing as well as the St. Vincent's drive-up location at 4875 Heather Street. The Richmond Assessment Centre is located at 6820 Gilbert Road, in the parking lot of the Richmond Tennis Club. On the North Shore, testing is available at the North Vancouver Urgent and Primary Care Centre. If you think you need testing, please call ahead before visiting your doctor, urgent and primary care center or health clinic.

According to Dr. Blyth, here are 3 effective and easy tips to improve the health of your skin—and your overall health—as you age:

article continues below

1. Nutrition, exercise, water, sleep: Maintaining a regular and comfortable sleeping schedule with a steady dose of exercise, water and healthy foods is still the best foundation for healthy skin and overall wellness.

2. Stress reduction: “I work in the emergency department [in my days away from the clinic] and I can’t tell you how many people come in with headaches and dizziness, completely stressed-out,” said Dr. Blyth. “Most of us live in a very stressful environment so we need ways to reduce the stress on a regular basis. I recommend exercise and meditating in particular – both are a great way to release stress and optimize body function.

3. Mineral and vitamin replenishments: As we get older hormone deficiencies and imbalances are more likely, says Dr. Blyth. Coupled with a daily dose of stress and the lack of a regular, healthy regime, the effect on our overall health can be severe. Dr. Blyth says mineral and vitamin replenishments are a great quick option.

“There are deficiencies that we test for at the clinic and optimize, in terms of body function,” he says. “In terms of the skin, thyroid, estrogen, and testosterone deficiencies—they can all affect the appearance of your skin, but on a greater level something like estrogen delivers leads to 400 different functions in the body—so it really is important that people take it seriously.”

Dr. Blyth makes a point of educating patients on the importance of a regular healthy regime.

“We’re a bit behind the U.S. in this regard,” he says. “We’re living longer now, so it’s become more and more important to optimize our health to improve our quality of life in the later years.”

The garden is an accessible and less expensive alternative to individual rooftop installations, and is part of the Energy Save New West program, itself part of the city’s larger goal of embracing clean local energy and the green economy. It has been in operation since June 2018, with a 50 kW array consisting of 156 solar panels. A second solar garden was installed earlier this year at the Public Works yard.

So far, the project has proven a fantastic success. Aside from being the first municipality-led community solar initiative in Metro Vancouver, it has been getting plenty of attention from other cities and organizations. Most recently, it was named the winner of the Environmental Award 2019 from the Engineers and Geoscientists of BC organization, in its prestigious annual awards program.

“The city is leading with action,” said Faltas. “The project is a template for transferability to other municipalities in BC and Canada to develop their own community-led renewable energy projects.”

He hopes to see the solar gardens developed in other communities, noting New Westminster’s version grew, in part, from the example set by Nelson Hydro with their community solar garden. “It’s extremely gratifying to participate in a community-led project that demonstrates local leadership in renewable energy.” The solar garden is operated under the Energy Save New West initiative, in partnership with Ecolighten Energy Solutions, a local consulting firm lead by CEO Ryan Coleman, supporting the city through design, mobilization and program management. The initiative is one of the longest running and most comprehensive community energy efficiency and greenhouse gas reductions programs in Canada. Any New Westminster Electric Utility customer can participate by subscribing to a portion of the solar electricity generated by the array on a per panel basis. The amount of energy generated by the garden is then credited back to a subscriber’s bills in proportion to their investment, for up to 25 years.

“New Westminster has been making important progress to reduce our carbon footprint and the Urban Solar Garden initiative is an example of our leadership in that,” said Mayor Jonathan Coté. “Moving forward, with our Seven Bold Steps for Climate Action we will continue to work with the community to address the Climate Emergency, developing new ideas and initiatives for meeting our goals.”

Doreen explains that in acupuncture and Chinese medicine, meridians are a set of pathways in the body along which vital energy flows. There are twelve such pathways that are associated with specific body organs. Doreen highlights four of these important meridians and their associated organs:

article continues below

· Kidney

The kidney is the root of life with functions that are closely related to every aspect of our development from birth to death. The kidney meridian travels the inside of the ankles and, therefore, massaging the area around the ankles can strengthen and circulate energy in the kidney/adrenal system to improve overall health

· Liver

The liver opens into the eyes, which is why the eyes are often used as a diagnostic tool for determining the health of the liver. If liver blood is abundant, we will see clearly. If it is deficient, there could be eye problems such as blurred vision, dry eyes, and floaters

· Heart

The heart is considered the ruler of other organs in Chinese medicine. It is deeply involved with the mental and emotional processes. The heart is considered the residence of the mind and, as such, is the organ most often involved in insomnia, depression, anxiety, and memory

· Lungs

In Chinese medicine, the lungs are associated with boundary, breath, and renewal. Abundant lung energy manifests as strong physical vitality. Conversely, weak lung energy shows up in low vitality and a poor immune system resulting in shallow breathing and skin that appears to be unhealthy. Emotionally, there is likely to be constraint and sadness.

“Regular acupuncture treatments,” Doreen says, “can regulate the function of the meridians and all body systems to bring about the return of overall balance and help restore physical and emotional health.”

Can you spot the scam?,[],,"New Westminster residents will want to take note that loan scams are on the rise in Canadian communities, putting a large population at risk each year of having their hard-earned money taken.

In fact, millions of dollars have been lost to all types of financial scams over the past two years, reports the Better Business Bureau of Canada.

article continues below

The scariest part?

Once the money is lost to a scam, recovering it is next to impossible. This is a high price to pay for a simple yet common mistake.

Canadians count on loans

Having the ability to access lenders can be life-changing. A loan approval can wipe away financial woes for many, providing a way to pay essential, outstanding bills and put food on the table.

Cue the private online lenders.

Private online vendors have improved the financial landscape for many. Often, these web-based resources are more willing to help people experiencing financial issues or those with denied loan applications from mainstream branches access the funds they need.

However, the increase in online loan vendors has also spurred the number of personal loan fraud cases. Recognizing the common signs of a loan scam can be the easiest and best defence against shady lenders.

How can you detect a loan scam?

When you’re asked to pay up

A recent Loans Canada survey revealed that approximately 45 per cent of credit-constrained Canadians who believe they’re financially savvy agree that alternative or online lenders are allowed to ask for upfront payment because it adds additional security.

This could be a costly mistake.

Licensed lenders never ask for money upfront. In fact, illegitimate lenders will ask for a processing or insurance fee as a condition for approval. Don’t fall for this. Be on alert if you’re asked to transfer money as a method to secure a loan.

Approval guaranteed

Life has no guarantees, and neither do loan approvals. An authorized lender will verify applicant information and evaluate credit before making a decision. When lenders guarantee approval, it’s just a scam to lure in applicants and collect upfront fees.

Guaranteed approval is a scam. Find out why here.

Pressuring applicants to commit quickly

Often, scammers will put pressure on loan applicants to decide quickly. This leaves little time for the applicant to realize they’re being swindled. Be careful of any tight expiration dates as they can be a sign of a scam.

Do they have an office?

Loans Canada’s survey also confirmed that credit-constrained Canadians rarely call vendors to pose questions and do more research when taking out a loan.

If a company has a lack of presence in the real world, it’s likely a sign something might be awry. Search out independent information on the lender and double-check if they have an actual office with a legitimate address.

Knowledge is the best way to protect yourself

Loans Canada advises Canadians to research lenders, search out verified sources for reviews and discuss applying for loans with trusted friends or family members. These are all ways that Canadians can arm themselves with more information, which will ultimately help them avoid falling for a loan scam.

“Over the last few years loan fraud has been on the rise,” says Loans Canada Chief Technology Officer, Cris Ravazzano. “Loan scammers impersonate many online lenders and similar websites, duping Canadians into paying to qualify for fraudulent loans. We want to bring awareness to this issue to help inform and protect potential victims of this fraud.”

Have you been scammed? Now what?

Once a scammer takes your money, there is a very low chance you’ll ever get it back. However, if you’re suspicious that a lender might be fraudulent, contact your local police and the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre.",[]

So when he sees anyone in his community heading in the wrong direction with their financial planning, he is compelled to help.

article continues below

“A retirement plan is always adjustable,” says Waddington, a New Westminster native who has been providing financial advice since 2008. “I’ve had a client come to me when he was 32 years old, unmarried with no children and no house, and others come to me when they’re well into retirement already. In either case—and every type of case in between—we can put the right financial plan in place.”

“The most important things are a) to have a plan in place sooner rather than later, b) to define your goals and c) to know what the ‘gap’ is—meaning the difference between where you are and where you want to be. That way you can plot a course of action to bridge the gap before it’s too late.”

Waddington, along with a team of wealth specialists at Canaccord Genuity Wealth Management, created a comprehensive list of the most common retirement planning mistakes they’ve seen.

Here are three to consider:

1. Asset allocation– Spreading your investments across different asset classes is a key consideration when planning for retirement.

“The three main classes are equities (stocks), fixed income (bonds) and cash,” Waddington explains. “There are other classes, of course, like commodities and real estate, but those are the main branches in a nutshell. By diversifying your investments across these different asset classes, you can adjust the amount of risk you take.”

2. Tax consequences of retirement – Many people will experience a change in their tax bracket upon retirement due to employment changes, a RRSP kicking in or taxes on public pension benefits, says Waddington.

“Not factoring in the government’s cut is a common mistake people make with RRSPs,” he says. “Yes, they allow you to invest your money for retirement without having to pay taxes on it immediately. But this money becomes taxable income the moment you start withdrawing it.”

3. Health care expenses – While retirement can bring about a time of relaxation, it can also bring with it the complications of age.

“Your medical expenses will go up after retirement and the further into retirement you are, the higher your expenses will likely be,” says Waddington. “It’s a major mistake that too many pre-retirees make. That said, there are three things you can do to guard against this: invest properly, consider long-term care insurance and keep your body healthy.”

There are decisions to make about educational paths, housing and employment. Many young adults have support systems (whether it’s parents and/or extended family members) to help them through.

But for the 700 young adults aging out of foster care every year, which happens at age 19 in B.C., the challenges are even more dire. Along with a roster of social barriers, youth aging out of foster care often don’t have networks that can facilitate access to rental housing, such as parents who can act as guarantors to sign leases. “You don’t have any of the main things a landlord on a screening application would require, and you’re trying to compete with people who do,” says Christina Grammenos, Community Engagement Coordinator for Aunt Leah’s Place, a charity organization that for 30 years has been dedicated to preventing youth homelessness.

article continues below

To answer this need, in 2016 Aunt Leah’s Place created the Friendly Landlord Network, a web portal which connects young adults age 19 to 30 who are looking to live in safe, affordable housing with community-minded landlords.

The online system, which acts as an internal market for youth and non-profits around the Lower Mainland representing young adults, allows landlords to post information about available housing. “We can post the unit up on the (site) and that way through the 19 partner organizations, someone is going to have a young adult who fits the location and price range and style of unit, so we can find a good fit,” Grammenos explains.

Along with supporting youth through their house-hunting process, the Friendly Landlord Network also provides support to landlords including guidance on tenancy rights and responsibilities. The organization also commits to doing a physical check-in once a month for the first six months.

While a number of youth have found long-term housing through the network, Grammenos says, “We’d really like to get more private landlords, more property managers and building owners.”

Once stable housing is secured, the doors open to other possibilities for youth. As Brendan, 21, who has found a home through the Friendly Landlord Network puts it: “To me, having a home represents stability. You can't do anything if you're constantly worrying about where you'll sleep this month, this week, or even today. A nice home is the foundation for all future aspirations to succeed.”

We spoke with Dr. Karim Lalani at the New Westminster location of award-winning dental practice, Family Dental Centres, to find out just what a dentist can tell about a patient’s overall health by looking in the patient’s mouth.

article continues below

“There’s a strong connection between the mouth and other health conditions, especially when it comes to someone’s diet,” says Dr. Lalani. “Often times we’re able to make recommendations to patients based on what we see.”

Here are 8 diseases and/or conditions Dr. Lalani says can be reflected in the patient’s oral health.

1) Tongue or stomach issues.If acid in your mouth isn’t breaking down properly, this can be an indicator of tongue or stomach issues.

2) Diabetes.Overly red or unhealthy gums and tongue can be an early indicator of diabetes.

3) Dry mouth and other gland conditions.Through the saliva, a dentist can tell if a patient is suffering from dry mouth or other conditions that affect the glands, depending on how the saliva looks or if the mouth isn’t producing enough.

4) Heart disease.There’s been evidence of a trend between advanced gum disease and heart disease. People with gum disease tend to be more prone to heart attacks; however, the exact cause or reason is still unknown.

5) Vitamin deficiency.Dentists can often tell if you’re nutritionally balanced or unbalanced depending on the quality of your gums. Gums that are overly red and bleed more indicate an unbalanced diet.

6) Oral cancer.Unexplained bleeding, discoloured patches, or swelling can be early indicators of oral cancer.

7) Sinus infection.What feels like a toothache could be a sinus infection caused by increased pressure in your sinus cavity.

8) Grinding teeth and nail biting.If your tooth enamel is worn down and flat, it can be a sign that you’re grinding your teeth at night (or that you bite your nails). Both habits are often underlying symptoms of stress.

“Our clinic has six physiotherapists, six massage therapists, a chiropractor, a dietician, and a clinical counsellor,” says Jeanie Bezdan, co-founder and owner of Royal City Health & Manual Therapy.

Conveniently located in the Royal City Centre Mall in New Westminster, Royal City Health & Manual Therapy offers shockwave therapy in conjunction with chiropractic and physiotherapy treatments.

“Typically, a patient is booked in initially for either physiotherapy or chiropractic sessions,” Jeanie explains. “They may then progress to the inclusion of shockwave therapy at the discretion of the treating practitioner.”

Used for decades to help alleviate chronic pain from a variety of causes, shockwave therapy is a non-invasive treatment that consists of an intense, but very short energy wave that travels faster than the speed of sound.

“It’s administered using a hand-held instrument that emits strong sound wave energy pulses to the affected area,” Jeanie says. “Approximately 2,000 pulses are introduced in a four-minute treatment, allowing pathological alterations of tendons, ligaments, capsules, muscles, and bones to be eliminated systematically.”

Jeanie points to studies that have shown the success of shockwave treatment over the years.

“Studies have shown that this type of treatment results in 83 percent improvement with calcific tendonitis of the shoulder,” Jeanie notes, “and 77 percent improvement with tennis elbow. There’s a 90 percent success rate with plantar fasciitis and 88 percent improvement for patellar tendonitis.”

The number of treatments necessary is dependent on the condition being treated, but the healthcare professionals at Royal City Health typically space treatments five to seven days apart, with an average number of treatments in the four to six range.

“Although the therapy itself can be uncomfortable,” Jeanie says, “the relief of painful symptoms can be quite immediate after a treatment.”

At Stokholm Insurance, staff members are highly experienced at finding savings that can have a significant impact on the cost of your insurance coverage.

“There are a lot of ways to lower your insurance costs,” says Solvi Stokholm, owner of Stokholm Insurance, a Co-operators Advisor since 2009. “As advisors, our role, first and foremost, is to provide you with exactly the coverage you need. But it’s also to find you the best prices. And that means taking advantage of the best discounts.”

Stokholm says people should start by reviewing their insurance policies annually and meet with an insurance agent to do a proper assessment. Part of the assessment includes a review of all the ways the customer can take advantage of any available discounts.

Here are a few of the ways Stokholm says people can reduce the cost of their coverage:

- Home security: Install an alarm system in your home.

- Deductible: Increasing your deductible will lower your monthly payments and qualify you for a ‘disappearing deductible’ feature, where the deductible is reduced by $100 each year that you don’t have a claim.

- Mortgage:Keep your insurance company up to date with the state of your mortgage. They should be offering a discount in your premiums if you pay it off.

- Age: There is a mature age discount for those over 55.

- Stay and Save:If you join Co-operators for two years and you are in your own home for two years, you can get a 5% discount.

- Repairs: If you own an older home where you’ve upgraded the electrical or heating within the last 20 years, you may be eligible for a discount.

- EnvirowiseDiscount: Homes that are LEED-certified qualify for a 10% reduction.

- Clean record: Being claims-free keeps your premiums low.

- Co-operative housing:Because Stokholm Insurance is part of a The Co-operators, it offers discounts on home insurance for those living in co-operative housing.

Stokholm knows that many people want to know “How much do I need? What’s normal?” but each case is different.

“A proper evaluation with an experienced agent is the first step,” she says. “Then you can properly review your options and pick the coverage that best suits your needs.”

After 20 years practicing, Dr. Katz knows that frequent check-ups and careful at-home care solve most dental issues before they even start. He empathizes with patients, hoping to ease their anxiety. Otherwise, patients might wait until there’s a problem before receiving adequate treatment and advice. Dr. Katz and his team of hygienists are “very approachable,” taking time to thoroughly analyse each patient’s situation, create a relevant course of treatment, and help the patient to continue treating themselves once home.

Alas, Dr. Katz understands that even the kindest words cannot calm a very nervous patient. “We can certainly offer sedation to help patients relax,” he says. The team’s non-invasive sedation technique uses a gas mask and lasts only as long as they’re in the chair. “Our patients can drive themselves home after the procedure,” he says.

Unfortunately, Dr. Katz and his team cannot save every tooth. They also offer a number of progressive options to replace lost teeth.

Tracey got her license in 2004 and now her son, Sean, has joined her business part-time. “Growing up, I remember being proud of driving round town and seeing my parents’ signs,” says Tracey. “Now I’m happy to be carrying on in their footsteps. Their business meant the world to them and their clients all knew that.”

So what kind of skills did her parents pass on to her? “Apart from being organized and knowledgeable, I think being a good Realtor® is about personal commitment,” she says. “When you hire me, you feel important and valued. Buying or selling a house is stressful because it’s not something you do every day. It is something I work at every day. The process can feel overwhelming – there’s so much to sign and understand.

To make this possible, Tracey takes on only a few clients at a time and works with them all personally. Son Sean mostly focuses on marketing. “He’s knowledgeable about social media but we still do mail-outs, newsprint and word of mouth, because we know there are a lot of people who are not online. That allows us to connect to clients in lots of different ways.”

While regular dentures rest on the gums, Ko explains, implant-supported dentures, meant primarily for those who have no teeth, connect to titanium rods that have been anchored to the patient’s jaw bone. This provides skilled denturists like Ko and Marcelo with the ability to fit the dentures tightly and securely to the patient’s jaw.

article continues below

“Implant-supported dentures have a more stable fitting surface and also reduce the amount of shrinkage that occurs when you don’t have teeth,” says Ko. “This results in dentures that look and function much better than the dentures of the past.”

The denture itself is made of an acrylic base that is designed to look like your gums, and acrylic teeth that look like your natural teeth. The then denture snaps into place on the implants and remains in place more firmly than regular dentures.

“Patients find that it is easier to speak with implant-supported dentures,” says Ko, “and they don’t ever have to worry about their dentures falling out. Patients are often thrilled to discover that they can now eat foods they hadn’t been able to eat in years—though it is still not recommended to eat sticky or hard foods.”

Besides improved appearance and the ability to eat more of the foods you love, implant-supported dentures can help prevent further bone loss and can maintain the integrity of a patient’s facial structure to minimize the effects of aging.

Prime Denture Clinic offers a variety of services depending on the needs of the patient, and they work together with local dentists and oral surgeons to ensure the best possible care.

“If the patient doesn’t already have a dentist, we can recommend one in the area, which also ensures there are no problems with communication between the dentist and denturist,” says Ko.

Forest Lawn Funeral Home and Ocean View Funeral Home are each a part of the Dignity Memorial® network.

Dignity Memorial® is North America’s largest provider of funerals, cremations, and cemetery services. As a result, staff at each funeral home has the advantage of studying different techniques and services offered in other Dignity Memorial® locations across the continent.

Some of their unique products include a bereavement travel program, full access to a grief management library, and a 24-hour compassion line.

“Many people don’t think they’re going to use the compassion line at first,” Knapman says. “But at 3 a.m., two months after your mom has passed away—most people aren’t comfortable calling someone and waking them up. That’s when the compassion line becomes very useful. You can connect with someone, rather than lie there with insomnia.”

The compassion line connects grieving family members to psychologists who hold either a master’s degree or PhD in social work. They’re available to speak at any hour and in any language.

The bereavement travel program, meanwhile, helps people book flights and hotels, and is available up to a year after a funeral for any funeral-related travel. Forest Lawn and Ocean View also offer a child/grandchild protection plan, where if your child or grandchild passes away unmarried and under 21 years of age, funeral services are provided at no cost.

“We really strive to focus on our customer,” says Knapman. “They become part of our family. And we make sure the services we provide are as special as they are.”

286,newwestrecord,https://www.newwestrecord.ca/standout/6-misconceptions-about-healthy-eating-1.23418854,6 misconceptions about healthy eating,[],,"Cast aside all your ideas about living on salads or being denied the things you love. Jocelyn Wong, Creative Director of Auxi Foods Kitchen + Coffee Bar, has the real scoop.

1. It’s outrageously expensive

article continues below

There’s a stereotype that healthy eating is always pricier, whether you eat in or out, and that fast food and junk food are cheap. In fact, healthy food can be affordable. “Our bowls are priced from $9 to $12 and they’re huge – almost no one finishes them,” says Wong. “You get a delicious meal that really fills you up, made from high-quality ingredients. You can’t put a price on that!”

2. It’s low on flavour

Who could resist bowls like Beef & Mushroom, a combination of rice or smoked sweet potato, tender hand-pulled beef, roast mushrooms, pickled cabbage, marinated tomato, roasted onions, spinach purée and chimichurri? “We make everything by hand – right down to pickling the cabbage ourselves,” says Wong. “That, plus high-quality ingredients, means you definitely won’t feel like you’re losing out on flavour.”

3. It’s all low fat or carb-free

“There isn’t just one way to eat healthily,” says Wong. “We have options to suit everyone’s needs and wants, including keto, paleo, vegan, gluten-friendly or dairy-friendly, and because everything’s prepared fresh, it’s completely customizable.”

4. You can’t eat out

If you’re a Myfitnesspal fan, or you count macros, you might be wary of restaurants, but at Auxi you can get a full breakdown of calories, fat, protein and carbs so you know exactly what you’re ordering.

5. You can’t eat in

If you want to eat healthily but you’re not a trained chef, eating at home can be dull. That’s why Auxi has just introduced a new subscription meal service. Depending on your goals, this might include a real-life meeting with a nutritionist with whom you can discuss your plan. You’ll get all you need delivered to your door, twice a week, without you having to chop or prep a thing. Follow Auxi Foods on social media (@AuxiFoods) or visit Auxifoods.com for info.

6. You can’t get it locally

You don’t need to head to downtown Vancouver to get a taste of the good life. Auxi is in Queensborough, New West. You can get food delivery via their website, Skip the Dishes and the new subscription meal service will be available throughout the Lower Mainland area.

287,newwestrecord,https://www.newwestrecord.ca/standout/need-quick-cash-consider-a-pawn-loan-1.23148686,Need Quick Cash? Consider a Pawn Loan,[],,"In tough times, many use credit cards or payday loan schemes to bridge the gap between pay cheques. But one of the oldest forms of banking, the pawn loan, should make more sense for some.

In 1955, Howard Isman opened Royal City Jewellers and Loans on Columbia Street in New Westminster. Fast-forward to today and the business is now Canada’s largest single-store pawnbroker. It’s still owned by the same family and Michael Isman is the company President. The store is run by a management team including the General Manager, Ken Basso, who joined the company 30 years ago. “We’ve always been a part of downtown New Westminster. We’ve seen a lot of businesses come and go but we’ve been consistent,” explains Basso over the phone from the shop.

When it comes to logistics it’s quite straightforward to get quick cash in exchange for a valued collateral item. Simply bring in an item, such as a piece of jewellery, an unlocked cell phone, electronic or sports gear and tell one of their loan officers how much cash you are interested in borrowing. Once the loan officer determines that the item is of appropriate value, it will be stored for up to three months in which time the loan can be paid back, or renewed by paying the interest. If the owner doesn’t return to reclaim the item, it is sold via Royal City Jewellers and Loans’ store.

With many pawnbrokers and payday loan offices operating throughout the lower mainland, clients may have a hard time choosing the one to work with. But Basso says the decision is easy when you compare the interest rates. “At five per cent all included, we have the lowest interest rate in Canada [some shops charge up to 20 per cent interest]. There are no additional or hidden fees and we’ll allow you to pay down the loan without penalty,” he explains. Also, there are no credit checks or requirements that clients be employed. Clients simply need to provide government-certified ID with the collateral.

Though pawnbrokers have received a bad rap over the years, Basso says the business he manages serves a need for the community: “We give every effort to meet our customers goal. I bumped into a customer from years ago who told me she used our services in the ‘90s and said the loans helped her raise her children.” “It was our pleasure to help.”

“The reception around the community has been great,” Dr. Blyth said. “On the cosmetic side, there was a stronghold of physicians and clinics in West Van and Vancouver but there was comparatively little in the way of available services here in New Westminster. Polo Health and Longevity Centre has filled that void. And our facility includes naturopathic physicians, a compounding pharmacy and anti-aging and men’s health treatments, as well.”

Opening its doors in 2015 in the heart of New Westminster, Polo Health and Longevity Centre is thriving, thanks to its customer-centric approach and highly skilled, multi-disciplinary staff.

Dr. Blyth, who specializes in facial rejuvenation and anti-aging, including Botox, dermal fillers, IPL Laser, microdermabrasion, chemical peels and an MD level cosmetic skin care line of products.

“One of our strong points is that we have several different techniques that we use, which means we can tailor the treatment to the end goal of the patient,” he says. “It’s not like we only have one thing in the tool bag. It all depends on skin type, person and comfort level.”

Those looking to escape the West Coast weather can find adventure inside the indoor trampoline park, which is a short drive from Burnaby and an even shorter SkyTrain ride. Sky Zone has plenty of entertaining activities to make the trip well worth it.

“This is a different experience,” says Morey Chaplick, owner of Sky Zone Trampoline Park in Surrey. “We do unbelievably good birthday parties.”

In addition to birthday parties, the jump park has frequent activities and events that cannot be found anywhere else – at least, not under one roof.

Sky Zone specializes in five forms of completely unique entertainment, according to Chaplick:

1. SkyRobics. Working out doesn’t have to be boring, not when clients can leap into better health with trampoline fitness. This low-impact workout is gentle on the joints but hard on calories – it burns up to 1,000 calories per hour.

2. Foam Zone. For freewheeling, foamy fun, look to the Foam Zone. The pit filled with 10,000 foam cubes is great for practicing tricks, and it provides a feeling of weightlessness that most people never get to experience elsewhere.

3. Ultimate Dodgeball. Dodging and diving on trampolines is such a good time, players might almost forget they’re competing for Ultimate Dodgeball victory. And for those competitive types who are all about the win, they can form a team and give their all in the Ultimate Dodgeball Tournament.

4. Sky Slam.Most people will never jump like Michael Jordan – at least, not without help. Sky Zone’s trampoline launch pads are just the thing, giving anyone the chance to brag about their slam dunks and pro skills.

5. Open Jump. But why choose? Open Jump allows jumpers to practice flips in the free jump area, the Main Court, leap into the Foam Zone, take part in a daily pickup Ultimate Dodgeball game, or sink a shot at Sky Jam. And for the truly inexhaustible jumper, they can do it all in one day.

For more information about what’s happening at Sky Zone Trampoline Park in Surrey, call 778-395-5867 or their website. Sky Zone in Surrey is at 11125-124th Street, just over the Pattullo Bridge. The indoor trampoline park can also be found on Facebook.",[]

SecuraView from Wizard Industries is a product specifically for those who are concerned about intruders entering their home through a screen doors or window. Built with high tensile marine grade stainless steel mesh along with a heavy duty aluminum frame, SecuraView screens keep a lot more than insects out of your home.

“This kind of mesh screen can’t be cut by a criminal or bashed through the way a door might be,” says Bedford. “That means you can enjoy a cool breeze during nights in the summer without having to worry about your personal safety.”

SecuraView is just the latest innovation from Wizard Industries, a family-run company based in Vancouver that’s been producing premium screens and awnings for customers all over North America for the past fifteen years.

“We strive to continuously lead our industry by offering the highest quality home improvement products available,” says Bedford. “SecuraView is just one more example of how we build products to meet our customers’ needs.”

One of the unique features of the SecuraView product is a 10-year limited warranty.

“It’s important for customers to feel satisfied with their purchase,” Bedford explains. “We want them to know that we build our products to last.”

Screen door products like SecuraView can also prevent dangerous mishaps, particularly with children. Serious injury can easily incur when children fall through screens. With SecuraView, that risk is eliminated.

There are now live streaming options for funerals, funeral apps and these days there’s even a trend towards crowd-funded funerals.

So it’s no surprise that online memorials, which provide a shared space for your loved ones to commemorate you after your passing, are also popular. Forest Lawn Funeral Home provides a 90-day complimentary obituary and photo on its website to all clients who book funeral services through the organization. Forestlawn-Burnaby.com also hosts Dignity Memorial’s online archival platform, Making Everlasting Memories. Here, family and friends can write condolences and share stories about their loved one, and upload photos which can then be displayed in a movie or slideshow format. If the family wishes to purchase the Making Everlasting Memories plan they can do so for $395, says Andrew Knapman, manager at Forest Lawn. “Like a gravestone, the webpage will run in perpetuity and will exist for as long as there is an Internet to run on,” he explains.

Upon the first meeting with the family of the deceased, “the funeral director takes information from them and they will help with the initial setup [of the webpage.] Then the family is given the password and they can manage it from then on,” explains Knapman.

The Personal Planning Guide is also a wonderful tool to assist in writing a living obituary, which is written by someone, often with the assistance of a professional writer, before their passing. “Who knows more about your life than you do, except for your parents?” asks Knapman.

From the photos and information posted on Making Everlasting Memories, Forest Lawn Funeral Home can also assist with producing printed materials celebrating a loved one’s life.

Saea Vivian remembers it well. “I did everything I was supposed to do to eradicate the lice in my daughter’s hair, but nothing worked,” she says. “Then we visited a head lice clinic in the US where my brother lived. My daughter was lice free in an hour. It was amazing.”

The clinic used a patented medical device called AirAllé, which uses microprocessed heated air to dehydrate the lice and their eggs, killing them completely, and is FDA and Health Canada cleared. Astonished that this treatment wasn’t available in Canada, Vivian decided to bring the technology here by opening two Lice Clinics of Canada offices in Greater Vancouver. “People travel from all over the province, or further, for an appointment. I even get enquiries in the middle of the night,” says Vivian. “It is stressful for families who have lice, and they don’t want to wait to get rid of them.”

Conventional treatments involve pesticides and insecticides, but science has proven that lice have become resistant. They are also irritating to sensitive scalps, and require multiple treatments as only the live lice are killed, leaving eggs behind alive. Other options, such as combing, are labour intensive, time consuming, and stressful.

Lice Clinics of Canada offers two treatments using AirAllé. The Signature Service ($200 per service) involves a three-step system: an AirAllé session taking roughly 30 minutes, a thorough comb-out of the debris, and finally an active rinse application. A complimentary follow-up session, usually one week later, is also included. Providing every member of the family is seen, this comes with a 14-day guarantee. The Express Service ($165) comprises the same 3-step process; the AirAllé session, has a shorter comb out, and active rinse application, but no guarantee. Vivian likens the device experience to a heated head massage. The clinics use salon-standard hygiene and sterilisation ensuring there’s no cross-contamination.

Other services include Head Checks ($25 first person, $15 for additional) where a trained technician thoroughly examines the head for signs of lice or eggs, and a range of take-home products, all of which are pesticide- and insecticide-free. “We’re here to help in any way we can, including providing information and preventative strategies. We take helping families seriously,” Vivian says.

Real Estate Wire (REW), one of Canada’s leading digital real estate platforms, is expanding their well-established listings portal to include rentals. The website, which has been trusted by real estate buyers and sellers for the better part of a decade, will offer a number of tools and resources to help renters find their next home.

“Renting is an important part of the real estate market for many families, especially in cities like Vancouver and Toronto, where affordability is a major issue,” said Simon Bray, REW President. “Over the years, we have seen an increasing need for a rental platform that is safe, secure, and provides renters with the same great service as buyers. That’s why we’ve expanded our real estate marketplace to include rentals.”

The Lower Mainland is one of the world’s most expensive real estate markets for buyers, driving many families to look for affordable rentals as an alternative. The COVID-19 pandemic has further impacted the buying power of many families.

A recent REW survey found that 45% of respondents had either lost their job or some income due to the pandemic. About 38% of survey respondents said that COVID-19 had negatively affected their financial ability to buy a home.

“The shift to include rental properties on our platform has been in the works for some time, but the pandemic has really accelerated the demand for this service,” added Bray.

“Our goal is to help Canadians find their next home. Whether it’s buying a new development, browsing a listing down the street, or finding a great rental apartment, REW delivers a comprehensive real estate experience for everyone.”

In addition to listings, renters will have access to videos, virtual tours, market insights, and detailed descriptions of the rental properties, including their location, nearby schools, and amenities.

With the uncertainty surrounding the future of COVID-19 and its impact on the real estate market, these resources will become increasingly important to families that want to shop for a home online. About 80% of survey respondents believe websites like REW are now a critical resource, with 90% reporting having used a website like rew.ca in the last 30 days.

REW is working exclusively with property management companies to ensure rental properties are vetted and meet REW’s quality management standards.

“Our position in the real estate market has enabled us to establish strong relationships with the top property management companies in Canada. When using our platform, renters can rest assured they are receiving quality listings that have been reviewed by industry professionals.”

There are currently over 10,000 rental listings available on REW in British Columbia, Alberta, and Ontario. Expansion plans to bring rental listings across Canada are in the works.

That’s what has helped make the Paddlewheeler Pub a community favourite for more than three decades.

Such longevity is rare in this industry. Marco Lucarino, assistant general manager at the pub, puts their success down to this special combination of factors that have given them a unique place in the Royal City.

“The Paddlewheeler really is a landmark, being in business for 33 years,” he said.

It first opened as part of the original Westminster Quay Public Market back in 1986 and still enjoys being part of the ever-changing Quay community while growing and evolving.

“We continue to create friendships and build community presence. We have a from-scratch traditional pub menu with a unique take on classic dishes and our newly renovated space really has a warm vibe and a welcoming feel.”

He says the dedicated staff and the customers – both loyal long-time visitors and new ones – make the pub a special place.

“One of the things I really love about the Paddlewheeler is the staff. We are all very close and it resembles a family business to me. It’s a place that I can experiment, learn, and continue to grow,” he said. “We have a ton of long term staff. Our longest would be Gail Saunders at 30-plus years. She is the heart of the Paddlewheeler. Most of our servers have been here for four-plus years and we are all very tight as a team.”

But even the best staff can’t make a business a success without the people who come through the door.

“And our customers are the best. You can often find our regular patrons sitting at the bar or at a table enjoying each other’s company. I think we’ve had a great reception in the community.” The pub isn’t just a great place for a casual get-together over drinks or for a great meal; it’s also an ideal spot for local events.

“We’ve hosted naloxone trainings, Santa breakfasts, and charitable events,” he said, noting they also are a favourite for holiday celebrations for other local businesses and groups. The city has been an ideal home for the Paddlewheeler all these years and Lucarino says they’re excited to see what the future will bring.

“I love New Westminster for its charming vibes,” he said. “To me it resembles a big city without the bad parts. It’s continuously growing and reaching new peaks. The community here is incredible.”

As for the Paddlewheeler itself, some unique changes are on the way.

“We have a few special projects in the works. We will be working on a social lounge, better games room, and some patio improvements,” he said. “And we will be launching a brand new happy hour, new menu items and I’m excited for unique custom cocktails that you won’t find anywhere else.”

At the end of the day, it’s about doing a great job for each customer and taking pride in that effort.

“Excellence to me is a happy customer and, just as importantly, a happy employee.”

“My focus is to help people see the value of insurance and understand what product will best serve their needs,” says Solvi Stokholm, a Co-operators Insurance Agent since 2009 and a twenty-year veteran of the insurance industry. “When there is a claim situation, people should know right away if they are insured. You never want to find yourself saying, ‘Oh I thought that was covered!’”

The Co-operators has been helping Canadians with their insurance needs for more than 70 years. The company started in the Prairies helping small farms and today provides protection to over a million Canadians.

According to Solvi, it’s Co-operators commitment to first-class customer service that has made them so successful—a commitment she shares.

“I’m a real people person,” she says. “I take my time with my customers to make sure they walk out of here feeling good about whatever coverage they’ve chosen. I’m not the pushy type. I just say, ‘Here are your options. What’s your budget?’ and we go from there.”

While many people question the cost of insurance, Stokholm says the real value is peace of mind.

“Knowing that you’re taking care of the people you love is a good feeling,” says Solvi. “With the right insurance, you can protect what you’ve worked so hard for and safeguard your family’s future against any unforeseen events.”

Even if you already have insurance, Solvi suggests you review it at least once every two yearsto ensure your coverage still meets your needs.

Kinman says that one of the reasons they’ve established a great reputation over the years is their focus on communication.

“Client service is very important,” he said. “Many people are unfamiliar with the legal system and only need legal services every few years, so we work hard to be sure they understand what’s going on, and to have strong communication and personal service.”

In fact, the firm is able to work with individuals in a variety of languages, including Korean, Punjabi, Mandarin, Farsi and more, thanks to a diverse staff.

Kinman notes that recent changes in legislation around ICBC cases has left a lot of people uncertain about their legal needs.

“With those changes, a lot of firms are simply turning people away. But we’re saying we will still talk to you, hear your situation, and help you understand your rights and what is and is not possible,” he said. “We may not be able to help in the end, but we think people deserve the opportunity to discuss it and know what the options are.”

“I love this community and we’re proud to be able to serve the people here,” he said.

Many of their clients come to them from recommendations from family and friends, which the team says is a rewarding experience.

“When a client comes back or when they recommend someone else to us, we know we’ve done a great job,” he said.

Vivian Young has seen the difference that level of commitment makes in the lives of children, from both sides: first as a parent whose children attended the program, and now as the owner of two CEFA locations in New Westminster.

CEFA is an all-day early learning private school for children ages 1 to 5, with a curriculum that offers reading, writing, mathematics, and STEM (science, technology, engineering and math), as well as visual arts, dance, music, drama, yoga, cultural immersion, and more, with a focus on helping prepare for kindergarten readiness.

Young was the parent of three young children – two of whom were already in a CEFA school – when she made the decision to leave her position with an environmental consulting firm to have more time to focus on her young family. She began volunteering at the school, leading her to a deep appreciation of everything that CEFA stood for.

“I fell in love with the program and what it was offering,” she said. “All three of my children are quite unique with their own strengths and perseverance, including one with a learning disability. I felt strongly that CEFA supported us and promoted comfort and confidence. All three graduated from the CEFA program and my husband and I couldn’t be happier, more grateful or more proud of their efforts and successes in school and in sports.”

With her oldest about to graduate from Grade 12 and the youngest set to begin high school, she’s seen the long term impact that their early education experiences had on them. Now, she’s thrilled to offer that same experience for students at her two local programs.

She says the Royal City has been an incredible place for CEFA, with enthusiasm and support not just from local families but from the city itself.

“It’s amazing being a part of a vibrant and friendly community and working with the City of New Westminster,” she said. Their first location opened on Carnarvon Street in 2008 and they celebrated their second location in the Uptown area in Royal City Shopping Centre in May of 2019. She gives credit to her team of teachers and the families for the success they’ve had here.

“My staff are amazing, caring and dedicated. One of our teachers, who was with our school from 2009 until she retired in 2018, was a recipient of the 2015 Prime Minister’s Award for Excellence in Early Childhood Education which we are extremely proud of,” she said. “Our schools are like a second home and we truly work as extended family to each other and to our families. We operate with mutual respect and consideration.”

Young says she is excited about the future as more and more parents hear about the program. “CEFA’s core purpose is to inspire children to learn and be knowledgeable, seek self betterment and contribute as individuals,” she said. “Whether you are a child, parent, teacher or adult in your community, our core purpose helps guide any efforts.”

The foundations that made the first CEFA such a success continue today, she says, as that original commitment to excellence continues.

“Excellence is putting forth your best with the sincerest intentions,” she said.

The duo owns Triniti Laser Clinic and Medi Spa in New Westminster, which has re-located into a revitalized heritage house on Sixth Street.

Being able to offer top-notch services in a beautiful environment is something the pair is ecstatic about – but it’s the impact that their work has on each client that makes them so proud of the work they do.

“People sometimes think of what we do as being about the outside, but what we see is clients who feel great on the inside because of what we can do for them,” said Tahora Eslahian, who owns Triniti along with Tina Ruggiero.

“That’s the best part of this work – you may have a client who comes in with acne, for example, who is feeling upset and insecure about that but we can find solutions for them.”

The clinic offers an array of services, including laser treatments to help with skin conditions and anti-aging, body contouring, laser hair removal, medical facials, permanent makeup, reflexology and more. Some services are aimed at treating current issues, others at prevention, and still others – such as hair removal – can simply make life simpler and easier for a client. Other services are focused on providing relaxation, balance, and general wellness.

No matter what services a client comes to Triniti looking for, or if they are a long-time customer or a first time visitor, the focus on excellence is the same.

“The level of service we have here is the best, hands down,” said Eslahian. “It’s all medically influenced, it’s the best technology, the most effective tools and techniques.”

That approach has helped the company grow by leaps and bounds over the years as loyal customers continue to return, but also recommend Triniti to their friends and family.

“Word of mouth has been the primary way we have grown and we love knowing that someone has recommended us,” she said.

The move into the new space has been an exciting evolution for the business.

“We renovated a beautiful heritage home on Sixth Street – it’s three levels, a beautiful large space. From the outside it looks a house but inside we have quite a number of treatment rooms and it’s a beautiful place to be able to work with our customers.”

Both Eslahian and Ruggiero have substantial experience in the field; Ruggiero is a certified laser technician with more than a decade of experience, and Eslahian has served as a trainer in laser treatments across North America.

“We have great expertise but we are always learning, too,” said Eslahian. “We want to know we always have the best techniques and tools, and that we are educated about the best ways to help our clients. We treat our clients like family – if there’s a service that I wouldn’t do to myself, or to my family or to my best friend, then I won’t perform it on a client.”

O’Reilly knows a thing or two about caring for dogs. In addition to operating the leading dog daycare and boarding facility in Vancouver for more than a decade, O’Reilly and her staff provide a long list of dog care services that includes grooming, training, hikes, runs, structured play, teeth cleaning… even birthday parties!

article continues below

“Dogs are a lot more like us than most people think,” says O’Reilly. “They’re highly social and they respond well to affection. At the same time, they’re creatures of habit. So the sooner you can introduce them to the kind of experiences they’re going to have later in life, the better.”

Here are 7 easy tips O’Reilly suggests will make caring for your dog easier in the long run:

1. Play with your new puppy’s feet to prepare them for future nail trimmings. The more your pup gets used to having its feet handled, the easier that first trimming will be.

2. Don’t wait to start socializing your puppy. Right after the second set of shots, bring your pup to dog parks, arrange dog dates with your friends and their pets, and/or take them to dog daycare.

3. Book your dog’s first grooming by the time they are four months old. This will prevent matting in the fur. For long-haired breeds, consider grooming every six weeks.

4. Brush your dog’s teeth and provide them with bones so they have something resistant to chew. It’s really important to keep your dog’s teeth healthy and strengthen their gums. If brushing your dog’s teeth isn’t your thing, let the pros at Uptown Dawg do it for you.

5. Use a no-pull harness and/or a martingale collar on walks when training your dog. O’Reilly cautions that martingale collars should never be left on during playtime or whenever your dog is out of sight.

6. Bring bite-sized treats with you on outings to reward your dog for good behavior.

7. Crate train your puppy early on, as it will help teach them to accept a kennel as a safe and familiar area in the future.

""With so few vacancies in the Lower Mainland, it’s even harder because landlords have so many applicants they usually don’t choose to rent to people who have struggled with homelessness.""

Through a program called A Key of Her Own, EFry helps women who have been homeless for more than six months or who are repeat shelter users, to access housing. Part of a federal government initiative called Housing First, the program also supports women in becoming successful long term tenants and connecting to local community supports.

The program is making a significant difference in the lives of women struggling with homelessness.

“I would have been lost without this support,” one woman writes on her program evaluation form. “I now feel stable both in my housing and emotionally. It has improved my life dramatically. I now have hope that I can obtain my goals.”

A significant portion of A Key of Her Own clients are seniors or mothers with young children. The first step in supporting vulnerable women is getting to know them.

""During our intake process, we ask questions to prompt each woman to tell her story,"" says Susan. ""When women have been traumatized, they have a hard time with trust so they might not openly say, “I have health issues” but based on their answers, we can usually figure out what struggles they’re facing.”

""A Key of Her Own is more than just finding a woman a place to live,” says Susan. “We provide ongoing support for up to two years that greatly improves a women’s ability to deal with common barriers such as hoarding, mental health issues, physical issues or addiction.

""For example, we have clients who, without help, wouldn't remember to pay their rent on time and find themselves being evicted as a result. We meet with women on an ongoing basis, once a week, twice a week, whenever they need support in their community or in their home. By doing this we can help deal with the issues as they come up rather than after they have become a crisis.”

Most women connect with A Key of Her Own through referrals from community agencies, EFry drop-in centres or EFry’s shelters.

“It is very rewarding speaking to women who now have a home of their own and a life they are proud of,” says Susan.

303,newwestrecord,https://www.newwestrecord.ca/standout/5-of-the-biggest-myths-about-dentures-1.2330221,5 of the biggest myths about dentures,[],,"Denture technology and techniques have come a long way in recent years; however, several of the myths about dentures continue to circulate. We reached out to Brian Ko and Patrick Marcelo of Prime Denture Clinic in New Westminster to set the record straight.

“For those who have few or no teeth remaining, dentures are an excellent option,” says Marcelo. “As denturists, we make sure patients understand the facts and explain the best options so that they can make an informed decision.”

article continues below

According to Marcelo, here are 5 of the biggest myths about dentures:

1.Dentures are difficult to clean: In fact, dentures are easier to clean than crowns, bridges or even natural teeth, because you can take them out and have easier access to them. “We also offer professional cleanings,” says Marcelo. “And we provide a lot of information to patients on how to clean their dentures more efficiently. It’s not hard to do.”

2. Dentures can get loose or fall out: Implant-supported dentures have eliminated this concern, says Marcelo, because they snap on to anchors embedded in the jaw and remain stable and tight. “We guarantee they will fit,” he says. “And if they should loosen over time, there are things we can do to make them tight again.”

3. Dentures are only for the elderly: “We’ve created dentures for people as young as 19,” Marcelo says. “They may have different options available to them but if the patient wants dentures, we can do that.”

4. Dentures will last for life: Prime Denture Clinic recommends replacing your dentures every five-to-seven years. Just like natural teeth, dentures will wear down and stain over time. “The tissue in your mouth and jawbone changes constantly,” says Marcelo. “As a result, your dentures will require adjusting and rebasing periodically so that they continue to fit comfortably and securely.”

5. Once you receive dentures, you do not have to go to the denturist anymore: “You will need to see your denturist at least once a year so your dentures can be adjusted, which will help you avoid any potential problems down the road,” says Marcelo. “You should also see your denturist at the first sign of any irritation or frequent sore spots on your gums.”

Well, what is more transparent and authentic than making your own product?

Located at the historic waterfront saloon district in New Westminster, The Wine Factory, which opened in June of 1994, was the city’s first and is now its only remaining consumer-made wine shop.



The Wine Factory moved to downtown New Westminster six years ago, after seventeen years in its original uptown location, and has been avidly exposing locals to the joy of make-it-yourself wine production while also linking the community in a creative and productive environment.



“You have to be here, you have to come into the store because you are the maker of the wine,” said owner Harm Woldring. “If you like wine, which according to many is healthy for you in moderation, making it yourself has lots of advantages.”



This inclusivity is one of the main reasons Woldring believes his store has been so successful, because it allows people from all kinds of different backgrounds to produce something they can be proud to consume and share with friends and family without the expense and bother of purchasing the equipment, creating a space and undertaking the process on their own. Of course, if you want to do it at home they’d be happy to help equip you and supply you with juice products of your choice.



Making your own wine with The Wine Factory can cost you as little as half the price of bottled or bag-in-a-box wine you buy in a store. The Wine Factory’s products are also uniquely vegan and contain far fewer sulphites and sorbates that commercial products. Typically, their customers reuse their bottles for years rather than disposing of them after one use, a far more environmentally friendly choice.



The Wine Factory has over 250 different varieties of shelf-stable juices from around the world for you to choose from to make your own high-quality wines, coolers and ciders. Although often seen as a luxury product, wine is a staple part of millions of people’s daily lifestyles. “Customers returning from trips to Europe often comment that wine is cheaper there than water, coffee or other common beverages,” said Woldring.

The Elizabeth Fry Society of Greater Vancouver’s (EFry) mission is to help reduce the odds.

“More than 90 per cent of women’s crimes are driven by poverty,” says Shawn Bayes, executive director of EFry. “EFry was founded in New Westminster in 1939 to support women in prison and we still do that. Now, we also work to address the factors that put women at risk of breaking the law.”

Lack of employment is a key reason women reoffend. Four years ago, EFry began a social enterprise, Asphalt Gals, which provides site clean-up services to the busy roofing industry. EFry recruits women before release, so they know they will have an income to rely on.

“We provide whatever a woman needs to work with us: boots, equipment, training, sometimes even food in the beginning. We set women up for success and they do themselves proud,” says Bayes. Asphalt Gals consistently receives rave reviews and repeat business from its customers.

As the majority of female inmates are single mothers, supporting children with a parent in prison was a natural fit for EFry. In 2001, it launched JustKids, Canada’s first such initiative.

“Without specialized supports, more than half of kids with incarcerated parents end up in prison themselves,” says Bayes. “We can help change that.” Programs include spring break and summer camps, Saturday clubs, a literacy program and holiday support. Every JustKids activity is made possible solely thanks to donations.

In all, EFry offers nearly two dozen programs and services throughout the Lower Mainland to help women and youth, at risk, involved in or affected by the justice system, including drop-in centres, shelters, supportive recovery programs, transitional housing, parenting and child development programs.

It’s the hallmark of Kearney Funeral Services, one the family-owned and run business has been proud to provide families across Metro Vancouver with compassionate care for more than a century.

article continues below

“We are one of the oldest businesses in Vancouver. We’ve been around for 112 years, and owned all that time by the same family,” says company CEO Ryan Crean who represents the fourth generation to work in the business started by his great grandparents.

“My great grandfather went to Dawson City during the gold rush, where he owned a general store. And when he came back to Vancouver with the money he made, he met my great grandmother who helped the local churches lay out those who had passed away,” Crean says. “They fell in love, purchased a funeral home, and the rest is history.”

Since that time, Kearney Funeral Services has always stood by the philosophy that theirs is the business of building relationships—with individual families and the community as a whole.

“Essentially, we try to always be there when people need us, regardless if it’s before they require our services, or at the actual time,” Crean explains.

That’s a rare quality in today’s funeral industry, which is populated mostly by large corporate operations.

“We strive to be involved with the communities where we do business, because that’s where we live, and those are the people we serve,” Crean says. “That’s why we place such importance on building those important relationships. It permeates everything we do.”

Whether it’s supporting the local Catholic Church community, and its charitable organizations and parishes, or service groups such as Rotary, Kearney Funeral Services takes pride in being a member the surrounding community can rely upon.

“Being a family business, we are looking after generations of families, as well,” Crean says. “And that has allowed us to have built up trust over time, which makes everything so much easier for our clients because they have a sense of familiarity and belief in what we do.”

That’s especially important in today’s longer-lived society where many families don’t experience the loss of a loved one until later in life. So, when they do, having a trusted and familiar contact to depend on, like Kearney Funeral Services, is a significant comfort.

“That’s why cultivating relationships is such an integral part of what we do,” Crean says.

Most people think of downsizing as something that empty nesters do when they no longer need the space to accommodate their family. But in fact, says New Westminster Realtor® Tracey Davies, it’s something of a trend for young families too. “People start to think, ‘Why do I need the big yard when I could have a townhouse with all the amenities I need nearby, reduce the commitments and responsibilities of a house and yard, and use the money I make for trips and experiences?’” she says.

article continues below

2. It can take a long time

“People shouldn’t be surprised if it takes years,” says Tracey. “It’s a really big decision and sometimes an emotional one – this could be a family home that someone’s lived in for years. It’s not just a transaction.” Tracey believes says that clients can be reassured that a conversation with a Realtor® doesn’t mean a commitment. “It’s something that needs to be thought about and discussed with other parties like the family, the lawyer and the bank. At a first meeting, I might just be giving clients information about what’s involved, and that’s OK.”

3. You need to do the math

A lot of number crunching needs to take place before you can get started on downsizing. “You need to know exactly how much money you’re going to get in your pocket before you go shopping,” says Tracey. “People often expect to come out with a lot, but sometimes that’s not the case if, for example, you want to downsize to a penthouse. You really need to talk to whoever handles your finances before making any decisions.”

4. Think 20 years ahead

You might put downsizing on the back burner because you’re fit as a fiddle now, but that might not be the case a decade down the line. “Ultimately it’s better to move when you still have control,” says Tracey. “If you’re downsizing for an unhappy reason, your kids and caregivers will do their best to find the best new home for you, but ideally you want to be the one making the decisions about where you live.”

5. Your Realtor® can help with more than the house

The logistics of going from a large family home to a condo can be overwhelming, but that’s where an experienced Realtor® can help. “I’ve been doing this a long time so I can provide all kinds of advice on movers and storage, for example,” says Tracey. “I know where you can donate goods, and who are the best cleaners. It saves you doing the research and eliminates one more cause of stress when you’re moving house.

For Penny Hyndman, tapping into that connection to help people find healing, health, and renewed energy has become her life’s purpose.

article continues below

Hyndman uses a variety of techniques to help her clients improve their well being at her New Westminster-based clinic, UR Wellness. This includes neurofeedback – or brain training – along with a variety of other tools to help people with a wide spectrum of needs including pain and stress management, performance enhancement, emotional support and general wellness. “Simply put, I provide stress management services to help you maintain balance in your life,” she said. “Wellness is a dynamic process of change and growth and I find brain training is the quickest route to get to the physical and emotional imbalances.”

Hyndman was drawn to health care early in life thanks to a passion for caring for others, and spent many years working as a nurse. “My hospital nursing career brought me deep meaning and joy,” she said. “I loved acting as a teacher, an advocate and a caregiver for my patients.”

But when a back injury forced her to leave her much loved vocation, she discovered bio- and neurofeedback.

“It transformed my life. It brought resilience to my nervous system and body. I felt calmer, more at peace, my muscle tension released, and most importantly, my sleep improved,” she said. Her chronic pain and physical discomfort lessened. Over time, she also found that it helped her let go of negative emotional patterns, such as perfectionism and poor self image, and improved her energy and self confidence.

The impact was so profound, she was quickly drawn to learn more. “I started working in one of Vancouver’s biofeedback clinics, and sought out mentors in the field of biofeedback and neurofeedback, both nationally and internationally. I was like a sponge.”

She also provides services in craniosacral therapy, reflexology, and other specialities, drawing on a blend of holistic western approaches and eastern healing methods to help create highly personalized approaches for each client based on their unique lives and needs. “My philosophy of health care is based on the principle that health is innate, or in other words, that it comes from within,” she said. “Our bodies are self-regulating, nonlinear systems capable of self healing. When interference such as stress, trauma, infection and toxicity is removed, your body can express its own healing potential and balance so equilibrium is obtained. My role is to create a healing environment and provide your body with accurate information so it can shift and heal itself.”

The clinic name is itself a reflection of this belief, she explains, noting that the U stands for “you” and the R for “are.” “You are wellness. It’s a philosophy that we are actively in the process of becoming aware of and making choices toward a healthy fulfilling life.”

Her reputation has grown through word-of-mouth recommendations, a reflection of the positive and powerful experiences clients have had. “I like to think I am changing the world one brain at a time,” she said.

Though Hyndman works with individual clients through her Eighth Street office, she also works with a variety of organizations, such as addiction centres and nursing homes. As well, she offers complimentary brain training sessions for veterans and first responders, a unique area of care that grew out of her clinical work helping veterans with PTSD through the Together We Can program in Vancouver.

“It’s my way of giving back to those providers who care for others.”

It is part of what SEA TO SKY LAW refers to as life-planning. Everyone should have a Power of Attorney and a Representation Agreement, for example, documents most people don’t know much about.

“The old saying is that a Will speaks from death,” Andrew says. “It does not give authority before death.”

Experienced lawyers like those at SEA TO SKY LAW address clients’ health decisions by asking a lot of “what-if” questions. Representation Agreements can be more daunting psychologically, but they are very important to have in place.

“Most people do not attend to this aspect of life-planning, perhaps because they are uncomfortable thinking about it. But it is part of personal planning that really should be done.

“Gum grafts are needed for a number of reasons,” explains Dr. Darcy Murphy of Queen’s Park Dental. “Typically a patient has recession of the gums due to grinding, clenching, or brushing too hard over a number of years. Gum recession can also be the result of periodontal disease.”

article continues below

To avoid needing a gum graft, Dr. Murphy recommends keeping up with preventative dental care.

“Recession of the gums is something we measure during a routine check up,” he says. “If there’s a drop of one or two millimetres around the teeth, it’s something we monitor closely for any further changes. However, if it changes to three or four millimeters, then we would suggest a gum graft to the patient.”

Previously, the traditional method of performing a gum graft consisted of cutting tissue from the roof of a patient’s mouth and surgically placing it in the affected gum area.

“This can be extremely painful,” Dr. Murphy says, “and it can result in long-lasting soreness and a lengthy recovery period.”

To help Queen’s Park Dental patients avoid much of the pain and inconvenience of a traditional gum graft, Dr. Murphy offers the Pinhole Surgical Technique (PST®), a safe alternative that doesn’t require cutting or stitching and results in minimal post-operative symptoms, such as pain, swelling, or bleeding.

“We use specially designed instruments inserted through a small pinhole in the gum, to gently loosen the gum tissue and slide it over the gum recession. Most patients are pleasantly surprised by the instant cosmetic improvement.”

The Pinhole Surgical Technique was pioneered and patented by John Chao D.D.S, to provide a scalpel-free and suture-free procedure for correcting gum recession.

But according to Dr. Steven Blyth of Polo Health and Longevity Centre, there are more options than ever for people to consider when it comes to the health and appearance of their skin.

article continues below

“When there are obvious signs of aging such as wrinkling, sagging of the facial skin or discoloration of the pigmentation on the face, a corrective approach would typically be needed,” Dr. Blyth says. “Fortunately, today there are many safe options to choose from.”

Here are four procedures Dr. Blyth suggests considering:

1. Botox – “This is what is known asa neuromodulator,” Dr. Blyth says. “When we repeatedly use our facial muscles over the years it can lead to wrinkling, frown lines between your forehead, and laugh lines (crow’s feet). Botox temporarily paralyzes and relaxes those muscles and it serves a smoothing sort of effect. It’s an option either if you want to prevent wrinkling or if you’re looking to smooth out established wrinkles that have built up over time.

2. Dermal filler– This rejuvenating injection serves as a great way to regain and replenish moisture and hydration within the body, says Dr. Blyth, and it delivers a fuller appearance.

“Typically these are used for the lips when we want to regain a fuller and more rounded look,” Dr. Blyth says. “When we have deep established wrinkling or lines or want to regain a certain figure, a filler would be a good choice.”

3. Microdermabrasion– An alternative to a facelift is the much less intrusive microdermabrasion. In this procedure a small instrument with diamond-shaped beads attached to it ‘sand away’ the top layer of your skin.

“Over the years we accumulate a lot of dead skin or scarring that can make it look dull, wrinkling and discoloured,” Dr. Blyth says. “This is an overall facial treatment to give you a younger, brighter, healthy look to your skin.”

4. Micro-needling: If a collagen deficiency is the issue, a micro-needling treatment may be the answer.

“There are multiple small needles that we use to puncture the skin to stimulate collagen growth with micro-needling,” Dr. Blyth says. “Collagen is huge for skin health but as we get older it dwindles and thins out. That leads to wrinkling, to our face drooping and to an overall decrease in collagen volume. Micro-needling acts as a corrective measure.”

Yet it’s exactly what 23 year-old Kim did to get help with an addiction she worried would threaten the health of her unborn baby.

“Someone I dated led to me getting into a lot of trouble,” Kim says. “I’ve struggled with addiction and when I was in jail, I found out I’d taken fentanyl and it freaked me out. I was determined to get clean for my baby. So when I was told I could be released, I asked to stay in so I could get help through their methadone program.”

Kim’s request was granted and once clean, her social worker told her about EFry’s Ellendale Cradle program, which supports expectant and new mothers in maintaining their recovery, learning parenting skills and preparing for stable lives after a stay of up to three months.

“I’m so much better now,” says Kim, now mom to an infant daughter. “I feel safe and the staff is always around to help me. There’s no judgment, just support. It’s great for me and my baby.”

Child development monitoring and support is a unique element of the program.

“There is a significant focus on babies’ health and supporting mothers in learning what to expect with their development and helping them establish a strong parent-child bond,” says Justine Patterson, clinical director with the Elizabeth Fry Society (EFry).

Justine oversees both Ellendale Cradle and EFry’s other residential program for pregnant women and those with infants called Transitions to New Beginnings.

“Substance use and trauma are interconnected, so all our work is trauma-informed,” says Justine. “With the right support, people can build stable lives. Society needs to remove the stigma and encourage women to come forward and get help.""

While Ellendale Cradle provides recovering women with structured support and programming, Transitions to New Beginnings is a step down on the continuum of care, focusing on helping secure housing and regain independent living. Both programs only take clients who are seeking help in providing a stable, healthy home for themselves and their children.

That’s where Fraser Works Co-op comes in, providing resources and services to help job seekers find employers, and vice versa, in New Westminster and beyond.

“We provide free employment services for anyone from 16 to 80,” explains general manager, Tracey Fraser. “We are the only WorkBC Centre in New Westminster providing services for both jobseekers and employers in our community.”

WorkBC is co-funded by both the provincial and federal government. Fraser Works is unique within the WorkBC system because it’s one of the only centres operated as a cooperative, under the combined wings of four local organizations: AWARE Society, Fraserside Community Services Society, MOSAIC, and Pacific Community Resource Society.

“We really want people to know that we are here to help,” said Fraser. “We are here to assist jobseekers with any employment-related needs that they may have. We have employers who are seeking employees, and employees who are seeking employers. We want to ensure that people find and sustain employment that can improve the quality of their lives.”

Fraser says that the organization has a spectrum of tools to assist people, including a resource room with self-serve job support services, computers, printing, and job board services, and even a Working Man’s Closet program where men can access gently used suits and working gear that they might not otherwise be able to afford.

The centre also provides a wealth of case management services from training, to wage subsidy, to self employment referrals. They also offer assistance to employers, ranging from job postings to hiring fair, and have a partnership with the New Westminster Chamber of Commerce, called CONNECTIONS, that helps connect local employers to clients.

Fraser says the staff are all incredibly dedicated to the work they do.

“Our excellence comes through in our support of our clients and employers. We take a lot of pride in being able to assist people who may be at a low point in their life,” she said. “Our staff are knowledgeable, compassionate and focused on delivering the highest level of service. We strive for excellence in what we do and how we provide service. To be able to assist someone alleviate stress and anxiety is a wonderful feeling that we are very fortunate to experience in our day to day work here.”

The services are all provided free of charge, and the staff speak a combined 13 languages and are all certified with various vocational support credentials that give them the know-how and expertise to provide a vast array of services. Their efforts over the last seven years since they first opened have helped them build a strong reputation for supporting both individuals and the wider community.

“We strive to be compassionate in supporting our clients to reach their goals,” said Fraser. “We really focus on individual needs, be they jobseekers or employers.”

After 20 years running his own dental practice, he’s seen many young children lose their baby teeth prematurely due to lackadaisical maintenance.

“Those temporary baby teeth are very important because they hold space for permanent teeth. Baby teeth hold space for the second set of teeth to glide into position so as not to shift forward or crowd the mouth,” says Dr. Katz.

When it’s difficult just to get energetic toddlers to sit for a toothbrushing, it’s even more difficult to detect cavities on baby teeth. That’s why it’s pertinent that parents bring their children for regular check-ups. When mouths are kept clean, bacteria on one tooth may not spread. “If a parent isn’t diligent, the bacteria from a small cavity can spread throughout the mouth.”

What’s more, if a cavity in a baby tooth isn’t treated in time, the bacteria can actually spread to the permanent tooth. “Between around the ages of six and twelve, the permanent teeth share an arch with the baby teeth. If the child and parents allow a cavity to go unnoticed, the decay can spread to the permanent tooth.” By maintaining regular check-ups and teaching good dental habits, parents ensure their children’s oral health well into adulthood.

Partly due to the fact that they are more difficult to clean, children’s mouths and teeth and more sensitive than adults. So, Dr. Katz and his team also advise on preventative tooth care at home. “Provide kids with fruit roll-ups instead of candy and fruit juice instead of soda,” he says. “Sugary foods and drinks are some of the worst culprits for tooth decay.”

More importantly, they also know how to fix it so you can get a restful and deep sleep every night of the week.

As a medical consulting company staffed with highly trained Registered Respiratory Therapists and Registered Nurses, CanSleep Services knows one thing: how to improve the quality of life by educating and treating people with sleep disorders. These disorders can range from sleep apnea, which is their specialized area of interest, to insomnia and general poor sleeping habits.

article continues below

Marina Abramskey, a Training and Development Manager at CanSleep Services, says that good quality sleep is essential for our overall health. “Sleep improves our memories, improves cognitive function, and builds our immune system,” she said.

With locations scattered throughout the Lower Mainland, including clinics in Burnaby, Surrey, Coquitlam, New Westminster, and Delta, CanSleep Services is dedicated to resolving sleep-disordered breathing. By educating the population as a whole and by undertaking a scientific study to improve diagnosis and treatment, CanSleep Services has helped hundreds of people sleep better at night. After all, Abramskey said that 80 percent of people with Obstructed Sleep Apnea (OSA) are undiagnosed. When untreated, sleep disorders, like OSA, can lead to vehicle fatalities, weight gain, heart failure, anxiety, depression and other health issues.

In fact, repeated nights of sleep deprivation can lead to more long-term health concerns. These include poor short-term memory, an increased risk of more accidents at work due to decreased cognition, and a weak immune system, leaving you more susceptible to illness, Abramskey warned. However, she said that treating these sleep disorders and poor sleeping habits is what they do best at CanSleep Services, leaving you to breathe better, sleep easy, and live well.

For Clay Tierney and his team at Budget Blinds New Westminster, the goal is much bigger.

article continues below

“It’s a matter of always trying to exceed the expectations of the customer, treating every customer like you’d want to be treated, giving the best service, no matter what product you’re providing for them,” he said.

Tierney, who owns the local franchise with his wife Lacey, says that philosophy has been a guiding force since they opened their doors.

“Every customer is important, and you treat them that way,” he said. “To me, it’s a matter of being able to offer my expertise – I want a customer to use my knowledge and experience to help them make decisions. When I come into someone’s home and I can use what I know to help them save time, money, and to give them something that fits their unique needs, that’s what it’s all about.”

Even if a customer opts not to purchase from him after the complimentary in-house consultation, it’s rewarding to know he has offered help and guidance.

“I’m happy knowing I’ve given them information, and that they’ve been able to use my expertise,” he said.

The company, which opened in New Westminster five years ago, offers a huge spectrum of window treatments, including shutters, blinds, draperies, and shades, which allows them to provide creative and custom solutions for people.

“One of the best parts is that we have relationships with vendors that you can’t get anywhere else, so we can provide unique products that you won’t see elsewhere,” he said. “I love coming in and being able to show people what we can offer and they’re blown away by the options.”

While the company does a significant amount of private residential work, they also offer services for commercial and retail locations. Increasingly, there’s also a demand for products that use motorization and automation.

“We’re really on the leading edge of that,” he said, noting that these products may include apps, timers, remotes and other technology to fit the customer’s needs.

But no matter what is being installed, from the simplest of blinds to the most modern of high-tech solutions, helping a customer beautify their home and create satisfaction in the final product is the goal.

“People are often surprised at what a change it can make – to have the right product in the right place can really change the look and feel of a home,” he said. “We come in and do a consultation and bring the products right in for people to look at and see.”

Their focus on personal service and custom products has proven a successful approach so far. “Referral is a large portion of our business, and that’s really the key to success,” he said. “Some people may find you online but a referral from a happy customer is the best compliment.”

The goal now, says Tierney is to continue growing their reputation and maintaining and exceeding expectations from both prior and new customers.

“One of the great things about us is our warranty, which really tops everything else out there: it’s a no questions asked five-year warranty,” he said. “And we really mean that. It’s quite unique.”

Ultimately, the secret to success, is offering excellence to each customer.

“You need to have incredible customer service and a quality product,” he said. “Plain and simple.”

Snowden had previously worked for some well-known intelligence agencies, including the FBI, CIA, and NSA, who, according to him, had, along with many governments around the globe, been spying on their populations for years.

article continues below

And because we have embraced the Internet in our lives, their spying tactics have become stronger.

Modern spying tools allow surveillance agencies to keep a check on whatever we do online. They can check what websites we visit, the people we talk to, and even our chat conversations.

And if that doesn’t satisfy them, they can also hack into our home cameras - even the cameras installed on our devices - and can monitor us via live video-feeds.

Creepy, isn’t it?

Imagine how many times you’ve placed your phone camera in front of you while changing clothes.

According to Snowden, all this data has been forwarded to these intelligence agencies.

In worst case scenarios, this information has been used to blackmail victims.

If you want to stop a stranger from viewing your intimate moments, then the following steps would go a long way in keeping you safe and anonymous on the Internet:

1. Get a VPN

For complete online security and anonymity, it’s recommend you install a VPN as soon as you can.

If you look at Snowden’s revelations you will come to realize most of the surveillance threats happen because the intelligence agencies have the power to monitor our online traffic. Therefore, keep your online traffic as private as possible. This can be achieved with a VPN which uses encryption so strong even the most powerful hackers and surveillance agencies cannot break through.

PureVPN provides this service which offers important anonymity features, including secure Wi-Fi, an Internet kill switch, and more.

PureVPN also has apps available for all platforms. You can download them and remain completely anonymous.

The VPN provider has received positive feedback for its unparalleled features, as well as performance. It has garnered highest ratings on TrustPilot, CNET, etc.

2. Configure the privacy settings of your browser

Keeping the security and privacy settings of your browser and your device configured is vital.

If the wrong options are used, your online privacy can be at risk.

Visit the settings section of your device and block third-party cookies and other such options to keep your online activities anonymous.

3. Keep your apps updated

Keeping your apps updated is important. It’s even better to turn on auto-update option if it’s available.

Why?

Most apps have bugs and loopholes hidden inside them. Hackers try to exploit them and gain access to your data. Thankfully, the owners of these apps continually try to locate these loopholes and cover them up with patches. These patches are released alongside app updates, which is why updating your apps is so important.

Right from the start, he faced some complicated health problems, including being born with only three heart chambers instead of four. He survived his medical challenges into adulthood but passed away at the age of 25. His death devastated his mother, Marilyn.

“He was the first thing, the last thing, most of the things I ever thought of,” says the Port Coquitlam woman about her son. “I never thought about doing anything without first thinking of Greg.”

The grief was overwhelming, and Marilyn describes having regular panic attacks after Greg’s death. “We went to a barbecue once, and I actually stood in the middle of this backyard and screamed at the top of my voice,” she recalls.

Marilyn was referred to Royal Columbian Hospital psychiatrist Dr. Anson Koo, who eventually admitted her to hospital. “I was terrified,” says Marilyn. “But my husband took me and knew it was the best thing, because I wasn’t doing very well. I wasn’t coping at all.”

Marilyn spent five weeks at Royal Columbian Hospital, followed by 13-weeks in an outpatient program. “I met the most caring, the most compassionate people you could ever meet in your entire life,” recalls Marilyn. “I was also amazed at who else was in the hospital with me. How many young people, how many ordinary people, people that didn’t seem different. They were just struggling with life.”

Over time, Marilyn learned coping techniques that she says have helped her enormously. She continues to see Dr. Koo during follow-up visits.

“My life has changed completely since Gregory died,” she says. “I am 100% a different person. I just feel so fortunate that I was where I was at the right time in order to be able to get this long-term support.”

Just ask Shannon O’Reilly, owner of Uptown Dawg, Vancouver’s premiere dog care facility, and passionate dog-lover.

“The relationship a pet owner has with a dog is different than the one they would have with a cat,” says O’Reilly. “That’s not surprising given how different cats and dogs are as pets. And people tend to gravitate to the kind of pet that best suits their personality.”

article continues below

Here are 5 ways that dog and cat owners differ:

1) Dog owners are better listeners

Like their pets, dog owners tend to be more attentive and are often better listeners than their cat-owner peers. Experts suggests that dog people also tend to follow the rules more closely.

2) Cat owners are more creative

Some studies have suggested that cat people score higher on intelligence tests than dog people, but no sample-size would be big enough to convince dog owners of that. A less controversial opinion is that cat owners are more creative, which aligns with point #1 about dog owners following the rules more closely.

3) Dog owners love people

There’s little debate about dog owners being more social. Few cat owners have play-dates for their pets, whereas dog owners frequently gather in parks and other open areas to allow their pets to socialize. How many times have you seen a romantic comedy where two cat owners meet because of their pets? Enough said.

4) Cat owners are less social

Modern Dog Magazine suggested that cat owners were one third more likely to live alone and twice as likely to live in an apartment than dog owners. No surprise there. The same report suggested that dog ownership was closely associated with living in a house with family.

5) Dog owners have dominant personalities

According to the same study, self-confidence and forcefulness are more closely related to dog owners than cat owners. Not surprising since dogs expect owners to be the dominant personality in the household. Cats see themselves as the top of the food chain and the resident boss. It stands to reason that an owner who accepts a cats tendencies would be less dominant by nature.

So what do the dogs think of this high-touch, highly-social, fun-based approach to dog care?

“Our customers often tell us how excited their dogs get when they hear the word “daycare,” says O’Reilly, laughing. “The dogs know how much our staff loves them!”

Staff treat the dogs like their own, she adds, even staying overnight with them when required.

“Whatever it takes to keep the dogs comfortable and safe,” she says.

Customers like Lisa Liberatore agree. Like many of Uptown Dawg’s regulars, she refers to the staff as “Aunties” and the facility as her dog’s “second home”.

Oxygen has fast become a favourite home-base for yoga and fitness enthusiasts of all ages in the Royal City, which itself has a special place in the hearts and lives of its owners.

article continues below

“That whole notion of community and what that means has always been important to us, but it really comes together here (in Oxygen) in such a unique way,” said Kelly Ranford.

Ranford and Oxygen partner Faith Wiens opened the doors in January 2014 under the umbrella of the New Westminster-based Stonewater Group. Stonewater is an award-winning restaurant group that is owned by the Ranfords and the Flintoffs, local friends with long established roots in the Royal City.

When Wiens – who has been with Stonewater for over 18 years and serves as controller for the organization – told them about her experience with an Oxygen Yoga in another community, they were quick to agree with her assessment on the potential of a local franchise.

The decision has paid off in spades: their two studios have a bustling schedule that continues to grow and expand.

“It has absolutely become this incredible community. People enjoy being here, it’s such a happy comfortable place to be,” said Ranford. “What we’ve built here is very special.”

Ranford notes the studio is unique in the breadth of its offerings: from traditional yoga practice, to more cardio-based yoga fusion classes with dance, boxing moves and more.

“We really pay attention to what members are showing up for, what’s popular, what are they asking about, what’s going on out there in the wider yoga world, what’s best for our bodies, the latest concepts, and then really morphing our classes to fit those needs. Even the same person might need different things at different times and we can give them those options.”

On top of that, the studio offers yoga teaching training and a variety of workshops.

“We have this really interesting range. We might have a weekend workshop on yoga as a coping strategy, and then we have the Naked Truth yoga teacher training. We have yoga instructors coming from all over to our studio to do training and I think that really is a testament to what Faith created in our particular franchise that we have the best of the best coming here.”

Ranford is herself an instructor, on top of her primary role as an educator and counsellor with the New Westminster school district.

“It’s a wonderful combination with my career, this ability to use yoga for anxiety and stress in counselling. We’ve been able to bring students into the studio – and every single one who has come has just loved it,” she said.

Being able to not just build community but give back to the wider community as well has always been a primary focus for Stonewater.

“We grew up here doing sports and feeling supported in the community and now my own kids are doing the same and we want everyone’s kids to feel that way so a lot of our community giving is focused on youth and sport,” she said. “This city is very important to us.”

With so many products being mass-produced, misrepresented and mixed with harmful agents, now is the best time to take up craft wine-making!



Like growing your own herbs or using a community garden, producing your own wine is a great way to learn about what goes into your product, where your product is handled and what costs are associated with producing a product.



At the Wine Factory, they know people lead busy lives, but they think that everyone can benefit from making and producing their own wine. Here are a few reasons why you should try craft wine making:



Quality – At the Wine Factory, they offer shelf stable juices from regions worldwide for you to choose from. They have over 250 types of juices; red, white and rose to suit your taste preferences.

Vegan – Virtually all commercial wines contain some sort of animal by-product. At The Wine Factory, they have never used those products. They discard the supplied gelatin based clearing agents that contain animal proteins derived from the swim bladders of fish or the parts of various types of shellfish. Their wines are, and have always been, vegan.



Affordability – One batch costs roughly $135 to $270 for 30 bottles, depending on the quality of the juice you choose, with the real savings coming from the non-taxable status of consumer-made fermented alcoholic beverages like wine. Unlike the liquor store, most of your money here goes into the cost of the juice not the approximately 80% government markups of the liquor store.

Eco-Friendly – Most commercial wines are shipped in single use glass bottles, arguably one of the least environmentally friendly types of packaging. The Wine Factory’s customers re-use their bottles, often for years or even decades. All the store asks is that you clean your bottles before bringing them in to fill. In the past decade or so, as the population has become increasingly urbanized, bag-in-a-box (BIB) packaging has become very popular in the wine industry. The Wine Factory has been offering a BIB solution to their customers for over seven years.



The Wine Factory welcomes groups of all sizes and encourages parties to book their special event together. Additionally, ask about the wedding package for a memorable, affordable and unique party experience.

For Ian Kinman, the owner and senior lawyer at Kinman & Associates, the only way to provide top-notch legal services is to listen to each client, to help them through the process with consistent communication, and to have a team of staff whose expertise keeps things running smoothly at every step.

“It’s really about client service,” he said. “Many people only need legal services every few years, or once or twice in their life, so it’s important to remember that the process may be unfamiliar to them. We really do try to make our clients feel happy and comfortable.”

The full service law firm focuses on a variety of areas, such as personal injury, civil and commercial litigation, corporate and commercial transactions, family law and more.

“We offer legal services in the most common areas a person might have need for help, with the kinds of problems that the day-to-day person might encounter,” he said. As well, the organization provides legal services for a number of small to large companies.

The firm was created in 2007, but grew out of Baumgartel & Gould, a law firm that had been serving New Westminster since 1960, and where Ian had been practicing as a lawyer for many years.

In all, he’s had three decades in the Royal City.

“It’s wonderful to have been in the community for so long,” he said. “You really get to know people, and to develop those relationships with clients.”

Ian notes that one of the unique aspects of his firm is the diversity of its staff: he himself was born overseas, and has travelled to more than 130 countries, and he has staff members who speak Korean, Punjabi, Mandarin, French and more.

“That can provide familiarity and comfort for clients, many of whom are first or second generation Canadians,” he said. “It really goes a long way in making them feel good about the process.”

Ian says he’s focused on ensuring consistent communication.

“I often take over files from other firms, and I’m quite struck by how little the former lawyer may have done to keep the client appraised of what’s going on,” he said. “That’s important to me, that someone feels knowledgeable and understands what’s happening next. We do our best to keep the clients involved in what’s going on with their files along the way.”

Ian credits his team for helping to create the strong reputation at the firm.

“I have a wonderful team – many of them having been working closely with me for many years,” he said. “One of my paralegals has been here for 16 years. They’re all very dedicated and knowledgeable in what they do.”

Most of the new clients who come to them do so through word of mouth, says Ian.

“That’s always so rewarding, to know that someone has recommended you to others,”

he said. “And then when we see a client come back themselves, for a new item they need help with, that tells us we’ve done our job right. When a client is satisfied, and their issue has been resolved, and we’ve been able to provide expertise and guidance in a way that has left the client happy, that’s when we know we’ve provided excellence service.”

“Patients were having to wait two to three weeks for an appointment,” he says. “It wasn’t acceptable.”

After an exhaustive search, Dr. Murphy and his team at Queen’s Park Dental welcomed Dr. Karen Liang to the practice.

“Karen was one of several candidates to apply,” Dr. Murphy recounts. “She was highly qualified and had the necessary experience, but it was her fantastic personality that was the biggest thing for us.”

Dr. Liang’s qualifications include a Bachelor’s Degree in Science from UBC and a Doctor of Dental Medicine (DMD) from Boston’s School of Dental Medicine, where she graduated Summa Cum Laude, an honour only achieved by the top seven percent of students participating in the program.

Dr. Liang has since been awarded the Delta Dental Award for Excellence in Public Health.

A believer in life-long learning and professional development, Dr. Liang shares Dr. Murphy’s interest in implant dentistry.

“In addition to everything else she brings to the practice, Dr. Liang speaks Cantonese,” says Dr. Murphy. “She is also conversant in Mandarin, which is a great help with our Cantonese and Mandarin speaking patients. Another great addition is Dr. Liang’s dental assistant, Marina, who is fluent in Russian.”

Like her colleagues at Queen’s Park Dental, Dr. Liang enjoys guiding patients through the planning and treatment process.

“Patients love her,” Dr. Murphy says. “They have no hesitation coming back to see her again and again.”

And that includes Dr. Murphy himself.

“She is my dentist too,” he laughs. “If I need dental work or professional preventative care, she’s the one I go to.”

Dr. Liang is a member of a number of professional associations and clubs and actively continues to expand her knowledge of dentistry and dental implants. She is a member of the Canadian Dental Association, the Chinese Canadian Dental Society of BC, the Vancouver Invisalign®Study Club and the Comprehensive Interdisciplinary Treatment and Education in Dentistry Study Club.

Dr. Liang is currently welcoming new patients and can be contacted through the Queen’s Park Dental practice.

Timed to coincide with B.C. Rivers Day and World Rivers Day on September 22 – 24th, 2016, RiverFest features both educational exhibits about the river and fun activities over three days.

Stephen Bruyneel, Interim-Executive Director of the FRDC, highlights five reasons why you and your family will not want to miss this informative and fun weekend:

1. Live music entertainment:

""In 2016,"" Stephen says, ""we'll be hosting five independent artists who will perform busker-style, just carrying their instruments and a microphone."" This arrangement means that RiverFest attendees will be able to enjoy a more intimate and up-close experience with the entertainers.

""We've had musicians perform on one stage before,"" notes Stephen, ""but sometimes large crowds meant that some people missed out on the entertainment. This year, musicians will perform throughout the day and entertain on the boardwalk.""

2. The arts and artisan market:

On Saturday, September 24, RiverFest is partnering with the New Westminster Arts Council to feature over 30 unique vendors along the boardwalk selling arts and crafts.

3. Bosa Family Fun Zone:

RiverFest is as much about fun as it is about education and information. There will be activities for children of all ages, including arts and crafts and some special events. ""We're partnering with organizations such as Stream of Dreams, to bring some exciting activities to RiverFest,"" says Stephen. “There will be a fish painting station, gold panning with Yukon Dan, facepainting, and even drumming sessions in our Canyon Theatre”

4. Lucille Johnstone Work Boat Parade:

Named after FRDC founding patron Lucille Johnstone, this a day for the working river to come out to play. At 1:00 on September 24, participating marine vessels will show their capabilities, agility, and speed as they manoeuver the waters of the Fraser River.

5. Exhibitors for Thought:

The FRDC is partnering with local conservation and educational organizations, such as the Vancouver Aquarium and the Yale Historic Site, to celebrate the Fraser River. ""We want to generate discussion and get people really thinking about the long-term importance of the River. There will be booths set up and presentations,"" says Stephen.

For the team at Head To Toes Spa on Sixth Street, excellence is woven through everything they do – and the proof is in their incredible reputation and business longevity.

Head to Toes has been owned for 22 years by Rosa Chiesa and has continued to grow over the years, offering a full range of salon and medispa treatments. Providing top-notch products and services in a beautiful space with unparalleled customer service has always been a guiding force for the business.

“We want every client to know that when they walk through our doors they can put all their troubles away and come in for a service that goes beyond their expectations,” said Chiesa. “We want them to leave already thinking about when they will be back.”

This year, Chiesa partnered with her sister-in-law, Giulia Chiesa – also a long-time esthetician - as a new co-owner in the business, who has an identical philosophy in her approach.

“I have such a strong passion for this industry,” she said. “Becoming partners with Rosa has already been the most amazing experience and I can’t wait to continue to make the business grow together.”

Giulia is herself a provincial instructor in teaching esthetics, which gives the spa a unique advantage in bringing her leadership and skills on board.

The pair are proud of all that the spa offers: highly trained estheticians, a full range of cosmetic laser procedures, a doctor on staff for botox and fillers, an acupuncturist, and a full range of services including facials, waxing, manicure, massage, as well as high-end makeup and medical grade skin care products. And that’s all in a tranquil, 5,000-square-foot spa environment with cutting edge technology and ongoing education and training.

They also add new services over time as new innovation in the industry happens: this year, for example, they’ve added a new laser machine and microblading. But most important to the success of the business, perhaps, is the high degree of customer service that they’ve come to be known for.

“Our assistant spa manager, Sabina Erickson, has been with us for four years and is amazing with her customer service,” said Chiesa. “She treats everyone with the utmost respect and care. Her connection with our clients is extraordinary.” In fact, loyal clients come from not just the local area in New Westminster but throughout the region.

The spa also continues to share its beautiful uptown location with Atefa Hair Design, a unique partnership that has lasted for more than 12 years. The owner of Atefa Hair Design, Atefa Nuri, has been a master stylist for more than 35 years and trained in England at the Morris School of Hair Design and the Vidal Sassoon Academy.

“Our unique partnership with Head to Toes Spa enables us to provide our clients with a truly holistic beauty experience,” said Nuri.

“We really do operate like a team, and she is incredible at what she does,” added Chiesa. “We have everything in one place here with so many services offered.”

The spa can provide unique experiences such as corporate parties, bridal groups, and birthday parties, and all with the same level of care and service as individual clients.

“Excellence for us means being the very best – we want to be the best in everything we do for our clients. We want them to enjoy every minute of their experience.”

You’ve gone through physiotherapy, massage therapy, maybe even acupuncture, and still the nagging pain continues to hamper your ability to work or just even live your life comfortably.

article continues below

Those are exactly the types of cases that made Royal City Health & Manual Therapy decide to bring in a unique treatment method to provide relief to their clients.

It’s called Shockwave, a system that uses high frequency sounds waves to stimulate healing.

Originally used to treat medical patients suffering from kidney stones, Shockwave was developed to treat chronic conditions such as shoulder injuries, chronic achilles tendonitis, calcific tendonitis, plantar fasciitis, elbow tendinopathies and chronic stages of painful muscle syndrome.

“We wanted to help address the cases that were just not getting better,” says Jeanie Bezdan, a registered massage therapist and managing partner at Royal City Health & Manual Therapy.

“You don’t want to continue offering sessions that are not resolving the issue.

“Shockwave is really helping clients who have a chronic injury.”

When is a good time to try it?

It is important patients try more traditional treatments for a period of at least six months before considering Shockwave therapy, Bezdan says.

What can you expect from Shockwave?

Bezdan says it can be an intense experience at the start, but as patients work their way through the sessions, the healing process kicks in.

“Shockwave is much more focused and intense than ultrasound. You feel a strong pulse in the area with Shockwave. It’s like being tapped by a finger, just deeper, stronger and faster.

""The purpose of inducing the sound wave is to cause an inflammatory response in the area it is directed,” Bezdan explains. “With chronic injuries like a tendon problem where there is poor blood supply and scar tissue, Shockwave forces oxygenated blood to the area and re-starts the healing process.”

Shockwave sessions run about four minutes and can be held in conjunction with physiotherapy treatment.

The number of treatments usually runs from three to a maximum of five to derive a benefit. And the success rate runs between 75 and 95 per cent.

At Sky Zone Trampoline Park in Surrey, people of all ages are welcome to join in the fun. In fact, owner Morey Chaplick says he saw a jumper who was over 60 having a great time there recently.

article continues below

“It’s a good workout,” Chaplick says, adding jumpers of all ages should stay within their limitations and ask for guidance from court monitors if they’re considering trying new tricks.

Jumpers should also be prepared to sweat, he says, and should wear clothing that wicks.

Sky Zone makes sure that all jumpers are given clear safety guidelines, and big kids aren’t allowed to jump near the little kids.

There is a separate trampoline court for toddlers throughout the day, and the jump park also holds Toddler Time sessions a few days a week. Toddler Time is half-price for the half-pint set, and the little ones get the place to themselves. There’s no charge for caregivers.

Court monitors are on site at all times, as is a manager, so parents can retreat to the parents’ lounge knowing their children are being watched and kept safe.

But toddlers aren’t the only ones who get to bounce around on their own. Starting in May, Sky Zone will host SkyJam for teenagers who are 16 or older.

The event will be held on Saturdays at 10 p.m., and includes 90 minutes of jump time, loud music, two pizza slices and a soda. The teens can shoot hoops in Sky Slam, play Ultimate Dodgeball or dive into the Foam Zone with their friends.

Sky Zone also hosts other special events, such as Sensory Night on Mondays, which launches on April 4. The evening, which runs from 6 to 8 p.m., is designed specially for jumpers who are autistic or have other special needs. The music is low, and staff have received training from the Canucks Autism Networkto create a safe and welcoming atmosphere for the jumpers. Caregivers only pay half price.

The indoor trampoline park is a short drive across the Pattullo Bridge, and an even shorter SkyTrain ride. The park is right across from Scott Road SkyTrain station, making it a 15-minute ride from Metrotown.

For more information about events at Sky Zone Trampoline Park in Surrey, call 778-395-5867 or visit their website. Sky Zone in Surrey is at 11125-124th Street, just over the Pattullo Bridge. The indoor trampoline park can also be found on Facebook by searching for Sky Zone Surrey.",[]

It’s safe and walkable – a great place to raise children,” she explains.

Schlechtleitner says she’s especially appreciative of New West’s unique advantages because she didn’t grow up here. “My childhood environment was not like this at all. I lived near Edmonds Station. We were surrounded by social housing, drugs and alcohol, and I know I’m lucky I got out.”

While luck perhaps played a part, Schlechtleitner’s determination and hard work is also a big factor in her success: After a friend told her she’d make a good realtor, she studied the subject at BCIT, graduated in 2002 and moved to New West, where she started her real-estate career. “After a two-year intensive programme, I hit the ground running. I have loved real estate since day one – I walked in, and it was my calling.”

Now she owns a boutique brokerage, which has a staff of seven (five realtors and two admin), all with different skill sets so they can provide a complete service for any client. “I have three divisions: Rethink Land, which focuses on assembling homes or winding up condos to build higher density; Rethink Home, where we sell homes, condos, investments and dreams; and Rethink Stage, our in-house staging company that is included with our listings if needed,” she says.

Her clients love her – 95 per cent of her residential custom is through referrals. Why? Her combination of people skills and business smarts. “I love putting pieces of the puzzle together – I move people all over the city, often without a sign up. I know where people want to go and connect the dots. New West is a small town and anything can happen here when you have a network of fabulous people.”

As a business owner and proud member of the community, she’s always looking for ways to give back, whether that’s financially (at least 10 per cent of her income each year goes to non-profits), or with her time. “I am the girl you call when you need something. My interests for giving are youth at risk, homelessness, social issues, access for kids to sports and addiction. It’s all grass roots and true to my heart,” she says.

Unlike many pets, dogs are known to lock onto humans with unwavering focus, sometimes for unnaturally long periods of time.

“It can be unnerving,” jokes Shannon O’Reilly, owner of Uptown Dawg, Vancouver’s premiere dog daycare and boarding facility. “But once you understand the reasons for it, it’s actually quite an endearing trait. Dogs crave human interaction. Staring is a bi-product of that.”

article continues below

Here are 8 reasons your dog may be staring at you:

1. Your dog is seeking attention. Dogs thrive on affection. If they’re staring at you, there’s a good chance they just want you to focus on them for a few minutes.

2. Your dog is confused. Dogs are very attentive and don’t like to miss a cue or instruction from their owners. If you’re talking to yourself while you’re doing the dishes, your dog might be wondering what’s going on.

3. Your dog is hungry. Dogs use a variety of ways to communicate hunger to their owners. Staring is one of them, particularly if they’ve been punished for vocalizing their hunger previously.

4. Your dog wants to go for a walk. Dogs love to be outside and they crave activity. Staring at you may be there way of convincing you to get active. Don’t have the time to take your dog on a hike? Sign them up for a super-fun Adventure Walk.

5. Your dog wants a belly rub. Belly rubs are an essential part of the communication between owner and dog. It builds trust and dogs love it!

6. Road trip!Short or long, many dogs love car rides and will tell their owners that they want to take one by staring at them until they do something about it.

7. Your dog wants to play fetch. A stare can indicate a specific desire and playing fetch is at the top of the list.

8. Your dog wants to retire for the evening. Dogs who are used to sleeping near their owners will often stare at the owners either in anticipation of going to bed or to encourage their owners to do so.

Right from birth, he faced some complicated health problems. His death at the age of 25 devastated his mother, Marilyn.

The grief was overwhelming, and Marilyn describes having regular panic attacks. “We went to a barbecue once, and I actually stood in the middle of this backyard and screamed at the top of my voice,” she recalls.

Marilyn was treated in Royal Columbian Hospital for over a month, followed by support in an outpatient program. “I met the most caring, compassionate people,” recalls Marilyn. “I was also amazed at who else was in the hospital—how many young people, how many ordinary people, people that didn’t seem different. They were just struggling with life.”

Psychiatric care is the centrepiece of phase one of Royal Columbian redevelopment. Construction begins this year on a new Mental Health and Substance Use Wellness Centre. It will provide a significant opportunity for groundbreaking research, increased psychiatric training and state-of-the-art patient care.

At four floors, the centre will offer two and a half times as many beds, including a 20-bed Older Adult Psychiatric Unit—a first for Fraser Health—to serve the unique needs of seniors.

Joyce Kubu-Haynes, now in her 70s, has experienced the benefits of Royal Columbian Hospital’s mental health program firsthand.

Her illness started with anxiety attacks when she was 30. “They were bad,” the Coquitlam resident remembers. “I went to see my doctor, and he said I should be in the hospital.”

She would eventually be diagnosed with schizophrenia, which she now manages with medication.

“I can cope,” she says. “I am out almost every day.”

Outpatient psychiatric care will also benefit from the redevelopment, and the new centre will serve as the hub for mental health education, training and research within Fraser Health.

If you’re paleo, how about the Superfood Bowl, a mix of spiced sweet potato, Brussels sprouts, roasted vegetables, hemp hearts and spinach puree? Keto fans might like the Power Up salad, which includes hard-boiled egg, pulled chicken, spiced sunflower seeds, feta cheese, smoked paprika and tomato dressing. There are also plenty of options that are plant-based and dairy-friendly.

2. Allergy and intolerance friendly

“The entire menu is gluten friendly, except for the wraps, and we’re hoping to switch over to a gluten-free variety in the future,” says creative director, Jocelyn Wong. “We’re also extremely conscious about allergies. Much of our menu is dairy-free. If you have a peanut allergy, just tell us when you order and we’ll sanitize the workspace to prevent cross-contamination. Because we make everything fresh on the premises, from the marinated meats to the pickled cabbage, we know exactly what ingredients are used in our menu items so you can order with confidence.”

3. Completely customizable

You can add, subtract or substitute anything to the items on the menu, which include wraps, salads, bowls, snacks and drinks. That means if you’re paleo, but like the look of a rice bowl, you can ask them to remove the grains and increase how much of everything else you get.

4. Veggie and vegan

Many of the salads and bowls come without animal ingredients and you can also add tempeh if you want to up the protein quota.

5. Fresh ingredients

Ingredients are always fresh and organic where possible. Chicken is free run and beef is locally sourced.

335,newwestrecord,https://www.newwestrecord.ca/standout/ancient-healing-secrets-of-salt-therapy-1.2248808,Ancient Healing Secrets of Salt Therapy,[],,"A halotherapy spa resort was first mentioned in records dating back to 12th century Poland. Since then, halotherapy has found its way all over the world. As an alternative medicine, many forms of salt therapy exist today, the benefits of which are well documented, including treatment of allergies, asthma or skin conditions like eczema and dermatitis.

Halotherapy remains popular in Europe; however, it’s not easily found in Canada and the US. It was especially difficult to find halotherapy services on the West Coast- that is, until Helen and Keith Tong opened their wellness centre, Pure 5 Wellness Hub, in Burnaby in January, 2016.

article continues below

“There’s no place like this in Burnaby or Vancouver,” says the Tongs. “Back in the day people would sit in a salt cave and feel better just because they were breathing in the micronized salt, which cleans out the airways.”

Today, halotherapy chambers come in several different forms: natural formations of salt caves (known as speloetherapy), rooms made from salt blocks and equipped with air-filtering systems, or rooms with a coating of salt on the walls.

With speleotherapy, one takes advantage of the natural climate in salt caves, some of which are 300-million years old. But speleotherapy may be harder to recreate and enjoy as it depends on natural formations.

Popular halotherapy spas in Belarus and Slovakia provide lounge chairs for clients to use while the aerosol works its way through the air, into the lungs. Conducted movement and breathing sessions help the aerosol make its way to the affected regions of the respiratory system.

Most will breathe easier after a salt halotherapy session, and several studies have shown that it boosts your immune system. It’s not uncommon for asthmatics to use their inhalers less frequently after halptherapy and for sufferers of seasonal allergies to see their symptoms significantly decreased.

Salt therapy is also used for irrigation and cleaning of human cavities. Orally, it may be best remembered for helping heal ones throat from the Strep virus: gargling with salt water. Saline irrigation and lavage is used for some respiratory system, colonic, or gynecological treatments.

For Julie Joyal, that day was the first time she experienced the benefits of Jin Shin Do® Bodymind Acupressure®.

article continues below

“I had been a personal trainer and martial artist for almost 20 years in Vancouver and New Westminster,” she says. “I had a fellow martial artist who studied Jin Shin Do® say, ‘Hey, why don’t you come onto my table after class, and give it a try.”

The experience was unforgettable.

“I floated home, feeling deeply relaxed and connected after that session. Everything looked like it was highlighted with a silver highlighter – so shimmery and sparkling,” she recalls. “I couldn’t explain it. That was my first conscious experience with Ki, or Qi – Life Energy.”

Now, Joyal hopes to allow others to have their own experiences that come from relaxation.

She’s the owner of the New Westminster location of Jin Shin Do® Bodymind Acupressure®, which is a registered organization operating in 20 countries worldwide and founded by Iona Marsaa Teeguarden (see jinshindo.org). According to Teeguarden, there is no stronger conductor of Ki in the world than the human hand, and her no-needle approach to wellness and relaxation uses gentle yet deep finger pressure on specific acu-points and verbal body focusing techniques to help release “armoring” or chronic tension, balance the Ki/energy, and improve vitality.

“It helps relieve stress- and trauma-related problems,” says Joyal. “Words cannot explain the feelings and experiences that come with complete relaxation.”

She notes being unable to relax or release tension can keep an individual from experiencing the “magic that makes life a sovereign celebration and expression of our uniqueness” and points to the Taoist belief that there are as many ways to live life as there are people.

Doing this work with clients and seeing the impact it has on their individual lives is deeply rewarding and exciting, she says.

“I want my clients to be able to say ‘Wow, I never knew I could feel so connected and so relaxed. My mind is my best friend and is so peaceful.’”

The process is a powerful one, she says, for creating mind-body-spirit balance.

“I want everyone to understand the importance of valuing ourselves, our feelings, our tensions, our stories,” she said.

Joyal notes that the relaxation therapy is a useful adjunct to licensed, qualified medical or psychological care, and not intended for the diagnosis, treatment or cure of disease. When used in conjunction with standard medical treatment, the Jin Shin Do® Bodymind Acupressure® technique can assist the healing process, and create the conditions where healing can occur.

Mobile Museum and First Peoples of the Northwest Coast are two programs now available for free download at www.tinyurl.com/NWMuseumOnline.

“The museum remains dedicated to New West residents during the pandemic,” said Rebeca Salas, the city’s heritage program coordinator. “First Peoples of the Northwest Coast and Mobile Museum are free resources for families to discover people, places, and stories from their own community.”

Mobile Museum, which includes visuals and activities that are inspired by local heritage, aims to guide families with children in kindergarten to Grade 5 through some of the museum's teaching collection.

Participants will examine community artifacts and archival photos to better connect with the people and events of the place they live. This includes asking important questions to compare their own experiences and experimenting through crafting, videos and games.

As part of Mobile Museum, families can also learn how to curate their own personal ""heritage collection"" to reflect who they are and where they come from.

First Peoples of the Northwest Coast includes online resources made available by local Indigenous people and supplements them with artifacts and information from the museum's collections. Families can engage with local language and knowledge of the area, try traditional foods, create and visit Coast Salish art and design, and listen to stories that help people think about changes brought on by colonization.

First Peoples of the Northwest Coast is intended to complement the school curriculum from grades four to eight.

""The museum hopes the program will expose people to active leaders in the community, and that family-learning continues by looking to Indigenous educators, artists, organizations and perspectives,"" Salas said.

According to the New Westminster Museum and Archives, both programs can be broken up into short, successive activities, or completed in a full morning or afternoon. Each program is designed for convenient home-learning and fun, with any craft, snack or game supplies being easily found in New West.

The New Westminster Museum and Archives are located in Anvil Centre. Although the museum is closed because of the pandemic, a variety of virtual offerings are being posted at nwmuseumarchives.ca or on Facebook (NWMuseumandArchives), Instagram (@newwestmuseum) and YouTube (newwestminstermuseum.)",[]

“Walk the craft crawl and shop outdoors in a COVID-compliant environment,” said a notice about the event. “Gogos are featuring their usual wide variety of handmade, local, beautiful crafts in nine departments. The garden department is new this year, featuring wind-chimes, birdhouses and feeders, sun-catchers, thrift-store sculptures and succulents. Come early for the best selection.”

Gogos are also selling an array of sweet and savoury preserves with tasty flavour combinations including fig and rum jam, tequila sunrise and pomegranate marmalade, and pineapple habanero chutney.

While you can start the craft crawl at any house on the route, the Royal City Gogos point out that the house at 117 Fifth Ave. is a good place to start out because their “signature tote” is there for purchase – and can hold items purchased along the way. Here’s where you’ll find the sales.

While Neighbourhood Small Grants have been funding programs that bring people together for 20 year, organizers believe that’s more important than ever.Applications are now being accepted for the Responsive Neighbourhood Small Grants, which will provide grants of $50 to $500 for projects that connect people socially or involve sharing skills or talents with each other – while adhering to physical distancing guidelines developed in response to the current health crisis.

“Public health orders to physically distance from others has had the unintended impact of creating more social isolation,” said a notice about the grants. “But so many of you are stepping up to counteract this. Thousands are already self-organizing online to support each other out of their own pockets.”

Applications for the new Responsive Neighbourhood Small Grants were being accepted from across British Columbia until July 1, but the deadline has been extended until July 30

Projects must build community by finding ways to connect with people socially, reduce social isolation, build community strength and resilience, and foster community creativity and wellbeing. Examples could include delivering care packages to elderly or immune-compromised people in the neighbourhood, sewing and distributing masks, hosting a webinar about a topic you’re passionate about or a cooking demonstration, storytelling or mindfulness workshop.

Because of physical distancing guidelines, organizers believe this is an opportunity to get creative in quarantine and explore new ways to build community.

Each year, Family Services of Greater Vancouver administers the Neighbourhood Small Grants program in New Westminster, which is funded by the Vancouver Foundation. In 2019, New Westminster residents received $36,500 that went toward 81 projects, including potlucks, barbecues, plantings of native plants and wild flowers for pollinators and murals.

Community coordinators will be contacting people who applied for 2020 Neighbourhood Small Grants to discuss if those projects can be modified to suit the new grant program’s criteria or should be deferred until physical distancing requirements are lifted.

The Volunteer Cancer Drivers Society, a not-for-profit organization providing free transportation to and from cancer-related medical appointments throughout the Lower Mainland, recently resumed operations after being off the road for three months because of COVID-19. Because most of the volunteer drivers are seniors and many of the patients are elderly, service was temporality suspended to minimize the risk to patients and volunteers.

George Garrett, the society’s vice-president and co-founder, said the society’s executive rounded up donations of masks, cap shields and disinfectant wipes from various suppliers. New policies have been implemented to ensure patients and drivers are safe.

“The driver and the patient must wear a mask,” he said. “The patient must sit in the back seat. There is hand sanitizer provided, disinfectant wipes provided. We ask the patient, when they call in for a ride, have you had any fever, have you had the flu, have you been feeling ill. They have to answer those questions. They are posed by the dispatcher and again by the driver, so it is double. We are being very careful.”

In 2019, the nonprofit provided 1,710 patient trips to New Westminster, which involved 1,522 hours of volunteer time and 23,644 kilometres.

Representatives from the New Westminster Firefighters Charitable Society recently made a $500 donation to the society to help with the cost of driving New West residents to treatment centres in Surrey and Abbotsford.

“They have supported us before,” Garrett said. “We take patients from New Westminster over the river to Surrey and Abbotsford. The freemasons were providing service to New Westminster but they wouldn’t go over the Fraser River. They take patients to Vancouver.”

Garrett said the society greatly appreciates the support from the firefighters, as it helps to provide a valuable service to cancer patients. While the service was on hiatus, he said one New West resident had to pay $50 for each of three return trips to the cancer clinic in Surrey.

“The Cancer Agency provided some taxi vouchers,” he said. “He didn’t know about the vouchers. He’s not complaining, he just said it cost him $50 each way.”

Garrett also knows of a Langley man who needed a ride to Abbotsford every day for cancer treatment.

“He looked at the meter in the taxi – it was $60 to $65 each way from Langley to Abbotsford,” he said. “It was covered, but he said ‘I couldn’t have afforded that.’”

The Volunteer Cancer Drivers Society is always in need of drivers.

“We ask them to commit to at least one day a week or the equivalent, like two half days,” Garrett said. “They all say their fulfillment is in meeting the people and doing something for them. They do form a bond.”

“As we head into the summer months, the centre is a great place for residents as well as tourists from across B.C. who are doing ‘staycations’ this year,” said Stephen Bruyneel, director of external relations and development. “We will be open seven days a week from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., and our goal is to provide our guests with the safest possible way to enjoy learning about the living, working Fraser River.”

Closed since mid-March because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Fraser River Discovery Centre has developed a reopening safety plan based on WorkSafeBC guidelines and has created new safety and health procedures to ensure the safety of visitors and staff.

“We are excited to be able to welcome back visitors of all ages as of July 7,” Bruyneel said in a press release. “Their health and safety are our top priority, and we have put in a lot of work to ensure our guests can once again safely enjoy our exhibits and programs.”

Key elements in Fraser River Discovery Centre’s reopening plan include the providing hand sanitizer stations, cleaning and disinfecting during the day, using personal protective equipment and introducing physical distancing measures. Occupancy limits will ensure there will be a maximum of 50 people in the building at any one time, and there will be restrictions on the number of people in the Canyon Theatre, gift shop, bathrooms and elevator.

Home to a number of educational and public programs, Fraser River Discovery Centre is also reducing the number of in-person programs, such as cancelling birthday parties for now as they present problems for social distancing. It’s also moving some programs, including its Faces of the Fraser and Fraser River Dialogues, to an online format.

Riverfest – an annual celebration of the Fraser River that takes place at the centre and on the waterfront – will feature a combination of online and small-group events. Summer camps are still a go, but they’re being limited to no more than 10 students per camp.

St. Aidan’s Presbyterian Church launched the Don’t Go Hungry food program at its West End church in May, soon followed by a second program at Knox Presbyterian Church in Sapperton. A third food hamper program is set to begin this month in Queensborough.

“We will start with 20 bags there,” said Rev. Laurie Deacon of St. Aidan’s in an email to the Record. “We are now preparing over 70 bags per week so that will take us to 90 bags of dry goods.”

With two additional Save-On-Food stores coming on board with food donations, Deacon is hopeful the program will have enough food for all the folks who show up. Volunteers from the New West Soccer Club will help distribute food at the Queensborough site.

A fourth program is set to start the first weekend in July at Gordon Presbyterian Church in the Edmonds neighbourhood in Burnaby.

“The need is great in that area so will probably serve 100 households,” Deacon said. “The food source is Greater Vancouver Food Bank for dry goods and Costco for reclaimed produce.”

While a variety of food programs exist for folks who are able to pick up hampers on weekdays, Don’t Go Hungry provides food on weekends, helping people who may work during the week and can’t access emergency food supports.

Free food hampers, including dry goods, meat, dairy, bread and produce, for anyone in need are available for curbside pickup (complete with physical distancing, gloves and masks) on Saturdays:

* St. Aidan’s Presbyterian Church, 1320 Seventh Ave., serves the West End community from 1:30 to 2 p.m.

* Knox Presbyterian Church, 403 East Columbia St., serves the east side of the city from 4 to 4:30 p.m.

* Holy Spirit Roman Catholic Church, 130 to 2 p.m., serves the Queensborough community from 1:30 to 2 p.m. (Starting June 27)

For more information on the program, go to or the Don’t Go Hungry page on Facebook and Instagram.

Deacon said the church is grateful to the many groups and individuals, including more than 50 volunteers, who have supported the food program at the New West locations.

“I feel at times I’m at the centre watching amazing volunteers magnify what a caring community looks like, she said in an email to the Record. “It truly does take a village to create a whole society. And I’m glad to be a part of New Westminster! People are generous and compassionate, especially in difficult times.”

Along with food and grants to pay for food (Save-On Foods, Robyn Faust at Epicure, the Greater Vancouver Food Bank and the Vancouver Foundation), the program received a donation of 2,000 masks for volunteers (Canadian Tire). But the assistance doesn’t stop there, with Dan’s Legacy picking up and delivering the food every week, Betina Wheeler at the Homelessness Action Network working “tirelessly” to find and connect community resources, city staff helping to get the programs up and running and applying for the Vancouver Foundation grant, the New West Soccer association setup up a site for the hamper pickup in Queensborough, Deborah Deacon donating time to get the project’s website and social media up and running, Greens and Beans providing tips on supporting the food program and Dave Valley providing encouragement, advertising and signs.",[]

Volunteers must wear appropriate footwear (something with ankle support and closed toes) and bring sunscreen, a hat and a long-sleeve shirt. Because of COVID-19, organizers are unable to offer some items that have been provided to volunteers in the past, so people are advised to bring their own water bottle filled with water, their own snacks, their own pen (to sign a waiver if they haven’t already done so), their own work gloves (if they have them) and their own tools if possible (but organizers will have ways of sanitizing tools on-site.)

“COVID-19 requirements will include new check-in protocols (as we sign people in with appropriate physical distancing), so a bit of a slower start may be expected,” Routledge said. “Dedicated city staff and group leaders will be onsite to ensure physical distancing is adhered to throughout the day.”

Anyone planning to attend can RSVP to kyleroutledge@gmail.com and let him know how many people will be in your party.

On June 17, Royal City Rotary inducted B.C.’s provincial health officer as an honorary Rotarian and presented her with a Paul Harris Fellow award on behalf of the club. Lizz Kelly, president-elect of the Royal City Rotary Club, presented Henry with the honour, while members of Royal City Rotary and the Rotary Club of New Westminster attended the online presentation.

“Your measures have saved countless lives in our province and been recognized internationally as a model for effective pandemic control,” Kelly said. “When you first spoke the words, ‘Now is the time to be kind, be calm and be safe,’ you showed your compassion for what the people of B.C. face with COVID-19. You inspired us with your gentleness. Your calm voice of reason reassures us that we were going to get through this together. And you instilled a confidence in our citizens that we could place our trust in your strategies.”

Kelly said the Royal City Rotary Club selected Henry to receive this recognition because her work exemplifies the humanitarian objectives of The Rotary Foundation. Named after Rotary’s founder, the Paul Harris Fellow acknowledges the contributions of Rotary members and supporters of The Rotary Foundation who have brought positive change to communities in need.

Eradicating polio has been a major mission of Rotary – a mission shared by Henry.

“Dr. Henry, your own personal experience as part of the WHO/UNICEF polio-eradication program in Pakistan demonstrates you share Rotary’s mission to eliminate the polio virus from the world,” Kelly said. “This is something Rotary and its partners have been working on since 1985.”

Henry told local Rotarians she is touched and honoured to receive the Paul Harris Fellow.

“I am well aware that it was Rotary Canada that started the polio-eradication program and was instrumental in raising the money to start it in Latin America and South America, and we were actually able to control polio there, and the impetus for the partnership with the WHO around the eradication program,” she said of the World Health Organization.

Henry said she is “so appreciative” of the work that Rotary has done in support of polio eradication.

“Anything that we can do, particularly to improve the lives of children who suffer from polio and never gain back life in many parts of the world when they have had it,” she said. “We have the means to do it and we need to still remain committed to it.”

Henry, who has attended more than 100 press briefings since the COVID-19 pandemic began in B.C., took time to field a few questions from local Rotarians. These included what she did on her first day off after 56 days (cleaned her house and cooked), the potential for writing a book on her COVID-19 experience (it’s a possibility) and chances for a second wave of COVID-19 in the fall.

Looking around the world, Henry said New Zealand had a “really good handle on it” and had dropped down to zero cases of COVID-19 – only to recently see two new recorded cases. She said B.C. is working on keeping the number of cases “low and slow” and to prevent any rapid spread of COVID-19.

“When the virus is anywhere, we really are at risk everywhere,” she said. “We really have to keep up some of the basic things until we have a vaccine. … We cannot let our guard down.”",[]

Due to COVID‐19, the annual reading club designed to support literacy during the out‐of‐school summer months has been retooled and will consist of combination of online and at home activities.

The theme of this year’s Summer Reading club is Explore Our Universe.

Starting Tuesday, June 16, kids aged three to 12 can register online at www.bcsrc.ca and begin tracking their reading. They will also be able to download a printable version of their reading record, or pick up a complete summer reading club kit, including stickers, at the library’s main branch Tuesday to Saturday from 12 to 4 p.m.

According to a press release from the New Westminster Public Library, reading in any language or format counts, including stories that are read to children by someone else. If a child reads for 15 minutes or more a day, they can mark it down in their print or online reading record, and at the end of seven weeks will be eligible for a Summer Reading Club medal.

“We will be distributing medals at the end of the summer as we always have to recognize and celebrate reading achievements by various children,” Koth said in the press release.

Youth aged 12 and up can also participate in the Teen Summer Reading Club, where they complete reading and creative challenges for a chance to win books, free ice cream and more. More details can be found at www.nwpl.ca/teens.

These webinars can help,['Record Staff'],,"The Alzheimer Society of B.C. is offering a series of webinars to help people affected by dementia cope with the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.

A press release from the society notes that people with dementia have been particularly impacted by the changes in care provision and the disruption in daily routine.

article continues below

Those changes may result in different symptoms and behaviours, including the development of hallucinations and delusions – and that’s the subject of an upcoming free webinar.

The webinar, Delusions, Hallucinations and Visual Mistakes, is designed for anyone supporting a person living with dementia. It’s set for Wednesday, June 24 at 2 p.m.

The Alzheimer Society notes that peopleliving with dementia can experience a wide range of delusions, such as the belief that someone else may be living in their house, and hallucinations, which are incorrect perceptions of objects or events that seem incredibly real to the person experiencing them but cannot be verified by anyone else.

A key first step for caregivers is recognizing and controlling the variables that may put people living with dementia at an increased risk of having delusions or hallucinations.

Some tips for responding to delusions, hallucinations and visual mistakes:

Ensure adequate lighting:Inadequate lighting can create an ambiguity about someone’s surroundings and may contribute to paranoia and fears. For example, what may look like a housecoat in a properly lit setting could appear to be a person in a dimly lit setting.

Keep routines and schedules consistent: Constant change to daily routine can create a sense of confusion, disturbance and imbalance in a person living with dementia.

Determine whether a hallucination is bothersome: Hallucinations that create a positive reaction may not be important to address, as long as they do not promote any dangerous behaviour.

Avoid arguing: People experiencing hallucinations and delusions are experiencing a different reality than the rest of us. Avoid arguing with their expression of those experiences or attempting to debunk them.

Anyone who would like to learn more about the cause and effects of delusions, hallucinations and visual mistakes in people living with dementia – as well as additional strategies to respond to them – is invited to attend the Alzheimer Society of B.C.’s webinar on hallucinations and delusions on Wednesday, June 24.

It’s part of a series of weekly free webinars.

The upcoming schedule includes:

Research Ready: Extending the Cognitive Healthspan (Friday, June 19, 11 a.m.): Local researcher Nathan Lewis shares the latest research on cognitive engagement as an intervention aimed at delaying the onset of cognitive decline

Delusions, Hallucinations and Visual Mistakes (Wednesday, June 24, 2 p.m.): Explore strategies for responding to delusions, hallucinations and visual mistakes caused by dementia.

In 2006, the United Nations General Assembly designated June 15 as World Elder Abuse Awareness Day (WEAAD). The declaration provides an opportunity for communities around the world to promote a better understanding of abuse and neglect of older persons by raising awareness about the issue.

According to Seniors Services Society of B.C., social isolation has been identified as one of the leading contributing factors to an increase in risk of elder abuse.

“In this unprecedented time of social isolation and stress throughout the world due to COVID-19, abuse incidents are higher, domestic violence has increased dramatically and crises line calls are at an all-time high,” said a press release from the society. “Approximately 10% of all senior adults will experience some form of physical, emotional, financial or sexual abuse. It is also believed that abuse of seniors is significantly under-reported. Tragically, many will suffer in silence, in fear or in shame.”

On June 15, the Anvil Centre will glow purple – the colour associated with World Elder Abuse Awareness Day. The Seniors Services Society invites community members to commemorate the day wearing something purple to show they’re united in the support of preventing elder abuse.

“The City of New Westminster, along with cities throughout the world, acknowledges June 15 as World Elder Abuse Awareness Day and offers its support for older adults, their safety, their happiness and well-being,” Mayor Jonathon Cote said in a news release. “We all deserve to lead happy and healthy lives free from abuse. By working together, we can build better community supports and services for older adults to create meaningful and lasting local changes.”

As part of World Elder Abuse Awareness Day, the Seniors Services Society announced its partnership with the B.C. Association of Community Response Networks to form the New Westminster Community Response Network.

“The New Westminster CRN will work with community members to build awareness in our community concerning older adult abuse issues and the need for prevention activities,” said Alison Silgardo, CEO of the Seniors Services Society. “We will work to educate workers, friends, family members and neighbours on how to recognize the signs of abuse and neglect and where to go for support.”

The British Columbia Association of Community Response Networks website states that it grew out of the need to create an ongoing, permanent provincial funding and support structure for the benefit of vulnerable adults who are experiencing abuse, neglect and self-neglect. It also works to coordinate communities’ efforts to respond to reports of adult abuse, neglect and self-neglect.

According to the provincial association, abuse can take many forms including financial, physical, sexual and psychological abuse. It can also include under-medication, censoring mail, violation of civil and human rights, denial of access to visitors, or invasion or denial of privacy.

“Elder abuse commonly refers to adult abuse where the target is a senior or older adult. An abuser is someone who likely to be someone known to the abused older person like a friend, family member or caregiver. Instances of abuse often coincide with neglect,” said the association’s website. “Neglect is when lack of care, assistance, or attention leads to physical, mental or emotional harm, or loss of financial assets.”

New Westminster MLA Judy Darcy said New Westminster is incredibly fortunate to have the Seniors Services Society in the community, saying its advocacy and outreach programs have helped to tackle many challenges, including housing and mental health.

“Our B.C. government is very proud to support their wonderful work which is more critical than ever due to the COVID-19 pandemic that has kept us physically distant,” she said in the news release. “I am really excited to hear that the Seniors Services Society is partnering with the B.C. Association for Community Response Networks to create the New Westminster CRN. On behalf of a grateful community and a grateful province, thank you for your leadership. I look forward to continuing to work with you and ensure no seniors in New Westminster suffer from social isolation or abuse.""

New Westminster-Burnaby MP Peter Julian said the federal government needs to make seniors a real priority in Canada. He said far too many seniors are struggling during the COVID-19 pandemic, with more than 80% of deaths occurring in long-term care facilities.

“Coupled with the challenges of the rising cost for essential items and the uncertainty about income benefit programs, seniors are being left out of government’s economic response to the pandemic crises. Besides worrying about making ends meet, many seniors suffer a great deal of fear, isolation and anxiety,” he said in a press release from the society. “To that end, I am pleased to see the establishment of the New Westminster Community Response Network. Every senior deserves to age with dignity and respect.”",[]

The program’s volunteers collect donations of fresh produce, either homegrown, or store-bought, which they then deliver to the Union Gospel Mission. This year’s collections are set to begin on Sunday, June 21, and will run every Sunday until Sept. 27.

Claude LeDoux, who has coordinated the New West program since it began 21 years ago, has been tackling “COVID projects” around his home – including a lot of gardening projects. His gardening efforts have already resulted in two loads of veggies being dropped off at the Union Gospel Mission – with much more to come.

“We always do the Union Gospel Mission,” he said of produce used by the UGM food that’s cooked at the mission or distributed to community members. “Through that connection, we send it out to different homes as well. They could be women’s shelters, some families.”

LeDoux, who has coordinated the New West program for many years, is confident the produce ends up in the hands – and mouths – of people who need and appreciate it.

“New West is our main focus, but sometimes it goes further afield if they don’t need it at that moment,” he told the Record. “It works really well. I feel comfortable that things are being properly used and distributed. Our focus has always been New West families, and especially children.”

Some folks have specific containers or gardens where they grow vegetables but LeDoux, the city’s retired manager of horticulture services, likes to mix in vegetables with perennials in his home’s many gardens.

“Wherever I find an opening or when I decide to move a plant out, I may put veggies in there,” he said. “I call it urban agriculture because you’ve got a little bit of everything.”

LeDoux said many folks have been gardening more and started growing more food in recent months.

“In advance of our usual June collection we have already had three pickups,” he noted. “We put our email out to contact people and say, ‘hey, if you have anything, just get in touch with us.’”

While tending to the gardens on the boulevard of his West End home, LeDoux often chats about the Plant a Row – Grow a Row program with passersby.

“I have signed up probably half-a-dozen people for Plant a Row – Grow a Row that way. I’m recruiting while gardening,” he laughed. “It’s so neat. They all want to know about it and how they do it. They are so impressed with what is going on. I explain the importance of what we are doing – that really draws them in. They understand.”

Anyone with extra produce – either homegrown or store-bought, is welcome to drop it off at the Plant a Row – Grow a Row collections that are starting this month. Donations can be dropped off on Sunday morning from 8:30 to 9:15 a.m. at the front entrance to St. Thomas More Collegiate, 7450 12th Ave. (just across the border in Burnaby.)

“Our friendly volunteers will collect and weigh your donations. Your donations will help those in need,” said a notice about the program. “Stop by for a garden chat with our volunteers.”",[]

The auxiliary runs the New to You Thrift Shop in Sapperton, and the gift shop and lotto booth in the hospital lobby – all of which have been shuttered by COVID-19. New to You, located at 416 East Columbia St., is reopening on June 10.

“We will have to comply with all the regulations, the WCB regulations and things,” said Lindy Kirkwood, the auxiliary’s vice-president. “We were already kind of short on volunteers before this even started – it’s our ongoing thing – but not all of our volunteers are going to return right now. We do have quite a number of elderly volunteers. We have a few over 90, several in their 80s. We do have quite a number with compromised immune systems. They are just not prepared to come back yet.”

When the store reopens, there will be restrictions on the number of people allowed in the store at any one time and the change rooms will be closed.

“The idea is we are going to have someone near the door monitoring and watching how many people are coming in, and asking people to use the hand sanitizer and to follow the arrows on the floor,” Kirkwood said. “We did reconfigure the store so that it was going to be easier to navigate.”

Most of the volunteers will be working on the floor, rather than working in the back sorting donations, until some items start to sell.

“Our store is full. We can’t even put much more stuff out until we sell some things,” Kirkwood explained. “I know we are going to be bombarded with donations because you know everybody has been cleaning out these last few months.”

The Royal Columbian Hospital Auxiliary appreciates the support of community members who donate to the thrift store, but hopes they’ll “be gentle” and bring small batches of donations in for the time being.

“We do have amazing donors. We get some beautiful, wonderful donations,” Kirkwood said. “We absolutely would love them to bring them in smaller amounts. That would be wonderful.”

The doors to the New to You Thrift Store have been closed since March, but the charity has still had to pay rent. Using money from its general funds to pay rent will impact the amount of money it’s able to donate to Royal Columbian Hospital this year.

“We have not actually decided on a financial commitment to the hospital. We are kind of hovering around $150,000,” Kirkwood said. “In fact, it should have been better than last year, which was $175,000, because our thrift store did amazing in the last year, better than ever.”

Gordon Hobbis of Cap’s Bicycle Shop, right, recently presented Susan Pearson, one of the managers of the New to You Thrift store, with a $1,000 donation for the Royal Columbian Hospital Auxiliary. The donation will help the auxiliary with rent payments for the New to You Thrift Store, which has been closed because of COVID-19 and is opening this week. - Contributed

Gordon Hobbis, owner of Cap’s Bicycle Shop in Sapperton, heard about the charity’s plight and recently presented the Royal Columbian Hospital Auxiliary with a $1,000 donation to be put towards the thrift store’s rent.

Along with working on the reopening of the New to You thrift store, the auxiliary is also working on plans to reopen the gift shop so Royal Columbian Hospital staff have a place to buy snacks. It may take awhile longer, however, before the lotto booth gets up and running.

“The lottery booth, we can’t see a time yet where that would happen. It’s all cash. And the hospital is not open to the general public, so it doesn’t seem viable to open the lottery booth when there are not enough people around to sell to. That’s going to have to wait until the hospital opens up more,” Kirkwood said. “We may open the gift shop in a limited capacity just to help the staff out a bit with getting a snack here and there.”

Meanwhile, the Royal Columbian Hospital Auxiliary is on the lookout for a volunteer who would be willing to come by the shop once a week to pick up its recycling and take it to the appropriate depots.

“It is electronic recycling – we get a lot of donations of electric things that don’t work. We have small metal recycling and cardboard. Those are our big three,” Kirkwood said. “If anybody would offer to do that, at least once a week would be wonderful.”",[]

For many folks who are spending more time than normal at home because of COVID-19, jigsaw puzzles have been a good fit for their free time. When a friend posted on Facebook that he had a puzzle to give away, Jeremy Perry took him up on his offer.

article continues below

“I hadn’t done a puzzle since I was a child. I was like ‘I’m going to give that a go.’ My husband and I sat down and did the puzzle in two days. It was a 1,000-piece puzzle – and we really enjoyed it,” says the New West resident. “It was this nice evening activity to de-stress. It didn’t require a lot of brain power, but it was still rewarding enough. It was something that we could do together. We really enjoyed it.”

Once that puzzle was complete, Perry wanted to do another – but he didn’t want to have to keep going out and buying a bunch of puzzles. So he headed to Facebook and started the New West Puzzle Exchange group.

“There are a whole bunch that are just sitting and collecting dust on people’s shelves. I started the exchange group with the hope people could share puzzles around the community,” he explains. “I signed the inside of the box so that when you get the puzzle you’d see all these little notes from people who have done it in the past, and it can feel like you have done the puzzle with the community.”

The New West Puzzle Exchange is still in its early days, but some puzzles have already been passed around several times.

Puzzles have been a popular pastime for many folks who are staying home more than normal because of COVID-19. Jeremy Perry has launched New West Puzzle Exchange group on Facebook so folks can share puzzles with community members. - Contributed

“I feel like a lot of people are finding themselves looking for activities to do at home right now,” Perry says. “Doing a puzzle seemed like a reasonable thing people would be interested in.”

Perry was recently chatting with a toy distributor, who told him that puzzles were currently their highest-selling item and his company couldn’t distribute them fast enough.

For some folks, like Perry, puzzles are a throwback to childhood.

“There was always a puzzle going in our living room around the Christmas holidays,” he recalls. “Usually a puzzle would get gifted at Christmas, and it would just kind of be out there happening. My mom was the one who sat and worked on them, but all of us kids would join for little bits here and there.”

Others are passionate about puzzles – and not only during a pandemic.

“What’s interesting is, I know there are people on the sidelines watching the group, who are big puzzlers. They are waiting before they starting jumping in,” Perry says. “I was talking to a friend who I didn’t realize was really big into puzzles. They have a collection and are watching to see if there’s one they want in their collection so they can then offer some trades. I know there are some people with puzzle hoards that are just waiting for the right puzzles to be posted.”

There are no hard and fast rules for folks wanting to access puzzles through the New Westminster Puzzle Exchange.

“Some people are lending their puzzle out and asking that they come back to them because they still want to control their puzzles, whereas others are doing straight-up exchanges. Others are saying, ‘here’s a puzzle, anyone can have it,’” Perry says. “You do whatever works for you.”

Perry hopes puzzlers will jot down a note in the box of puzzles that are making their way around town, as they’ll start to tell a story of the puzzle’s travels.

“It’s something that the community can do together,” he says. “As some of these puzzles make their rounds, I think it will be interesting to look back in a year or two and see some of the puzzles that have been done by so many people.”",[]

In a first for the Hyack Ambassador program, the awarding of the Miss New Westminster title took place virtually in front of an audience on Zoom. After completing their training in March, Hyack Ambassador candidates learned the planned Evening of Stars award gala at Douglas College in April would be cancelled because of COVID-19.

“It was incredibly disheartening, as the girls had worked so hard throughout the year developing their leadership and presentation skills,” program coordinator Deb Wardle said in a news release. “We decided as an organizing committee to find a way to honour and reward our candidates, while still keeping them, their families and guests safe.”

The organizing committee adapted the 49th gala to be an online event, which included a socially-distanced delivery of prizes and materials for the five candidates to be installed as this year’s New Westminster Hyack Ambassador leadership team by their families at home.

“The online event received overwhelming support, as hundreds of guests logged on to watch, maxing out the Zoom call’s capacity,” said a press release from the program. “As the first ambassador program in British Columbia to host their festivities online, the New Westminster Hyack Ambassador leadership program paves a new way for programs across the province.”

Joining Moira Young (Miss New Westminster 2020) as this year’s Hyack Ambassadors are: Tianna Beaudoin (Hyack Princess); Ashley Choi (Miss Friendship); Laura Solkoski; and Alyssa Choi.

All members of the 2020 Hyack Ambassadors received a variety of scholarships for their participation in the program. A number of community members provided video messages to the young women taking part in this year’s program.

A recording of the event will be available on YouTube, under New Westminster Hyack Ambassadors, for those who were unable to watch the weekend’s event. Applications for the 2021 Hyack Ambassador leadership program are now available online at www.hyackfestival.com.",[]

Along with some online offerings, such as Coffee Break with Shelly on Tuesdays, Century House is making items such as puzzles, books and colouring supplies available to local seniors. They’re available for pickup just inside the entrance of the facility at 620 Eighth St.

“We have puzzles. We are giving away puzzles,” said Shelly Schnee, program coordinator of seniors’ services at Century House. “We are giving away some bundles of pencil crayons and some colouring sheets. We have the crossword puzzle – we photocopy the Vancouver Sun crossword puzzle every day and leave that out.”

When seniors borrow items like books and puzzles, they’re normally able to return them for someone else to take – but that’s not happening because of COVID-19.

“It’s just like a free service that we offer,” Schnee said. “Unfortunately, we can only give them; we can’t take them back right now, because of COVID.”

Sitting down for a meal or a cup of coffee with friends in Connections Café is another thing that’s not happening at Century House because of COVID-19, but food service is still available. A take-out meal program is being offered Monday to Friday from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.

“It’s going really well. We are getting 25 customers a day,” Schnee said. “You preorder. You can phone and say, ‘I want the entrée today.’ You can drop in as well, and if she has enough you can be served. If you really want that meal for the day, you should phone it. It is takeout. You come in one door and go out another door.”

The weekly takeout meal offerings and prices are found at www.centuryhouseassociation.com (Search under Connections Café.)

The Gurdwara Sahib Sukh Sagar is also distributing free dinners on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 4:30 to 5:30 p.m. in Century House’s parking lot. This meal is for those who need it most – seniors, persons with disabilities and vulnerable populations.

Through its 2019 fundraising campaign, the New West-based charity was able to purchase equipment for the ICU and Emergency departments at Royal Columbian Hospital. The donations, which were recommended by the Royal Columbian Hospital Foundation, include a cerebral oximetry EEG for the ICU department and a Code Blue Team Lifepak monitor.

“Both pieces are critical to ICU and Emergency frontline workers,” said a news release from the Group of Five.

The group also partnered with New West Rotary to revitalize the breast imaging department’s reception room, which received new chairs, tables, artwork, a 32-inch television and a fresh coat of paint.

“Thanks to the generosity of the local New Westminster Rotary Club #153, we were able to expand our impact at RCH to include some much-needed renovations,” said James Crosty, president of the Group of Five.

Founded in 2004, the Group of Five holds a variety of fundraisers and buys equipment and incidentals for the Royal Columbian Hospital.

“Thanks to the generous support of our charitable donors, both personal and business, the G5 realized a tremendous 2019 fundraising season,” said a press release from the Group of Five.

‘Tis the Season, held in November 2019, and Spring is Right Around the Corner, hosted in May 2019, raised funds for the latest purchases for the hospital.

Due to COVID-19, the Group of Five’s spring event was cancelled. The charity welcomes donations, and believes its efforts to purchase equipment for Royal Columbian Hospital is needed now – more than ever.

“We will all be together at our scheduled fall 2020 event – see you there,” said Gerda Suess, co-founder and treasurer of the Group of Five. “Meanwhile, please donate today to the Group of Five – thank you.”

365,newwestrecord,https://www.newwestrecord.ca/community/food/food-security-is-an-issue-for-new-westminster-seniors-1.23839835,Food security is an issue for New Westminster seniors,['John Stark Contributed'],,"The City of New Westminster was contacted by a senior who had received an eviction notice in order to facilitate renovations in her rental building. The senior had recently relocated to a nearby rental building; however, her monthly rent is considerably higher. As a result, the senior is finding it difficult to live on her fixed income and was inquiring as to food and meal programs in her neighbourhood.

In talking to the senior, she stated that she was receiving a rent supplement under the Shelter Aid for Elderly Renters (SAFER) program. She further stated that she had not applied for subsidized housing under the BC Housing Registry but had heard that there are long waitlists for such housing. (In April 2019, there were 214 seniors on the registry who are looking for subsidized housing in New Westminster.)

article continues below

The senior had very limited knowledge of available food programming, which is understandable as she had never experienced food insecurity in the past, and she was apprehensive about crowds and lineups. Although not explicitly stated, there appeared to be a concern that others would see and judge her. As such, the stigma associated with poverty and food insecurity was a potential barrier to her receiving assistance. The senior also stated that she had diabetes, thus had a restricted diet.

This raised the question of how prevalent is food insecurity amongst seniors and what resources are available to assist them in New Westminster.

People are food insecure when: (1) they worry they will not be able to afford adequate food; (2) they eat sub-optimal food because they cannot afford better; and (3) they skip meals because they are unable to purchase enough food.

In March 2016, 103,464 people received food from a food bank in British Columbia; which represented a 32.5 per cent increase since March 2008. In 2017, 429 people received food in an average week from the Greater Vancouver Food Bank Society in New Westminster. A large number of people accessing a food bank are on some form of government assistance, including a pension. The high cost of housing is a key driver of food bank usage, with 66 per cent of people who use a food bank paying market level rents.

A complete, nutritious diet is critical to good health. As such, food insecurity is associated with an increased risk for conditions such as asthma, diabetes and high blood pressure. Seniors who are food insecure are 40 per cent more likely to develop congestive heart failure, 53 per cent more likely to report a heart attack and 60 per cent more likely to experience depression.

There are many organizations that are working to address food insecurity in New Westminster and several publications listing resources. One such publication is the Helping Hands brochure, which lists food and meal programs, including locations and times when they are available. Another publication is the Fraser Health Low Cost Food Directory, which also includes community kitchen and cooking programs.

For the senior in question, recent changes related to food bank delivery may allay many of her fears. For example, the Greater Vancouver Food Bank Society in New Westminster offers staggered entry hours to accommodate those requiring extra assistance and time; empowers users to make their own food choices; accommodates dietary needs and preferences; and provides opportunities for social connections.

In 2018, the City of New Westminster, with a grant from the Vancouver Foundation, developed a Food Security Action Plan. This plan, which involved over 30 community, faith, settlement and social service organizations in its development, identifies needs and gaps and proposes 38 actions to enhance food security. The New Westminster Homelessness Coalition Society and the New Westminster Community Food Action Committee, with a grant from the City, will be responsible for plan implementation.

The City of New Westminster is also working on a number of housing initiatives to address renovictions (when some landlords evict their tenants under the guise of performing major renovations and then significantly increase the rent), and increase the supply of below-market and non-market rental housing. The city has also partnered on a Rent Bank program, which provides low-interest loans to people at risk of eviction. These housing initiatives, plus others, recognize the important role that housing affordability plays with regard to poverty, food insecurity and homelessness.

In moving forward, it is envisioned that people who find themselves food insecure will have ready access to information about available programs; will be able to easily locate and utilize food and meal programs; will be able to meet their dietary needs and preferences; and will be able to do so in a dignified and respectful manner. In so doing, the senior in question will feel empowered and supported, and will not be forced to choose between buying food and paying other bills.

366,newwestrecord,https://www.newwestrecord.ca/community/on-cooking-tips-for-creative-cooking-with-crustaceans-1.23411727,ON COOKING: Tips for creative cooking with crustaceans,['Chef Dez'],,"Crustaceans is the grouping that represent crabs, lobsters, shrimp, crayfish, etc. They are all more “creature-like” than mollusks because of their visible legs and eyes.

They are usually thought of only living in salt water, which is true for the most part, but there are some forms of crayfish, crabs and shrimp that also inhabit bodies of fresh water. Lake of the Woods in Kenora, Ont., where we vacation quite frequently, is a perfect example of this. There are many crayfish to be found, and some fishermen focus solely on these for their catch of the day.

article continues below

The availability of prawns and shrimp is much more common than crayfish. Rarely available live, the markets near the coast will have prawns and shrimp available fresh (never been frozen). Elsewhere, they are usually purchased either frozen or thawed from frozen. Small shrimp are also available in cans.

Prawns and shrimp as we know them in the market are actually only the tails of these creatures. Some prawns are available with the legs and shell still attached, but rarer are some larger varieties sold in whole form, eyes and all.

When purchasing them frozen, there are many options, and you will need to take into account how you plan to serve them.

Very small shrimp, whether frozen, thawed or canned, are always sold pre-cooked, but with larger prawns one also has the option of purchasing them raw.

Frozen cooked prawns should be purchased for recipes that require little or no cooking of them since they are already cooked. Overcooked prawns are very rubbery and less flavourful.

Examples of applications for cooked prawns would be for a salad, shrimp cocktail, or for adding at the end of a cooked dish. Proper thawing of your prawns is recommended to prevent bacteria growth.

Whether cooked or raw, the recommended procedure for thawing them is in the refrigerator over a period of 24 hours. This is a gradual thaw that keeps them in a safe temperature storage zone.

If you are in a hurry, then a water thaw can be acceptable as a second choice. This is done by putting the frozen prawns in a bowl in the sink. Fill the bowl with cold water and continue to run a slow stream of cold tap water into the bowl.

The water level will obviously overflow, so make sure the drain is open. Keep running the stream of cold water until the prawns are thawed – approximately 15 to 20 minutes, depending on their size.

Raw prawns purchased fresh, frozen or thawed obviously need to be cooked, but one should never overcook any shellfish, because they become rubbery. They should only be cooked until they just turn pink for optimal flavour and texture, and be served immediately. Raw prawns are available peeled or unpeeled, with or without tails, and de-veined or not.

Deveining of larger prawns should always be done. The “vein” is the long dark intestine embedded along the top length of the prawn. If the prawns you have purchased are not deveined, this can be easily performed by running a knife blade along this line until it is exposed. It then can be simply pulled or scraped out.

Prawns that still have their shell on, but have already been deveined, are frequently called “zipperbacks.” These are perfect when you want to serve prawns as a finger food when your guests peel them as they eat – aptly called “peel and eats.”

Congratulations to you if you took my advice and tried your hand at this wonderful culinary skill. For those of you that did, and for those of you that never will, I want to give you some ideas for sauces to complement your pasta, be it from fresh or dry.

article continues below

The most common is the classic tomato sauce. Although chefs will consider it sacrilege to any pasta, a number of people still buy canned or jarred premade tomato sauces. Some will at least get creative by adding extra ingredients like onions or garlic, but nothing can take the place of good rustic homemade batch of tomato sauce. This does not have to be the style that simmers for hours on end, either.

Many great homemade sauces can start out with a little help from canned diced tomatoes and some tomato paste, and be done in record time. Reduce it down even further at the end (by simmering some of the water content out) and replenish with some whipping cream and you now have a rosé sauce for those special occasions when calorie counting is not on your priority list.

Any ground meat (beef, pork, chicken, turkey, lamb, etc.) cooked up at the beginning of the process will magically transform this rustic tomato or rosé sauce into a hearty meat sauce. Sausage meat can also be utilized in the same manner by removing it from the casings and cooking the same as ground meat. Italian sausage (mild or hot, depending on your tastes) is wonderful for this.

A béchamel (white sauce) is a very simple sauce. Don’t let the fancy French culinary name scare you – it’s just milk thickened with flour and butter. A little seasoning (salt, pepper, and a pinch of ground nutmeg), and you have an incredible sauce that can be a blank canvas for your favourite cheeses to be melted in or tossed with bits of grilled chicken. Add garlic and parmesan and you will basically have alfredo sauce.

Oils infused with flavours and seasonings can be the base of a tasty light pasta coating. Heating olive oil over medium to low heat and letting ingredients like crushed garlic, chillies, herbs, etc. infuse their way into transforming an ordinary oil into a savoury enhancement. These types of sauces are perfect for less filling side dishes or during hot weather when a heavily thickened sauce is not desired.

A batch of seasoned simmered vegetables can also be transformed into a smooth sauce bursting with flavours with the help of a blender, food processor, or hand immersion blender.

One of the quickest pasta sauces you will ever make is a browned-butter sauce. It is exactly what the name states it to be – butter that has been browned. Take a hot pan and place a handful of cold butter cubes into it. Stir, or lift the pan and swirl the melting butter, until the butter foam has just started to brown, then toss with your favourite pasta.

Your favourite fresh delicate herb (basil, oregano, sage) can also be added at the time of the cold butter for an incredible infusion of herbal essential oils. Although we have all been taught never to add butter to a hot pan for fear that it will burn, the trick is to stop the cooking process of the “browning” butter before it hits the “burning” stage. Use salted butter and you will have to do less seasoning afterwards.

Dracaena in a pot surrounded by pink geraniums are a seriously dated idea, like icicle lights at Christmas or the broad, monochromatic sweep of impatiens at the front of the house, which has been replaced with something new.

Truth is, many of our past obsessions in the garden have been replaced with a staggering breadth of choice. Hybridizers have been busy meeting demands of Canadian consumers for perennial plants that feature longer bloom times, more intense fragrance and higher pollen and nectar counts to attract pollinators. No longer do gardeners have to invest in fresh annuals year over year to get the variety and colour they long for.

article continues below

Canadian gardeners live in the most exciting of times. Ever.

Here to support our theory is a shortlist of some of the most exciting new perennial plants for 2018.

Pollinators such as cat mint, or nepeta, have always been a magnet for honey bees and native bees alike. This year, look for the new Cat’s Pajamas cat mint. It grows a bit lower (80 centimetres) than the original species, but it is dense with sky blue flowers come mid-summer. Plant in full sun.

Early summer, colour is guaranteed with many sedum varieties. They thrive on neglect, need very little water and they attract pollinators to beat the band. Look for Rock’ N Grow for 40 cm tall plants loaded with purple flowers and Little Miss Sunshine, also low-growing, featuring bright yellow flowers. Thrives in full sun.

Bergenia attract a host of bumblebees, which are fun to watch. Flowering now in the garden, Bergenia features evergreen foliage and bright pink flowers about 80 cm tall. Look for the new Flirt bergenia for sun to part shade.

Russian sage, or perovskia, is another winter hardy, long-flowering perennial staple for any sunny garden. The new Blue Jean Baby features sky blue flowers, born on a metre-high plant. Suitable for cutting. Another pollinator magnet.

Coneflowers, the native Echinacea, have been worked with by the hand of humankind for a few years now. All varieties need full sun and tolerate moderate drought conditions (less watering). Let them stand over the winter so that foraging song birds can enjoy the seeds.

Look for these four new varieties for a wide selection of new colours:

Kismet Intense Orange features intense orange blooms, grows to a mere 40 cm high with a compact growing habit.

features intense orange blooms, grows to a mere 40 cm high with a compact growing habit. Kismet Raspberry flowers for an extended period, from early summer to frost. Raspberry red, 40 cm high. Each flower lasts for weeks. Great for cutting.

flowers for an extended period, from early summer to frost. Raspberry red, 40 cm high. Each flower lasts for weeks. Great for cutting. Kismet Red , 45 cm high, upright habit. Great display.

, 45 cm high, upright habit. Great display. Kismet Yellow, 45 cm sunny, butter-yellow flowers. According to the breeder, trials of this variety across the country garnered high scores.

Tiarella is a perennial that performs in dense shade and flowers for up to three weeks in early summer. Look for the new Cutting Edge for bright, clean white blossoms on short 30 cm plants with light green leaves with dark purple veins.

Heucherella is another great plant that thrives in the shade. Look for new Fun and Games featuring soft pink upright panicles of flowers standing above lime-green leaves with dark purple veins. Interesting! 30 cm high.

Heuchera, or coral bells, perform well in a half day of sun. The new Primo has deep purple foliage that will stand out amongst softer, green foliage plants. Great border plant.

It is the Perennial of the Year: a huge honour and one that is earned through countless trials continent wide.",[]

The 350-year-old red oak is located on a residential lot in Rexdale. The homeowners fear that the house may no longer be livable. As the tree grows, it “squeezes” the house and its foundation with branches and roots.

article continues below

The property is on the market for about $750,000.

The city has said that it does not want to buy it, but a final decision has been put off for a few weeks while discussion and study goes on. Some Torontonians with a keen sense of history and appreciation for Toronto’s oldest tree have challenged the city to meet them halfway. Edith George, a long-time advocate for heritage trees, is leading a coalition of private citizens to raise half of the value of the real estate, approximately $325,000.

What is the significance of this tree? First, it was a rather mature 130 years old when Toronto, then York, was founded in 1793.

Secondly, it is not just the tree that is significant, but what it represents. There is only one “oldest” tree in the city. When it is gone, another tree will be deemed “the oldest.” But it won’t be 350 years old and it may not be in a state of health that makes it worthy of saving, as this one is. To a large degree we need to save this tree because we can.

Third, the location and age of this tree has special significance to Indigenous people. It is considered sacred by many.

We believe this campaign should focus on the tree and its preservation. The house should be gently removed, the soil around its roots remediated and the entire tree be given special attention by professionals in the business of arboriculture. It deserves nothing less.

We understand that the tree could live another 150 years or more, given proper care and attention.

During the war of 1812, the Americans thought it was a good idea to come to Canada to claim our country as their own and as 35,000 Americans left home to fight, 5,000 British, Canadian and Indigenous people defended our border.

Without the help of our Indigenous people, specifically the people of the Six Nations, historians agree that we would most certainly be American today.

All non-Indigenous Canadians owe another debt of thanks to our native brethren. Our attention is drawn to Toronto’s oldest tree. What a fitting tribute to the efforts and sacrifice made by Indigenous people on behalf of us all.

We believe today is the best day of all to remind ourselves of our history, to acknowledge past mistakes and to make good on the promise to “never forget.”

A breeze through tall grass, the crunch of gravel underfoot and a frog croaking all play their part in this living soundtrack.

Nothing can stop us in our tracks like birdsong.

Our friends at Bird Studies Canada remind us that birds are an important indicator of the health of our environment. Healthy planet, healthy birds.

Our favourite way to promote and enjoy birds is bringing them right into the backyard by providing food and habitat. Here is how:

Plants are a one-stop shop for food and shelter. Birds prefer fruits and seeds right off the plant, and most birds either build their nests in a tree, shrub or stand of grass, or they make their nests from pieces of it.

Flowers such as asters, black-eyed Susan (Rudbeckia), echinacea (purple coneflower) and coreopsis not only add colour to your yard but attract a range of song birds from cardinals to colourful finches. Leave perennials standing throughout the winter so they can continue to be foraged and cut them down in the spring.

Native ornamental grasses attract sparrows, finches and other small birds that forage for seeds. Robins and sparrows pick up coarse blades to construct the main walls of their nest, then revisit for finer-textured blades to pad the soft lining of the interior.

We recommend planting big bluestem, little bluestem, northern sea oats or side oats.

Like your perennials, leave these grasses standing through the winter to provide habitat for overwintering species such as dark-eyed juncos.

Robins, waxwings and cardinals build nests in shrubs, eating and singing like old friends at an East Coast kitchen party. Mulberries and serviceberries are two medium-sized, summer-fruiting shrubs that are especially popular with this crowd. Flowering dogwood bears fruit in the fall to keep them coming, as does crab apple, which also fruits in the fall but holds its fruit into the winter.

Trees are the bird equivalent of a tall condo building, bustling with life. White oaks provide nesting opportunities to woodpeckers, jays and even wood ducks, and unlike other oaks, white oaks produce acorns every year.

Native tree species are found to support more bird life. We recommend red maple or black, red and white spruce, gray, white and yellow birch or black willow, if you have lots of space.

Once you have created a bountiful bird food-garden, supplement with the right bird feed.

Birds will forgive you for letting the feeders go empty. People worry that the birds depend on them for feeder-food. While a feeder helps bring birds to your yard, it will only ever be one of many food sources they depend on, so don’t race home from the cottage to fill your bird feeders.

Buy seed based on the birds you wish to attract. The following guidelines by BSC will help you understand what type of feed will attract the birds you want:

Black oil sunflower seed will attract cardinal, black-capped chickadee, mourning dove, dark-eyed junco, song sparrow and common grackle.

Suet and bird peanuts attract blue jay, red-breasted nuthatch, downy woodpecker, white-breasted nuthatch, hairy woodpecker. Avoid “human peanuts” as the salt is harmful to birds.

Nyjer/black oil sunflower will attract the smaller house finch, American goldfinch, purple finch, common redpoll, pine siskin.

With enough food and places to make nest, remember water. This is extremely important as birds, like humans, need to drink and bathe.

As you enjoy the bird chorus of the oasis in your yard, consider joining a “citizen science” initiative through BSC such as Project FeederWatch. Simply count the kinds and numbers of birds at your feeder and report it back for BSC to add to their database.

Like many New Westers, all of the plants in my yard have been crushed under a blanket of snow and frozen in place for the past few weeks. My cedar hedge is all bent and folded out.



- New West resident



Answer:



I asked Claude LeDoux, the city’s horticultural manager, for some advice.



“The snow blanket, as it’s better called, is truly a protective blanket because it insulates the plants. Now, if you are stacking snow on top, heavy wet snow or ice, yes, you can damage plants that way. But if it’s just a regular blanket of snow that’s fallen naturally, then it really acts as an insulator protecting them.



“The plants that are what we call zonal denial, a bit of a tropical-type plant, there is no guarantees on them at all. The really important thing for you to do in that situation is not to cut any plants. Do not prune anything off unless it is broken, or if it was a perennial you knew was just black. Regular shrubs or plants that might – do not cut them. Wait until they start to sprout in the spring and make sure they are alive before you chop anything.



“Hedges, you really should always shake off the snow. Yes, they kind of go floppy, but the trick right now with it being so cold is you shouldn’t mess with them other than to remove the snow. And then if they are not going to stand up once it is warmed up, then you can tie them together, tie them up, and see if that allows themselves to straighten back up.



“You won’t be able to really tell anything until it really warms up. Plants will stay green and look OK and then if they succumb to the cold, freezing or breakage that you didn’t notice then they will die.”

We get into a groove and it becomes our norm.

article continues below

Without question, we perform these activities in our habitual manner, even if there are better ways of doing them.

Our habits resist change. It takes conscious practice to create a new groove, but with effort over time, we can settle into new and positive routines.

But it all starts with a moment of reflection and a fresh perspective.

Is this the best way to act? Does it reflect my values and bring me closer to my goals? Or is it wasteful or harmful to myself or others?

When we see our routines in a new light and recognize a better way to live our lives, we can be energized to practise new habits.

How do you approach your own health? How do you use the health-care system? Who is responsible for most of your care?

Although most of us would endorse the concepts of preventive and proactive care, both patients and providers tend to act reactively.

Reactive care includes going to a clinic or the emergency department for an acute problem, such as an infection, heart attack or stroke. It includes seeking care when chronic conditions have deteriorated to the point that you can no longer manage at home.

We certainly need urgent and emergency care for acute and unexpected crises, but this shouldn’t be all of your health care.

Just as health is not defined as the absence of illness, health care is not simply the treatment of disease. If your personal approach to health is episodic and reactive, you won’t be able to maintain wellness. You’re more likely to suffer from the complications of chronic health conditions and require hospital care sooner rather than later.

While acute care is episodic and reactive, the alternative is planned and proactive care. You are in the driver’s seat and you are responsible for the daily activities that maintain good health. These include the four foundations of self-care: healthy eating, physical activity, emotional well-being and healthy relationships.

You need to know your risks for health conditions based on your age, gender and family history; what you can do to prevent them, and what tests you need for early detection.

If you are diagnosed with a chronic condition, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, chronic lung or heart disease, you need to know how to self-monitor your condition, take medication appropriately and how to work with your health-care providers.

One essential key to proactive health care is a family doctor who works with you over time, knows your family and health history, understands where you are and what’s important to you, and partners with you in treating disease in the context of your whole life.

If you don’t already know the answers, the next time you see your family doctor ask, “Considering my age and family history, what should I be doing to maintain the best health? Am I due for any screening tests? What activities will prevent illness and promote health?”

This is no ordinary gym however. In fact, LIVE WELL Exercise Clinic New Westminster likes to describe itself as the “anti-gym,” a place where how you feel is more important than how you look and where people get a lot of support to achieve their goals.

LIVE WELL is a medical fitness clinic that’s built on the belief that exercise is medicine. Specializing in safe, supervised exercise and healthy-lifestyle coaching for people who have chronic health conditions or want to prevent them, it helps its members make sustainable changes to their lifestyle to live healthier and happier lives.

Members come to LIVE WELL Exercise Clinic for many different reasons, whether to lose weight, lower cholesterol, have more energy, combat stress or to continue playing tennis until they’re 80 years old.

So how is it doing? We asked three local residents to tell us how LIVE WELL Exercise Clinic has changed their lives.

“I had previously tried gyms but always went alone and felt invisible and uncomfortable.”

“After a lifetime of being moderately active particularly in various forms of dance, I suffered three strokes in one week due to high blood pressure,” Doreen explains. “I was dancing Can Can, tap and Scottish Country prior to having the strokes, but my neurologist told me during one of my appointments that I should stop due to my health.”

Doreen wasn’t enthused by her previous experience with gyms and found doing yoga or pilates in her own home demotivating, then she discovered LIVE WELL.

One of the things that Doreen likes most about LIVE WELL is the expertise of its staff. Personalized expertise and support are key aspects of LIVE WELL. The New West location is staffed by clinical exercise physiologists. Experts in their field, the team create personalized plans specifically tailored to each member’s needs. They also monitor vitals during sessions and work closely with members’ doctors to create plans that are geared towards improving their health, something that is key for someone like Doreen.

The friendly and supportive nature at the gym is also important to Doreen. “I love the smallish groups and the support and love we are able to extend to each other. I look forward each day to greetings from some, hugs from others.”

“LIVE WELL staff create a supportive environment and we have lots of fun.”

Lynda had known for some time that she needed to take action to improve her health, however a knee replacement had made it hard for her to get going.

“I had gained quite a lot of weight from being so sedentary and I was at the highest weight I had ever been in my life,” she says. “My blood pressure was up, cholesterol was up and I was feeling very depressed.”

Lynda knew that a traditional gym setup was not the best fit for her, “they can be intimidating, the pressure to wear trendy clothes and to look fit,” but then she discovered LIVE WELL and became a founding member at the New West location.

“I was greeted by caring, welcoming staff, who made it a safe place to be totally honest about health issues and concerns. There was no judgement at all. LIVE WELL’s staff create a supportive environment and we have lots of fun. The members are like “Your Tribe” and we all support each other.”

Lynda immediately began to see benefits thanks to a personalized plan that was tailor made to specifically meet her needs and abilities.

“It has been almost six months and my blood pressure is down to normal levels, my blood tests revealed that my cholesterol is down and my family doctor could not be happier. I have lost on average two pounds per month, which is a bonus. My strength, flexibility and mobility improvement is amazing to me.”

“LIVE WELL fits perfectly into my busy lifestyle.”

“I heard all about LIVE WELL from my father who was a founding member of the Langley LIVE WELL Clinic,” Susan explains. ""His enthusiasm for the program sparked an interest by my sister who in turn joined the Langley clinic. I was pleasantly surprised at the commitment that my family had made to LIVE WELL and I wanted get on board!”

When LIVE WELL opened their New West location Susan was one of the first members to sign up. And something she enjoys the most about her membership is the flexibility to fit her visits in around her busy schedule.

“I have committed to two sessions a week in ‘my’ time slot, but life doesn’t always run on a smooth calendar and with LIVE WELL I have the opportunity to move my session with as little as four-hour notice, so there is no use it or lose it.”

Susan has already started to see the benefits from her time at the clinic, she says: “I have seen a reduction in my blood pressure, greater cardio endurance, and a huge desire to return every time.”

One of the things that she attributes her success to is the setup, which prioritizes small classes and individual support that’s tailor-made to each member.

“I enjoy the fact that only a limited number of people are in each session,” she says. “That means that any help or guidance you need is easily available from the trained fitness professionals while we work on our own program which has been tailored to our own specific needs.”

If you are trying to lose weight, reduce your cholesterol, decrease your blood pressure, or just want to get healthier LIVE WELL Exercise Clinic can help. LIVE WELL specializes in supervised exercise and healthy lifestyle-coaching specifically tailored to each member’s unique needs with a focus on overall health and well-being.

With clinics throughout BC, including right here in New Westminster, LIVE WELL’s evidence-based programs are ideal for those with chronic health conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, hypertension and obesity and for anyone who wants to improve their general wellness.

Lotteries foster magical thinking. We like to dream. What would you do with an extra $1,000, $10,000 or $100,000? What would you do with a million dollars?

article continues below

Those really big numbers both delight and confuse us. We forget about the teeny, tiny numbers – like our odds of actually winning.

Lotteries can be a tax on the poor. As a kid, I remember seeing desperate looking people spending $20 or more for the improbable chance of winning big and improving their lives.

The feeling of imagining winning really is enjoyable, and to some it can be an addiction. That magical feeling and the optimistic thinking that goes along with it instantly deflate when we’ve found out we’ve lost. That’s probably why I wasn’t keen on checking my soon-to-be unlucky numbers.

Even if you don’t buy lottery tickets, you’re still a player in the big lottery of life.

There’s the genetic lottery, the random mix up of genetic traits you acquired from your mom and dad. If your parents don’t look like Brad Pitt or Angelina Jolie, you probably don’t look like either of them.

You got half your genes from each parent, but those genes were randomly distributed to you and any siblings. Nature may have thrown in a number of mutations, and this all makes you a complete individual.

Your unique genetic makeup, the events of your life, your childhood and your relationships are yours alone through chance, serendipity, karma or divine intervention. You may not think of these as prizes, but they are.

If you knew you had just one year, one month or one week left of life, what would you do with this time? How would you use the gifts you have been given?

With your limited time remaining, who would you call? What would you say? Who would you spend time with? Where would you go? What would you do?

The reality is that our lives are limited. Though we live each day with an assumption of immortality, we won’t live forever, and because of this, we limit ourselves. We don’t take stock of what we have when we have it and this is what limits us most.

You have a unique potential in your life today. It is worth much more than the lottery ticket in your pocket and certainly more than the old ones in your drawer.

Life is a lottery, but most of us don’t realize what we have won. Check your winnings now and spend them while you can. Look at your talents. What useful skills come easily to you? What can you improve and refine with practice?

Look at your relationships. What can you do to appreciate and strengthen those connections? Is there anything important left unsaid? In what ways can you express your love?

Look at the positive potential of each day. What small thing can you do to make someone else’s day? Who in need can you help? What great things can you do with your life?

You are already a winner. Share your special gifts with others.

In the 17 years I chaired Burnaby Hospital’s former ethical resources committee, I discovered the moral foundation of medicine that informs every patient encounter. Over 10 years, our team consulted on ethical dilemmas faced by patients, their families and healthcare teams.

All of the patients were no longer capable of independent medical decision-making. Some were unconscious. Others were disabled by severe dementia.

They obviously could no longer speak for themselves and make independent health-care decisions. It was not clear what the patients would have chosen for themselves. Family members and health-care providers conflicted in their opinions.

In many cases, patients were in LTC (long-term care) or in the ICU (intensive care unit). Interventions had been started in response to presenting conditions. Feeding tubes provided nutrition when patients were unable to safely swallow. Machines would support ventilation of the lungs when patients could no longer breathe on their own. But in the face of worsening medical conditions and a grim prognosis (outlook), we were asked if these treatments should be removed.

I believe John Milton said, “The road to hell is paved with good intentions.” I used to say, “The road to ICU is paved with clinical practice guidelines.”

That is not a criticism of the heroic and angelic medical teams in our ERs and ICUs, but rather a reminder that our treatments and tests are just the tools of medicine; ethics (not just diagnoses or clinical conditions) guides us in their appropriate use.

And at the core of ethics is autonomy (the values and preferences of the individual patient).

In our consultative meetings with families and the health-care team, we would review the principles of medical ethics and then step back to see the whole patient, looking at not only the medical facts but also significant personal and social factors.

We would seek to understand the individual patients’ personal preferences. What were their values, religious and cultural beliefs, and sources of meaning? What did quality of life mean to the individual?

Had they ever discussed their preferences and who they would choose to make decisions for them if they were no longer able to do so?

Of course, our work would be easier if patients had anticipated and reflected upon the possibility of being incapacitated by illness in the future. An advance medical directive is a written, signed and dated document that explicitly states your wishes for what you would or would not want at a future time when you no longer capable of making your own decisions and who you trust to direct health-care providers on your behalf. It can take the form of the free downloadable document, My Voice, or a formally notarized representation agreement.

If you would like to know more about advance directives, talk to your family physician or see the Ministry of Health’s website at

tinyurl.com/MyVoiceGuide.

We are all prone to forget about the big picture when going about our everyday lives. If we drive without a roadmap, compass or GPS, we can be distracted by detours, accidents, breakdowns, other drivers and the people with whom we travel. We may find ourselves lost and far from our destination … and half of us are less inclined to ask for directions.

Ethics is everywhere, and we don’t always see it.

But if we consider our values and live by its principles, we can find our way.

In life and health, almost anything can happen anytime. It’s best to look and plan ahead.

New Westminster natives Ralph and Loree Baker recently enjoyed a month-long vacation in Europe with their oldest and dearest friends, Ron and Maureen Darnbrough and Byron and Vivienne Welters, who grew up in New Westminster, but now call North Delta home. The Bakers took along a copy of The Record and the six friends posed with their hometown newspaper in front of the Eiffel Tower, which was erected for the 1889 Paris Exposition.

article continues below

""These old friends go back a ways - not as far as the tower, but quite a ways,"" quipped the Bakers in a letter to The Record.

""Maureen, Ralph, Loree and Byron graduated from Lester Pearson High School in 1966. Vivienne graduated from New Westminster Secondary School in 1967. Ron is an import from Burnaby South.""

The group's friendships go back even earlier than high school, as Loree and Maureen were in Grade 1 together at Lord Tweedsmuir Elementary School, and Byron and Ralph met in Grade 3 at Herbert Spencer. Ralph and Maureen

also attended Lord Kelvin Elementary School.

""It was fabulous,"" Loree told The Record about the vacation that started in Paris.

Although the six friends range from 64 to 66 years of age, Loree said they still encountered a few problems with directions during their trip.

""You cannot believe how many times we got lost,"" she laughed. It was while traveling by rail in the Cinque Terre region along the coastline of Northern Italy that the travelers discovered just how small the world can be.

Having taken a wrong train, the vacationers got off one train and boarded another - as did another couple. After getting onto a different train, the Bakers stood near the other couple, who also spoke English.

""First question, so where are you from?"" wrote the Bakers. ""We were shocked to discover that the four of us were from New Westminster.""

Not only did the two couples learn they were from New Westminster, but they were stunned to discover they both lived on London Street in the West End.

""It was absolutely unbelievable,"" Loree later told The Record. ""We are actually one block and five houses apart.""

It turns out that Richard and Debbie Lemire were quite familiar with the Baker's home, as they walk their dog past the residence and its well-manicured lawn.

""He is meticulous about our lawn,"" Loree said about her husband. ""Right away, Richard said, 'we know that house, that is the one with the nicest lawn.'""

After marveling at the fact the neighbours had crossed paths thousands of miles from their home in the Royal City, the Bakers took out their copy of The Record and posed for a photograph. When the two New Westminster couples parted ways, they exchanged names and phone numbers and pledged to get together and enjoy some Italian wine.

""We are definitely going to have the wine,"" Loree said. ""We are going to do it - we just haven't done it yet.""

It's not the first time the Bakers have met fellow Royal City residents when travelling.

While playing golf at a nine-hole golf course that included holes in North Portal, Saskatchewan and others in Portal, North Dakota, they met someone who lived in New Westminster and worked at Royal Columbian Hospital. While shopping in a gift shop on the other side of the country in Cape Breton Island they met someone from Sapperton.

Several of Loree and Ralph Baker's vacation photos have been featured in Paper Postcards, which see residents posing in front of a famous landmark with The Record during their travels.

They note that the feature is a conversation starter, as they have to chat with people and ask them to take their photo.

Photographers are encouraged to be creative with their interpretation in each of the following categories: The River at Work (industry), The River Wild (environment), The River’s People (culture) and People’s Choice (based on votes from the public online).

Each year a new selection of photographs is unveiled with a juried, themed photograph exhibit on a specific theme. For 2016 the theme is ‘Time’.

“Every year we brainstorm with staff about what the theme should be, trying to find a topic that will be broad enough encompass all aspects of the mighty Fraser,” added Stephen. “As a result, *click* photos of the fraser always generates interest from a wide range of amateur and professional photographers. And we look forward to seeing what they have come up with this year!”

Also headlining the evening is the opening of the Living, Working River Art Exhibition, a collection of juried pieces from eight local artists, presented by the Arts Council of New Westminster.

“This is another “first time” event for us and means that attendees will get an additional dose of Fraser River-based culture,” says Stephen. “We are also pleased to offer a selection of wines from Mt. Lehman Winery in the Fraser Valley and an assortment of First Nations appetizers from Salishan Catering during the evening.”

The Fraser River Discovery Centre’s RiverFest is Metro Vancouver’s biggest celebration of the environmental, economic and socio-cultural importance of the Fraser River.

But for Holly Mitton, death is a path in the journey of life – and one that people needn’t walk alone.

Mitton offers support, care, education, and advocacy for a wide spectrum of end-of-life needs in her role as a death doula.

article continues below

“In some ways it’s very much like a birth doula, who is there to support the mom and the family going through this huge transition of life. There’s a team there – nurses and doctors and midwife and family and friends,” she said. “And the doula works to support the family within that. I do something very similar but at the opposite end of life.”

Mitton came to this path almost by accident – though in retrospect she can see that as her interest and connection to this work grew, doors opened to help her along the way.

It began when she spent time with her grandfather during his final days, sitting with him and, later, attending at the funeral home – full of questions, she says, about what would happen to him there. These questions, and her curiosity, grew – and eventually led to a job there. Later, she completed autopsy training and a degree in forensic science, and worked in that field for many years.

But when a close family friend – a young mother with two children – died unexpectedly in a tragic accident, it became incredibly clear to her how valuable this work could be.

Her background in funeral homes allowed her to step in and assist on a level that many others wouldn’t have been able to. Later, when a friend mentioned the term “death doula” – something Mitton had never heard of – it all came together.

Nowadays, Mitton’s work can vary from working oneon- one with individuals with terminal conditions or in the active dying stage, to help advocate for them and organize wishes, to assisting families after a loved one has passed away.

She has found a particular connection to supporting families through perinatal, infant, and child loss.

“This is really one of the places my heart is,” she says. This can incude helping families with miscarriages – many of which may go otherwise unmarked though the parents themselves are grieving silently.

Education is also a huge component of her work.

“Many people don’t know what is required when someone passes, or even what their options are,” she said.

For example, she’s increasingly been involved in helping people create “hybrid funerals” in which a funeral home takes care of the legal end of things – paperwork and so on – but the family can have an event at home, even bringing their loved one there as well in accordance with local laws.

Sometimes her work is largely event planning, much like a wedding planner would book venues, chair rentals, organize food and flowers – particularly if a death is very unexpected and arranging details may be overwhelming for the family.

She also offers workshops and has plans for more unique events to help spread education and give people the opportunity to talk about death.

“Sometimes people don’t know how to start that conversation, and if I can give them some tools to feel comfortable to do so, that’s important,” she said.

Started in 1956 by a group of people in a church hall, the Memorial Society of B.C. now has in excess of 242,000 members around the province, making it the largest memorial society in North America.

""Because we have so many members,"" Nicole explains, ""I am able to negotiate lower costs with funeral service providers for our members. We only work with established funeral homes with a good reputation. Currently, we work with almost 30 funeral homes around B.C.""

The Memorial Society is a non-profit organization registered under the Societies Act of B.C. and is the only member-based, volunteer-driven memorial society in B.C.

""Everybody should be a member of the Society,"" Nicole says. ""Everybody alive will pass away at some point and for a $40 one-time membership fee, we can take the burden off your loved ones by referring them to a designated funeral service provider for the disposition of your remains and related issues.""

Upon joining the Society, members are asked to complete an arrangement form stating their wishes for their remains and detailing any pre-paid arrangements they may have.

""People need to have this conversation with their children,"" Nicole says, ""It's not a pleasant topic for most people and you don't need to dwell on it, but it's a conversation that must be had.""

She didn’t know much about the area, so she figured a place close to SkyTrain would be ideal.

Enter New Westminster.

article continues below

Nine years later, and Nakagawa and her partner are still living in the city. They’ve moved around a few times within its boundaries, but they could never bring themselves to leave, she said.

It makes sense.

Nakagawa has become entrenched in the community. She’s volunteered for the Elizabeth Fry Society, Lookout Emergency Aid Society, New Westminster Environmental Partners, Brow of the Hill Residents’ Association (she is currently its president), and more.

For her impressive number of accomplishments, Nakagawa was named the 2017 Citizen of the Year at the Platinum Awards held last week at Starlight Casino.

“It was really nice,” she told the Record.

“There were a few women there who I’d worked on projects with, and it felt really validating for their work as well – so it was a really nice moment.”

Speaking with Nakagawa, it’s obvious she finds joy in helping people pursue their passions.

The Record caught up with her this week to hear more about her volunteer experience, what’s left to do and where she’d like to see the city go from here.

What was your first volunteer experience in New Westminster?

One of the first things I volunteered for was the Elizabeth Fry Society. I volunteered in their drop-in centre for marginalized women, and then later I ended up working for them for three years.

From there, what was next?

Once I started working for EFry, I could no longer volunteer for them, obviously, so I did a community kitchen for three years for Lookout Emergency Aid. We used to do Christmas dinner and Thanksgiving dinner. … I just started going to things in New West and realizing that there’s a big group of people in New Westminster who are really involved and passionate about the community and obviously, since that time, I’ve found a change in the community – the number of events that go on, the number of things that are happening in the city has changed quite a bit since I first moved here.

What are some challenges? What keeps you going?

I think again it’s working with other people. It’s really exciting sharing your passions with other people and helping people work on things that they’re passionate about. I think the challenge is that there is so many good things going on that … there’s too much that I could say ‘yes’ to that I’d be very, very happy to be a part of, but (I’m) really trying to pick which will have the most impact or just (decide) where best to spend my time because there’s so many amazing things to be done here.

Are there any other challenges that stick out?

Something that I talk about a lot is diversity and diverse voices. I think that there are lots of people who are engaged in the city, I don’t necessarily know that that group of people reflects the entire city, and I would love to be able to work with more diverse community members whose issues aren’t normally represented. …

OK, so how do you get these people out if they’re not out already?

I think there’s work to be done on lots of different levels, like the city, as an organization, and other local organizations. Just trying to continuously talk about it and (trying to welcome) people. I think things like when I hold events, having child care at them is always really important to me because if people are busy and working, and (if) they’re having to pay for child care to come out to a community meeting, (that) isn’t realistic for a lot of people. And … how we host events. If you have to push your way to the front to speak, to say something, to make a point, to share, a lot of people aren’t going to be willing to do that – that’s hard for me to do – so I think maybe just trying to rethink how we behave in the public space.

What kinds of supports would you like to see from the city? Recently, at council, there was a lot of discussion about diversity on committees. What role do you think the city should be playing in that?

I think the city first needs to acknowledge that often what they do doesn’t reflect certain aspects of the community, and also acknowledge that they might not know because they don’t ask the question. On things like the official community plan, they asked how many renters were there, and we saw quite drastically that there was not very many renters participating. So knowing that that is true is the first step to addressing the problem, and I think being creative in outreach and also finding partners and community leaders is the key to reaching out to the communities.

You are the constituency assistant for New Westminster MLA Judy Darcy. How does your job work with your volunteer life?

It goes really nicely because my job is a lot of listening, and I hear from a lot of members of the community about how things impact them. So I really have a good ear to the ground for that. It makes me even more involved that my job is working for the people of New Westminster. … I think it really just amplifies it.

When you moved here nine years ago, is this where you saw your life going?

No. No, I don’t know. I’d just graduated with my undergraduate degree, and I wasn’t sure. I think that this sense of community that I feel right now is really something that I didn’t expect to feel here. So no, I wasn’t sure, but it feels pretty good right now.

What’s next for you? I really want to know.

That’s what everyone wants to know.

Well, you’re part of so many projects and some of them are big – the truth and reconciliation stuff, it’s a lofty thing.

I think I want to continue to see how that evolves in the city, and I think, again, I want to work on representation issues in the city and the community at-large. I think moving away from some committees to more projects-based work is where I see myself focusing.

Any projects lined up right now that you’re excited about?

I’m very passionate about women’s leadership and diverse leadership. So there’s something that’s been sort of buzzing around about doing something about that maybe in the new year, but I don’t know exactly what that’ll look like just yet.

You talk about leadership, for women especially. Is there ever a chance that you’d consider running for city council?

I would never say ‘no,’ but … I think the end goal can’t just be myself or just one person elected. I think there’s a lot of structural change that I would want to focus on.

When you say structural change, what do you mean?

I think the system makes it very, very difficult for diverse voices to come forward; for women’s voices to come forward. I’ve talked to a lot of women at different levels of politics about some of the difficulties they face before and after they’ve been elected, and I think that there’s some really concrete things that we could work on together about that. Even things like offering child care at council meetings or school board meetings I think would be a really concrete thing that might make it easier for people to become involved.

Do you ever foresee there being a moment when you’ve done so many things that you’re going to just going to say “this is enough”?

No. I don’t think so because there’s people always asking or talking about what they’re excited about that I’m also excited about. So I don’t think so.

You talked a lot about getting other people involved. If you could say one thing to people considering getting involved, what would you say?

I would say that your voice is needed and you’re valued, and come with me. I will try and introduce you to people or try and make space for you and ensure others recognize that as well.",[]

United,[],,"LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. — It didn't seem possible the MLS is Back Tournament could start any worse for Toronto FC after its first match was postponed twice due to COVID-19 concerns.

But a late collapse, with 10-man D.C. United scoring the tying goal in stoppage time, proved different as Toronto had to settle for an unsatisfying 2-2 tie when the teams finally took the field Monday morning at ESPN's Wide World of Sports Complex.

article continues below

""We're angry with ourselves, we're frustrated,"" sad Toronto captain Michael Bradley. ""For a team that wants to be as good as we do and for a team that holds ourselves to the standards that we do, there's no way that you should let a team like that back in the game today.""

""We were in position to win the game, we should have won the game and we collapsed,"" echoed Toronto coach Greg Vanney.

Ayo Akinola, in a rare start, scored twice in the first half to give Toronto a 2-0 lead.

D.C. United played the second half down a man after midfielder Junior Moreno received a second yellow for going through the back of Marky Delgado in first-half stoppage time.

Toronto used its man advantage in the second half, stroking the ball around the field, and seemed cruising to a commanding win until the bottom fell out.

It started in the 84th minute when D.C. United scored against the run of play.

Substitute Federico Higuain, in his D.C. United debut after knee surgery and a decorated career in Columbus, cooly chipped the ball over Quentin Westberg after the heart of a reshuffled Toronto defence was sliced open by a pass from Brazil's Felipe.

Defender Frederic Brillant completed the comeback in the 91st minute, heading in the tying goal from a Felipe free kick.

Akinola came close to restoring the Toronto lead in the 96th minute but Bill Hamid got a hand to his header.

""Overall, just in general, a gutsy performance from what I think is a mentally tough group,"" said D.C. coach Ben Olsen. ""It has not been an easy 10, 11 days since we got here. A lot of moving parts, a lot of cancellations and games being moved. So to get something out of that game, I think, says a lot about our group.

""Yes we can get better. But this is a marathon and the trick at these tournaments is to keep pushing and getting better throughout the tournament.""

Vanney shuffled three-quarters of his backline in the second half, changes he said were due to physical issues he did not want to exacerbate in the Florida heat and humidity.

Fullback Justin Morrow came off at halftime after experiencing some Achilles tendinitis. Centre backs Omar Gonzalez and Chris Mavinga were replaced in the 64th minute after both started cramping.

Replacement centre backs Eriq Zavalata and Laurent Ciman were victimized on both goals.

On the first, D.C. could have driven a fleet of Mack trucks down the centre of the pitch without hitting anything after a Ciman giveaway at midfield triggered the counter-attack.

Substitute Richie Laryea then gave away an unnecessary free kick just inside the Toronto half that led to the tying goal. Steven Birnbaum rose high to beat Zavaleta, who protested he had been fouled, and sent the ball to Brillant, who got between Bradley and Ciman to head the ball home.

Toronto outshot D.C. United 18-8 (7-5 in shots on target) and had 66.4 per cent possession — helped by its second-half numerical advantage.

There was some bad blood after the final whistle of a game that saw some ugly tackles. Bradley said some of it seemed to come from D.C. players blaming them for the match postponements.

The two teams were originally scheduled to meet Friday night but that was pushed back to Sunday due to Toronto's late arrival (July 6), caused by the need for additional COVID-19 testing after a member of the travelling part reported symptoms.

Sunday's game was called off minutes before the 9 a.m. ET kickoff in the wake of a positive test for a D.C. United player and an inconclusive test for a Toronto player.

All other players tested negative in a round of new testing. The two players in question, neither of which were identified by their clubs, were isolated pending receipt of a second negative test.

The tournament, which marks the league's first action since it shut down March 12 due to the global pandemic, has already lost FC Dallas and Nashville SC due to a rash of positive COVID-19 tests.

The game finally kicked off at 9:08 a.m. in 28 C heat. Both teams arrived wearing masks and Black Lives Matter T-shirts, taking a knee before kickoff.

There was no evidence of rust as Toronto pressed D.C. and attacked on multiple fronts despite the absence of star striker Jozy Altidore.

Akinola scored in the 12th minute, beating one defender and then splitting two more before hammering in a right-footed shot from the edge of the box. The goal came after Hamid's goal kick went straight to Bradley in the D.C. end, with an Alejandro Pozuelo pass eventually finding Akinola.

The 20-year-old scored again in the 44th minute after Pozuelo beat Brillant to the ball following an 11-pass Toronto sequence. Pozuelo floated the ball to the far post where an unmarked Akinola tapped it in.

Akinola came into the match with one goal in 12 career MLS appearances (including two starts) spread over three seasons. It was his first MLS game action since June 29, 2019 — and first start since May 8, 2019.

Westberg made a remarkable one-handed save to stop Ola Kamara's header from point-blank range in first-half stoppage time.

On the plus side, Argentine newcomer Pablo Piatti looked sharp in his Toronto debut, showing a good rapport with Pozuelo and Brazil's Auro on the right flank. Akinola also made the most of his opportunity.

And Bradley, in his first outing since injuring his ankle in the Nov. 10 MLS Cup final, was a force in midfield.

""I thought he was fantastic,"" said Vanney.

Toronto has not lost a regular-season game since Aug. 3, 2019, when it was beaten 2-0 by the New York Red Bulls. Vanney's team has gone 5-0-8 since.

Toronto's next Group C game is Thursday against the Montreal Impact, who lost their opener 1-0 to the New England Revolution last Thursday.

The three group games count in the regular-season standings with Toronto now at 1-0-2 and D.C. United at 1-1-1.

Altidore did not make the matchday 23. He was late joining the team after spending the lockdown at his Florida home and had to train on his own while fulfilling quarantine.

Canadian midfielder Jonathan Osorio didn't dress due to a quad strain.

Vanney said Altidore could get some minutes against Montreal with the third game targeted for Osorio.

Toronto knocked D.C. United out of the playoffs the last time they met, scoring four goals in extra time in a 5-1 first-round win in October.

“Advance fee loans, the second riskiest scam in Canada for 2019, continues to wreak havoc for B.C. residents in a financial bind because of the pandemic,” according to the BBB, which is warning consumers, who may be urgently trying to acquire funds, to be on “high alert” to avoid losing money and exposing their personal information.

article continues below

The BBB says that the reports its received from victims across the province show consumers are extremely susceptible to the scam.

As part of the scam, the BBB says consumers may receive an email or phone call, or – as in the case of more recent reports to the bureau’s Scam Tracker – a pop-up ad online or find a website while searching for a loan company.

In this con, scammers disguised as loan brokers and other lending institutions advertise and promise loans to those in a financial bind. The loan, which is guaranteed regardless of credit history, comes with upfront charges labelled as “taxes,” “insurance” or “processing fees.”

However, when the charges are paid, the loan never materializes and the applicant is left with larger debts. The BBB says that requiring advance fees for loans is illegal in Canada

“Typically, the scammers will ask you to pay a fee for a seemingly legitimate reason,” said Karla Laird, the BBB’s manager for community and public relations.

“Oftentimes, they require that payment to be made by wire transfer, bitcoin or some other hard-to-recover method. However, once the fee is paid, the phony loan company stops communication and the consumer cannot get a refund.”

Vancouver man loses nearly $1,500

In one instance of the scam, which was reported to the BBB, a Vancouver resident lost nearly $1,500 to a company he found online with an Ontario address on its website.

The company told the Vancouver man his loan was approved for $10,000 at the rate of seven per cent for four years, however, the company needed a three-month advance payment in order to release the funds – a total of $718.

The company also told the man that his credit is high risk, so he would need to pay $1,500 insurance for the lender, although the company would cover half. The company wanted the Vancouver man to send the money using Bitcoin.

The company, Kingsway Lending, according to the BBB, is using the address of a Canada Revenue Agency office in Ontario.

“Scammers understand that consumers are searching for websites that look professional, and will put effort into making your loan application process feel like the real deal,” said Laird.

“With this in mind, thorough research on a company before initiating any transactions, is the best way to avoid being tricked out of your money and personal information.”

What to look out for

The BBB says consumers should look out for the following red flags is they are searching for a lender or loan broker:

The health authority added the outbreak of C. difficile to its list of current outbreaks on July 14.

According to Health Canada, Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is a bacterium that causes mild to severe diarrhea and intestinal conditions like pseudomembranous colitis (inflammation of the colon). C. difficile is the most frequent cause of infectious diarrhea in hospitals and long-term care facilities in Canada, as well as in other industrialized countries.

C. difficile bacteria and their spores are found in feces. People can get infected if they touch surfaces contaminated with feces, and then touch their mouth. Healthcare workers can spread the bacteria to their patients if their hands are contaminated.

Symptoms include watery diarrhea, fever, loss of appetite, nausea, and abdominal pain/tenderness.

For healthy people, C. difficile does not pose a health risk. The elderly and those with other illnesses or who are taking antibiotics, are at a greater risk of infection.

Fraser Health asks all visitors to use our hand hygiene stations when they enter and exit its facilities, particularly if there is a reported outbreak.

If you have any of the following, please do not visit at this time:

Vomiting or diarrhea

Cough or flu-like symptoms

Fever

Rash

If you are visiting someone who is located on an outbreak unit, visitors may be limited to two people at a time. Fraser Health asks that you do not visit other patient rooms or common areas on the unit such as the lounge and patient kitchenette. It also recommends you don’t visit public areas in the hospital such as the cafeteria and gift shop.",[]

Dr. Michael Schwandt, who was one of the first infectious disease specialists from Vancouver Coastal Health to help contain outbreaks at sites like the Lynn Valley Care Centre, made the comments not long after a group of 239 scientists from 32 countries wrote an open letter to the World Health Organization, successfully appealing for the world health body to change its guidance on aerosolized transmission.

“We'll be watching closely the science around airborne transmission. At this time, we don't think it's played a major role in the outbreaks in Vancouver Coastal Health that we've had direct experience with,” said Dr. Schwandt.

The new W.H.O. guidance, which came last Thursday, accepts that the novel coronavirus can spread through aerosolized particles — tiny droplets in the air — in crowded indoor settings for prolonged periods of time.

“There have been reported outbreaks of COVID-19 in some closed settings, such as restaurants, nightclubs, places of worship or places of work where people may be shouting, talking, or singing.

“In these outbreaks, aerosol transmission, particularly in these indoor locations where there are crowded and inadequately ventilated spaces where infected persons spend long periods of time with others, cannot be ruled out,” reads the W.H.O.’s new guidance, which also calls for more research into aerosol transmission. aerosol transmission.

But Dr. Schwandt said his team doesn’t view the airborne versus droplet transmission debate as a binary, and that while the virus can be traced at varying distances at concentrations, most of the cases he’s come across in Vancouver Coastal Health region, home to the first outbreaks in the country, have been from “face-to-face” transmission.

The proof, he said, comes from Vancouver Coastal’s success in tracing contacts based on direct contact, an experience a spokesperson for Fraser Health told the Tri-City News has been echoed in their health authority.

“Without taking airborne transmission into account as a risk factor, we've been able to bring outbreaks under good control, really looking at close physical contact as the main risk factor,” said Dr. Schwandt.

That means, at the moment, current ventilation systems in places like long-term care homes are not considered a risk factor in the spread of the virus.

Airborne or not, sharing air in large, indoor public gatherings raises everyone’s risk of transmitting the virus, as Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry reminded British Columbians in her daily update Tuesday.

“Stay away from closed spaces as much as possible,” she said. “If it’s a house party, you may not know all the people who are there.”

And like the W.H.O., health officials in B.C. said they are keeping an eye on the science.

“If more evidence were to develop around airborne or aerosol transmission, then naturally we'd need to look at preventative measures that include attention to ventilation,” said Dr. Schwandt.",[]

Provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix announced July 15 that there were 21 new cases in the past 24 hours, including two cases that they call ""epi-linked,"" or presumed cases that have not been proven through testing but are being treated as official cases.

The province has now recorded 3,149 cases since the novel coronavirus first appeared in B.C. in late January.

More than 87.4% of those infected, or 2,753 people, have recovered. Of those who haven't, 189 people have died and 207 people are actively fighting the virus. Only 14 people are hospitalized, with five of those in intensive care units. The rest are self-isolating at home. There were no new deaths recorded in the past 24 hours.

Recording at least 20 new COVID-19 cases in a 24-hour period has become common in B.C., and Henry said yesterday that she found that number ""distressing,"" even though, she added, the good news is that the province knows where the clusters of infection are, many of the infections are linked and the number is not really that large given the province's population of more than five million residents.

The numbers in the past week were:

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12;

• 21 new cases on July 13;

• 13 new cases on July 14; and now

• 21 new cases on July 15.

In June, the number of daily new cases many times was in the single digits.

""There is one active community outbreak, in addition to several community exposure events,"" Henry and Dix said. ""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks.""

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,023 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,659 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 216 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

The Federal Bureau of Prisons is expected to take Sidoo into custody on September 23 and release him from a Pacific Northwest area facility just before Christmas.

article continues below

Sidoo, 61, appeared online via Zoom in front of United States District Judge Nathaniel Gorton of the United States District Court for District of Massachusetts, as well as his lawyers and prosecutors. He wore a plaid suit while sitting in an office space inside his $31.7 million home in Vancouver’s Point Grey neighbourhood.

Sidoo, now a convicted felon, initially pled innocent to fraud and money laundering charges; he teared up before being sentenced and read a prepared statement:

“The last several months have been the hardest in my entire life and today I accept the court’s decision without reservation. No words can express how sorry I am for my decisions and actions that led to this day. I make no excuses, your honour. I broke the law and pled guilty and I now must pay for my actions.

“To my wife and boys, all I ever wanted was your love and respect and to be a good role model. And I know I have made a terrible mistake that has deeply affected our family. To my friends and colleagues and former teammates over the years, I am deeply ashamed today. To the young men and women who looked up to me as a role model, you deserve better. To the court and all of you, I wish to apologize for my actions.

“I will serve my sentence and am committed to returning to the community and doing everything possible to make a positive impact. I hope in time people will not judge me for the worst mistake in my life but for the work in the days, weeks and years ahead in which I am committed to being a better man.”

Gorton told Sidoo he was “impressed” by the businessman’s “obvious remorse.”

But Gorton pointed out two omissions in Sidoo’s statement.

“You expect to put this behind you and go forward and make up for what you called mistakes. I would call it a crime, not a mistake, but nevertheless, it is important that you acknowledge it and realize how many constituencies you have disappointed,” said the judge.

Sidoo also did not explicitly acknowledge that his crimes resulted in two students missing an opportunity to attend the universities his sons, Dylan Sidoo and Jordan Sidoo, were admitted to.

“What you accomplished, along with getting them into college, is to deprive two other deserving students of admittance into those universities — an act that is the very antithesis of one you want to be known for,” said Gorton.

Likewise, United States Attorney Andrew Lelling submitted to Gorton: “Sidoo engaged in serious criminal conduct involving fraud and deception that stretched over multiple years.

“His crimes warrant significant punishment. By engaging in the scheme, with [scheme mastermind Rick Singer] and others, Sidoo was able to steal two college admissions slots for his sons, including one from the University of California at Berkeley, one of the top public universities in the nation.”

Sidoo, said Gorton, “committed a crime that displayed an unbelievable lack of integrity, morality and common sense.

“You have let your selfish desire, your pride and your enormous wealth overcome all of what you apparently want to stand for with your works of charity,” Gorton told Sidoo.

Sidoo’s philanthropy, derived from his earnings in the capital markets, was central to his sentencing defense. According to Sidoo he has donated several million dollars to charitable causes, such as the University of B.C. football program.

In pleading guilty to fraud, Sidoo avoided a maximum prison term of 20 years and prosecutors subsequently agreed to 90 days behind bars, plus a $250,000 fine and one-year of supervised release, which will not be enforced in Canada by the U.S. Probation Department. Prosecutors also agreed to drop the money laundering charge.

The prison Sidoo goes to is expected to have harsher conditions since his options are limited due to his foreign citizenship. His attorney Martin Weinberg said he is expected to spend 14 days in isolation in a “maximum security setting,” due to COVID-19.

Sidoo will get four days credit for time already served. If he serves the full 90 days he will be released December 17 but will have to spend 14 days in isolation at home should B.C. public health rules for international travellers and COVID-19 continue into the fall.

Gorton said Sidoo’s crime would normally warrant more time in jail but there are mitigating circumstances, such as his remorse, lack of criminal record, philanthropy and “collateral consequences,” such as not being able to enter the U.S. as a felon and being stripped last month of his Order of B.C. medal for community service. Sidoo’s attorneys also previously noted he did not directly pay the universities but that his fraud was limited to cheating on the tests.

The former B.C. Lions football player worked as a stock broker in the 1990s and an investment banker between 2000 and 2010. Since 2010 he has made millions of dollars directing a handful of public companies that have failed to generate wealth for retail investors.

Sidoo was arrested March 8, 2019, in San Jose, California, on charges by the U.S. Department of Justice of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering related to the high-profile U.S. college admissions and bribery scandal, brought to light by a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe dubbed Operation Varsity Blues.

One of dozens of parents to be charged, Sidoo initially pled innocent to paying $200,000 total to scheme mastermind William ‘Rick’ Singer, who hired corrupt exam expert Mark Riddell to take Dylan and Jordan’s SAT exams, in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Sidoo also helped falsify one of his son Jordan’s university applications in October 2013 with an essay that originally included a fake claim of Jordan being held up at gunpoint by gangsters, while he was purported to be an intern for an anti-gang organization.

Co-conspirators Singer and Riddell pled guilty last year in exchange for cooperating with the government’s investigation.

The guilty parties in the case, who used Singer’s criminal services, were generally well-off individuals. Celebrities such as actress Lori Loughlin and her clothing designer husband Mossimo Gianulli and actress Felicity Huffman also pled guilty for related crimes and brought much media attention to the investigation.

Sidoo’s sons had no involvement in their father’s crime.

Jordan is now a 2018 history graduate from University of California Berkeley. Dylan graduated in cinematic arts in 2016 from the University of Southern California (USC). The two previously attended Vancouver’s prestigious St. George’s School.

Neither university has announced whether or not their degrees will remain valid. Dylan, according to the sentencing documents, had scored a 1,460/2,400 SAT score until Riddell, using a fake ID in December 2011, bumped up the score to 1,700, which was high enough for Dylan to enter Chapman University (and later transfer to USC). Riddell then scored 2,280/2,400 for Jordan in December 2012, paving the way to Berkley.

Riddell also took a high school test for Dylan. The B.C. Ministry of Education has issued no statement on how its testing process was so vulnerable to fraud.

Both sons have since entered into penny stock promotion with their father.

In one cluster, at least 17 cases have been traced to a group of people who met up in Kelowna, some from the Interior and Alberta, others from the Lower Mainland.

article continues below

“There are a number of people who have been exposed in those events,” said Henry Tuesday.

More troubling still is the emergence of new cases at the Krazy Cherry Fruit Company in Oliver, where two have been identified among migrant workers. They were among 62 cases identified in B.C. between Friday and Monday.

“Public health teams are monitoring the situation closely and have placed restrictions on those living and working on the farm to limit the potential for further transmission,” said Dr. Henry in a written statement today.

But others have expressed concerns that not enough is being done to prevent outbreaks among vulnerable groups. Where newly arrived immigrants were disproportionately affected at earlier outbreaks at poultry plants in Coquitlam, others say migrant agricultural workers still run higher risks due to inadequate housing.

“As anticipated,” said Byron Cruz of Sanctuary Health, an organization that works to protect migrant workers from predatory practices. “We knew that something was going to happen because the situation for housing in that farm is terrible. They were all crowded.”

‘WAY ABOVE MY COMFORT ZONE’

Yesterday, Dr. Henry warned 25 cases a day was “distressing” and “cautionary to us.” And while not unexpected due to the increased travel and social interaction of phase 3, she said “That’s way above my comfort zone.”

Dr. Henry urged anyone who attended Canada Day parties in the vicinity of the Kelowna cluster to self-monitor for even the mildest of symptoms, noting that anyone can be tested should they feel they’ve been exposed.

Just how quickly a province or state can backslide has been painted in stark relief among our neighbours to the south.

In comments to the press Tuesday, Health Minister Adrian Dix pointed to surges in several U.S. states where record breaking daily caseloads in several states have led jurisdictions like California to re-introduce physical distancing protocols, in what Dix described as “lockdown 2.0.”

“All our neighbouring jurisdictions continue to see an increase, whether it’s our neighbouring province to the east, Alberta, or others, Washington, Oregon and California, in Nevada, Arizona and in other American states — we’ve seen record days of new cases of COVID-19 recently,” said Dix.

Here in B.C., Henry said that on Monday, she checked how weekly caseloads are tracking with the province’s modelling that suggests British Columbians keep their social contacts to 65% of normal.

“We are still skirting that line. The RT, the reproductive number, is hovering around one… which is sort of pushing the limits of where we need to be,” she said.

While health officials work to contain the outbreak in Oliver, it’s unclear how a potential surge in cases will affect that calculation, and Byron Cruz of Sanctuary Health said he expects more cases to crop up in coming days due to their tight living quarters.

What is clear is the more cases are contained to a single cluster, the easier they are to track.

“This is going to be our dance over the next few months, where we do what we can do, we travel, we have those social interactions, but we do it in a thoughtful way so we do it with the people we know we’re with,” said Dr. Henry.",[]

The man and woman, who have asked not to be identified, were taken in by what appeared to be a call from their grandson in dire need of help.

article continues below

“The guy sounded so much like our grandson. If he had said ‘Grandma,’ we’d have known [it wasn’t him] right away, but he said ‘Nan’ and so does my grandson,” said the man.

The imposter grandson, who used their grandson’s name, called on Monday and told them he had been driving a friend’s car and struck a vehicle with Quebec licence plates that had turned sharply in front of him.

The fake grandson went on to say he had been taken to jail, but a judge would free him if he could pay for the damage, estimated to be $5,000. The grandparents were told to send money to the car’s owner in Montreal.

“I wasn’t cluing in at all [that this was a scam], he sounded so much like our grandson,” the man said.

The dutiful grandparents then took cash from their bank and went to the Bank of Montreal and using an account number the scammer had provided via an accomplice posing as a lawyer, they sent money to a BMO branch in downtown Montreal.

“The kid said, ‘Please don’t tell Dad,’ ” the man said. It wasn’t until he later talked to his grandson that it became clear they had been scammed.

The couple has since been in touch with police and the Bank of Montreal, which they say has been very helpful.

“They are doing their best to try and get the money back,” said the man, who thinks the scammers “took a shot in the dark and got lucky.”

But according to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre, it’s likely the scammers mined information like the grandson’s name from social media to make the pitch more convincing.

The centre calls these types of scams “the emergency scam.” It preys on the fear of a loved one being hurt or in trouble. The scammer claims to be someone you know and says they need money immediately. They tend to use scenarios like needing bail money because they’ve been arrested, or being in a car accident, or having trouble returning from a foreign country.

The targets are often seniors and the scammer pretends to be a grandchild, who begs them not to tell their parents that they’re in trouble, the Anti-Fraud Centre said. As a result, the grandparent doesn’t find out until after they’ve sent the money that their grandchild was not the person who asked for help.

Const. Cam MacIntyre said scammers will go to any lengths to defraud a victim.

“They will pose as a family member, a trusted member of the public, or even the police. We strongly recommend that people never deposit money into accounts of people or entities they do know personally,” he said.

“It’s so important to verify where your money is going. Call a family member, a friend, or the police if you are suspicious.”

The Anti-Fraud Centre says there were 18,803 reports of fraud, and 6,671 victims reporting losses of $22.6 million in Canada in the first four months of this year.

MacIntyre suggests if you are in the process of providing financial information or sending money to potential fraudsters, stop immediately.

“Contact your financial institutions and ensure all payments that you have not authorized are stopped. Inform them of the fraud and change both passwords and access information,” he said.

Suspected frauds can be reported to your local police or the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre at 1-888-495-8501.

On the day Finance Minister Carol James announced a $12.5 billion deficit, the combined effect of an economic meltdown and $6.26 billion in supports to date, a polling company released details of a huge jump in approval ratings for how the B.C. government has stick-handled the pandemic.

article continues below

Meanwhile, the BC Liberals are weighing in with a hefty criticism of the government’s economic recovery plan, and trying to get their voices heard above the fray.

In a press release issued today Wednesday, Liberal Leader Andrew Wilkinson stated that under the BC NDP-government’s watch, the province has amassed the largest deficit in British Columbia’s modern history.

He contends that this year’s deficit has increased by 27.6%, or $2,643 for every British Columbian, while household incomes are estimated to fall by approximately 3.9% in 2020.

James, however, maintains that B.C.’s safe restart plan is “creating signs of hope for our economy as consumer confidence increases.”

Wilkinsons argues the economic recovery plan is lacking because “there will be no change in the government spending priorities” and the strategy is “simply unsustainable.”

Source: Insights West Graphic

Still, the Insights West poll suggests the government has got a lot of wriggle room in its appeal to British Columbians, noting that the BC NDP has approved its rating during the pandemic, with Premier Horgan himself ratcheting up his approval rating by 17% to 68%, “a higher level higher than for any political leader in B.C. since tracking began 8 years ago.”

Meanwhile, Insights West said its online poll — which ran from June 24-28 among 830 B.C. residents — shows opposition parties are having a difficult time catching the attention of B.C. voters.

The poll found Wilkinson’s approval rating has dropped five points since November to 30%. Interim Green leader Adam Olsen has made his debut at a 29% approval rating — the lowest of any Green leader since the 2017 election, and 44% of B.C. residents don’t know enough about him to provide a rating. Trevor Bolin from the BC Conservative Party, meanwhile, has an 18% approval rating, but similarly, 49% of British Columbians didn’t know enough about him to provide a rating.

Insights Wests notes that approval of the government’s response to the pandemic has improved its ratings overall.

For example, 85% think it has done a good job on combating COVID-19, 84% for providing info about the pandemic, 79% for phase 2 and phase 3 re-opening of the economy, and 69% for the financial support for people impacted from COVID-19.

However, a closer reading shows a dip in areas where B.C. residents are “typically more negative than positive towards the BC NDP’s handling of certain issues, such as housing and affordability, down nine points, and homelessness down 13%.",[]

• 18 new cases on July 8;

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12; and

• 21 new cases on July 13.

""I know it was distressing to me to see 20, especially 25 [new cases] one day,"" Henry said. ""That's way above my comfort zone.""

She added, however, that the slight rise in cases was not unexpected, given that the province has been allowing restaurants and other indoor businesses to reopen.

""We do know where those cases are,"" she said. ""We're testing the people who need to be tested.""

It would be more concerning, she said, if the cases were spread out across the province in an unlinked way. The most recent cluster of cases is linked to the Krazy Cherry Fruit Company in Oliver, she announced yesterday (July 13).

Given B.C.'s population, 20 cases in one day is also better than some other jurisdictions, she said.

The province has identified 3,128 infections since the virus first appeared in the province in late January.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,015 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1649 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 212 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 52 people who reside outside Canada.

Of the 209 people currently fighting COVID-19 in B.C., 14 people are in hospital with five of those in intensive care units. That leaves 2,730 people who have recovered from the virus.

No new deaths from the virus were identified in the past 24 hours, leaving the death toll at 189 people.

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

So far 399 residents and 252 staff at seniors' care facilities have been infected by COVID-19 in B.C.

Health Minister Adrian Dix said that it is his understanding that the federal government and the U.S. government have agreed to extend the closure of the two countries' border for one additional month, until August 21.

""This is obviously positive and necessary news,"" he said. ""Everybody who lives in B.C. knows how inconvenient and how difficult that is for many businesses and many individuals for a variety of circumstances.""

Harry Bains said injured workers have complained for too long that the system lacks fairness and support in times of injury and recovery.

article continues below

Changes Bains proposes include raising the maximum annual salary on which compensation benefits are based; authorizing WorkSafeBC to provide preventative medical treatment before claim acceptance; giving powers to the court to issue WorkSafeBC search and seizure warrants appropriate for investigating workplace safety infractions; and giving people a voice in serious workplace prosecutions and trials by using victim impact statements.

Victoria is also fast-tracking legislation to handle situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic so workers can access benefits more easily.

During the pandemic, the regulator is allowing businesses to defer paying their premiums for six months without penalty or interest. It is also waiving premiums on wages paid to workers of employers receiving the Canadian Emergency Wage Subsidy.

The amendments to the Workers Compensation Act comes after three expert reviews were completed in 2018 and 2019.

The ministry said of the more than 44,000 injured workers currently receiving permanent disability benefits because of a work-related injury, about 35% are in the Lower Mainland, while the rest are spread throughout all regions of B.C.

There are more than 100,000 workplace injury or fatality claims annually.

In 2019, there were 140 workplace fatalities in B.C. Of that number, 84 were due to occupational disease, 40 to traumatic injury and 16 the result of a motor vehicle incident.

In a fiscal update Tuesday, B.C. Finance Minister Carole James said the COVID-19 pandemic will result in ""the worst downturn experienced in our province in recent history.""

article continues below

""The projected numbers are staggering, but they're not without hope,"" James said, in summing up B.C.'s fiscal position.

She said B.C. had entered the pandemic perhaps better situated than other provinces, as it had a balanced budget, a triple AAA credit rating and one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country.

B.C. also managed to contain the pandemic and flatten its growth curve better than some other provinces, and it has been able to move earlier on a phased economic restart plan.

""Because of that strength, we were able to take immediate action to help people, to help businesses, to help communities with our $5 billion COVID action plan,"" James said.

She said the province is expecting a loss of $4.2 billion in tax revenue, including $1 billion less in personal income tax revenue, $973 million less in corporate taxes, $1.3 billion in provincial sales tax revenue, $300 million in natural resource revenues and $882 million less in Crown Corporation income.

The province is also spending $5 billion in emergency spending, and has approved $1.3 billion in tax credits and deferrals. In total, the increased spending, lost tax revenue and foregone revenue will bring the deficit to $12.5 billion.

In February, James brought down, but never passed, a balanced budget and modest surplus of $227 million and provincial GDP growth projections of 2% in 2020.

""Mere weeks after the budget 2020 was tabled, our entire world changed,"" James said.

James said the B.C. economy is now expected to contract 6.8% in 2020, according to some forecasters.

Since February, B.C. lost 235,000 jobs, and saw retail sales declined by 23.6% in April compared to February. Overall, home prices dropped 4%.

Home sales declined 45.4% in May, compared to February, and B.C. merchandise exports are down 14.7% year-to-date, compared to January to May 2019.

""While the job losses in March and April were record-breaking, figures for May and June in fact have seen some recovery of the losses that we experienced in the previous two months,"" James said.

Asked if her government planned to resort to spending cuts to address the deficit, James said ""now is not the time to be able to cut back on services and support for people and business in British Columbia.""

As for any long-range plans for dealing with debt and deficits, James said: ""I do not believe that it's going to be a quick fix.""

Asked if the $5 billion that her government has already approved could be added to later this year, James said ""I believe the $5 billion is enough now.""

However, she added no one can predict what might happen should there be a second wave of COVID-19.

As for the $22 billion in capital spending allocated in the 2020 budget over three years for big capital works projects, like new schools, hospitals, bridges and roads, that will continue to be spent.

""This is going to serve us very well because it translates into huge investments,"" James said.

That’s the news released today by the B.C. government, which claims the move will allow help with the cannabis retail industry's need for more security-screened workers, as well as reducing costs to cannabis workers and reducing interruptions from having to go through criminal record checks.

article continues below

The government claims the move will also “allow provincial security screening resources to focus on the qualification of new workers rather than the requalification of current workers who are already working in the legal cannabis retail industry.”

Security screening and re-screening requirements were implemented as a measure to keep organized crime out of the legal, non-medical cannabis market.

Screenings involve background checks with police, courts and corrections databases. To date, 4,300 workers have been screened.

All workers with a current valid security screening will have their security verification period extended from the date of their initial verification. Security verifications for all new workers will be valid for five years.",[]

A month after the BC Junior A Lacrosse League was supposed to begin playing, the league officially cancelled its 2020 season.

The Minto Cup, along with all other minor and senior national championships, has also been cancelled by the Canadian Lacrosse Association.

In a release, BCJALL president Karl Christiansen said ongoing restrictions in British Columbia limiting the size of public gatherings during the COVID-19 pandemic to no more than 50 people made it impossible for games to be played.

“We had hope we might be able to compete this year,” he said. “But it became evident we wouldn’t be able to have a normal season.”

Christiansen said alternative schedules were considered, but public health directives were insurmountable.

CLA president Shawn Williams said health and safety, travel concerns and venue closures were the main considerations in its decision to cancel all 2020 national championships from the Mann Cup senior men’s title to the U12 finals, as well as the U19 women’s field lacrosse championships.

“We recognize that national championships are important to lacrosse players of all ages,” he said, adding all hosts for 2020 events will be charged with staging their championships in 2021. That means the Minto and Mann Cups will both be played in Ontario.

She got her start in 2004, and then saw her business boom in the low market of 2008, because it offered so many deals for young buyers. This last year has seen a similar shift and provided an opportunity for Darcy and her team at ReThink to refocus on being the best in three key areas: service, presentation, and all things New Westminster.

article continues below

Darcy says her priority is always to do the best for the client no matter what the market is doing: working harder and giving more to help people seize unique opportunities, whether it’s to move to another city, to downsize or upsize, or to invest.

“All market dips are when the bravest and often richest people on the planet make their moves,” she said. “This is a time when you need a highly intelligent agent or team working for you. Someone who knows the numbers, how to present a home to a specific market, rental vacancy rates, trends and can offer inhouse staging like ReThink can.”

In practical terms that means the team has the capacity to take a listing from “zero to 100” in 48 hours, with in-house staging that allows them to work directly with a variety of tradespeople, gardeners, photographers, and more to create the best presentation for a sale.

“Challenging markets are just that – a challenge. Having happy clients who believe in their move in this market is a win,” she said. “There are no losses, just strong informed lateral moves, or gains when it’s a choice.”

For Darcy and her team, there’s no better place than New Westminster to be in business.

“We believe in the city, our heritage, our houses, our people, our community, our spirit and tradition – that’s what ReThink Real Estate Group is all about,” she said. “Highs or lows, this is still New West and we are a boom town regardless.”

No matter what comes, and no matter how the market or the city changes, there’s one constant that has always shaped Darcy’s approach: providing excellence in client care, on every level and helping each person through the process with whatever unique needs they have.

“You have to be ahead of what’s going on, where is the market going, what do people want and need,” she said. “That varies from year to year, from client to client, so it’s a constant re-evaluation. We’re always asking ourselves what else can we do, what can we do different, what can we do better? But no matter what, it’s always about the client. Always. This business is really about doing the right thing and helping however you can.”

Most of ReThink’s new clients come from word-of-mouth referrals, which is gratifying for Darcy and her team.

“There are lots of options in this industry and if someone recommends you, it’s because you did what you set out to do for them,” she said “I want my customers to feel total contentment about the work we did for them.”

Focusing on others is a philosophy that doesn’t just apply to customers, but to her team, her family and her community.

“At the end of the day, it’s about people. People come first, whether it’s your customers, your colleagues, your family, your neighbours. When you put people first, the rest falls into place.”

For the team at Budget Blinds New Westminster, the garden is in full bloom.

The local franchise, led by husband-and-wife owners Clay and Lacey Tierney, has expanded over the last year to include both Surrey and East Vancouver; their service area now includes those communities, their homebase here in the Royal City (along with Queensborough), as well as Maillardville and Richmond East.

article continues below

“This is an exciting opportunity for us to serve customers in these communities as well,” said Clay Tierney of the new expansion.

The company offers a spectrum of custom and creative window treatments, including shutters, blinds, draperies and shades, for both residential and business clients. The process begins by finding out exactly what the customer needs and wants, and matching up the right product and design for the space.

“We do free in-home consultations and help style homes with beautiful window coverings,” he explained.

“We do it all: from design, measuring to installation. Our consultations and quotes are free and our design consultants help customers choose the best products for their windows.”

Offering inhome visits is a crucial step in the process – not only is it more convenient for customers, it also makes it easier for people to envision the products in their home because they can look at samples in the space that they’ll be installed rather than in a showroom.

“It’s a great day when you can help customers achieve their vision of design and functionality,” he said, noting that they have worked on a huge diversity of homes with a variety of designs and styles.

While much of their work is focused on private residential projects, the team also offers many services for commercial and retail locations. And as time goes on, there’s an increasing demand for high-tech solutions using products that offer motorization and automation.

Either way, the company’s goal is to offer each customer the right product with top-notch service – and with a steady stream of referrals from prior clients, their efforts are paying off.

Tierney says word of mouth has been a critical piece of their success.

“We want to make fans out of our customers,” he said, noting that the best form of advertising is the reviews and referrals given by clients. “We are a small family-run business, and our long-term goal is to continue to grow the business by adding more well-trained, knowledgeable team members that want to service our customers in the same manner we already do now.”

For the Tierneys, the leap into small business ownership has been an exciting one, in a community they’re pleased to be a part of.

“This was a new adventure for us. We wanted to be our own bosses and to serve customers the way we believe they should be served,” he said. “New Westminster is like a small town in a big city with its diverse population. We love the small town feeling and the sense of community it offers.”

For many people, these are goals that sound wonderful – but all too often impossible. For an unemployed professional, who may be battling low confidence while struggling to find a job for the first time in their career, these goals can feel like a slap in the face.

article continues below

Winnie Furber of A.I.P. Services Inc. has experienced this first-hand.

“I’ve had clients come in very angry, determined that they don’t have enough experience or education. Some of these people have Masters degrees or PhDs. It’s ridiculous. What they need are the right tools to market themselves to an employer.”

That’s where Furber comes in, with a program that focuses on not just getting a job, but renewing her clients’ confidence and their excitement for the future. They may come in discouraged and uncertain, but they leave inspired and confident. Furber loves the transformation.

“I have the same amount of passion, excitement and commitment I had the first day I began my career,” she said. “I worked as an employment counsellor for over 10 years, and I believe there is a real need for this. When employers are travelling to other countries to seek out talent, and we have talent in our own backyard, I think there is a total disconnect. That’s why I started my own company, to address those gaps for professionals.”

Furber specializes in helping professionals from all backgrounds, including new immigrants, new university or college graduates, professionals returning to their career, and professionals who want to advance. They often have one thing in common: they are used to making a high income and being sought by employers, and are in uncharted waters searching for work.

Furber knows how her clients feel, because she’s been there. “I’ve walked in their shoes. I emigrated to a country where I didn’t know the language, didn’t have my credentials recognized, and didn’t have the right experience. When I came back to Canada, I had to start from scratch. Within a month I was working at the most prestigious employment agency in Vancouver.”

Often, she says, people have bad advice or old wisdom that simply won’t serve them to finding a new position, let alone work that is fulfilling. The process can be discouraging without guidance, and people don’t know where to start.

“People say the same things: I have no money, I can’t afford that, I have no time – instead of taking the time to think, breathe, reflect and dream of what they really want. Do not waste your time and money making less than you’re worth.”

Furber sees herself as a guide, with knowledge and expertise, to help people find their own way.

“Excellence means giving the right tools and strategies to ensure success in achieving their life and career goals,” she said. “I hold the client’s hand all the way through the program, but I expect accountability. People take 100% responsibility for their lives.”

Her workshops are based on the Azrin Method – learn, then do – and her clients leave the program with a full toolbox, including branded resumes and cover letters, networking scripts, and information about salary negotiations. However, it’s “doing” that makes all the difference, and brings back the confidence and excitement to take charge of their career.

Furber notes that she hosts regular orientations to give potential clients an overview of her program.

Luckily Sky Zone Trampoline Park in Surrey is just a few high bounces away.

The trampoline centre, which opened March 5, gives kids of all ages the chance to fly through the air, and to do so safely.

article continues below

“We have a very strict protocol,” says Morey Chaplick, owner of Sky Zone in Surrey.

Big kids are not allowed to jump with little kids, especially when it’s busy, he says. There are court monitors throughout the jump park, and there is always a manager on duty.

The Surrey trampoline park is the only Sky Zone in Western Canada. The company has been operating for 20 years and has 200 franchises worldwide.

Chaplick discovered Sky Zone when he lived in Toronto and took his son there, and was impressed by the safe, fun facility.

Now he’s opened his own park, filled with blue and orange trampolines as far as the eye can see.

But despite its size, the 30,000-square-foot facility has plenty of oversight from employees. The court monitors train for weeks at Sky Zone University, and managers are trained extensively in California, where the franchise is based.

With more than 10,000 people coming to Sky Zone since March, the worst injury they’ve had to handle was a rolled ankle, Chaplick says. His secret? Just follow the rules.

“Don’t try to do something beyond your capabilities,” Chaplick says. “Ask for help, and stay within limitations.”

Sky Zone in Surrey is at 11125-124th Street, a short drive from Burnaby.

The trampoline park is across the road from Scott Road SkyTrain station. The SkyTrain trip takes approximately 15 minutes from Metrotown to Scott Road station.

Since June 2017, the rent bank has been providing low-cost loans to residents who are at risk of eviction and/or at risk of having their utilities disconnected.

article continues below

“During the first three months of the pandemic (i.e. March 1 to May 31, 2020), the program issued 22 loans for a total of $27,462,” said a staff report to council. “If this pace of demand continues for the next nine months, this would result in 88 loans for a total of $109,848. This would be a dramatic increase when compared to the fiscal year (April 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020) in which the program issued 37 loans for a total of $40,775.”

The rent bank provides loans of up to $1,400 for individuals and up to $1,700 for families. The Lower Mainland Purpose Society operates the rent bank in New West.

On July 13, city council approved a staff recommendation to continue to fund the administrative costs of the New Westminster Rent Bank program. The city will contribute $35,000 annually for a three-year period from Sept. 1 to Aug. 31, 2023.

According to the report, the province has provided $48,400, with another $42,820 having been requested for the program. The city previously provided onetime funding of $100,000 to the rent bank in March to expand administrative and loan capacity in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“The program has a demonstrated need,” said the report. “It has been highly effective in preventing evictions and essential utility disconnections; it is one of the city’s tools in preventing homelessness; it has facilitated partnerships, including with the financial sector; and it has leveraged provincial funding,” said the report. “Regarding the latter, this was an objective of the program from its initiation.”

In 2015, New Westminster MLA Judy Darcy and her constituency office staff began working on the concept of creating a rent bank in New West by meeting with stakeholders and seeking financial contributions toward an endowment fund. After securing $35,000 in donations from a number of financial organizations, Darcy and her team received a commitment from city council in 2016 to support the program and to contribute $20,000 annually for three years (increased to $35,000 in December 2018) to cover administrative costs associated with operating a rent bank.

Police set up a roadblock in the 900 block of McBride Blvd. early Sunday morning. At around 1:50 a.m., as police were checking drivers for sobriety, a car in the line attempted a U-turn across the center median, said police.

“The driver mounted the car on the center median and attempted to drive away,” said a news release. “As officers ran to the vehicle, the driver attempted to dislodge the stuck vehicle from the median by hard acceleration to evade arrest.”

The driver was unsuccessful at fleeing in the vehicle before officers arrived and arrested the driver. Once in custody, the officers located a gun (pictured) on the back seat with ammunition.

“Policing is an unpredictable line of work, where the situation can rapidly change from a routine impaired driving CounterAttack to a possible dangerous and unpredictable encounter,” said Sgt. Jeff Scott. “Having public safety at the forefront of their minds, officers put themselves in harm’s way to help prevent a potentially more dangerous situation from occurring.”

The driver was arrested, and charges are being recommended to Crown counsel for dangerous driving, prohibited driving, breach of undertaking, breach of recognizance, and several possible firearms-related offences.",[]

Robert Billard, a lifelong musician, did just that by creating Fifth Chord Studios in uptown New Westminster.

The old clinic sat empty for many years. It’s positioned under a medical building and resides mainly under the landscaping and walkway in the 600 block of Fifth Avenue.

Billard said he realized the opportunity the space provided and undertook extensive renovations to turn the space into a sound-controlled rehearsal and recording studio.

“This isn’t just any music space,” said Billard. “We’ve worked to develop a space that is accessible, comfortable, and professional. While in the process of setting it up, we talked about who we want this space to support, and made a special commitment to supporting Black, Indigenous and artists of colour.”

Fifth Chord Studios features five locked-off monthly-rent rehearsal spaces, a live recording space, control studio, and gathering area to relax and meet the other musicians post-pandemic.

A special feature of the space is that it is accessible for people in wheelchairs and with mobility limitations, including an accessible washroom and thoughtful considerations such as offering light dimmers and low-noise air flow for neuro-diverse musicians.

The walls currently feature visual art by local artists, including PJ Patten, Sherida Charles, and Iris Mes Low.

“We are working with Black and Indigenous musicians to determine what kinds of programs would support their work best and how we can support their art,” said Billard.

Following COVID-19 protocols, Fifth Chord Studios is available for viewing by appointment only. Musicians interested in renting space can contact Robert Billard directly at 778 789-0621. You can visit the website here.",[]

The notion of establishing a framework to commercialize cannabis began as a promise by the Liberal Party in the 2015 federal election campaign that led to Justin Trudeau becoming prime minister. The implementation of the policy was not as smooth as first envisioned, and the provincial governments were put in charge of setting guidelines for the sale and consumption of marijuana.

article continues below

Research Co. and Glacier Media have been tracking perceptions about legalization every six months in British Columbia. Our latest survey shows that agreement with the new rules remains high across the entire province, that some residents are starting to ponder a future when other drugs could be treated in the same fashion as cannabis, and that – in stark contrast with what we found last year – marijuana users in British Columbia are starting to acquire all of their product through licensed retailers.

As more time passes, British Columbians appear happier with the decision to end prohibition. Seven in 10 of the province’s residents (70%) agree with marijuana being legal in Canada, while 26% disagree and 3% are undecided.

These findings represent a seven-point increase since a similar survey conducted in October 2019, as legal cannabis approached its first anniversary. The groups that are more likely to voice satisfaction with the new status quo are men (75%), British Columbians aged 35 to 54 (76%) and residents of northern B.C. (80%).

In recent weeks, we have seen more talk about creating a safe supply for drugs that are currently available only through illegal means. The impact of these discussions has led to a shift in the views of British Columbians about legalizing all drugs. It must be completely acknowledged that sizable majorities of the province’s residents continue to oppose a move to place any controlled substance inside a store, but the proponents of this option have grown since late last year.

At least two-thirds of British Columbians are opposed to legalizing ecstasy (66%), powder cocaine (70%), heroin (72%), crack cocaine (73%), methamphetamine or “crystal meth” (74%) and fentanyl (75%).

Support for making some of these drugs available in a fashion that would conceivably meet the same guidelines that govern cannabis has risen over the past six months, to 25% for cocaine (up from 18%) and to 24% for heroin (up from 19%). While these are still low proportions, the fluctuation could signal the start of a trend.

Just 10% of British Columbians say they only consumed marijuana after it became legal. Identical proportions of residents tried it before October 2018 (45%) or have never consumed it in Canada (also 45%). The incidence of “legal-only” marijuana users is highest among residents aged 18 to 34 (18%) and those who live in southern B.C. (19%).

But perhaps the biggest surprise, and a source of satisfaction for policy makers, is the way in which cannabis is being sought by users. Just over half of British Columbians who have consumed marijuana since legalization (51%) say that all of their product was acquired at a licensed retailer. In October 2019, only 31% of cannabis consumers in the province were getting all of their product at a licensed retailer.

We still see 16% of British Columbians who say none of their marijuana has been bought at a licensed retailer – a proportion that climbs to 25% among those aged 55 and over. Two-thirds of cannabis consumers aged 35 to 54 (68%) are buying all of their product at a licensed retailer.

Even though the delivery of cannabis products has improved over the past six months, there are significant regional differences that are indubitably related to the presence of stores in specific areas of the province. Cannabis consumers who reside in southern B.C. and Metro Vancouver are the most likely to be getting all of their product from licensed retailers (63% and 62%). The numbers are significantly lower in Vancouver Island (29%), northern B.C. (24%) and the Fraser Valley (19%).

Finally, the issue of “drug testing” remains a priority for British Columbians, with 61% saying that companies in the province should “definitely” or “probably” be able to administer these examinations to any employee now that marijuana is legal.

After a bumpy start that featured slow store openings and hitches with delivery options, there are signs that cannabis legalization is starting to work in a better fashion. More consumers are getting all of their product through licensed retailers, and the number of “new users” has not increased dramatically. Still, the significant regional disparities suggest that more marijuana outlets will need to be authorized in order to effectively eliminate the black market.

Results are based on an online study conducted from July 10 to July 12, 2020, among 800 adult British Columbians.

“Advance fee loans, the second riskiest scam in Canada for 2019, continues to wreak havoc for B.C. residents in a financial bind because of the pandemic,” according to the BBB, which is warning consumers, who may be urgently trying to acquire funds, to be on “high alert” to avoid losing money and exposing their personal information.

article continues below

The BBB says that the reports its received from victims across the province show consumers are extremely susceptible to the scam.

As part of the scam, the BBB says consumers may receive an email or phone call, or – as in the case of more recent reports to the bureau’s Scam Tracker – a pop-up ad online or find a website while searching for a loan company.

In this con, scammers disguised as loan brokers and other lending institutions advertise and promise loans to those in a financial bind. The loan, which is guaranteed regardless of credit history, comes with upfront charges labelled as “taxes,” “insurance” or “processing fees.”

However, when the charges are paid, the loan never materializes and the applicant is left with larger debts. The BBB says that requiring advance fees for loans is illegal in Canada

“Typically, the scammers will ask you to pay a fee for a seemingly legitimate reason,” said Karla Laird, the BBB’s manager for community and public relations.

“Oftentimes, they require that payment to be made by wire transfer, bitcoin or some other hard-to-recover method. However, once the fee is paid, the phony loan company stops communication and the consumer cannot get a refund.”

Vancouver man loses nearly $1,500

In one instance of the scam, which was reported to the BBB, a Vancouver resident lost nearly $1,500 to a company he found online with an Ontario address on its website.

The company told the Vancouver man his loan was approved for $10,000 at the rate of seven per cent for four years, however, the company needed a three-month advance payment in order to release the funds – a total of $718.

The company also told the man that his credit is high risk, so he would need to pay $1,500 insurance for the lender, although the company would cover half. The company wanted the Vancouver man to send the money using Bitcoin.

The company, Kingsway Lending, according to the BBB, is using the address of a Canada Revenue Agency office in Ontario.

“Scammers understand that consumers are searching for websites that look professional, and will put effort into making your loan application process feel like the real deal,” said Laird.

“With this in mind, thorough research on a company before initiating any transactions, is the best way to avoid being tricked out of your money and personal information.”

What to look out for

The BBB says consumers should look out for the following red flags is they are searching for a lender or loan broker:

According to Health Canada, Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is a bacterium that causes mild to severe diarrhea and intestinal conditions like pseudomembranous colitis (inflammation of the colon). C. difficile is the most frequent cause of infectious diarrhea in hospitals and long-term care facilities in Canada, as well as in other industrialized countries.

C. difficile bacteria and their spores are found in feces. People can get infected if they touch surfaces contaminated with feces, and then touch their mouth. Healthcare workers can spread the bacteria to their patients if their hands are contaminated.

Symptoms include watery diarrhea, fever, loss of appetite, nausea, and abdominal pain/tenderness.

For healthy people, C. difficile does not pose a health risk. The elderly and those with other illnesses or who are taking antibiotics, are at a greater risk of infection.

Fraser Health asks all visitors to use our hand hygiene stations when they enter and exit its facilities, particularly if there is a reported outbreak.

If you have any of the following, please do not visit at this time:

Vomiting or diarrhea

Cough or flu-like symptoms

Fever

Prejudice is indeed pandemic. Bigotry is a virus. And we all have the potential to be hosts (even those of us from racialized minorities).

We’re not born with it in our blood. It’s transmitted from person to person. From family to family. It’s learned through conversations, comments, jokes, judgements, looks, books, micro-aggressions, political rhetoric, insults, attitudes, ignorance, and even classroom lesson plans.

It infects entire institutions to the point where everyone within the organization becomes immune to biased hiring practices, offensive language, token diversity, racial and religious profiling, and exclusive, patriarchal power structures.

And like COVID-19, it won’t just go away on its own. We have to track it and attack it. We have to trace it, isolate it, and call it out. By name. Persistently. We have to propose anti-racist policies, pass anti-racist laws, and push for anti-racist consequences.

We have to stop passively and proudly saying we’re not racist. And we have to start actively and loudly being anti-racist. We have to listen to those with lived experience.

We have to hold elected officials (and each other) accountable. We have to. And we can.

The world has changed dramatically over the last two months, since George Floyd took his last breath on May 25, 2020. In many ways, the globe has gotten smaller, as evidenced by the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus (with about 13.5 million cases worldwide and over 580,000 deaths and rising), and the massive outpouring of protesters on city streets from Vancouver to Sydney screaming that Black Lives Matter.

No matter what language we speak or what corner of the Earth we inhabit, “social distancing” has become a part of our everyday vocabulary and behaviour.

Yet science has proven that all human beings – regardless of colour, class, culture, gender, or sexual orientation – are inextricably linked like never before.

As the motto goes, we’re all in this together. Overnight, we’ve all become armchair epidemiologists. Following the lead of our Provincial Health Officer, Dr. Bonnie Henry, British Columbians have sacrificed and worked hard to flatten the curve of COVID-19.

Complacency is not an option. We can’t afford to go backwards. And we must be equally vigilant and aggressive to finally squash the scourge of white supremacy, police brutality, systemic racism, and hatred in all its insidious forms.

Silence is no longer acceptable. We’re in a pandemic. And lives are at stake.

The city has received rezoning and development permit applications related to a proposed five-storey residential building being proposed at 909 to 915 12th St. The project would include nine ground-oriented units.

Artist's rendering of a building being proposed on 12th Street. - Contributed

In a four to three vote, council directed staff to process a rezoning and development permit application for 909 to 915 12 St., as well as an official community plan amendment application for part of the rear lane adjacent to the site. Mayor Jonathan Cote, along with councillors Patrick Johnstone, Nadine Nakagawa and Mary Trentadue, supported the staff recommendation, while councillors Chinu Das, Jaimie McEvoy and Chuck Puchmayr were opposed.

In order to build this project, the applicant would buy a 96.6-square-metre (1,040-squrae-foot) city-owned lane at the rear of the property.

According to a staff report, the site’s current zoning allows for the development of a four-storey commercial or mixed-used building. While the site would need to be rezoned in order for the project to proceed, the report stated the five-storey residential building being proposed is consistent with the official community plan’s designation for the site, except for the city-owned lane.

Das noted three small businesses will be lost as a result of this proposal. She said upper 12th Street has been a vibrant area, but that could change if it becomes entirely residential and loses its retail.

“There will be no reason for people to step out into the street. Who would want to walk down 12th Street? Where is the activity? Where is the vibrancy?” she said. “Although I have nothing against this proposal per se – it is in its preliminary stage – my worry is that there is going to be more and more and more.”

Das questioned how many other development proposals are in the works on upper 12th Street that would see ground-level commercial replaced by residential.

“I don’t have the exact number of projects at my fingertips,” Jackie Teed, the city’s senior manager of development services, told council July 13. “However, I am aware of two that we are currently evaluating, potentially three. There’s one that is a little bit behind the rest.”

Puchmayr said the updated official community plan (OCP) didn’t provide protection of all of the commercial spaces on upper 12th Street. He said the area where this project is proposed is relatively flat, so it makes sense to have commercial at that location.

“I am very concerned about 12th Street. It is an incubator for a lot of new immigrants and small businesses. It has some affordable rents,” he said. “As soon as the OCP passed, there was a rash of purchases of these commercial businesses, which showed that people were literally buying them up to develop multi-family or residential properties at the expense of commercial.”

Puchmayr said he’d like council to send the application back to staff and have them tell the proponent that the city won’t sell the lane unless the development includes commercial space.

Mayor Jonathan Cote said a retail strategy that’s getting underway will consider issues related to 12th Street. During the official community plan process, he said some people expressed concern that the 12th Street business district was “too long to be a thriving business district” and would benefit by having a more compact commercial area.

“Whether that was the right decision or not, that’s what came out of the OCP process. Certainly I would be more than open in reengaging in this conversation,” he said. “We are embarking on a retail strategy, which I support, which very well may revisit that strategy.”

Based on council’s past instructions to staff, Cote said some development applications on 12th Street will still be coming to council for its consideration.

In June 2019, council and staff discussed the impact that new development is having on existing businesses on 12th Street. Council directed staff to report back on the impact of temporarily suspending all 12th Street development permits.

Council subsequently considered a staff recommendation to support continued application review of the four in-stream development applications on upper 12th Street, but to temporarily suspend any new rezoning applications for mixed-used sites until staff completes the retail strategy and the upper 12th Street land-use strategy. Instead of staff’s recommendation, council voted three to two in favour of considering new development applications on 12th Street on a case-by-case basis.

Base d on that decision, Cote said it would be “problematic” to now notify an applicant that council won’t consider its application.

“I think we need to be more consistent there,” he said. “The message we gave is, we would at least consider the application. Ultimately, this has to go through a full public process and is not necessarily going to be supported by council. But to me, I think the decision we made is that we would see these processes through, so I will be consistent with that.”",[]

Dr. Michael Schwandt, who was one of the first infectious disease specialists from Vancouver Coastal Health to help contain outbreaks at sites like the Lynn Valley Care Centre, made the comments not long after a group of 239 scientists from 32 countries wrote an open letter to the World Health Organization, successfully appealing for the world health body to change its guidance on aerosolized transmission.

“We'll be watching closely the science around airborne transmission. At this time, we don't think it's played a major role in the outbreaks in Vancouver Coastal Health that we've had direct experience with,” said Dr. Schwandt.

The new W.H.O. guidance, which came last Thursday, accepts that the novel coronavirus can spread through aerosolized particles — tiny droplets in the air — in crowded indoor settings for prolonged periods of time.

“There have been reported outbreaks of COVID-19 in some closed settings, such as restaurants, nightclubs, places of worship or places of work where people may be shouting, talking, or singing.

“In these outbreaks, aerosol transmission, particularly in these indoor locations where there are crowded and inadequately ventilated spaces where infected persons spend long periods of time with others, cannot be ruled out,” reads the W.H.O.’s new guidance, which also calls for more research into aerosol transmission. aerosol transmission.

But Dr. Schwandt said his team doesn’t view the airborne versus droplet transmission debate as a binary, and that while the virus can be traced at varying distances at concentrations, most of the cases he’s come across in Vancouver Coastal Health region, home to the first outbreaks in the country, have been from “face-to-face” transmission.

The proof, he said, comes from Vancouver Coastal’s success in tracing contacts based on direct contact, an experience a spokesperson for Fraser Health told the Tri-City News has been echoed in their health authority.

“Without taking airborne transmission into account as a risk factor, we've been able to bring outbreaks under good control, really looking at close physical contact as the main risk factor,” said Dr. Schwandt.

That means, at the moment, current ventilation systems in places like long-term care homes are not considered a risk factor in the spread of the virus.

Airborne or not, sharing air in large, indoor public gatherings raises everyone’s risk of transmitting the virus, as Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry reminded British Columbians in her daily update Tuesday.

“Stay away from closed spaces as much as possible,” she said. “If it’s a house party, you may not know all the people who are there.”

And like the W.H.O., health officials in B.C. said they are keeping an eye on the science.

“If more evidence were to develop around airborne or aerosol transmission, then naturally we'd need to look at preventative measures that include attention to ventilation,” said Dr. Schwandt.",[]

Provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix announced July 15 that there were 21 new cases in the past 24 hours, including two cases that they call ""epi-linked,"" or presumed cases that have not been proven through testing but are being treated as official cases.

The province has now recorded 3,149 cases since the novel coronavirus first appeared in B.C. in late January.

More than 87.4% of those infected, or 2,753 people, have recovered. Of those who haven't, 189 people have died and 207 people are actively fighting the virus. Only 14 people are hospitalized, with five of those in intensive care units. The rest are self-isolating at home. There were no new deaths recorded in the past 24 hours.

Recording at least 20 new COVID-19 cases in a 24-hour period has become common in B.C., and Henry said yesterday that she found that number ""distressing,"" even though, she added, the good news is that the province knows where the clusters of infection are, many of the infections are linked and the number is not really that large given the province's population of more than five million residents.

The numbers in the past week were:

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12;

• 21 new cases on July 13;

• 13 new cases on July 14; and now

• 21 new cases on July 15.

In June, the number of daily new cases many times was in the single digits.

""There is one active community outbreak, in addition to several community exposure events,"" Henry and Dix said. ""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks.""

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,023 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,659 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 216 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 51 people who reside outside Canada.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons is expected to take Sidoo into custody on September 23 and release him from a Pacific Northwest area facility just before Christmas.

article continues below

Sidoo, 61, appeared online via Zoom in front of United States District Judge Nathaniel Gorton of the United States District Court for District of Massachusetts, as well as his lawyers and prosecutors. He wore a plaid suit while sitting in an office space inside his $31.7 million home in Vancouver’s Point Grey neighbourhood.

Sidoo, now a convicted felon, initially pled innocent to fraud and money laundering charges; he teared up before being sentenced and read a prepared statement:

“The last several months have been the hardest in my entire life and today I accept the court’s decision without reservation. No words can express how sorry I am for my decisions and actions that led to this day. I make no excuses, your honour. I broke the law and pled guilty and I now must pay for my actions.

“To my wife and boys, all I ever wanted was your love and respect and to be a good role model. And I know I have made a terrible mistake that has deeply affected our family. To my friends and colleagues and former teammates over the years, I am deeply ashamed today. To the young men and women who looked up to me as a role model, you deserve better. To the court and all of you, I wish to apologize for my actions.

“I will serve my sentence and am committed to returning to the community and doing everything possible to make a positive impact. I hope in time people will not judge me for the worst mistake in my life but for the work in the days, weeks and years ahead in which I am committed to being a better man.”

Gorton told Sidoo he was “impressed” by the businessman’s “obvious remorse.”

But Gorton pointed out two omissions in Sidoo’s statement.

“You expect to put this behind you and go forward and make up for what you called mistakes. I would call it a crime, not a mistake, but nevertheless, it is important that you acknowledge it and realize how many constituencies you have disappointed,” said the judge.

Sidoo also did not explicitly acknowledge that his crimes resulted in two students missing an opportunity to attend the universities his sons, Dylan Sidoo and Jordan Sidoo, were admitted to.

“What you accomplished, along with getting them into college, is to deprive two other deserving students of admittance into those universities — an act that is the very antithesis of one you want to be known for,” said Gorton.

Likewise, United States Attorney Andrew Lelling submitted to Gorton: “Sidoo engaged in serious criminal conduct involving fraud and deception that stretched over multiple years.

“His crimes warrant significant punishment. By engaging in the scheme, with [scheme mastermind Rick Singer] and others, Sidoo was able to steal two college admissions slots for his sons, including one from the University of California at Berkeley, one of the top public universities in the nation.”

Sidoo, said Gorton, “committed a crime that displayed an unbelievable lack of integrity, morality and common sense.

“You have let your selfish desire, your pride and your enormous wealth overcome all of what you apparently want to stand for with your works of charity,” Gorton told Sidoo.

Sidoo’s philanthropy, derived from his earnings in the capital markets, was central to his sentencing defense. According to Sidoo he has donated several million dollars to charitable causes, such as the University of B.C. football program.

In pleading guilty to fraud, Sidoo avoided a maximum prison term of 20 years and prosecutors subsequently agreed to 90 days behind bars, plus a $250,000 fine and one-year of supervised release, which will not be enforced in Canada by the U.S. Probation Department. Prosecutors also agreed to drop the money laundering charge.

The prison Sidoo goes to is expected to have harsher conditions since his options are limited due to his foreign citizenship. His attorney Martin Weinberg said he is expected to spend 14 days in isolation in a “maximum security setting,” due to COVID-19.

Sidoo will get four days credit for time already served. If he serves the full 90 days he will be released December 17 but will have to spend 14 days in isolation at home should B.C. public health rules for international travellers and COVID-19 continue into the fall.

Gorton said Sidoo’s crime would normally warrant more time in jail but there are mitigating circumstances, such as his remorse, lack of criminal record, philanthropy and “collateral consequences,” such as not being able to enter the U.S. as a felon and being stripped last month of his Order of B.C. medal for community service. Sidoo’s attorneys also previously noted he did not directly pay the universities but that his fraud was limited to cheating on the tests.

The former B.C. Lions football player worked as a stock broker in the 1990s and an investment banker between 2000 and 2010. Since 2010 he has made millions of dollars directing a handful of public companies that have failed to generate wealth for retail investors.

Sidoo was arrested March 8, 2019, in San Jose, California, on charges by the U.S. Department of Justice of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering related to the high-profile U.S. college admissions and bribery scandal, brought to light by a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe dubbed Operation Varsity Blues.

One of dozens of parents to be charged, Sidoo initially pled innocent to paying $200,000 total to scheme mastermind William ‘Rick’ Singer, who hired corrupt exam expert Mark Riddell to take Dylan and Jordan’s SAT exams, in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Sidoo also helped falsify one of his son Jordan’s university applications in October 2013 with an essay that originally included a fake claim of Jordan being held up at gunpoint by gangsters, while he was purported to be an intern for an anti-gang organization.

Co-conspirators Singer and Riddell pled guilty last year in exchange for cooperating with the government’s investigation.

The guilty parties in the case, who used Singer’s criminal services, were generally well-off individuals. Celebrities such as actress Lori Loughlin and her clothing designer husband Mossimo Gianulli and actress Felicity Huffman also pled guilty for related crimes and brought much media attention to the investigation.

Sidoo’s sons had no involvement in their father’s crime.

Jordan is now a 2018 history graduate from University of California Berkeley. Dylan graduated in cinematic arts in 2016 from the University of Southern California (USC). The two previously attended Vancouver’s prestigious St. George’s School.

Neither university has announced whether or not their degrees will remain valid. Dylan, according to the sentencing documents, had scored a 1,460/2,400 SAT score until Riddell, using a fake ID in December 2011, bumped up the score to 1,700, which was high enough for Dylan to enter Chapman University (and later transfer to USC). Riddell then scored 2,280/2,400 for Jordan in December 2012, paving the way to Berkley.

Riddell also took a high school test for Dylan. The B.C. Ministry of Education has issued no statement on how its testing process was so vulnerable to fraud.

Both sons have since entered into penny stock promotion with their father.

In one cluster, at least 17 cases have been traced to a group of people who met up in Kelowna, some from the Interior and Alberta, others from the Lower Mainland.

article continues below

“There are a number of people who have been exposed in those events,” said Henry Tuesday.

More troubling still is the emergence of new cases at the Krazy Cherry Fruit Company in Oliver, where two have been identified among migrant workers. They were among 62 cases identified in B.C. between Friday and Monday.

“Public health teams are monitoring the situation closely and have placed restrictions on those living and working on the farm to limit the potential for further transmission,” said Dr. Henry in a written statement today.

But others have expressed concerns that not enough is being done to prevent outbreaks among vulnerable groups. Where newly arrived immigrants were disproportionately affected at earlier outbreaks at poultry plants in Coquitlam, others say migrant agricultural workers still run higher risks due to inadequate housing.

“As anticipated,” said Byron Cruz of Sanctuary Health, an organization that works to protect migrant workers from predatory practices. “We knew that something was going to happen because the situation for housing in that farm is terrible. They were all crowded.”

‘WAY ABOVE MY COMFORT ZONE’

Yesterday, Dr. Henry warned 25 cases a day was “distressing” and “cautionary to us.” And while not unexpected due to the increased travel and social interaction of phase 3, she said “That’s way above my comfort zone.”

Dr. Henry urged anyone who attended Canada Day parties in the vicinity of the Kelowna cluster to self-monitor for even the mildest of symptoms, noting that anyone can be tested should they feel they’ve been exposed.

Just how quickly a province or state can backslide has been painted in stark relief among our neighbours to the south.

In comments to the press Tuesday, Health Minister Adrian Dix pointed to surges in several U.S. states where record breaking daily caseloads in several states have led jurisdictions like California to re-introduce physical distancing protocols, in what Dix described as “lockdown 2.0.”

“All our neighbouring jurisdictions continue to see an increase, whether it’s our neighbouring province to the east, Alberta, or others, Washington, Oregon and California, in Nevada, Arizona and in other American states — we’ve seen record days of new cases of COVID-19 recently,” said Dix.

Here in B.C., Henry said that on Monday, she checked how weekly caseloads are tracking with the province’s modelling that suggests British Columbians keep their social contacts to 65% of normal.

“We are still skirting that line. The RT, the reproductive number, is hovering around one… which is sort of pushing the limits of where we need to be,” she said.

While health officials work to contain the outbreak in Oliver, it’s unclear how a potential surge in cases will affect that calculation, and Byron Cruz of Sanctuary Health said he expects more cases to crop up in coming days due to their tight living quarters.

What is clear is the more cases are contained to a single cluster, the easier they are to track.

“This is going to be our dance over the next few months, where we do what we can do, we travel, we have those social interactions, but we do it in a thoughtful way so we do it with the people we know we’re with,” said Dr. Henry.",[]

The man and woman, who have asked not to be identified, were taken in by what appeared to be a call from their grandson in dire need of help.

article continues below

“The guy sounded so much like our grandson. If he had said ‘Grandma,’ we’d have known [it wasn’t him] right away, but he said ‘Nan’ and so does my grandson,” said the man.

The imposter grandson, who used their grandson’s name, called on Monday and told them he had been driving a friend’s car and struck a vehicle with Quebec licence plates that had turned sharply in front of him.

The fake grandson went on to say he had been taken to jail, but a judge would free him if he could pay for the damage, estimated to be $5,000. The grandparents were told to send money to the car’s owner in Montreal.

“I wasn’t cluing in at all [that this was a scam], he sounded so much like our grandson,” the man said.

The dutiful grandparents then took cash from their bank and went to the Bank of Montreal and using an account number the scammer had provided via an accomplice posing as a lawyer, they sent money to a BMO branch in downtown Montreal.

“The kid said, ‘Please don’t tell Dad,’ ” the man said. It wasn’t until he later talked to his grandson that it became clear they had been scammed.

The couple has since been in touch with police and the Bank of Montreal, which they say has been very helpful.

“They are doing their best to try and get the money back,” said the man, who thinks the scammers “took a shot in the dark and got lucky.”

But according to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre, it’s likely the scammers mined information like the grandson’s name from social media to make the pitch more convincing.

The centre calls these types of scams “the emergency scam.” It preys on the fear of a loved one being hurt or in trouble. The scammer claims to be someone you know and says they need money immediately. They tend to use scenarios like needing bail money because they’ve been arrested, or being in a car accident, or having trouble returning from a foreign country.

The targets are often seniors and the scammer pretends to be a grandchild, who begs them not to tell their parents that they’re in trouble, the Anti-Fraud Centre said. As a result, the grandparent doesn’t find out until after they’ve sent the money that their grandchild was not the person who asked for help.

Const. Cam MacIntyre said scammers will go to any lengths to defraud a victim.

“They will pose as a family member, a trusted member of the public, or even the police. We strongly recommend that people never deposit money into accounts of people or entities they do know personally,” he said.

“It’s so important to verify where your money is going. Call a family member, a friend, or the police if you are suspicious.”

The Anti-Fraud Centre says there were 18,803 reports of fraud, and 6,671 victims reporting losses of $22.6 million in Canada in the first four months of this year.

MacIntyre suggests if you are in the process of providing financial information or sending money to potential fraudsters, stop immediately.

“Contact your financial institutions and ensure all payments that you have not authorized are stopped. Inform them of the fraud and change both passwords and access information,” he said.

Suspected frauds can be reported to your local police or the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre at 1-888-495-8501.

The fiscal and economic report released a week ago detailed the Liberals' financial expectations, including a $343.2-billion deficit due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Parliamentary budget officer Yves Giroux says in a report that there are other numbers behind the biggest ones that MPs and senators should question.

He points to projections that enterprise Crown corporations, such as the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. and Business Development Bank of Canada, will collectively lose $12 billion this fiscal year.

Giroux notes that loss is a sharp turnaround from the $7.3 billion in gains for the 12-month period ending in March.

He says losses are unusual for these Crown corporations and adds that each should provide detailed projections to Parliament as soon as possible about its COVID-19 liquidity programs.

Similarly, Giroux says the Liberals should provide details of their own borrowing, which his office estimates will exceed by $150 billion the ceiling set by federal legislation.

The budget office estimates the government's planned debt issuance this fiscal year of $713 billion will cost $2.2 billion annually in interest.

The report released Thursday also notes $4.4 billion in spending for measures the government has yet to announce.

All the spending is expected to push the federal debt past the $1-trillion mark.

The Liberals had previously made a declining debt-to-GDP ratio key to their fiscal plans, but skyrocketing spending will push the ratio to 49 per cent from 31.1 per cent.

Giroux says fiscal transparency and accountability would be enhanced if the Liberals identify their new ""fiscal anchor,"" how they'll measure their own successful handling of the budget and national economy, which wasn't specifically laid out in the update last week.

He said the federal government will contribute $19 billion under the ""Safe Restart Agreement.""

article continues below

The money is to help the lower-tier governments with needs such as funding child care, bailing out cities whose expenses have soared and revenues plunged, increasing contact-tracing capacity, and buying personal protective equipment.

Trudeau had promised $14 billion in early June, but several premiers resisted some of the conditions the federal Liberals wanted to put on the money and said it wasn't enough.

Ontario's Doug Ford was one who didn't like a federal demand that some of it fund up to 10 days of paid sick leave to discourage workers with precarious employment from going into work ill. Quebec's Francois Legault wanted the money to be transferred without conditions so provinces could use it on whatever they considered most important.

Trudeau said the agreement outlines seven priority areas, with some flexibility for the provinces to apply the money to their particular needs over the next six to eight months.

""The provinces agreed to invest in the targeted sectors,"" Trudeau said. ""There are areas like support for vulnerable people where we will expect the provinces to declare publicly what they will do.""

At his side, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland added the agreement includes standards in certain areas, such as COVID-19 testing, in exchange for the federal money.

The pandemic is a health crisis, but Trudeau said it has a deep economic dimension that the funding is intended to address.

He said workers can't work if their children don't have safe care, and many can't get to their jobs if they don't have access to safe transit systems.

That means funding public services better so they don't have to rely on crowding many people into small spaces for their finances to make sense.

Municipal governments, which deliver many of those services, have been warning for months that their finances are careening toward brick walls and have been begging for aid.

Canada's largest city, Toronto, has reported that it's facing a $1.35-billion deficit this year. Montreal says it has a $500-million shortfall. Halifax expects to be short $85.4 million.

""The ruin of the First Nations and peoples of Canada is not just statistics. As seen here, it is real pain,"" Justice Chris Martin said in a written decision delivered July 10.

Anthony McKay was sentenced to four years after pleading guilty to manslaughter in the death of his mother, Shirley McKay. He faces two years behind bars, after receiving credit for time already served, and will be subject to three years of supervised probation after that.

""As a human, Mrs. McKay deserved better. And, like anyone born in this bountiful country, her son, her killer, deserved a better start, a better chance, in life,"" Martin wrote.

The judge said the killing on the Berens River First Nation, about 300 kilometres north of Winnipeg, was a ""calamity of almost 150 years of government policy, actions and inactions affecting the Indigenous community.""

Anthony McKay, who was 21 at the time, went to his mother's home after a night of drinking on June 22, 2018.

Court was told there was blood everywhere when a cousin came over about 8 a.m. The cousin found Shirley McKay unconscious and badly beaten. Her son has said he doesn't know why he viciously beat her.

The woman was taken to a nursing station before being transported to a hospital in Winnipeg. Her son visited her in hospital daily and was overheard at her bedside sobbing and apologizing.

Court heard he was confronted by a stepbrother and admitted that he had hurt his mother.

Shirley McKay died that September. Her son was arrested the following month.

""She did not recover and died months later, another victim in a mass of slain Aboriginal women,"" Martin said. ""He pled guilty to manslaughter, joining an appalling line of young Aboriginals ending up in prison.""

Crown prosecutors were asking for a seven-year sentence in a federal penitentiary. The defence asked for two years behind bars plus the probation so that McKay could have access to programming available in provincial custody.

The judge pointed to impacts of colonization, the pass system which restricted Indigenous Peoples' movement, residential schools and the '60s Scoop in his sentencing.

""It is well accepted that the government's role, since the early days of dealing with First Nations peoples, has had the effect of isolating, infantilizing, marginalizing, and traumatizing Indigenous societies like the Ojibwa (or Anishinaabe) of Berens River,"" Martin wrote.

""Mr. McKay is a person shaped by a system historically designed to 'take the Indian out of the Indian.'""

Reports provided to the judge on McKay's background said he has partial fetal alcohol syndrome.

One of 13 siblings, he spent most of his time in foster homes on the First Nation or more often in Winnipeg. His parents struggled with alcohol and sniffing substances, and McKay followed a similar path starting when he was 13. His father died in 2010.

McKay was neglected and not cared for, files from child and family services said. He asked to become a permanent ward of child welfare in 2013 because he didn't feel safe with his family.

Martin said McKay's troubled upbringing doesn't excuse his behaviour, but does help explain why he is who he is.

Occasionally it is incumbent on a judge to underscore systemic issues, he said, adding Indigenous people are disproportionately affected by serious crime and disproportionately incarcerated.

""Like so many other cases, this case is troubling, not only for its specific facts, but because it reminds that core issues affecting many in the Indigenous population are not really being addressed sufficiently or urgently enough,"" Martin wrote.

""Many in this and the next generation of Indigenous people are at risk.""

461,newwestrecord,http://www.newwestrecord.ca/experts-say-twitter-breach-troubling-undermines-trust-1.24171586,"Experts say Twitter breach troubling, undermines trust",['Zen Soo'],,"HONG KONG — A breach in Twitter’s security that allowed hackers to break into the accounts of leaders and technology moguls is one of the worst attacks in recent years and may shake trust in a platform politicians and CEOs use to communicate with the public, experts said Thursday.

The FBI is investigating the hack, according to a person familiar with the probe who was not authorized to discuss an ongoing probe and spoke on the condition of anonymity Thursday.

article continues below

The ruse discovered Wednesday included bogus tweets from Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Mike Bloomberg and a number of tech billionaires including Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Celebrities Kanye West and his wife, Kim Kardashian West, were also hacked.

Hackers used social engineering to target some of Twitter’s employees and then gained access to the high-profile accounts. The attackers sent out tweets from the accounts of the public figures, offering to send $2,000 for every $1,000 sent to an anonymous Bitcoin address.

Cybersecurity experts say such a breach could have dire consequences since the attackers were tweeting from verified, globally influential accounts with millions of followers.

""If you receive a tweet from a verified account, belonging to a well-known and therefore trusted person, you can no longer assume it’s really from them,"" said Michael Gazeley, managing director of cybersecurity firm Network Box.

Reacting to the breach, Twitter swiftly deleted the tweets and locked down the accounts to investigate. In the process it prevented verified users from sending out tweets for several hours.

The company said Thursday it has taken ""significant steps to limit access to internal systems and tools.""

Many celebrities, politicians and business leaders often use Twitter as a public platform to make statements. U.S. President Donald Trump, for example, regularly uses Twitter to post about national and geopolitical matters, and his account is closely followed by media, analysts and governments around the world.

Twitter faces an uphill battle in regaining people’s confidence, Gazeley said. For a start, it needs to figure out exactly the accounts were hacked and show the vulnerabilities have been fixed, he said.

""If key employees at Twitter were tricked, that’s actually a serious cybersecurity problem in itself,"" he said. ""How can one of the world’s most used social media platforms have such weak security, from a human perspective?""

Rachel Tobac, CEO of Socialproof Security, said that the breach appeared to be largely financially motivated. But such an attack could cause more serious consequences.

""Can you imagine if they had taken over a world leader’s account, and tweeted out a threat of violence to another country’s leader?"" asked Tobac, a social engineering hacker who specializes in providing training for companies to protect themselves from such breaches.

Social engineering attacks typically target human weaknesses to exploit networks and online platforms. Companies can guard themselves against such attacks by beefing up multi-factor authentication -– where users have to present multiple pieces of evidence as authentication before being allowed to log into a system, Tobac said.

Such a process could include having a physical token that an employee must have with them, on top of a password, before they can log into a corporate or other private system. Other methods include installing technical tools to monitor for suspicious insider activities and reducing the number of people who have access to an administrative panel, Tobac said.

Several U.S. lawmakers called on Twitter to co-operate with authorities including the Department of Justice and the FBI to secure the site.

""I am concerned that this event may represent not merely a co-ordinated set of separate hacking incidents but rather a successful attack on the security of Twitter itself,"" said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican.

He added that millions of users relied on Twitter not just to send tweets but also communicate privately via direct messaging. Twitter hasn't said if hackers were able to access the private messages of their high-profile targets.

Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden said Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey told him in a private conversation in 2018 that the company was working on protecting direct messages, known as DMs, with end-to-end encryption.

But that promise never materialized, Wyden said Thursday, leaving everyone's private messages ""vulnerable to employees who abuse their internal access to the company’s systems, and hackers who gain unauthorized access.""

""This is a vulnerability that has lasted for far too long, and one that is not present in other, competing platforms,"" Wyden said in an emailed statement. ""If hackers gained access to users’ DMs, this breach could have a breathtaking impact, for years to come.""

Mohammed Shahed, a member of the governing party who regularly appeared on TV talk shows, was arrested Wednesday by the Rapid Action Battalion near the Indian border after a nine-day manhunt.

article continues below

Shahed is chairman of the Regent Group and owner of two Regent hospitals in the capital, Dhaka.

Abdul Baten, a commissioner of the Detective Branch in Dhaka, said Shahed admitted after his arrest that his hospitals did not have proper equipment to conduct coronavirus tests.

A court in Dhaka on Thursday allowed investigators to keep Shahed in custody for 10 days for questioning.

Officials said the hospitals had issued more than 10,000 coronavirus test results and about 60% were fake even though patients were charged for them. The hospitals allegedly arranged for the remaining tests to be conducted by another hospital.

The two hospitals had not renewed their medical licenses for years, but the Ministry of Health nevertheless signed a deal with Shahed to dedicate the hospitals to coronavirus testing and treatment as the number of cases rose in Bangladesh.

Bangladesh on Thursday was nearing 200,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, including 2,496 deaths. Public health experts say the actual number is much higher because only about 70 testing facilities are available in the country of 160 million people.

Shahed belongs to the governing Awami League party headed by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and is a member of its foreign affairs subcommittee. He has more than 50 illegal cases pending against him across the country on various charges including forgery and cheating.

Another doctor and her husband were also arrested recently on similar charges of falsifying test results.

Local media reports say the scams could hurt Bangladesh’s earnings from overseas workers. Last week, Italy suspended all flights from Bangladesh to Rome after some Bangladeshis reportedly presented fake negative test reports for the coronavirus.

Bangladesh earns about $19 billion a year from about 10 million overseas workers. Authorities said about 15,000 Bangladeshi workers with jobs in Italy remain stranded in Bangladesh and it is unclear whether they will be able to travel to the European country.

Bangladesh has reopened businesses including its main export-earning garment sector after a monthslong closure.",[]

The Anti-Defamation league and some Jewish leaders had condemned what they called anti-Semitic theories expressed by Cannon and demanded the apology.

article continues below

""First and foremost I extend my deepest and most sincere apologies to my Jewish sisters and brothers for the hurtful and divisive words that came out of my mouth during my interview with Richard Griffin,"" Cannon said on his Twitter account.

""They reinforced the worst stereotypes of a proud and magnificent people and I feel ashamed of the uninformed and naïve place that these words came from. The video of this interview has since been removed.""

ViacomCBS cut ties with the TV host and producer Tuesday in response to his comments on a podcast where he discussed racial bias.

Rabbi Abraham Cooper, the Simon Wiesenthal Center’s associate dean, told The Associated Press that Cannon reached out to him Wednesday and during a 30-minute telephone conversation he apologized to the Jewish community and Cooper asked him to post it on social media.

""He started out the right way, he said the right things. Half an hour is a long time, and we'll probably meet tomorrow in the LA area,"" Cooper said.

""He understood that the words and references that he thought were based on fact, turned out to be hateful propaganda and stereotypical rhetoric.""

The TV host and producer wrote earlier a lengthy Facebook post defending himself and criticizing his firing for what the company deemed ""bigotry"" and ""anti-Semitism,"" prominent members of the U.S. Jewish community said the post fell well short and demanded an apology.

""It’s not enough to say, ‘I’m not a racist, I’m not a bigot,’"" Cooper had told the AP earlier. ""The statements he made are hurtful, and they’re false.""

Cooper said Cannon should read and heed the words of Martin Luther King Jr., who ""dedicated his life for civil rights for all and a colour-blind America."" Cooper also had advised him to seek out the guidance of basketball Hall of Famer-turned-writer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who has condemned several sports and entertainment celebrities for anti-Semitic posts.

In the hour-plus episode of ""Cannon's Class"" released last month that prompted his firing, Cannon and Richard ""Professor Griff"" Griffin, formerly of the rap group Public Enemy, contended that Black people are the true Hebrews and Jews have usurped that identity.

Cannon then argued that lighter-skinned people — ""Jewish people, white people, Europeans"" — ""are a little less"" and have a ""deficiency"" that historically caused them to act out of fear and commit acts of violence to survive.

""They had to be savages,"" he said.

""When I first heard about the comments Mr. Cannon made, it was very, very disappointing,"" said Oren Segal, director of the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism. ""We’re in a time where hatred of all kinds is very much apparent. It’s in the news every day.""

""Anti-Semitism in particular over the past several years has been something that we've seen in increase , as well as racism and other issues,"" Segal added. ""So when you hear an individual who has a public profile, who has influence over people, make statements that are highly offensive to the Jewish community, the first reaction is disappointment.""

Anti-Semitic violent attacks rose worldwide by 18% in 2019 compared with the previous year, according to a report published in April by Tel Aviv University’s Kantor Center for the Study of Contemporary Jewry.

Segal said some members of the Black Hebrew Israelite movement see themselves as the true ""chosen people,"" and believe that Blacks, Hispanics and Native Americans are the true descendants of the 12 Tribes of Israel. He noted that not all spew hateful rhetoric, although many adhere to an extreme set of anti-Semitic beliefs.

Bruce D. Haynes, a professor of sociology at the University of California, Davis, who has been studying Black Jews for more than two decades, agreed that the remarks echo the ideas of extreme Black Hebrew Israelites and of Minister Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam leader who last year referenced ""Satanic Jews"" in a speech denying allegations of anti-Semitism. But Haynes took a more nuanced view.

""The danger is that those groups get confused with other self-identified Israelites like (Rabbi) Capers Funnye, who has a congregation in Chicago, and who is very much involved with the Ashkenazim Jewish community. So I want to make clear that the term 'Israelites' is a tricky term,"" he said.

""Is it anti-Semitic to say Black people are the real Israelites or the real Jews? I’m not sure I’d call it anti-Semitism,"" Haynes said. ""It’s not a good reading of history, but I wouldn’t call it anti-Semitism. On the other hand, some of those groups that call Jews impostors certainly cross the line.""

Until his firing, Cannon produced ""Wild ’n Out,"" a comedy improv series for VH1, the ViacomCBS-owned cable channel.

In an earlier Facebook post, he had said that he welcomes being held accountable and takes responsibility for his words, while also accusing the company of trying to silence an ""outspoken black man"" and demanding full ownership of the ""Wild ’n Out"" brand.

""I do not condone hate speech nor the spread of hateful rhetoric. ... The Black and Jewish communities have both faced enormous hatred, oppression persecution and prejudice for thousands of years and in many ways have and will continue to work together to overcome these obstacles,"" he wrote.

Cooper had said that Cannon should reject Farrakhan’s hate speech and ""reduce the long statement to two sentences"" — a simple apology, which he did after their conversation.

""I just had the blessed opportunity to converse with Rabbi Abraham Cooper director of global social action @SimonWiesenthal. My first words to my brother was, I apologize for the hurt I caused the Jewish Community"" Cannon tweeted.

""On my podcast I used words & referenced literature I assumed to be factual to uplift my community instead turned out to be hateful propaganda and stereotypical rhetoric that pained another community For this I am deeply sorry but now together we can write a new chapter of healing.""

""My hope is that this series can be a place to explore meaningful topics together and sort through so many of the questions we’re all trying to answer in our own lives,"" Obama said in a statement.

The new podcast is the first title in the ongoing collaboration between Spotify and Higher Ground, a production company founded by Barack and Michelle Obama. Last year, the former president and first lady partnered with Spotify to produce exclusive podcasts for the platform.

In an email to workers Wednesday night, the company said that since January it has had fewer than 10 cases of the virus that causes COVID-19 that were transmitted in the workplace.

article continues below

But the email from Laurie Shelby, Tesla’s vice-president of environmental, safety and health, also confirmed reports that Tesla is looking into more than 130 positive tests among employees, including those who contracted the virus outside of Tesla facilities. She said less than 0.25% of employees worldwide have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, which equals just over 137 workers.

Her message came in response to a report by Electrek.co that over 130 Tesla employees or contractors have tested positive, and hundreds more are waiting for test results. The website said it based the report on internal company data.

Shelby wrote that the story referred to data ""that was in the process of being validated"" and included employees worldwide who may have been infected but never entered a Tesla site, or were infected at home while Tesla's operations were shut down earlier in the year. A Tesla spokesman would not comment on the report or the email, which was obtained by The Associated Press.

""Nearly all — more than 99.99% — of these occurrences were not cases of virus transmitted at work,"" Shelby wrote in the email. ""Most of the positive cases resulted from an individual living with or travelling with someone with COVID-19 and have returned to work after recovering from home.""

Shelby wrote that Tesla doesn't have any employees in serious condition anywhere in the world because of COVID-19.

A message was left Thursday seeking comment on the numbers from the public health department in Alameda County, California, which includes Fremont, the location of Tesla's only U.S. assembly plant. The factory employs about 10,000 workers.

Some workers have refused to return to the plant out of fear of catching the virus. They did so after CEO Elon Musk in May defied Health Department orders not to restart production under shutdown orders due to the virus.

Some Tesla workers and labour activists say the company is threatening to fire employees who haven’t returned, but Tesla officials have said claims about firings are not true. Workers say they've heard about COVID-19 cases at the plant but they don't know numbers. They have called on the company and health department to release the figures.

However, Shelby wrote in the email that an employee survey found the vast majority of workers feel comfortable with the safety measures being taken by the company.

Among the measures are increased cleaning, limiting access to facilities, temperature checks for employees before they enter buildings, staggered shifts to keep workers apart, additional barriers between employees and providing protective equipment, Shelby wrote.

She urged workers to wear masks or face coverings to stay healthy and save lives and warned that failing to wear masks where required, or not wearing them properly, will bring disciplinary actions. She also wrote that workers should stay home if they're sick.

Musk reopened the Fremont plant May 11 in defiance of county orders. The health department had deemed the factory a nonessential business that can’t fully open under virus restrictions, but Tesla contended it was essential under federal guidelines.

The next day, however, the Health Department announced that the plant could return to manufacturing as long as it delivers on worker safety precautions that it agreed to.",[]

Asa Hutchinson issued an order Thursday requiring people to wear face masks in public throughout the state, which has had a surge in coronavirus cases over the past several weeks.

The Republican governor had resisted a statewide mask mandate and opposed issuing a stay-at-home order earlier in the pandemic, but he signed the order requiring masks when social distancing isn't possible in the hopes of slowing the disease's rapid spread in the state. The order takes effect Monday.

article continues below

Hutchinson’s decision comes amid growing support for mask requirements from business and health leaders and a day after Bentonville-based Walmart said it would require customers to wear masks in all of its U.S. stores. The state’s largest newspaper, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, also called for a statewide requirement on Thursday.

Hutchinson previously encouraged people to wear masks and allowed cities to pass ordinances requiring their use, but he stopped short of requiring them statewide. He’s the latest Republican governor to relent on the mask issue in the face of a surge in COVID-19 cases. Alabama's governor issued a similar mask mandate on Wednesday.

Arkansas' coronavirus cases have dramatically risen since May, when the state began allowing businesses that had closed because of the pandemic to reopen despite warnings from national health officials about the risks of doing so too soon. Arkansas was one of a handful of states that did not issue a broader stay-at-home order that kept most businesses closed.

Hutchinson previously questioned how a mask mandate could be enforced in a rural state such as Arkansas, but this week he left open the possibility of such a requirement. The chancellor of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences called for a statewide requirement last weekend.

Hutchinson's order was expected to face criticism from some conservatives in the state. Hours before he issued the order, a Republican legislator urged people to call Hutchinson to oppose any mask directive.

A poll by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business suggested tensions are flaring between workers and employers, with around 27 per cent of 3,389 employers polled indicating some of their laid-off staff have refused to return to work.

article continues below

Of the nearly 870 businesses that provided the reasons their employees gave for refusing to return to work, 62 per cent reported workers ""prefer the Canada Emergency Response Benefit."" Employers could choose more than one explanation for why a worker refused to return, and respondents also selected options such as concern for health (47 per cent), childcare obligations (27 per cent) or lack of hours in return offer (16 per cent).

CFIB president Dan Kelly said it's ""clear"" that CERB ""created a disincentive to return to work for some staff, especially in industries like hospitality."" Other sectors where conflicts are arising include child care, dental offices, home health care, amusement parks, gambling and spectator sports, the study suggested.

""CERB was created as emergency support for workers who had lost their job due to the pandemic, not to fund a summer break,"" Kelly said in a statement.

But Ian Robb, Canadian director of the Unite Here union that represents hospitality workers, disagrees. He said workers are impatient to return to work — for what is usually the lucrative summer season — but employers are the ones failing to adopt measures like frequent cleaning and wage subsidies. The union previously estimated that average wages in cities like Toronto are around $20 per hour for hospitality.

""A number of our members in the U.S. have gone to work and contracted (COVID-19),"" Robb said.

""There's just not enough safety in front of service. Nobody wants to stay home and make two grand when they can make double that by working.""

The survey suggested that the hospitality sector had the biggest share of employers, 45 per cent, who had trouble recalling workers. CFIB defines hospitality as including hotels, restaurants and bars.

The CFIB study suggests that in the hospitality sector, 56 per cent of hard-to-fill positions were ""unskilled, entry-level jobs"" that pay ""at or around minimum wage,"" although across sectors, skilled and semi-skilled jobs were harder to fill.

Employment and human rights lawyer Neena Gupta says she has heard of tradespeople unable to perform jobs because workers failed to return.

She said the reason an employee is refusing the work matters. Lack of childcare, like daycare and camps, can be a job-protected reason for staying home, as can disabilities such as being immunocompromised, says Gupta, a partner in Gowling WLG's Waterloo Region and Toronto offices.

The federal government's website states that workers seeking CERB, which offers $500 per week over a limited period, ""should be seeking work opportunities and/or return to work when their employer makes a request for their return, provided they are able and it is reasonable to do so."" The government's COVID-19 guidelines also provide for employees to refuse to do a dangerous job, although the worker must already ""be at work"" to refuse such a task.

However, notes Gupta, general apprehension about the pandemic is likely not enough to merit a job refusal. She said workplaces must comply with health and safety guidelines, and that a ministry inspection must find some sort of violation to justify a job refusal.

Managers should give workers a written ""come back to work"" recall and an indication that it will be treated as job abandonment if the worker doesn't return, says Gupta. After that process is completed, the employer could consider that worker terminated for cause, and hire a replacement.

While reporting misuse of CERB by a former employee might appear to give an employer some moral satisfaction, Gupta says it’s unlikely to help with staffing concerns or worker morale.

""I do ask people to be reasonable. You can’t call someone at noon on a Thursday and expect them in at 7 a.m. on Friday,"" she says.

A month after the BC Junior A Lacrosse League was supposed to begin playing, the league officially cancelled its 2020 season.

The Minto Cup, along with all other minor and senior national championships, has also been cancelled by the Canadian Lacrosse Association.

In a release, BCJALL president Karl Christiansen said ongoing restrictions in British Columbia limiting the size of public gatherings during the COVID-19 pandemic to no more than 50 people made it impossible for games to be played.

“We had hope we might be able to compete this year,” he said. “But it became evident we wouldn’t be able to have a normal season.”

Christiansen said alternative schedules were considered, but public health directives were insurmountable.

CLA president Shawn Williams said health and safety, travel concerns and venue closures were the main considerations in its decision to cancel all 2020 national championships from the Mann Cup senior men’s title to the U12 finals, as well as the U19 women’s field lacrosse championships.

“We recognize that national championships are important to lacrosse players of all ages,” he said, adding all hosts for 2020 events will be charged with staging their championships in 2021. That means the Minto and Mann Cups will both be played in Ontario.

But Paul Dal Monte said the league’s executive and governors are doing everything they can to ensure that doesn’t happen, even as the uncertainty about when restrictions on public gatherings could be lifted continues.

article continues below

At the very least, the coming season - which has already been postponed from its scheduled May 21 start - is unlikely to look like any other normal campaign.

Dal Monte said the league has a contingency to play a schedule as short as 12 games. But any decision on how to proceed relies on continuing direction from health authorities, as well as the Canadian Lacrosse Association.

Dal Monte added he’s also in regular communication with his counterpart at Major Series Lacrosse in Ontario, which is supposed to be hosting the Mann Cup national championship in September.

“We stay on top of things,” Dal Monte said. “We understand the pain points and challenges.”

One of those pain points is the financial viability of the league and its seven teams, including the Coquitlam Adanacs, Burnaby Lakers and New Westminster Salmonbellies.

Dal Monte said the niche nature of lacrosse means teams rely on sponsors and partnerships rather than gate receipts to cover expenses, and with so many businesses suffering because of the pandemic, those dollars may be hard to come by this summer.

“At this stage, it creates a significant obstacle for us and many of our teams,” he said, adding without the certainty of a schedule, it’s difficult for teams to even begin having a conversation with potential sponsors.

Dal Monte conceded some teams might have a hard time operating.

Still, he said, time is on the league’s side. Virtual meetings with team governors are being held May 2 and 16 to assess the current situation and options for moving forward.

Any final call on how to proceed with a season could be held off as late as June 1, Dal Monte said. Then “we would have to make a decision one way or the other.”

Meanwhile, the president of the BC Junior A Lacrosse League said a recent pronouncement by British Columbia’s health officer, Dr. Bonnie Henry, suggesting large gatherings of people may not be allowed through the summer in an effort to quash transmission of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 puts his league’s ability to hold a season “at risk.”

The BCJALL, which includes the Coquitlam Jr. Adanacs, PoCo Saints as well as junior incarnations of the Lakers and Salmonbellies among its eight teams, was supposed to play its first regular season game on Saturday. But that’s now on hold with the league executive meeting next on May 19.

Karl Kristiansen said the league could reduce its schedule to 14 games from 21, or even stage a tournament-style season to determine playoff teams that could compete for a chance to go to the Minto Cup in St. Catharines in August. That is, if the national championship even gets the green light to play.

Kristiansen said his group should have more clarity after the CLA meets May 15 when the fate of several national championships, from youth to senior leagues, is expected to be decided.

“We are hopeful we can play some lacrosse this season,” he added.",[]

League governors decided to postpone the start, and officials with both the WLA and Major Series Lacrosse of Ontario are working together with an aim of having a Mann Cup championship series between the two leagues in September, hosted by Ontario.

Everything hinges on Canadian and provincial health officials ending the state of emergency, which has closed all community facilities and put a ban on large gatherings.

“Our intention is to play a full season but we have alternately drafted a few proposals that give us options should the situation not permit (a regular length schedule),” WLA commissioner Paul Dal Monte said in an interview with the Record on Tuesday. “We have drafted two alternative schedules, with playoff options, and aligned in lock-step with the MSL.”

When they receive the all-clear from health officials to open shuttered community facilities and permit public gatherings, municipal schedulers will be inundated with requests for floor time from the minor sports and recreation sports user groups, as well. That would also require some coordinating on a local standpoint, Dal Monte said.

The WLA governors are slated to meet again on April 11 to review their options. Dal Monte said the focus is on preparing for a possible spring startup that could facilitate a condensed schedule and playoffs and a September Mann Cup tournament.

“Obviously we all want to start the season soon,” New West Salmonbellies general manager Ray Porcellato said. “This is unprecedented, and everyone needs to follow (health officials) instructions. The goal is to have a season and playoffs leading to a Mann Cup. It’s going to be a challenge, as (most) Ontario teams play second or third fiddle to junior hockey in regards to their arenas.”

With Ontario slated to host the Mann Cup championship and as a number of the competitive teams there share their arenas with Ontario Hockey League clubs, postponing the national series past mid-September would be a challenge.

“In arenas where a number of Ontario teams play, junior hockey takes precedent, like in Peterborough,” noted Dal Monte. “But the Mann Cup is the Mann Cup, so we’ll have to see.”

The WLA regular season usually sees teams play each other three times in an 18-game schedule, for a total of 63 games. If the league reduced to a home-and-home series each, it would result in a 12-game schedule per team, for 42 league games.

Porcellato said he’s been in contact with the ‘Bellie players and says they are working out in anticipation of an eventual start to the season.

“They’re Instagramming each other with push-up challenges, staying home and doing what they can,” he noted. “I guess if there’s any benefit to this, the guys who play pro (in the National Lacrosse League) are getting a chance to heal up, rest and recuperate.”

The Ontario league has not announced a postponement to its schedule as of Tuesday, but released a statement that extends the ban on all in-person lacrosse activities to May 15, pending further provincial directives. The MSL was slated to launch May 31 and run until July 30, with the league playoffs running through August.

With both leagues working together in mapping out various options for condensed regular seasons and playoffs, Porcellato said his squad is all-in for however the 2020 season is drawn up.

“We will be ready to go, right to the bitter end until a Mann Cup is not feasible,” he said. “We plan on being there, even if it’s a one-game winner take-all.”",[]

The Lower Mainland Baseball Association, which oversees 37 teams over four leagues for 18-and older players, announced Monday that all events, games and meetings are cancelled as it encourages its members to remain safe.

Among the scrapped events was a league meeting slated for Saturday.

Lower Mainland Baseball League commissioner Dan Taylor said there the public health concerns trump sports, but has set some possible scenarios that would see the health scare abate and regular activities begin to return.

“I’m hoping it isn’t too long. I’ve got about 700 guys who are itching to play,” said Taylor. “We’re not anticipating starting the season any time soon, but I’ve sort of set a date in my head of the Victoria Day (May 16 to 18), and hopefully start a schedule then.”

His 38 teams, which compete in 18-plus, 30-plus and 45-plus divisions, would have to play a short-season schedule. In a regular season the teams play 16-game schedules, plus playoffs.

“Basically, we’re just in a great big holding pattern, like everybody else.”

Taylor notes his league is also dependent upon what the region’s minor baseball associations can do, since most of the men’s league field access relies on what is available after the kids need.

“We share all the same diamonds as the minor associations,” he noted. “Most parks are allocated (municipally) for the minor organizations, because the kids come first, as it should be. Over our 26 years we’ve built up a lot of goodwill so I’m confident that we can work together.”

The league has kept the registration system open, and has advised teams that have not yet paid its registration fees to hold on until an opening day is determined.

“LMBA is instructing all teams not to practice until parks have been re-opened – per instructions from Baseball BC and all Lower Mainland municipalities. We are optimistic that we will get in some baseball time in 2020 and will keep everyone updated,” a notice posted on the LMBL website.

While the three different divisions are full with teams, one squad that has competed over the past two seasons – the B.C. Badgers, a female team composed of provincial and national-level players – won’t be returning due to scheduling conflicts.

Taylor said it was a great experience having the Badgers compete in the over-45 division, where they received steady competition in preparing for the women’s national team responsibilities. Unfortunately, because their roster includes players from Vancouver Island and right through to the Fraser Valley, it was difficult to guarantee the Badgers could make the often early weekend games. They ended up forfeiting some games due to travel difficulties, he said.

“The schedule just didn’t mesh well with them,” said Taylor. “I’ve followed the female program for a while and you can see how much it’s improved over time, here in B.C. but also across Canada.

“We told the national level players that they could come out and tryout for any team in our league.”

He said the Badgers have decided to join the Vancouver Recreational Baseball League, which operates out of Burnaby’s Central Park and New West’s Queen’s Park.",[]

Four months after the NBA was forced to shut down due to COVID-19, the Raptors are making up for lost time with their fierce fight at practice.

article continues below

""Practices have been super, super competitive,"" said Patrick McCaw. ""A lot of trash talk, a lot of guys going at it, just pushing each other. We've been away from each other for two or three months, so guys are excited to see each other but also excited to play.

""So that energy (at) practice is super intense, and it's fun, because you're competing against the guys that you're going to war with. It's been a couple weeks of great fun.""

Coach Nick Nurse wasn't quite sure what to expected in this unprecedented situation. He's been pleased with his players' feistiness.

""There's a lot of juice in there, a lot of juice in the building, and high spirits,"" Nurse said after Thursday's practice at Disney, where courts have been laid down in a massive convention hall.

""It's all good-natured stuff — it's competitive-natured stuff, but it's all been fine.""

Norm Powell, the unofficial leader of the second unit, said the younger players have been pushing the veterans hard.

""Man, we're competing,"" Powell said. ""I was actually really happy and excited the way the younger guys were getting Fred (VanVleet) and Kyle (Lowry) and Pascal (Siakam) worked up, taking their intensity level even higher. The games have been really good when we're getting after it in our in-team scrimmages and things like that.""

The Raptors were second in the Eastern Conference when the league shuttered on March 11, and that was despite having a revolving door of a roster due to numerous injuries to key players. The Raptors were fifth in the league in games lost to injury.

Nurse now has the luxury of a full roster to choose from.

Powell, who was playing the most consistent basketball of his NBA career before the hiatus, is being more vocal at practice. He's taken aside players such as Chris Boucher, rookie Terence Davis, McCaw and Stanley Johnson to remind them to make Nurse's job more difficult, to constantly battle for more a bigger role.

""I'm telling them, 'We've got to go at these guys (the starters) because we want their spot. They are in the position we want to be in. So we're not going to take it easy on them in these drills, we're not going to let them feel like they can do whatever they want and take it easy and go through the motions. We're going to go after them, we're going to compete, and we're going to show them that we're here and we want more,'"" Powell said.

Nurse said he could go deep into his bench for the three scrimmages and eight-game seeding round before tightening it up for the playoffs.

""I just think that you're going to play eight, nine in the playoffs. Everybody sort of gets to that point, every possession is so critical,"" he said.

""One thing that's for sure, each series always seems to be so different. Sometimes there's just some guy that doesn't fit and then maybe there's a series where a Chris Boucher or Rondae Hollis-Jefferson or somebody who's in the rotation but towards the back of it maybe they get slotted in for a matchup or something.

""So I think it's always good to have some versatility, maybe 12 guys you can use because you can never know who suits each series.""

Nurse received a virtual thumbs up from reporters in Thursday's Zoom video call for his sweater. It said ""Box + One,"" a nod to the box-and-one defence, most often seen in collegiate games, that he implemented against Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors in last year's NBA Finals.

The Raptors could be at Disney World for the next three months if they go deep into the playoffs. The team has tried to make them feel at home, and most recently decorated their floor of the hotel. There's large ""We The North"" banners on players' doors, and a huge photo of the Toronto skyline decorates one wall of the hallway.

A cracked bone? Good to go. What about a sore shoulder? No problem.

It's well-known NHLers battle through aches, pains and even illness. Almost like clockwork, a flu bug tears through more than a few locker rooms every season. Players often attempt to soldier on without missing any time, especially when the games matter most.

In the era of COVID-19, however, some of that old the definition of ""toughness"" is being thrown out the window.

Players and coaches are keenly aware that if they're feeling even the slightest bit off — and there are a laundry list of symptoms associated with the novel coronavirus, from chills to headaches to fatigue and weakness — it needs to be reported immediately.

""Doesn't matter if you're a tough hockey player or not,"" said Tippett, now the head coach of the Edmonton Oilers. ""I had a lot of games where I hid a broken finger or something like that from doctors. I didn't want them to know because they wouldn't let me play.

""But when you get sick, you're going to have to tell people. That's just the way of the new world.""

The NHL opened training camps this week as part of its plan to kickstart a campaign that was suspended in mid-March by the pandemic. Players and staff are getting tested every 48 hours — they're not currently quarantined — and that will be kick up another notch to once a day when the 24 teams involved in the resumption head to the hub cities of Edmonton and Toronto, where they'll be kept in a bubble separate from the general public.

Vancouver Canucks captain Bo Horvat said the mentality of the past has been turned on its head when it comes to illness.

""As hockey players you want to be in every single game, you want to play, and you want to help your teammate, and you want to be a difference-maker,"" he said. ""Before you played through colds, you played through injuries, you played through sickness and stuff like that.

""You have to step back and think a little bit now. It's a different animal, this virus. You have to be not only cautious of yourself and how you're feeling, but the people around you, too. It's not just your teammates, it's the medical staff, it's the trainers, it's everybody you're around every single day, and even obviously opposing teams. You've got to think of everybody. You've got to be very cautious.""

Edmonton Oilers centre and NHL leading scorer Leon Draisaitl said that caution is going to become the new norm.

""Every hockey player has played through certain things and we've all played through a flu or sickness or whatever it is,"" he said. ""But now with this going around, it makes it a little more dangerous.

""You have to be careful.""

Winnipeg Jets centre Andrew Copp said hockey's team-first mentality should kick in if someone isn't feeling right.

""You hope that everyone's pretty dialled in, and not only for everyone's health and safety, but for the team too,"" he said. ""If this guy gets it, he's not playing. Hopefully everyone can realize that we're all making a lot of sacrifices here.""

The NHL hasn't said how many positive tests would constitute the ""uncontrolled outbreak"" listed in its return-to-play protocol that could conceivably shut the league's resumption down. There's a difference between cases being spread out and a cluster of infections on a team or teams.

The league said earlier this week 30 players tested positive for COVID-19 during voluntary workouts at team facilities between June 8 and July 12. Another 13 positive results came outside of the league's protocol, while 10 other players tested positive in the spring. Training camps opened Monday, but individuals and teams won't be named moving forward with regards to positive tests.

It's no secret players have hid countless injuries in the past, and the league has been criticized heavily for how it dealt with the concussion issue, but Mathieu Schneider, special assistant to NHLPA executive director Don Fehr, said the virus is different territory.

""If concussions were contagious, I think players would feel differently about it,"" Schneider said. ""Guys certainly understand the notion that if they are not honest with symptoms or how they might feel, that they put their entire team in jeopardy.

""There's going to be a huge onus on the players here in (training camp) to make sure that they're taking care of themselves and looking out for their teammates — going to the rink, going home, going to the grocery store, social distancing, wearing mask, washing your hands. All the things that all of us are practising every single day now.""

Toronto Maple Leafs defenceman Morgan Rielly said it simply comes down to common sense is in this new reality.

""It's on the players and our staff to be honest with each other,"" he said. ""You don't want to put anyone else at risk.

""You want to do what's best for them.""

Matthews finished third in the NHL with a career-high 47 goals, one behind Maurice (Rocket) Richard Trophy co-winners Alex Ovechkin and David Pastrnak, while also topping the Maple Leafs with a career-best 80 points in 70 games.

The 22-year-old Scottsdale, Ariz., native also established a career-low with eight penalty minutes, tied for the fewest among the NHL's top 100 scorers.

Johns missed all of last season and the first 47 games of this one with painful headaches due to post-concussion syndrome. He scored four games into his return on Feb. 3 against the Rangers, with his parents in attendance at Madison Square Garden.

“With COVID being what it is, my work with musicians from Canadian bands like Prism, Trooper, Idle Eyes, Barney Bentall, has ground to a halt,” Young said in email to the Record. “The side-effect of not be able to currently produce records and perform has opened up time to work on my own music, which never seemed to get done.”

Young was thinking about a longtime friend who works at Royal Columbian Hospital and had recently entered a promising new relationship.

“Then COVID swoops in, and because he is frontline in the pandemic, he can’t see his new love close up,” Young said. “My wife and I chatted about how that must be really tough. It inspired me to write this cheeky little pop-rock song, called Lock Down Love Affair. I hope it can put a smile on some faces.”

To date, Lock Down Love Affair has been viewed more than 11,000 times on YouTube.

Young, the in-house producer and engineer at Alchemy Sound Studios in New West, said COVID-19 is the latest blow to his industry.

“The recording studio business has gone from being ambushed by the MP3, which turned the music industry upside down, to Vancouver’s crazy real estate, which has forced most professional recording facilities out of business,” he said. “The responsibility of recording young, local, indie artists and Canadian legacy artists has fallen to the smaller, agile studios like myself at Alchemy Sound Studios. COVID is another blow that is hitting an industry already on its knees.”

Just as COVID was warming up, Young said he was finishing up work on a record project involving Al Harlow (Prism) and Kevin Stuart Swain (Idle Eyes/Barney Bentall.) He was also producing a record by fellow New West resident/artist Clayton Hill from Trooper.

Musicians, said Young, are in a bit of a pickle because of COVID-19 and restrictions on large gatherings.

“Playing music live has been an important part of my life and income,” he said. “On a local level, I regularly played music at the Union Jack Public House, whose owner Darell Myers has actively supported live music from the moment he took over the pub.”

Along with playing at the Union Jack on weekends, Young hosted a jam night every Wednesday evening. He said the jam night was a hub where music lovers and amateur and pro musicians could get together to hit the stage and socialize.

“This evening is greatly missed in the community,” he said.

Young said the “silver lining” in the COVID situation is that it’s given him time to finally work on personal projects that always seemed to get put on the back burner. You can check out Young’s new tune on YouTube – search for Lockdown Love Affair.",[]

The show is part of a series of stand-up performances that are being produced in support of local businesses to help them with recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. For each show, audience members are given a chance to enjoy the show for free with purchase of gift certificates from the local business in question (ranging from $10 to $50 in value) or to pay $10 for just the online show.

A press release notes that Minhas was one of many small business owners that were hit hard by the pandemic when he was forced to close his doors for more than two months. The performers wanted to help Minhas because he has been a longtime supporter of the local entertainment scene.

“Prior to closing, Heritage Grill and Begbie’s have been home to several arts programs, shows and communities including the ukulele club, open mic nights, live music, trivia night, Way Off-Broadway Wednesdays, drag and, of course, stand-up comedy,” the release says. “(Minhas) has been an advocate and supporter of the arts, and these comedians want to give back.”

The show is being produced by Life is Still Funny and Laugh Wild Comedy. It’s set to feature Ray Morrison, Simi C., Ragini Kapil, Kalyn Miles, Helen Schneiderman and Nina Wilder, and it’s being hosted by Christine Hackman.

Performers will be on site at the Heritage Grill, while audiences watch from home via Zoom. Virtual “doors” open at 7:30 p.m. for the 8 p.m. show. A Zoom link will be sent out an hour before the show (audience members need a Zoom account, which can be set up for free).

Tickets can be booked through www.eventbrite.ca (search for Grill and Tavern Comedy), or use a direct link at www.tinyurl.com/GrillandTavernComedy.

The New Westminster-based quintet is offering up a live-streamed concert on Sunday, July 5 from 100 Braid Street Studios – the group’s home base and, as they call it, their “living room.”

Quayside in the House will feature a set of the group’s favourite songs, pulled from their repertoire of original a cappella arrangements of pop music.

It’s being brought to the stage thanks to a New Westminster Responsive Neighbourhood Small Grant from the Vancouver Foundation.

Audience members won’t be allowed in to watch live, out of concerns over COVID-19, but the singers will be able to work together – at appropriate physical distance from each other – thanks to some new technology.

“Using in-ear monitors and microphones will allow the five of us to sing apart from each other while being able to hear the blend and voices clearly,” explained Stephanie Lam, who sings alto with the group.

The group’s sound engineer, Emil Wu, has been working with the technology to ensure the group can produce a clear sound for the online audience.

Lam noted that their tech use stems from training sessions they had with Tony Huerta, the sound engineer for international a cappella stars Take 6 and The Real Group. Huerta flew in earlier this year to give the Quayside singers a weekend intensive.

Along with the technology, the singers have benefited from having the spacious surroundings of 100 Braid Street to work in.

“100 Braid Street has also been a huge factor in why we can even do this, as the space is large enough, with tall ceilings and circulation, to ease our minds and fears of aerosols and droplets,” Lam said.

As a result, she said, the singers will be able to put on a concert that, despite social distancing, will still provide the musical intricacies experienced through a cappella vocal music.

Looking ahead, Lam said, the singers are hoping to be able to stage an outdoor performance – and a musically satisfying one, since the in-ear monitors and microphones will allow them to produce good sound, even physically distanced, in the open air.

Quayside Voices features the talents of Lam, Justin Pham and Troy Martell, along with Elyse Kantonen and Megan Dray – who are filling in for Maggie Ma and Alyssa Inouye, both on maternity leave.

The livestreamed concert will be free. You can find the stream through https://quaysidevoices.com/",[]

That’s the news released today by the B.C. government, which claims the move will allow help with the cannabis retail industry's need for more security-screened workers, as well as reducing costs to cannabis workers and reducing interruptions from having to go through criminal record checks.

The government claims the move will also “allow provincial security screening resources to focus on the qualification of new workers rather than the requalification of current workers who are already working in the legal cannabis retail industry.”

Security screening and re-screening requirements were implemented as a measure to keep organized crime out of the legal, non-medical cannabis market.

Screenings involve background checks with police, courts and corrections databases. To date, 4,300 workers have been screened.

All workers with a current valid security screening will have their security verification period extended from the date of their initial verification. Security verifications for all new workers will be valid for five years.",[]

Facing challenges in getting temporary foreign workers into the country and encouraging local labour into the market, farmers know all about covid-19.

So the news of a record $3.9 billion in sales last year may temper some of the adverse effects no doubt coming down the pipe later this year and beyond.

Areas of growth included a close to $300-million increase in cannabis sales, along with a $47-million increase in dairy sales, a $25-million increase in beef sales and a $17.5-million increase in field vegetable sales.

The figures represent an increase of more than 13 per cent, or $462 million, more than 2018.

Indeed, the B.C. government hopes 2019’s bumper sales in the farming industry is a sign of a strong recovery in the future.

""For the past three years, our government has been focused on helping farmers farm and strengthening food security,” said Lana Popham, Minister of Agriculture.

“We know the pandemic has impacted farmers greatly this year, but the farming sector's record economic growth in 2019 sets the sector up for a strong recovery.

“COVID-19 has opened our eyes to the importance of our province's self-sufficiency. I urge everyone to continue to show their appreciation for our farmers and support our local food system by making a special effort to Buy BC.""

As government works on the overall economic restart, more British Columbian farm workers are still needed to ensure B.C.'s agriculture sector remains strong.

""Connecting more British Columbians to agriculture jobs and careers is more important than ever as we work to restart the economy and keep this momentum going,"" added Popham.

“We are working together with industry as we focus on restarting our farming sector.""

In May, government launched the BC Farm, Fish and Food Job Connector and a digital campaign is underway to further promote these job opportunities for the summer.

* Farm cash receipts refer to the revenues from the sale of agricultural commodities, program payments from government agencies and payments from private crop and livestock insurance programs.

* Other sectors/commodities with increased sales include:

* eggs - $14 million;

* nursery - $14 million;

* chicken - $12 million;

* blueberries - $7 million;

* grapes - $5.6 million; and

* grains and oilseeds - $2.7 million.",[]

Along with completing an online survey, the city is inviting people to attend small group discussions on the topic. It’s also providing an opportunity for people to make arrangements to complete the survey in a different language (with a translator) by phone by emailing engage@newwestcity.ca or calling 604-527-4653.



“Engagement on the city’s pandemic recovery is expected to continue through the summer and into September 2020,” said a notice about the survey. “We will report back to council and the community in the fall about what we heard, and input received will be considered in recovery planning as well as various departments, projects and decision-making.”

article continues below

The survey asks community members to rank their level of support for the nine principles developed by the city to guide the city’s pandemic recovery plan.

“In responding to the pandemic, the city has worked quickly to put physical changes and supports in place to help manage impacts in the community,” says the survey. “Some examples include changes to roadways to allow more space for pedestrians and cyclists, allowing expanded patio space for restaurants, and exploring creation of new parklets (outdoor seating areas, etc. that are not connected with a specific business / no purchase required. In May, city council passed a resolution to “move quickly in 2020 to expand road re-allocation toward pedestrian, cyclist, and public gathering space, using temporary measures where necessary with a mind towards more permanent solutions that can be applied after the period of crisis has passed.”

Aside from initiatives that have already been introduced, the survey asks survey respondents if they have any ideas for additional physical changes or innovations residents would like the city to consider in their neighbourhoods or in New Westminster as it moves through the recovery period and plans for the post-pandemic future.

The survey also asks people to rank the community benefits the city is anticipating as a result of city council’s declaration of a climate emergency and support of Seven Bold Steps on climate change – initiatives approved prior to the pandemic. It also asks if there are any particular climate-action activities the city should prioritize through the recovery period.

Prior to the pandemic, council approved a 2019 to 2022 strategic plan that identified priority areas, which included: affordable housing; culture and economic development; environment and climate action; reconciliation, inclusion and engagement; and sustainable transportation. In light of “the new COVID-19 pandemic reality and thinking about recovery” the survey asks how important these priorities are now, what types of actions in these areas are most important, and if any new priorities have come to light because of the pandemic.

According to the survey, the pandemic has increased and drawn attention to ongoing social issues and inequities in New Westminster, including economic inequality, systemic racism, quality of long-term care for and social isolation of elders and people with disabilities, the opioid overdose crisis, food insecurity, lack of affordable housing, employment inequities such as precarious jobs with no sick leave or other benefits, increasing poverty due to job loss, lack of affordable childcare, domestic violence, and others. On this front, the survey asks what actions the city should take to build a more equitable, sustainable and resilient city, and questions the degree of support for the city’s efforts to take transformation action during the pandemic recovery and beyond.

“City council would specifically like to hear from members of demographic groups that have been disproportionally impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic,” said the survey. “This information is important to understand what perspectives might be missing from the conversation, and to ensure diversity of participation.”",[]

On Monday, city council approved a motion calling on the federal government to extend the emergency wage subsidy program until such time that businesses are able to resume business at full pre-pandemic capacity. The motion states Canada’s emergency wage supplement is currently making the difference between the survival and failure of many small businesses.

article continues below

While presenting his motion, Coun. Chuck Puchmayr said he had just learned the federal government had agreed to extend the benefit, which was set to expire Aug. 29. Given that council won’t be meeting again until Aug. 31, he said he wanted to ensure the city informed the federal government of its support for the program.

“One of the businesses that brought this up gave me a really good example; they would have lost probably half of their work force had this not if already been in existence,” he said. “Losing this program, they would lose a lot of their skilled workers.”

Puchmayr said one local restaurant has had to reduce its seating from 129 to 55 seats because of social spacing requirements, something that’s not sustainable for many businesses.

“There are many, many restaurants that are in this same position right now. As one of the owners said, this is a slow moving train wreck that is going to have some dire consequences – by the time COVID is over, there will be a lot of casualties,” he said. “This motion is to ask (the federal government) to continue that support and keep these restaurants viable, and small businesses that are limited to capacity limits.”

Mayor Jonathan Cote agreed the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy has been among a number of important programs helping Canadians through the pandemic.

“We know that many of our local businesses, definitely in some specific sectors, are going to have a rough period during this time,” he said. “I think it’s important that we show our support for these types of programs.”

Launched as part of the federal government’s response to the pandemic, Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) provides eligible businesses affected by COVID-19 with a subsidy of 75% of employee wages for up to 24 weeks. The wage subsidy aims to allow businesses to rehire workers previously laid off because of COVID-19, to help prevent further job losses and to put them in a better position to resume normal operations following the crisis.

New Westminster-Buranby MP Peter Julian says the federal government must do more to ensure Canadians are supported while business owners and workers begin to get back on their feet. - File

New Westminster-Burnaby MP Peter Julian said he welcomes the announcement that the CEWS program will be extended, but believes more help is needed for Canadian businesses.

“For weeks, we have been calling on the government to extend the CEWS past Aug. 29 and to adopt more flexible criteria so that more businesses can get the help they desperately need,” he said in a news release. “The existing criteria for CEWS is too restrictive, and New Democrats are pushing for changes to make the program more flexible.”

Julian, who is the federal NDP’s finance critic, said New Democrats have proposed a sliding-scale for the wage subsidy in order to help more businesses over the summer.

“Right now, if a business loses less than 30% of their revenue they don’t qualify for the CEWS. This arbitrary number chosen by the government is unfairly leaving too many businesses without the support they need,” he said. “Under the NDP approach, businesses with a smaller loss of revenue could still qualify for a partial wage subsidy so that more businesses get support.”",[]

Can you help?,['Darrell Hoekstra'],,"We are blessed to live in a society and a part of the world where we experience a level of freedom and prosperity almost unparalleled in the history of human existence.

We aren't often pushed (and then typically not far) outside our comfort zone. One of the things that COVID-19 has done is helped me to re-evaluate my priorities.

article continues below

To spend time thinking about what is really important in life. To recognize how pervasive an underlying attitude of selfishness and laziness has become in my life because of such ease. I believe this to be true (to some extent at least) of our society generally without denying for a second the very real hardships that we do still experience as human beings.

Call it a wake-up call, call it a paradigm shift, these lines of thought have galvanized me to action. My wife Mary-Lin and her two brothers Jonathan and Timothy all have Cystic Fibrosis.

This is the most common fatal genetic disease in Canada, affecting over 4,300 Canadians. There is a defect in the body’s cells resulting in the production of particularly thick mucus in the lungs which, if left untreated, creates the perfect breeding ground for bad infections.

Forty years ago, children born with CF typically died young. For decades, Canada has been at the forefront of research and development of therapies and improved patient care.

Now CFers often live into adulthood, sometimes even middle age. But it’s still not possible to beat the disease, with the final recourse of treatment being a lung transplant. As drastic a procedure as that is, it is really like putting a Band Aid on a broken leg.

I've known that Mary-Lin has CF as long as I've known her. I try to convince myself that I've been supportive in regards to her disease throughout the years that we dated and have been married. But, if I'm honest, I haven’t really done much about it.

I was reminded this spring about an annual cycling fundraiser called GearUp4CF that I first heard of a decade ago. When I was a teenager, I rode my bike all the time, so why haven't I been part of this for the last 10 years?

Well, better late than never. I jumped online and found the website (www.gearup4cf.com).

Turns out this year's fundraising ride is ""virtual"" to encourage social distancing. What that means is instead of a group ride, participants are setting personal challenges to complete individually. I signed up the same day, and set a fundraising target of $25,000. Within an hour, a ride challenge began to formulate in my mind.

I would ride to Penticton and back from New West in five days. I literally hadn't pedaled my bike for 10 years.

That was two months ago.

So, for the last two months I've been training. I knew I had to do two things.

1) Get my legs in shape. The ride requires me to pull off at least 150 kilometres per day for five days, with some real climbs involved too (day one includes summiting the Coquihalla)

2) Prepare my mind. I'm not an athlete, but I am in reasonably good shape and my work involves physical labour, so I was fairly confident I could prepare physically.

However, to pull off five long endurance rides in a row requires mental toughness as well. I realized that the mental training could come partly from the physical training. Confidence in my physical ability to accomplish my goal would go a long way towards being mentally prepared. Therefore, I would train towards a really hard training ride to be accomplished shortly before the actual challenge.

Darrell Hoekstra with his wife Mary-Lin, who has Cystic Fibrosis. submitted

Well, I dug out the rusty old mountain bike I bought as a teenager and brought it to the shop. I decided it was better to ride that than buy a new one so that I could kick-start my fundraising campaign with my own money (which I did).

Unfortunately, after a full tune-up and new tires, it was stolen out of my parkade after only a couple rides. I borrowed a bike for a week so I could keep riding (often commuting to the jobsite as a way to squeeze more time out of the day, since I was working fulltime) and then replaced it the next weekend.

Now the training could really begin. I've put 1,300 kilometres on the new bike in the last six weeks, and last weekend accomplished the last big training ride, a Triple Crown ride which involves summiting Seymour, Grouse and Cypress on the same day.

Which brings us to today. Now I just have to pull off five of them in a row, while sleeping on the ground and eating from a backpack.

On July 20, I'm leaving from New West early in the morning. And since five days might be too easy, my new goal is to do it ""as fast as possible.""

I'm going push myself hard every day, and post regularly to social media so people can follow along.

I want to say a heartfelt thank-you to all my supporters. Together we've raised $16,000 (over 60% of my goal so far!) and this money is so important for everyone whose lives are directly or indirectly affected by CF.

The funds are for CF Canada, a non-profit that works tirelessly advocating for and funding world class patient care and research into life-sustaining therapies and treatments and ultimately, hopefully, a cure.

You can help, too, by doing your part to protect immuno-compromised people like those with CF.

Washing your hands, staying home when you're sick, the exact things we're so aware of the need to do now due to COVID-19.

Normal little seasonal illnesses take a huge toll on someone with CF, and as Mary-Lin's husband I've observed the cumulative damage they have caused her over time.

Save lives by being an organ donor.

You can also help by sponsoring my ride. Donations go directly to CFCanada and are tax receipted. Just go to www.gearup4cf.com and search for Darrell. And follow along on Instagram (@darrell.hoekstra) if you'd like to see how the ride goes.

Together we can make CF stand for “Cure Found.”

No example is better than the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks in the United States, which gave us the “Patriot Act” after just 45 days of deliberation to expand government surveillance of Americans to previously unimagined levels.

In mid-April, the actions of Gabriel Wortman led to the deaths of 22 people in Nova Scotia after multiple shootings and fires. Most Canadians, at the time still under lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, were horrified at Wortman’s actions, which included impersonating a police officer.

article continues below

It took the federal government only 13 days after Wortman’s criminal activity was evident for the entire country to announce a nationwide ban on 1,500 types of military-grade “assault-style” weapons in Canada. Any Canadian who possesses these firearms will have two years to get rid of them. The prohibition led to many new discussions about the role that firearms play in Canada’s urban and rural areas.

We know now that the perpetrator of the 22 murders in Nova Scotia had obtained his weapons illegally from Canadian and American sources. This was not a surprise for Canadian authorities, who have consistently reported that more than 70% of the weapons used in gun-related crimes in our country come from the United States.

On the issue of firearms, Canada is decidedly different from the United States. In Canada, it is not legal for a person to own or carry a firearm for the purpose of self defence against human beings. When Research Co. and Glacier Media asked Canadians about this key precept of Canadian law, more than three in four (77%) agreed with it, while 18% disagreed and 5% were undecided.

Atlantic Canada (31%), Saskatchewan and Manitoba (29%) and Alberta (24%) boast the highest number of residents who openly question Canada’s long-standing regulations for firearms. While higher than what is observed in Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia, these are not proportions of voters that would sway an election, certainly not in the way American statewide and congressional races can be tilted if your candidate can adequately hold a shotgun and recite the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution in a manner that panders to the base.

Fewer than one in five Canadians welcome the notion of citizens carrying firearms for something other than hunting or scaring wildlife away. Any survey measuring opinions on banning “assault-style” weapons would be met with near unanimity. The opposition reacted to the announced ban as it always has under its outgoing leader, by claiming the regulations would affect law-abiding Canadians. Lost in this unfortunate combination of inadequate polling and incapable opposition are the solutions that matter to Canadians.

In our survey, more than three in five Canadians (63%) told us that gun violence in Canada is a “very serious” or “moderately serious” problem – a proportion that climbs to 69% among women and 68% among those aged 55 and over.

Sizable majorities of Ontarians and British Columbians, who have experienced gang wars in urban areas, are more likely to look at gun violence as particularly problematic (76% and 67%, respectively). The COVID-19 pandemic did little to curb gun violence in Toronto, where 61 people were shot in the first four months of the year.

We asked Canadians about the effectiveness of four possible measures, and their responses outline a public that is ready for bold action. More than three in five Canadians (62%) think enacting a complete ban on handguns would be “very effective” or “moderately effective” in reducing gun violence in Canada. Most crimes, after all, are not being committed with the military-grade “assault-style” weapons that the federal government was quick to ban.

A higher proportion of Canadians deem two other measures as effective: imposing mandatory jail terms for crimes committed with firearms (74%) and introducing new outreach programs to steer youth away from gangs (also 74%).

Canadians place dealing with firearms smuggled from the United States as the most important issue that needs to be addressed. Many of the country’s residents also want to make sure gangs are not attractive to our country’s youth and believe mandatory minimum jail sentences would act as a deterrent.

Banning military-grade “assault-style” weapons is low-hanging fruit in a challenge that definitely has Canadians preoccupied and wishing for a type of government intervention that goes beyond a photo-op celebrated by poorly executed survey charity work.

True sociologists know that we learn nothing from posing the wrong questions to Canadians, and capable politicians should go beyond voicing displeasure with plans and proposals just because that is what they are expected to do. Meanwhile, Canadians are still worried about gun violence and expecting their elected officials to do better. •

The metaphor suggested by the title of Christian Sands’ new album is apt.

The jazz pianist says he was trying to be freer and more flexible on ""Be Water,"" and it shows. The set's 10 cuts explore a wide range of moods and instrumental combinations, with Sands' trio at the core.

Much of the material is built on the same pattern of tension and release found in a body of water. That begins with the opening ""Intro,"" which settles on the tonic chord after nearly four minutes of shimmering undulation.

The reflective ""Still,"" featuring Marvin Sewell on acoustic guitar, rides a mere ripple of rhythm. On ""Be Water II,"" a string quartet plays against the lapping beat established by Sands' piano. Marcus Strickland's woodwind work makes ""Drive"" swing as it crests with a cascading electric guitar solo by Sewell.

Sands rarely cuts loose at the piano — his objective isn't to be splashy — but he takes an active role as the producer, overdubbing extra keyboards and including sound effects and brief recitations by martial artist Bruce Lee. ""Water can flow, or it can crash,"" Lee says. Forgive the flood of puns, but ""Be Water"" flows freely.",[]

The newspaper explained the decision in a note by Bill Sternberg, editorial page editor, attached to the column online. Navarro's column originally moved online late Tuesday and was published in Wednesday's newspaper.

article continues below

Navarro wrote that Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, ""has been wrong about everything I interacted with him on.""

The newspaper on Wednesday evening also ran a fact-check story by Washington reporter Ledyard King examining five of Navarro's claims.

It wasn't clear how Navarro's column escaped such scrutiny before being published. Sternberg said in an email that he's letting his editorial note speak for itself. The incident is reminiscent of The New York Times saying last month that an opinion column by U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton hadn't been properly vetted, which led to the resignation of the paper's opinion editor.

Navarro did not immediately return a message for comment.

USA Today said it had sought Navarro's opinion to accompany an editorial that the newspaper ran calling Fauci ""a national treasure.""

That editorial said the fact that Navarro was writing the opposing viewpoint ""shows how hard it is to find an actual medical professional willing to undercut Fauci.""

It wasn't clear whether the newspaper sought those opinions.

Fauci has essentially been shelved by the White House as a prominent spokesperson on the coronavirus pandemic because he's publicly been more pessimistic than the president. He does webcasts but rarely gives television interviews anymore.

Trump distanced himself from Navarro's column, saying Wednesday that the column was Navarro's views and ""he shouldn't be doing that.""

Navarro claimed in the column that Fauci opposed travel restrictions from China that were imposed by Trump that ""might well have saved hundreds of thousands of American lives."" USA Today said there isn't enough data to conclude the restrictions made a significant difference, and that despite some initial skepticism, Fauci backed the president.

The fact-checker also gave more context to Navarro claims about masks, the drug hydroxychloroquine and Fauci's early statements of concern about the virus.",[]

He’s returned to the charts in 2020, working on songs for rising and established rap stars, including Lil Wayne, Juice WRLD, Saweetie and Doja Cat.

The songmaster, who has been entangled in a bitter lawsuit with former collaborator Kesha since 2014, has produced and co-written Saweetie’s new single ""Tap In,"" the follow-up to her double-platinum smash ""My Type."" Dr. Luke also co-wrote and co-produced Juice WRLD’s ""Wishing Well,"" taken from the rapper’s first posthumous album ""Legends Never Die,"" released last week.

The recent successes mean all three major U.S. record label companies have worked with Dr. Luke this year, even if he hasn't always put his widely recognizable professional name to the new collaborations.

Dr. Luke marked a major comeback this year with the success of the Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hit ""Say So"" by rapper-singer Doja Cat, who is signed to Dr. Luke's Kemosabe Records. Dr. Luke, born Lukasz Sebastian Gottwald, produced several songs on Cat’s sophomore album ""Hot Pink,"" including single ""Like That,"" which is No. 5 on Billboard’s Hot R&B songs chart. He is the only producer with two songs in the Top 10 on the latter chart (""Say So"" sits at No. 2).

For his work with Cat, he used the alias Tyson Traxe. He used the same pseudonym for his production credit on Toronto rapper-singer Benny Mayne’s ""Hokey Pokey,"" released this year. For Lil Wayne’s ""Shimmy,"" a track featuring Cat on the deluxe edition of his latest album ""Funeral,"" Dr. Luke used the name Loctor Duke.

Label representatives for Saweetie, Juice WRLD, Lil Wayne and Cat didn’t immediately reply to emails seeking comment. Neither did a representative for Dr. Luke.

Luke has sprinkled his comeback among the major labels. Cat is signed to Sony Music’s RCA Records, while Saweetie is part of the Warner Music family. Lil Wayne releases music through his Young Money imprint and Republic Records, a division of Universal Music Group.

Before Dr. Luke topped the charts this year with ""Say So,"" he last had a No. 1 with Katy Perry's ""Dark Horse"" in 2014. Months later, Kesha accused him of sexual assault during their yearslong partnership (Dr. Luke has vigorously denied the allegations.)

A New York court dismissed Kesha’s sexual abuse-related claims in 2016 because of legal issues, without ruling on whether the allegations were true. Kesha lost another round in February, when a New York judge said she made a defamatory statement about Dr. Luke on a different occasion: a 2016 text message telling Gaga the producer had also raped Perry. Both he and Perry have denied it, and the judge said there was ""no evidence whatsoever"" to support the claim.

Kesha’s lawyers have said they plan to appeal the ruling, but it didn’t resolve other aspects of his defamation and breach-of-contract suit, including the crucial question of whether Kesha’s allegation that he raped her is true. The judge said that’s for a jury to decide at trial.

Outside of rap in 2020, Dr. Luke has produced music for pop singer Kim Petras, using the pseudonym MADE IN CHINA.",[]

But home care isn’t just about medical care, in fact it’s as much about helping seniors keep their independence for longer.

“For us, senior home care is about caring, not just health care,” Susan and Wendy Scott from Nurse Next Door say. “In our experience, once a senior begins to lose their independence, their happiness starts to disappear too, so we do everything in our power to help keep them in their own home as long as they want to remain there and can so safely.”

article continues below

Here the Scott’s draw on their experience with seniors to share the four keys to happier aging.

1. Play: Seniors with a full dance card of hobbies and passions are much less likely to fall foul to the pitfalls of social isolation that we traditionally associate with old age. However for a variety of reasons seniors can find themselves drifting from passions that were once a key part of their lives. A good caregiver’s job involves helping seniors to continue the pursuit of their passions, helping them to maintain hobbies and interests that encourage them to remain active both socially and physically.

2. Connections and relationships: No matter what age we are, personal connections with our friends and families remain crucial to living happy and healthy lives. Research has shown that those people who maintain their interpersonal connections live longer than people who are isolated as they get older. As well as making us happy, maintaining these relationships can also impact our health, boosting things like our immune systems, lowering blood pressure and alleviating depression.

3. Learning: We’ve all heard the saying “It’s never too late to teach an old dog new tricks” but did you know the same applied to us humans too? Indeed ongoing learning, even in the later stages of our lives, has been widely proven to help boost health and longevity.

4. Travel and adventure: Whether it’s soaking up some Vitamin D on a pristine beach or venturing off of the beaten track, everyone has dreams of travelling. And these don't just stop as we start to get older. Many seniors have had to shelve their dreams and aspirations due to family commitments, work, or financial constraints. But those dreams never fade and just because you are getting older doesn’t mean that they cannot become a reality.

Here are four we’re seeing in memorial and funeral planning, according to Andrew Knapman Location Manager of Burnaby’s Forest Lawn Funeral Home.

1. Cremation is becoming more and more popular as opposed to a more traditional burial or mausoleum interment. “B.C. has one of the highest cremation rates in North America because of space concerns … Also, the further West you go, the less traditional people tend to be,” Knapman explains. That said, a lot of people are purchasing cemetery property for cremation so that families have a site at which to visit their loved ones.

2. These days many people are taking a proactive approach to their funeral planning by arranging many of the logistics—from the music to flowers to ceremony rituals—before they pass on. Not only does this help take the burden off of loved ones, it also ensures that you are remembered the way you want to be.

3. There’s also a trend towards putting a more optimistic spin on what has traditionally been a sad event by planning a Celebration of Life, where a person’s accomplishments, contributions and passions are the focus of the occasion. “It can be a time to memorialize you and talk about the stories that surround you,” says Knapman.

4. In terms of funeral service ideas, many people are foregoing the traditional church ceremony and personalizing the event. “We try to encourage clients to think outside the box,” says Knapman. Often, that means incorporating symbols of your loved one’s passions into the event. For one family that meant driving the funeral hearse around a race track to commemorate a person who had a deep love of car racing, says Knapman.

Between Oct. 24 and Dec. 5, the city received rezoning and business licence applications for cannabis retail stores at 22 locations around the city. Following an evaluation process, staff recommended five applications for retail cannabis stores including four private stores – Maple Leaf Greenery at 71 Sixth St. (downtown); Muse Cannabis – 532 Sixth St. (uptown); the Herb Co. Cannabis Store – 451 East Columbia St. (Sapperton); and Westcanna – 710 12th St. – and one public store to be operated by B.C. Cannabis Stores at Queensborough Landing Shopping Centre.

article continues below

As part of a plan to allow five initial cannabis retail shops to open in New Westminster, city staff evaluated all of the applications using a checklist that includes items related to: location and land use; business operations, nuisance and security; and esthetics (such as signage, windows and gates).

The city’s plan has been to see a blend of public and private operators, and to have one shop in each of the downtown, uptown and Sapperton neighbourhoods and two shops in remaining commercial areas. At Monday’s meeting, council voted four to three to consider the Queensborough Cannabis Co. Ltd.’s application for a store at 540 Ewen Ave. instead of the government store in Queensborough Landing.

“I understand that council originally was hopeful or interested in the idea of a public cannabis store to be part of the first stores that opened. I support that, except I feel that the B.C. Cannabis Store that has put forward an application has scored quite low as compared to the other location in Queensborough,” said Coun. Mary Trentadue. “I don’t feel that the argument of having a public store is strong enough to outweigh the scores of those two. I feel an independent store has done its work. It’s provided all the information required. It has a fairly high score, and I think that’s a reasonable reason to put forward that business, as opposed to the B.C. one, which has not scored well at all.”

Because the city’s plan was to have a mix of public and private stores, Coun. Jaimie McEvoy said the staff recommendation was consistent with the process laid out by the city.

“I believe in the role of the public sector in this. I think it’s important,” he said. “I think the role of the B.C. Liquor Branch in this is going to be a critical part of its success, particularly in a community-sensitive location like Queensborough. That role is going to be an important part of seeing how this works and being able to compare and draw lessons from both the public and private sector, rather than just one of those sectors.”

Councillors Trentadue, Patrick Johnstone and Nadine Nakagawa and Mayor Jonathan Cote supported consideration of the application from the private store, while councillors Chinu Das, McEvoy and Puchmayr preferred having a government-run store in Queensborough. (BC Cannabis Stores had an overall score of 28, compared to the Queensborough Cannabis Co. Ltd. score of 40.)

Council has directed staff to prepare a zoning amendment bylaw to permit the retail sale of cannabis at the five locations in the city and will consider first and second readings of the bylaw on April 8. The city will hold a public hearing on April 29, at which time council would also consider third reading and adoption of the bylaw.",[]

These have included multiple committees and working groups aimed at supporting neighbourhoods, businesses and residents.

As pictured above, some roads have also been reallocated to allow physical distancing.

I think it’s a great idea and one the city should consider continuing well into the future. Making communities friendlier to pedestrians and cyclists is the way of the future. We need to get people out of their pollution-spewing vehicles.

If you like this idea and want to keep it, the city has a survey that needs your input. You can also have a say on a variety of other pandemic issues as the city looks forward.

“This survey is only one way to participate in the city’s recovery planning and visioning for a post-pandemic future,” reads a statement by the City of New Westminster. “Later in the survey, we will ask about your interest in participating in small-group dialogues on this topic. City staff will also be reaching out to a wide variety of community groups, and their members, clients and networks, to gather input.”

This disgusting anti-abortion material has started arriving in New West mail boxes and mail slots.

article continues below

The flyers are being called out for the terrible images displayed and the anti-choice message.

“Hey #NewWest, someone just put a very graphic anti-choice/anti-abortion flyer through my mail slot,” tweeted New West resident @IjustKat. “It appears there is active campaigning in our city attacking the rights and autonomy of people with uteruses over our own bodies .., it’s gross enough on its own but something about putting it through my mail slot into my house that makes it extra offensive.”

That’s a key point for people. Someone coming onto your property and inserting it through a mail slot also exposes children to the graphic images, which can be seen embedded in this blog post.

Flyers being delivered by hand to residents. Screenshot

I wrote recently about a father of two named Dustin whose children sadly saw the graphic flyers.

“My kids went to get my neighbours mail as they were away,” Dustin said. “I found our 7 and 4 year olds sitting on my neighbour’s front lawn looking at that disgusting anti-abortion pamphlet. My 4-year-old ran to his room screaming. I phoned the RCMP and they said they would call the company to suggest they don’t distribute them that way. They didn’t care to find the person distributing them.”

I’ve included a photo below of one of the images because some readers said they wanted more ""proof,"" but I have blurred out the more disgusting parts of it.

People legally have a right to print up flyers like this, but I don’t feel they have the right to step on private property and inflict this on people.

I wrote recently about Keith, a Burnaby resident with two young children who get a kick out of going to grab the daily mail from the box outside his home.

Luckily, Keith’s kids didn’t see the flyers.

“(They) would have been greeted by very explicit images that should not be shown to kids,” said Keith.

Keith checked the footage from the security cameras he had installed and they show a woman with a stack of the flyers dropping one off.

The flyers were not delivered in a sealed envelope and Keith thinks that, at the very least, they should be.

“As the pamphlets are not delivered in a sealed envelope, they often end up in the hands of children,” he said. “And the girl delivering the flyers could clearly tell we have kids by the amount of kids’ stuff around our yard. Distributing graphic images like these, which easily end up being viewed by children, should be illegal. Movies, books and games all have a rating system and packaging must be made appropriate. These images are worse, and should be provided only with a warning.”

The question was one faced by parents around British Columbia as their children’s schools sent out surveys asking one deceptively simple question: Do you intend to have your child return to in-class instruction starting June 1?

article continues below

It’s amazing how complicated one simple question can be.

For the record, I said No. My daughter isn’t returning for in-class instruction in New West on Monday. But I can’t remember the last time a simple question caused me so much what-iffing, but-waiting and on-the-other-handing.

My initial response to the news that schools were reopening their doors in June was one huge and enthusiastic “yahoo!” Our seven-year-old is an only child. She’s been learning at home since March break, while my husband and I have both been working remotely at jobs that have demanded more-than-full-time attention.

Finding a way to spend time with her has been, without a doubt, the single biggest challenge we’ve faced since we all came home for March break and never went back to our outside lives. Trying to engage and interact with her, to help her figure out the necessary technology, to make sure she’s on top of her assignments and gets her half-hour of reading done and writes her daily journal and checks out her virtual music lesson and doesn’t try to sneak extra YouTube videos in while she’s supposed to be doing Mathletics and then trying to think of ways we can all get fresh air and exercise and do something fun because you’re supposed to do something fun every day and why can’t I just bake cookies and if I was a good mom I would be baking cookies right now and helping her learn how to do more household chores and after all this pandemic isn’t supposed to be all bad I mean other people are having fun right now so why am I not having fun and why am I not sleeping and somebody hand me the Advil because I have a migraine and dammit I’m not supposed to take Advil now because wasn’t there something about Advil and COVID-19 so fine make it Tylenol and where is my coffee and

and

and

My right eye is twitching again just typing it all out.

Suffice it to say, sending our daughter back to school seemed like a good idea.

The thought that somebody else – somebody trained and qualified and good at teaching; somebody she’ll listen to and learn properly from instead of digging in her heels and resisting help – would take over her education? Yes, please.

And friends? In the solitary life of only children everywhere, Facetime and Messenger Kids have been her lifeline to other humans under the age of 10. And even though she’s an introvert at heart who enjoys her own space and keeps herself company pretty well, it’s not the same as spending time with other kids.

Returning to class, even part-time, could only be a win all around – for my husband, for me and for my daughter.

But wait.

We’re still in the midst of a viral pandemic. And, although all indications at this point are that the virus doesn’t transmit readily among groups of children, there are still a lot of question marks. What do we really know about how the virus will react until we try it out and see? And do I want my child to be part of one of those test groups? What if it all gets worse, fast, once groups of kids start assembling again? Do I want our family to come in contact with so many other people who may or may not have been taking social distancing as seriously as we have?

But wait.

I know the school district is taking its direction from people who know far more than I do. The B.C. Centre for Disease Control and public health officials and the Ministry of Education wouldn’t be clearing the return to school if they hadn’t decided, based on science and evidence, that it was possible to minimize and contain the risks.

But wait.

Even if our daughter does go back to school, will her friends be there? And will she really enjoy it, given how different the school day is going to look? If the kids aren’t allowed to work together and interact normally and play on the playground like they usually would, is she going to get the kind of social interaction that is at least half the reason we want to send her back? On the other hand, isn’t some social interaction, even limited and restricted interaction, better than none at all?

But wait.

If she doesn’t go back to school, can I keep doing this? Can I really make it through another month of muddling through home learning while I’m trying to navigate a full-time job? Can I handle being the “bad guy” every day (or, more accurately, taking turns with my husband being the bad guy) and forcing her to do the schoolwork she’d rather skip and dealing with the subsequent moods and attitude? Do I even want to try?

But wait.

Anxiety. She’s an anxiety-prone kind of kid, and we’ve finally managed to work through a lot of the anxiety she had – and, let’s face it, that we had - about the world turning upside down around us. We’ve found a bit of a “normal” in the way we live now, and we’re making it work (ish), so do I want to turn that all on its head, again, for the sake of a few weeks of school? If she takes a couple of weeks to get used to a new routine – and she always does – then is it even worth it for the little time that’s left in the school year?

But wait.

Is it fair to our daughter’s teacher to keep her home, when the teacher is going to be in class and ready to teach? Is it fair to my daughter to keep her home if her friends are going to be at school? Is it fair to me and my husband to keep her home when our jobs are still as demanding as ever? Is it fair that I even feel like all of this isn’t fair, given that we’re both employed and we have a home and we lack for nothing and we rate pretty damn high on the scale of pandemic privilege?

So yeah.

That “do you intend to send your child back to school” question was a simple one. It just didn’t come with a built-in guaranteed right answer.

In the end, our daughter’s own verdict that she’d rather continue learning at home tipped the balance for us. But even as I filled out “No” on the survey and sent it back to the school principal, I wondered if we were doing the right thing.

I still wonder.

It helps to know that our daughter is, after all, in Grade 2. Realizing that whatever decision we make, her entire academic future is not at stake here – well, that helps. And so does the fact that she has a dedicated and supportive teacher who has been 100% available to her students and their families since this crazy journey began. She’s assured us that our child will be fine, either way, and that she’s here to support the decision that works best for us.

So I feel good about our “No.” Mostly.

But let me be clear: I’m not casting judgment on anyone who said Yes and whose children will be back in school on Monday. I can think of a thousand reasons why parents want – and, in some cases, need – to have their children back in class. My decision isn’t intended to in any way cast aspersions on those reasons. I only hope that, by having families like ours step out of the in-class instruction part of learning, perhaps we can free up some of the teachers’ time and attention for those students who need that face-to-face contact more than we do.

We may still change our minds.

If COVID-19 has taught us nothing else, it has at least taught us that we can’t predict what life’s going to throw at us next. Everything may stay very much the same for the next month. Or everything could be upside down tomorrow.

All we can do is make the best decision for us right now, with the information we have available. And if something changes? Well, we’ll move on and do the next right thing – whatever that may be.

For all my fellow parents who’ve agonized over all of this too, solidarity. And for the teachers and administrators who have been working so phenomenally hard to make remote learning work and then to gear up for the return to class, all without missing a beat for our kids, my deepest gratitude.

As for my daughter? Well, she just got off a long Messenger Kids chat with her aunt in Toronto and is now, I suspect, sneaking YouTube videos instead of doing Mathletics.

But you know what? She’s done all her work for the week, and she’s not in any danger of losing her Grade 2 year if I give us both a break and let it go.

So I think I’ll pretend not to notice and have an iced coffee while I sit on the patio and proofread this post.

Here’s to the weekend – and here’s to Monday, whatever it may bring.",[]

Me too.

article continues below

I’m sitting here writing this post as an act of solidarity with all of the parents who are also muddling through the brave new world of working full-time from home while attempting something resembling “home schooling” with your children.

Let me preface this up front by saying this: I know what a fortunate position I am in. Right here, right now, this house has two partners who are both working full-time. We are caring for one child, we have a freezer and a pantry full of food, and we have enough tucked away for a rainy day that even if it all came crashing down tomorrow we’d be fine for the time being.

These are blessings that I don’t take for granted.

But, while my gratitude for full-time work (work that I love and happen to get a paycheque for) remains boundless, it also means that neither my husband nor I have the time to be as engaged and involved with our daughter as we’d like. All those marvellous lists of resources and educational ideas for parents that are going around social media? They’re awesome, but the chances of me having time to delve into them, let alone sit down and actually interact with my child to make most of them happen, are slim to none.

I do not need any posts about “how to make baking muffins an educational activity for your child” or “how you and your child can build a backyard rocketship.” What I need are basic strategies for survival. Period.

So I’m writing my own.

Thanks to some crowd-sourced wisdom from the New West Moms Group on Facebook, I have come up with this list of strategies to help you stay sane while you pretend this is a balancing act you can actually accomplish.

Take what will help you, discard what won’t, or just swear at me from the comfort of your own home if it’ll make you feel better.

Here, for what it’s worth, are my 10 survival strategies:

1. MAKE SURE EVERYONE HAS A WORK SPACE.

Whether you have an actual “home office” or you’re working on a laptop in the living room, try to make sure everyone in the house has a defined work space – and that includes your child. Everyone needs a space where they can go to be (mostly) uninterrupted and where they can work without being distracted by others.

Be sure your children know that when you’re at your work space, you’re working and therefore not meant to be interrupted except for important questions. Offer them the same courtesy in return with their schoolwork space.

Consider making your own “Do Not Disturb” sign to hang next to you when you really need a designated amount of quiet time (for an important meeting, for instance).

No, you’ll never stop the “Moo-ooooom” questions. But the more you can provide visual cues that you are “at work” or “at school,” the more you can help your whole family separate those tasks from the “at home” hours – and the more fun it’ll be to hang out together when you’re all “at home” again in the evening.

Or, at least, you can tell yourself that. It hasn’t entirely worked for me yet, but I remain convinced that it’s a strategy that will pay off – eventually.

2. ACCEPT REALITY.

Reality #1: You’re not at your office, so your dream of uninterrupted time to focus on work is officially on hold. Indefinitely.

Reality #2: You’re not “home schooling.” You’re pinch hitting in a crisis, to the best of your ability (whatever that means for you), but unless you’re actually a teacher in real life, you’re not a teacher – and you didn’t just suddenly become one because your kid is sitting there staring expectantly at you expecting you to make this all make sense for her.

So work isn’t going to be “normal,” and neither is school. The faster you can accept both of those facts, the better off you’ll be.





3. COMMUNICATE.

Communicate with your own work team – your co-workers, your boss – and being clear about what you can and cannot achieve and when you can and cannot be available. No one (well, no one with any common sense and compassion) expects that you’ll be the exact same employee you are at the office when your child is safely ensconced at school or daycare. Everyone knows you will have some distractions and that maybe the old nine-to-five expectations are off the table right now. Talk to your team, if you need to, about how you can all help each other make this transition to working at home easier.

Even more importantly, communicate with your child’s teacher. That teacher is still guiding your child’s education, and he or she is now also struggling to navigate some very unfamiliar territory. Stay in touch. If you’re struggling to help your child, reach out. Chances are other parents are struggling, too, and the more honest we all are with the teachers in our lives, the more those teachers will be able to help us help our children.

And, above all, communicate to yourself. Repeat to yourself, as many times a day as you need to: I am not alone. We are in this together.

4. BE FLEXIBLE WITH YOUR HOURS.

How much of your work must be done at a certain time, and how much do you just stick to your routines because that’s how you’ve always done it? Your answer will be individual to your own situation, but, wherever possible, now’s the time to rethink the way your schedule works.

If you have a partner in the house, sit down and rethink your schedules together. Can one be the “more available” parent in the morning and one in the afternoon? Can some work get done in the evenings or on the weekends? Can you take longer lunch hours to give yourself a chance to play in the backyard or go for a walk with your child in the middle of the day? However you can free yourself up to give your child some attention and engagement during the day, it’s worth giving it a try.

And if that way fails? Then try something different. These days life is all about different. Go with it, and see what kind of new “normal” you can create for your own family in a world where nothing is normal at all.



5. SET UP A SCHEDULE.

Whether you’re the kind of person who likes to map out your day down to the minute or the kind who likes to go with the flow, everyone – especially the small humans in the house – will benefit from some kind of routine.

Decide how your household’s “schedule” is going to work. Whether it’s a list of tasks that can be accomplished in any order (which is how we like it), or whether it’s a specific hourly plan, commit that plan to paper and post it in a place where you can all see it.

My daughter’s in Grade 2; I know that her academic future won’t be irredeemably altered if she fails to complete her journal writing or her two tasks in Mathletics today. But having those expectations written down on a task list helps her, because she can take her checklist and run with it while I do my own work (and, yes, answer the inevitable questions that arise while she’s working).

Another help for us? Build rewards into your schedule to keep everyone motivated. For my kidlet, it’s earning extra screen time by finishing academic, creative and household tasks. For me, it’s sitting down with a glass of Naramata rosé and a satisfying murder mystery novel to end my evening.



6. KEEP EVERYONE FED.

Snacks, snacks and more snacks. Make sure your day, and your child’s, includes food.

It seems like a foolish thing to say, but it’s amazing to me how often I can “forget” to eat when I get engrossed in something work-related. And if you have a child who, like mine, suffers from a bad case of the hangries when food doesn’t arrive on time, you want to be prepared.

However you choose to provide that food is up to you. Maybe your household works best with specific snack items set out in easy-to-reach bins for the kids so they can grab their own food when they need it. Maybe you’re more of a fridge free-for-all family or a formal-sit-down-meal household. Whatever your style, just keep everyone nourished and hydrated.

And then do it all again tomorrow. And the next day. And the next day. And the one after that.



7. GET OUTDOORS AND GET MOVING.

Your child needs fresh air, and so do you. And, here on the West Coast, we’ve been blessed by the arrival of spring in all its cherry-blossom-and-magnolia-tree glory. So get outside, every day. Twice a day if you can. Whether that means taking a longer lunch to get outdoors together, going for an early-morning jog or taking to your neighbourhood streets for an after-work stroll, make sure you get out and give yourselves that brain break.

And get moving. Crank the tunes and throw yourselves a dance party, search out some yoga on YouTube, or whatever it takes to work out your body and shake off some stress. Heck, just run laps around the yard or the living room if it helps.

Tire out all the bodies in your house, and hopefully all the minds will sleep better.

8. RELAX SCREEN TIME RIGIDITY.

I know, I know, you have screen time limits for a reason, and so do I. But we can all allow ourselves to relax those limits – at least a little - right about now.

If you absolutely need your child to stay out of your hair while you’re in a Zoom meeting, or you have two hard hours of work to complete on a tight deadline, then maybe a movie on the TV or a half-hour of precious games on the iPad will be the solution to buy you the time you require.

If your child is a bookworm who loves reading more than screen time, then embrace the magical unicorn that you are raising and let her go to town on books instead. But for the rest of us mortals? Screen time may be just the break we need.

9. LAUGH.

Seriously, just start laughing now, because it’s all crazy, and someday it’ll have to be funny because if it’s not funny you’ll just start crying and you might not stop.

So find the funny side, fast. And if you can’t find the funny side in your daughter’s attempt to dress the cats in Easter outfits or in your own attempts to produce home baking, then turn to the experts and put on your favourite funny TV show or podcast, or seek out some comedy on YouTube. Or something. Anything to get the giggles going.

Embrace this new life you are leading, in all its bizarre gloriousness, and laugh. And, yes, laughter tinged with overtired maniacal hysteria is still laughter.

10. ALLOW YOURSELF THE GRACE TO BE IMPERFECT.

You’re going to suck at this sometimes. Probably even a lot of the time. You’re going to be stressed, frazzled and emotional. You may lose your patience with your child, forget to return a phone call, or not remember what day it is. And you may do all of those things with or without a shower, with or without clean hair, and with or without pants.

You are not in fact an incurable mess. You are just a human being, navigating what is undoubtedly the strangest time in your personal history. It’s OK if that contact has to wait a few hours for an email, or if your child does not in fact finish her two tasks in Mathletics today.

Her future and yours do not depend upon perfection. They depend only upon you showing up and doing your best, whatever that looks like today.

That’s it. That’s all I’ve got. And if you see a frazzled-looking mom with her unwashed hair in a messy ponytail wearing the same leggings she’s been wearing for a week and dragging a whining blonde seven-year-old around the neighbourhood for a walk, that’s probably me.

Feel free to say hi. I’ll say hi back, and I promise I’ll even smile.

We may or may not actually have this whole situation in hand. But whatever happens, remember: we’re all in this together.",[]

But right now, it just pisses me off.

article continues below

When I see a troop of teens huddled together on the beach, sharing drinks and scooching closer to snap selfies, it doesn’t make me miss my high school days, it makes my stomach turn.

This isn’t a snow day, and it’s not the spring break social time that we’ve come to expect during this time of year.

We have yet to see the worst of this global pandemic, and while some seem to be brushing off the warnings by the authorities, I’m starting to take their ignorance personally.

COVID-19 is spreading quickly, and we’ve been urged to stay home and act as though we’ve already contracted the contagious disease.

Many cases are mild enough that the carrier doesn’t realize that they’ve been infected. One visit to a family member or friend, and the virus is passed on, and the spread continues.

In one of her latest updates, Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer, urges residents to stay home, and only go out for essential trips such as to the grocery store. She emphasized that it’s alright to go for walks, but only with the members that live in your household.

Playdates are not ok. Coffee dates with friends are unacceptable. Crowding into public spaces - even if they are outdoors, is not practicing social distancing. Continuing to do these things will put our province in the same position as Italy, with rapidly spiking cases and increasing death rates by the hour. We could be where they are, only weeks from now, if we don’t start listening to the cautions today.

Physicians are working together to help spread the word, encouraging everyone to stay indoors. In an email sent to my aunt by her own physician, the content reads, “The time to act is now. Our province is in a state of emergency. What we do today will impact the health of British Columbians in the weeks to come. Stay home unless absolutely necessary. No dinner parties. No shopping. No sports, not even outside. Instead, have coffee with a friend online. Keep six feet or two metres away from everyone at all times. Call your loved ones and tell them to do the same.

Remind young people in your life that they can get sick from this virus. More importantly, they can be carriers and cause a lot of harm to parents, grandparents, and other loved ones.”

I get it, your kids are bored. Your teens are craving social interactions, and you need to separate stir crazy siblings. But it’s time to listen to the experts.

Our city shouldn’t have to tape up playgrounds, close down coffee shops, and barricade beaches to get you to stay home.

Because the only thing more annoying than staying home, is knowing that other people aren’t.

She didn’t seem concerned, more just curious about the introduction of a new word to her ever-growing vocabulary, and as she looked back down at her Lego structure that she was building, I realized that it was time to be honest with her.

Because while I’ve spent the last couple of weeks hovered over my computer, watching live Q&A broadcasts with the World Health Organization (WHO), reading updates on the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) website, and following the latest travel advisories posted on Health Canada, my kids have been mostly in the dark about the quickly-spreading disease.

Last week we cancelled what was going to be our first-ever family trip abroad, a two-week trek through the south of France for spring break, and since then, our plans have been ever-changing. Maybe we’ll just go to Palm Springs or Phoenix instead? Nope, increased cases in the US. Maybe we’ll visit another province in Canada? Nope, air travel is not recommended. A ferry to Victoria? Social distancing doesn’t recommend time spent in such close quarters with so many people.

As I write this, the coronavirus has spread to 146 countries, with over 153,000 confirmed cases around the world - 73 of which are right here in BC. Things are changing by the hour, and while we’re all, for the most part, trying to remain calm, most of our kids are concerned, curious, or confused as they watch us as we watch things evolve.

It’s time to be open and honest with our kids about the coronavirus and all that’s happening around the world. They need to know why they can’t go to Science World, or hang out at the mall, and they need to know the severity of the situation.

Start by asking them questions to find out what they know - or think they know already. Then, let’s not just tell them to wash their hands, but explain why it’s more important than ever right now. Let’s explain to them that it’s not just about us getting sick, but about the people around us who are already sick or immunocompromised too. Let’s make sure they know that it’s not ok to make jokes about COVID-19 as the global death toll continues to rise.

Let’s tell our kids where to find the facts, and not to listen to the fiction that is filling their ears from friends and on social media platforms. Let’s explain the border closures and self-quarantines and stockpiling that’s happening, and let’s also show them videos of how people are coming together, supporting small businesses, providing for their sick neighbours who need help, and using this pandemic to come together as a community.

And then let’s comfort them, let them know that we’re here to answer their questions, and that we’ll do our best to keep them healthy and safe. And let’s follow through with that promise, because friends, this is only the beginning.

518,newwestrecord,https://www.newwestrecord.ca/opinion/more-b-c-cannabis-consumers-choosing-legal-suppliers-over-black-market-poll-1.24171397,More B.C. cannabis consumers choosing legal suppliers over black market: poll,['Mario Canseco'],,"Marijuana has been legal in Canada for just over one and a half years.

The notion of establishing a framework to commercialize cannabis began as a promise by the Liberal Party in the 2015 federal election campaign that led to Justin Trudeau becoming prime minister. The implementation of the policy was not as smooth as first envisioned, and the provincial governments were put in charge of setting guidelines for the sale and consumption of marijuana.

article continues below

Research Co. and Glacier Media have been tracking perceptions about legalization every six months in British Columbia. Our latest survey shows that agreement with the new rules remains high across the entire province, that some residents are starting to ponder a future when other drugs could be treated in the same fashion as cannabis, and that – in stark contrast with what we found last year – marijuana users in British Columbia are starting to acquire all of their product through licensed retailers.

As more time passes, British Columbians appear happier with the decision to end prohibition. Seven in 10 of the province’s residents (70%) agree with marijuana being legal in Canada, while 26% disagree and 3% are undecided.

These findings represent a seven-point increase since a similar survey conducted in October 2019, as legal cannabis approached its first anniversary. The groups that are more likely to voice satisfaction with the new status quo are men (75%), British Columbians aged 35 to 54 (76%) and residents of northern B.C. (80%).

In recent weeks, we have seen more talk about creating a safe supply for drugs that are currently available only through illegal means. The impact of these discussions has led to a shift in the views of British Columbians about legalizing all drugs. It must be completely acknowledged that sizable majorities of the province’s residents continue to oppose a move to place any controlled substance inside a store, but the proponents of this option have grown since late last year.

At least two-thirds of British Columbians are opposed to legalizing ecstasy (66%), powder cocaine (70%), heroin (72%), crack cocaine (73%), methamphetamine or “crystal meth” (74%) and fentanyl (75%).

Support for making some of these drugs available in a fashion that would conceivably meet the same guidelines that govern cannabis has risen over the past six months, to 25% for cocaine (up from 18%) and to 24% for heroin (up from 19%). While these are still low proportions, the fluctuation could signal the start of a trend.

Just 10% of British Columbians say they only consumed marijuana after it became legal. Identical proportions of residents tried it before October 2018 (45%) or have never consumed it in Canada (also 45%). The incidence of “legal-only” marijuana users is highest among residents aged 18 to 34 (18%) and those who live in southern B.C. (19%).

But perhaps the biggest surprise, and a source of satisfaction for policy makers, is the way in which cannabis is being sought by users. Just over half of British Columbians who have consumed marijuana since legalization (51%) say that all of their product was acquired at a licensed retailer. In October 2019, only 31% of cannabis consumers in the province were getting all of their product at a licensed retailer.

We still see 16% of British Columbians who say none of their marijuana has been bought at a licensed retailer – a proportion that climbs to 25% among those aged 55 and over. Two-thirds of cannabis consumers aged 35 to 54 (68%) are buying all of their product at a licensed retailer.

Even though the delivery of cannabis products has improved over the past six months, there are significant regional differences that are indubitably related to the presence of stores in specific areas of the province. Cannabis consumers who reside in southern B.C. and Metro Vancouver are the most likely to be getting all of their product from licensed retailers (63% and 62%). The numbers are significantly lower in Vancouver Island (29%), northern B.C. (24%) and the Fraser Valley (19%).

Finally, the issue of “drug testing” remains a priority for British Columbians, with 61% saying that companies in the province should “definitely” or “probably” be able to administer these examinations to any employee now that marijuana is legal.

After a bumpy start that featured slow store openings and hitches with delivery options, there are signs that cannabis legalization is starting to work in a better fashion. More consumers are getting all of their product through licensed retailers, and the number of “new users” has not increased dramatically. Still, the significant regional disparities suggest that more marijuana outlets will need to be authorized in order to effectively eliminate the black market.

Hate-fuelled graffiti on the home of a Summerland family. Systemic racism and sexism, both overt and covert, at all levels of society.

Prejudice is indeed pandemic. Bigotry is a virus. And we all have the potential to be hosts (even those of us from racialized minorities).

We’re not born with it in our blood. It’s transmitted from person to person. From family to family. It’s learned through conversations, comments, jokes, judgements, looks, books, micro-aggressions, political rhetoric, insults, attitudes, ignorance, and even classroom lesson plans.

It infects entire institutions to the point where everyone within the organization becomes immune to biased hiring practices, offensive language, token diversity, racial and religious profiling, and exclusive, patriarchal power structures.

And like COVID-19, it won’t just go away on its own. We have to track it and attack it. We have to trace it, isolate it, and call it out. By name. Persistently. We have to propose anti-racist policies, pass anti-racist laws, and push for anti-racist consequences.

We have to stop passively and proudly saying we’re not racist. And we have to start actively and loudly being anti-racist. We have to listen to those with lived experience.

We have to hold elected officials (and each other) accountable. We have to. And we can.

The world has changed dramatically over the last two months, since George Floyd took his last breath on May 25, 2020. In many ways, the globe has gotten smaller, as evidenced by the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus (with about 13.5 million cases worldwide and over 580,000 deaths and rising), and the massive outpouring of protesters on city streets from Vancouver to Sydney screaming that Black Lives Matter.

No matter what language we speak or what corner of the Earth we inhabit, “social distancing” has become a part of our everyday vocabulary and behaviour.

Yet science has proven that all human beings – regardless of colour, class, culture, gender, or sexual orientation – are inextricably linked like never before.

As the motto goes, we’re all in this together. Overnight, we’ve all become armchair epidemiologists. Following the lead of our Provincial Health Officer, Dr. Bonnie Henry, British Columbians have sacrificed and worked hard to flatten the curve of COVID-19.

Complacency is not an option. We can’t afford to go backwards. And we must be equally vigilant and aggressive to finally squash the scourge of white supremacy, police brutality, systemic racism, and hatred in all its insidious forms.

Silence is no longer acceptable. We’re in a pandemic. And lives are at stake.

520,newwestrecord,https://www.newwestrecord.ca/opinion/gun-violence-imported-from-u-s-is-a-key-concern-for-canadians-1.24169958,Gun violence imported from U.S. is a key concern for Canadians,['Mario Canseco'],,"National governments have a tendency to overreact immediately after they are forced to face an unexpected challenge. No example is better than the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks in the United States, which gave us the “Patriot Act” after just 45 days of deliberation to expand government surveillance of Americans to previously unimagined levels.

In mid-April, the actions of Gabriel Wortman led to the deaths of 22 people in Nova Scotia after multiple shootings and fires. Most Canadians, at the time still under lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, were horrified at Wortman’s actions, which included impersonating a police officer.

article continues below

It took the federal government only 13 days after Wortman’s criminal activity was evident for the entire country to announce a nationwide ban on 1,500 types of military-grade “assault-style” weapons in Canada. Any Canadian who possesses these firearms will have two years to get rid of them. The prohibition led to many new discussions about the role that firearms play in Canada’s urban and rural areas.

We know now that the perpetrator of the 22 murders in Nova Scotia had obtained his weapons illegally from Canadian and American sources. This was not a surprise for Canadian authorities, who have consistently reported that more than 70% of the weapons used in gun-related crimes in our country come from the United States.

On the issue of firearms, Canada is decidedly different from the United States. In Canada, it is not legal for a person to own or carry a firearm for the purpose of self defence against human beings. When Research Co. and Glacier Media asked Canadians about this key precept of Canadian law, more than three in four (77%) agreed with it, while 18% disagreed and 5% were undecided.

Atlantic Canada (31%), Saskatchewan and Manitoba (29%) and Alberta (24%) boast the highest number of residents who openly question Canada’s long-standing regulations for firearms. While higher than what is observed in Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia, these are not proportions of voters that would sway an election, certainly not in the way American statewide and congressional races can be tilted if your candidate can adequately hold a shotgun and recite the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution in a manner that panders to the base.

Fewer than one in five Canadians welcome the notion of citizens carrying firearms for something other than hunting or scaring wildlife away. Any survey measuring opinions on banning “assault-style” weapons would be met with near unanimity. The opposition reacted to the announced ban as it always has under its outgoing leader, by claiming the regulations would affect law-abiding Canadians. Lost in this unfortunate combination of inadequate polling and incapable opposition are the solutions that matter to Canadians.

In our survey, more than three in five Canadians (63%) told us that gun violence in Canada is a “very serious” or “moderately serious” problem – a proportion that climbs to 69% among women and 68% among those aged 55 and over.

Sizable majorities of Ontarians and British Columbians, who have experienced gang wars in urban areas, are more likely to look at gun violence as particularly problematic (76% and 67%, respectively). The COVID-19 pandemic did little to curb gun violence in Toronto, where 61 people were shot in the first four months of the year.

We asked Canadians about the effectiveness of four possible measures, and their responses outline a public that is ready for bold action. More than three in five Canadians (62%) think enacting a complete ban on handguns would be “very effective” or “moderately effective” in reducing gun violence in Canada. Most crimes, after all, are not being committed with the military-grade “assault-style” weapons that the federal government was quick to ban.

A higher proportion of Canadians deem two other measures as effective: imposing mandatory jail terms for crimes committed with firearms (74%) and introducing new outreach programs to steer youth away from gangs (also 74%).

Canadians place dealing with firearms smuggled from the United States as the most important issue that needs to be addressed. Many of the country’s residents also want to make sure gangs are not attractive to our country’s youth and believe mandatory minimum jail sentences would act as a deterrent.

Banning military-grade “assault-style” weapons is low-hanging fruit in a challenge that definitely has Canadians preoccupied and wishing for a type of government intervention that goes beyond a photo-op celebrated by poorly executed survey charity work.

True sociologists know that we learn nothing from posing the wrong questions to Canadians, and capable politicians should go beyond voicing displeasure with plans and proposals just because that is what they are expected to do. Meanwhile, Canadians are still worried about gun violence and expecting their elected officials to do better. •

Dear shoppers: While the rules are slowly being relaxed regarding limits on how many people are allowed in a business, don't forget that social distancing still applies.

Please check the signage before you enter a business and remember that any business that wants to stay open has to abide by the rules as they are told to, and it is not the sole decision of the individual business owners or employees.

The rules apply to everyone and no businesses are intentionally trying to cause an inconvenience for shoppers. Don't expect the same rules wherever you go; some places count individual customers, some count groups of people up to a certain limit; some count couples as two individuals and some count them as one.

Some businesses request customers to wait outside if they are at capacity, so please have patience with staff and other shoppers; you will be called in. (This is also the procedure at the medical labs if you go for a test.)

Interrupting staff while they are helping someone else only causes a delay for everyone. If you phone a business and they don't pick up right away, phone back in a few minutes rather than right away.

Lastly, put enough money in the parking meter because you never know if you will encounter an unexpected delay; give yourself time to have a good shopping experience.

I am a resident of Sapperton and I live adjacent to the Royal Columbian Hospital.

article continues below

Recently, I discovered that there is an amazing new microbrewery here in Sapperton operating out of the industrial park just south of Sapperton SkyTrain station.

As the crow flies, Another Beer Company is about four city blocks from my front door and should take about five to seven minutes to walk to. Sadly, the route between the village of Sapperton and the industrial park is bisected by Brunette Avenue, the railway and the SkyTrain.

The route I was forced to take took me 30 minutes and I was forced to detour about three kilometres via the Braid Street railway crossing on Brunette and through a winding series of industrial park streets that were very unsafe to walk as a pedestrian.

I eventually arrived at ABC and sat in their lovely in-house tasting room with a dozen other people who had made the journey to sample their brewery offerings. Amazing staff, pleasant surroundings, great beer.

It should be noted that ABC is about a block south of Sapperton station, whereas I live two blocks north of the station, so instead of detouring around the Braid crossing again, I decided to use the “south end stairs” access to Sapperton station.

I used my Compass card to access the stairs and walked down the platform and out the main exit/entrance to access the north side of the station.

Unfortunately, my compass card was deducted $4.50 for the privilege of walking through the station and being inside the Compass system for only a few minutes.

My concern as a citizen of Sapperton and the growing business area south of Sapperton station is that the only safe access to this area from the north side of the station is through the Sapperton station and that going any other route including the Braid level crossing represents a significant danger to personal safety as a pedestrian.

I am therefore advocating that TransLink reset the card system at Sapperton station to allow “pass through” access for pedestrians to the south end of the station and that they also install signage and way-finding that allow for “south station” access.

At present, there is legal entrance access at the base of the south stairs, but no signage inside the station indicating there is an entrance/exit. It’s a secret.

It is clear that when Sapperton station was built that there was little need for south station access, although it was engineered into the construction of the station.

Presently, due to the explosive growth of Sapperton, there is an immediate and direct need for pedestrians to access the south station stairs for commuting in both directions and to also allow for pedestrian “pass through” to access the area south of the station, as this is the only safe access due to a lack of pedestrian accessibility by any other means.

I have brought this matter to TransLink and I am advocating that the City of New Westminster, as well as the growing business and residential community to the north and south of the station, improve access via Sapperton station and thereby improve the pedestrian safety and business visibility of this rapidly growing community.

The current session of the B.C. legislature is exhibit A in support of that thesis.

article continues below

The legislative chamber is often so empty, I half expect to start hearing echoes when I watch the proceedings on Hansard television. In order to enforce physical distancing, there can only be a maximum of 25 MLAs in the chamber at any one time and that occurs usually only during Question Period three times a week.

Everyone else participates in debates via Zoom chats, with the speaker or the chair calling on individual MLAs who are hunkered down at their office desks whenever it is their turn to speak (and occasionally reminding them to unmute their mic).

In terms of getting work done – passing bills and reviewing ministry spending plans – the new approach has been a success, with few glitches. Kudos to the house leaders, the clerks and Speaker Darryl Plecas for making it work.

However, the lack of human interaction is having a noticeable impact on political discourse - the normal cut and thrust of debate that traditionally frames B.C. politics.

“I’m Zoomed out,” said Dan Davies, the BC Liberal MLA from Peace River, told me last week. “It’s so tiring and you’re just sitting there, talking to a computer all day.”

Government House Leader Mike Farnworth agreed with that assessment and noted energy levels had dropped in this unusual, virtual session.

“You just don’t have the same atmosphere. You don’t pick up on the body language from those across the floor,” he said. “Everyone’s using scripts, there’s not a lot of spontaneity and you can’t get a read on anyone.”

BC Liberal MLA Jas Johal – Richmond-Queensborough - said the current Question Period bears no resemblance to pre-pandemic ones.

“Personally, I would much rather see the whites of a minister’s eyes when I’m challenging them,” he told me. “Video will never replace that.”

The public gallery seats are empty as the legislature building remains closed. The hallways are quiet.

Even press gallery members remain out of sight in the Speaker’s Corridor or the press theatre, where the news conferences and ministerial and opposition availabilities occur. Reporters are hooked up via a phone line and a pool TV camera operator records the proceedings.

A challenge facing every legislative body right now is appearing relevant in a pandemic that shattered the world economy, led to millions of people being out of work and continues to pose a dangerous health threat.

The B.C. legislature is not immune from that challenge. Politicians have to take care not to appear to be politicians in the traditional sense.

This is a particularly difficult issue for opposition parties to address. The BC Liberals have to walk a fine line between raising issues of legitimate importance and others that might have been raised in the past, but now seem rather pointless.

And they now have to walk that line in a virtual world, which allows for political debate to occur, but only in a dull, emotionless process.

As we slowly adapt to the pandemic, we will find our “new normal” in all kinds of places. Eventually, we will find it in B.C. politics as well and that is when the liveliness will return.

We have seen how the Trudeau government has been doling out billions of taxpayer's money, however, has seen fit to provide only $300 tax free to seniors who currently receive Old Age Security and Canada Pension Plan. This is a one time payment!

Seniors are those Canadians who have suffered through World Wars and the Great Depression. They have survived by hard work and savings for their retirement. Their savings and investments have been severely affected by COVID-19 and now they are subject to reduced income from investments and possibly faced with selling their residences during a real estate downturn.

Seniors count and are important to Canada, having contributed significantly to the growth of the economy and values of freedom, diversity and equality for all. It is now time for the Trudeau government to come to the table and top up pensions for seniors for an appropriate monthly amount under various COVID-19 programs.

Police Act review handcuffed right from the start,['Chris Campbell'],,"I hated having to use “handcuffed” in this blog’s headline, but it seemed a fitted word to what’s going on with the review of the B.C. Police Act.

Right from the start, the review has been tainted some of the people chosen to review the Police Act.

article continues below

In a statement announcing the creation of the committee doing the review, Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General, said that the Police Act is “out of step with our government’s approach our work with police services on important issues including harm reduction and mental health.”

“Everyone deserves to be treated fairly by the police, and our government acknowledges that for many Black, Indigenous and other people of colour, that hasn’t always been the case,” Farnworth said in an email to Glacier Media. “Ensuring the police are held accountable to the highest standards for fair and unbiased conduct is crucial to maintaining public trust.”

That sounds good and I’m sure all the intentions are good, but I have some issues with who is on the committee and you should too.

The nine-member committee includes four NDP MLAs, four BC Liberal MLAs and the Green Party’s Adam Olson.

Two of those MLAs are former police officers, Garry Begg (MLA for Surrey-Guildford) who is a former inspector with the RCMP and Mike Morris (MLA for Prince George-MacKenzie), who is a former RCMP superintendent for the North. He also served as solicitor general under the BC Liberals.

And this is the problem.

“Black, Indigenous and other people of colour,” as Farnworth described, have consistently said police, be they RCMP or municipal forces, are rife with systemic racism and out to protect themselves.

So I object to having two former police officers on the committee. What is needed are people from outside of the system taking a fresh look, not two former cops who are tainted by their association with the RCMP. (Read about what the RCMP has done to its female members of the years.)

The committee will be consulting widely with people across the province on policing in order to examine whether the Police Act, created in 1975, needs tweaking, changing or if some parts can be eliminated, committee member Jas Johal, the MLA for Richmond-Queensborough.

Those are the voices we need to listen to, not former members of a police force.

This is the kind of thing that people hate about “reviews” – the devil is always in the details about the scope of a review, the terms of reference and those controlling what happens on the committee.

I am a particular maniac when it comes to B.C.-grown cherries. I must admit I felt a little sticker shock a week or so ago when I saw the cashier ringing in my bag of cherries. She paused, looked me dead in the eye and asked if I really wanted to pay $13-plus for the bag of purple delight. I barely flinched and thanked her for asking but said that yes, I have to have them.

The thing with cherries is that if it rains on the orchard close to maturity, the cherries will spilt and become unmarketable to most consumers. The flavour is still there, of course, but the appeal of a split cherry on the store shelf is woefully low.

article continues below

Some growers will pay $1,000 an hour for helicopters to hover over the orchards after a rain to dry the trees and the fruit preventing a crop failure. This solution can take care of an acre in about five minutes

The other problem with the cherry harvest is the usual pickers are not as available as they were pre-COVID-19. Typically, hundreds of domestic “backpackers” from Quebec would make the trek to the Okanagan this time of year but the pandemic has kept most of them at home. Likewise, migrant workers from Mexico and the Caribbean that usually work the orchards are hamstrung by border access issues despite field workers being classified as an essential service.

Locally we look to be in good shape. A fantastically warm April saw a great start to our field crops and a moist start to summer is promoting growth. When the heat comes, and it will, we will be in good shape to enjoy the bounty grown for us by our local farmers. Remember to buy B.C. to support our farming community.

On a micro-local basis, the Farm Roots field in Boundary Bay is in early summer glory. The small farm is producing some fantastic food. Several hundred Russian Red garlic bulbs are curing in the school and hundreds of pounds of new potatoes have been harvested and make it to the farm stand daily along with super sweet snap peas, turnips, scallions and other early season goodies. The 250-metre walk from field to farm stand make these offerings the freshest around.

The young farmers that I work with are now officially on summer vacation but I see them around all the time. Just this past Tuesday I was greeted by three sets of two students on scooters and bikes while watering their school farm at English Bluff. It was a warm and sunny day and they pleaded with me to spray them with the hose. Farmer Mike happily obliged with enthusiasm. The switch from shower mode to “jet” was appreciated by the kids.

The school district has prepared signage that I will be installing at the school farms to remind us all to maintain social distancing when visiting school farms and community gardens during the pandemic.

Keep your distance and enjoy our local bounty.

I applaud your decision to protect people, especially when you enter indoor public places. Unless, of course, you’re not wearing that mask properly.

I’ve seen too many people attempt to “wear” a face mask, but then ruin things by doing what the dude in the above photo is doing. (The photo kills me because it’s NBA player Daniel Theis from my beloved Boston Celtics, but what he’s doing is being done right here in Burnaby.)

Too many people are wearing their mask below their nose. Or their mask is only covering their nose and not all of their mouth. Or, in extreme cases, the person just says, f*%$ it, I’m going to just let it hang around my neck. I’ve seen at least two people have the mask loop just hanging off of one ear as they parade around a grocery store.

It’s like they think the mere approximation of the mask to their face – without actually covering the face – is enough to protect themselves and others.

It’s not, of course. I hate to get all preachy, but wearing the mask incorrectly is dangerous and embarrassing to you. People are literally laughing at you behind your back.

This is how you wear a mask. - ENGIN AKYURT PHOTO/UNSPLASH

Look, I get it. Wearing a mask is hot. I can’t wear my reading glasses and my mask at the same time because the glasses fog up. And so, I just move the phone or restaurant menu farther away from me so I can, well, sort of read it.

Compromises are necessary to ensure safety and stop the spread of COVID-19.

“Make sure your mask is well-fitted over your nose, mouth and chin, and that it is secured to your head with ties or ear loops so that you do not have to adjust frequently,” says Canada’s top public health official, Dr. Theresa Tam. “Try not to touch the mask or your face while wearing the mask, as this is another route of infection. Some people may not realize that masks can become contaminated on the outside. Wash your hands before and after putting on and taking off your mask using soap and water or a Health Canada-approved hand sanitizer. Only you should wear your mask - please do not share it with others.”

While there are some merits to participating in this licence scheme around the integration of transportation options and data collection, I think that a basic condition for ride-hailing agencies such as Uber and Lyft, as well as food-delivery services such as Skip The Dishes and DoorDash, to operate in the Metro Vancouver region should be that workers for these types of companies must be classified as employees and not as independent contractors.

article continues below

These workers must be guaranteed employment rights and paid at least a minimum wage net of vehicle expenses and other incidentals.

There are many reasons why the failure to ensure this basic floor is economically unjust, but the problem of the distribution of economic risk is worth considering in the growth of the gig economy.

One of the broad trends in the economy over the last 50 years or so has been the downloading of risk from the aggregate to the individual in ways that have increased economic insecurity for many people.

In The Great Risk Shift, the political scientist Jacob Hacker describes various aspects in which the downloading of risk has been harmful in society: the decline of defined-benefit pensions has led to more retirement insecurity for individuals, the deregulation of financial institutions has led to various kinds of financial insecurity, and the erosion of collective bargaining and the outsourcing of employment have led to increased insecurities for workers.

The rise of the gig economy increases economic insecurity. It doesn't just merely unlock certain side jobs for people who are already affluent; rather it shifts more economic risk from the employer to the employee, as outsourcing leaves workers with fewer protections and less stability.

I'm not really worried about voluntary contingent arrangements that I would call ""flexible,"" but rather I'm concerned here with involuntary contingent arrangements – situations in which workers want more stability and protection – which would be more appropriately described as ""precarious.""

While outsourcing in the gig economy has undeniably led to increased income inequality – with all of its attendant problems – another important issue to consider is the way in which the gig economy has increased income volatility such that lows in month-to-month income fluctuations have become lower for average workers, and this has seriously harmful effects not just for individual workers but for the community more broadly.

Skip the Dishes photo

To get a more detailed sense of the problems faced by gig workers in Canada, the following two resources are worth consulting: The Tyee’s “Life in the Gig Economy” series outlines the challenges and pressures faced by gig workers; and CPA Canada’s “The Perils of Living Paycheque to Paycheque” explores the serious problem of income volatility in the Canadian context. The economic realities described in these resources should lead us to fight for income security for workers in the gig economy.

A common objection is the ""if you don't like the work conditions, why don't you get another job?"" type of response. But this objection has at least two problems with it.

First, the objection seems to presume that there exists a plentiful supply of secure jobs such that any one individual could reasonably opt out of contingent jobs structured in a model like Uber or DoorDash and move to more secure structures in the economy.

If this were really the case, there wouldn't be as much of a problem here. But the gig economy is something that is growing in scale and we should be deeply concerned about a situation where a large class of workers can't find work outside of precarious gig structures. Thus, it is important to limit and even reverse some of the pernicious elements of the gig economy.

Second, the objection arbitrarily locates responsibility with the worker rather than with the employer. Indeed, one could just as easily say the following to executives and investors at a company like Uber or DoorDash: ""If you don't like ensuring a minimum floor for workers or can’t do it while maintaining a viable level of profitability, then why don't you start a different kind of business where you can do these things?”

A licence to operate a ride-hailing agency or delivery service isn’t a right, but a privilege that should require meeting some basic threshold of ethical and legal standards – ensuring the provision of a minimum wage net of vehicle expenses and other incidentals is one such standard.

I want to conclude by emphasizing that none of this is to disparage the invaluable work done by transportation and delivery workers in our community. Helping someone to ferry groceries home or delivering a meal to someone immunocompromised in the midst of our current moment are examples of things that do our community a great service; thus, the province is right to classify these kinds of work as essential.

But if our praise of these workers is to have substance, it needs to be accompanied by a demand for economic justice.

In fact, I would argue that reciprocal fairness demands that workers who provide for our essential needs should themselves be provided with a living wage sufficient to meet their own essential needs.

While it would certainly be worth exploring how governments and businesses could work together to ensure a living wage for workers, a good place to begin is by ensuring that gig workers are never paid below a minimum wage.

To Anonymous who moved to Victoria from California: Welcome to Canada. I am glad you cleared your 14-day self-isolation. If you arrived from California last month then you have had time to change your license plate over to a B.C. plate. That would avoid some of the hassle you feel you are getting.

We in B.C. have done an excellent job of flattening the curve, unlike California who had 11,694 new cases of COVID-19 reported Wednesday, July 8. That same day, B.C. reported 18 new cases. So we aren’t under a mandatory rule to wear masks when indoors or outside unless we want to. And most people are social distancing. Obviously, people weren’t paying attention to the risks in California and didn’t take the necessary precautions earlier on. There is a price to pay for that.

Another reason we Canadians are not being so nice right now is because people from the States that cross our borders into B.C. and Alberta are saying they are driving straight through to Alaska. Bad loophole.

One couple in Golden did not go straight to Alaska. Instead they did the tourist thing and were forced to self-quarantine for 14 days. Four people in Banff were up from Texas, another hot spot, and freely admitted (rather stupidly) that no, they weren’t going to Alaska, they were on vacation.

So don’t get so bent out of shape when we Canadians want to keep flattening the curve and advise visitors to stay away. You can come and visit us when this pandemic is over and not until then.

The current health pandemic has shone a light on the cracks in many of our public systems, and BC Parks is no exception. B.C.’s provincial parks have been chronically underfunded since the early 2000’s, with minimal resources to manage nearly 15% of the land in our province.

This lack of funding has caused many issues within parks. Parks rangers are few and far between, leaving areas with no one to monitor for illegal activity such as wildlife poaching and dumping. There are decades worth of maintenance and planning to do, to keep up with demand for outdoor recreation while safeguarding nature.

As BC reopens our communities and green lights local travel, camping and hiking in provincial parks provide one of the most affordable and spectacular ways to explore the province. To keep these places open safely, we must invest in BC’s parks.

Investing in parks means investing in community wellbeing.

Contained in the government's election commitments was a promise to maintain and improve facilities and services in our parks. Now is the time to live up to those promises.

This year’s presidential campaign in the United States will be very different from the ones of elections past, with the COVID-19 pandemic affecting public gatherings, events and conventions.

article continues below

Research Co. has been tracking this democratic process, and some themes are starting to emerge. The last presidential contest that saw an incumbent seek a new term took place in 2012, when Democrat Barack Obama ultimately defeated Republican Mitt Romney. I had the privilege of following that election from start to finish, and there are many differences between what we saw eight years ago and the mood of Americans in 2020.

In July 2012, there was no clear frontrunner in the race for the White House. Obama and Romney were supported by 47% of decided voters across the United States, with Independents barely breaking in favour of the incumbent president. Obama could count on the votes of most women and young voters, while Romney connected well with men and older voters.

This year, the situation is dissimilar. Trump, the Republican incumbent, sits 10 points behind prospective Democratic Party nominee Joe Biden at the national level. Across the country, in a survey that was completed before the Independence Day celebrations, 53% of decided voters said they would cast a ballot for Biden, while 43% would support Trump.

Independents, who backed Trump over Hillary Clinton in 2016, are no longer happy with the president. In this crucial group, Biden is ahead of Trump by 15 points (54% to 39%). Unless the numbers tighten among American voters who do not align themselves with the Democrats or the Republicans, Trump’s chances will fade.

In our tracking, Trump’s approval rating dropped to 40% this month, down six points since we checked in early June, well into the COVID-19 pandemic but before the protests about racial equality dominated media coverage. An approval rating hovering around 50% is usually an indicator of a lost election for an incumbent president. Trump is significantly below this threshold right now.

Trump’s approval rating is particularly bad with African Americans (21%) and Latino and Hispanic Americans (32%). These two groups are usually supportive of Democrats, so the results are not earth-shattering. Still, his numbers also fell to 46% among White Americans.

When we asked Americans to select six words out of a list of 18 to describe Trump, almost three in five selected “arrogant” (57%). Of the six words chosen, the only one that is remotely positive is “strong” (36%). More than a third of Americans perceive their current head of state as “dishonest” (40%), “uncaring” (39%), “foolish” (also 39%) and “out of touch” (34%).

This does not mean that Americans are enthralled by Biden. When we pose the same question about the prospective Democratic Party nominee, about three in 10 Americans describe him as “intelligent” (32%), “compassionate” (also 32%), “down to earth” (30%), “honest” (28%), “weak” (28%) and “out of touch” (28%).

We could look at Biden’s results as superior to Trump’s, since only one of the six words is overly negative (“weak.”) These numbers are very different from what Barack Obama and Mitt Romney posted in July 2012.

At that time, 50% of Americans regarded Obama as “intelligent” and 46% felt the same way about Romney. In an exceedingly polarized nation, the numbers on this indicator are significantly lower for both Biden (32%) and Trump (31%).

Right now, Biden is clearly favoured at the national level, but we still need to look into the way specific American states will behave. The Democrats hope to win the three jurisdictions that took Trump to the White House (Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin) and perhaps make inroads in Florida and Ohio.

No election is decided four months in advance. In any case, three indicators point to Biden enjoying unique advantages in 2020: Trump’s weak approval rating, reminiscent of what Jimmy Carter and George H. W. Bush posted in 1976 and 1992, his difficulties in reconnecting with Independents, and a lower proportion of voters willing to cast a ballot for a third-party candidate.

In 2016, almost 6% of all cast ballots in the American presidential election went to third-party candidates, most notably Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party and Jill Stein of the Green Party. This year, Americans are not looking at third parties as much as they were four years ago, with only 3% selecting Libertarian Jo Jorgensen or “some other candidate.” However, we collected our data before a man called Kanye Omari West flirted with becoming the Ross Perot of the 21st Century.

Many were complacent when we started to see the rate of the disease spread slowing in China, so it was a surprise that a woman with no contacts with China but who had travelled in Iran had contracted the virus.

article continues below

The case also appeared to be a surprise to B.C. health officials, who admitted that the case was a sentinel event.

Thankfully, the 30-year-old woman took it upon herself to bring her case to the attention of authorities, even though all messaging had been directed towards people travelling from China.

Now, while authorities watch for signs of a global pandemic, we wonder whether more could have been done to protect students in School District 43 when it was learned that students somewhere in the Fraser Health region were in contact with the sixth coronavirus case.

For now, authorities are saying, approximately, ""Trust us.""

People want to know what school may have been affected but authorities are refusing to tell, saying that they need to respect people’s privacy so they will come forward if they have symptoms.

Given what has gone on globally, B.C. residents aren’t so ready to trust, and the sheer fluke of catching that sixth case is not reassuring — apparently, it’s the result of the province having a low threshold for approving a test.

What we have seen in other countries is a lack of transparency and awareness that has resulted in the spread of the virus, as has happened in South Korea and Italy, so it would seem that naming any affected schools would not so much put people at risk as provide peace of mind to the majority, and a way to distribute information to those in the contact zone.

There are other areas where B.C. health officials are less than forthcoming, too, especially how our province is preparing for a possible pandemic this year and when the disease comes back next year, as it surely will without a vaccine ready in time.

Are beds being set aside for isolation wards? Is there a transport system and equipment available for people needing ventilators? And what other initiatives are in the works?

How is coronavirus different from the cold, flu, SARS and other respiratory ailments? And why should we be concerned?

Should people stockpile food and medicine? Should businesses have plan? Are doctors willing to sign forms for people needing to explain to employers their need for quarantine? Can extended health benefits be provided for people needing to stay home until they are non-symptomatic?

Finance Minister Carole James announced in her budget last week that the 7% provincial sales tax will now be added to carbonated drinks that have sugar. The tax takes effect on July 1 and is forecast to generate $27 million in revenues in the 2020-2021 budget year.

According to one expert, children's health in British Columbia will benefit from this decision to tax sugary soda drinks.

Dr. Tom Warshawski, chairman of the Childhood Obesity Foundation, told the Canadian Press that studies show sugary drinks contribute to obesity, a leading cause of Type 2 diabetes, heart disease and hypertension, and health outcomes have improved in jurisdictions where sugar taxes are levied.

Warshawski, a consulting pediatrician from Kelowna, said sugar drinks are not healthy and the tax will shift people to choose healthy drinks like water. Warshawski said it may take a decade to collect data on improved health results for children in B.C., but he's seen remarkable changes with young patients who cut out sugary drinks.

""When I see kids, who are drinking sugary drinks and I get them to shift away from sugary drinks, I see a return on that change in behaviour within a month or so,"" he said.

According to the Canadian Cancer Society, research published in 2017 by the University of Waterloo estimated a 20% excise tax on sugary drinks would save more than 13,000 lives in Canada and prevent 600,000 cases of obesity and 200,000 cases of Type 2 diabetes over 25 years.

The research concluded the drink tax would result in $11.5 billion in health-care savings over 25 years and provide total government revenue of $43.6 billion.

Other countries are doing this, including Belgium, United Kingdom, Mexico, Chile, France, Portugal, Norway and Hungary charging an excise tax of 20% on such drinks.

Eight cities in the United States also levy sugar taxes, including Berkeley, Calif., where a University of California study published last year in the American Journal of Public Health found sugar-drink consumption was down almost 52 per cent in some neighbourhoods and water consumption was up 29%.

Warshawski said he and other health-care officials had been calling on provincial governments in B.C. to impose the 7% provincial sales tax on the drinks for years, but their efforts were rejected until Tuesday's budget.

""It was long overdue, but give them their credit,"" he said. ""It's hard for government to introduce new taxes. There's always a political backlash of some degree.""

We haven’t seen much of a pushback from the general public, other than some grumbling.

The fact is, we already tax dangerous things like cigarettes, so making sugary drinks less desirable doesn’t seem like much of a stretch.

“Frankly, it depends on the product you’re installing,” says Darrell Bedford, Director of Brand Communication at Wizard Screens. “We offer premium quality, custom-built screens and each one is professionally installed. That’s part of what makes them the best in the industry.”

Known for their constant innovation and industry-leading customer focus, Wizard Screens are not only completely customizable, they’re also really secure.

“Our screens are made with a stainless steel mesh and installed in heavy-duty aluminum frames,” says Bedford. “They’re extremely secure, assuming it’s installed correctly. When you buy a premium screen, you need a premium installation process. Otherwise, the product can’t do its job properly.”

Wizard has been an authorized vendor for Home Depot US since 2007 and is currently the largest manufacturer of screen doors in Western Canada. Their products include VistaView screens for oversized openings, SecuraView screens for added security, and their landmark

RetractaView Rectangular Screens, generally held to be one of the best retractable screen doors available.

“At the end of the day, if you’re going to invest in a premium screen door, you want to ensure that you’re getting the most out of it,” says Bedford. “You might be really handy, but the professional installers do this sort of work all the time. Wouldn’t you rather have an expert do it for you?”

Screen doors are a great way to open your home and circulate cool, fresh air during the warmer months. And now more than ever there are options to suit just about every need.

Early eye exams are an important part of ensuring good eye health for young children, even those as young as six-months old.

“There’s a misconception that kids don’t need to have their eyes examined until they start school,” says Dr. Errin Bligh, an optometrist at FYidoctors, located in the Royal City Centre in New Westminster. “But the earlier they come in the better, so we can monitor their development from an early stage.”

In addition to serving the varied needs of adult patients, the clinic runs a successful pediatric practice, using advanced equipment that allows the Doctors of Optometry to examine a child’s eyes before the child is able to talk. Amazingly, the equipment lets the doctor know what a child can or can’t see.

With a six-month old child, the Doctors of Optometry at FYidoctors are looking for any significant problems that will affect a child’s visual development, or even their general health, as signs of health conditions often appear in the eyes first.

Dr. Bligh attributes part of the clinic’s pediatric success to its all-female team of eight Doctors of Optometry—a unique approach in the healthcare field.

“Children feel comfortable in our clinic,” she says. “We examine their eyes with a series of ‘eye games’, have lots of toys for them to play with, and a pretty sweet treasure chest from which they choose a prize at the end of the exam. We often have kids saying we’re their favourite doctor’s office to visit.”

Outside the clinic, the doctors make a point of reaching out to the New Westminster community, giving talks to schools, daycares and community centres about the importance of eye health for children.

“The fact is that 1 in 4 kids have a vision problem that affects learning, although many actually pass a vision screening at school” says Dr. Bligh. “Our advanced technology often detects diseases and conditions missed by checks performed at school or at the family doctor’s office. We really encourage regular exams with a Doctor of Optometry.”

FYidoctors participates in two independently-funded programs that provide eye exams and free glasses to children in need.

According to Dr. Bligh, eyes can act as early indicators for other health conditions in the body such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and some cancers, which further stresses the importance of regular exams for both children and adults.

Opening night will feature the Canadian premier of YAKONA, BC Director Paul Collins’ multi-award winning film that tells the story of Texas’s San Marcos River and its relationship with the world around it.

""We're quite excited,"" says Stephen Bruyneel, Interim-Executive Director of the non-profit society. ""We've never shown a film at RiverFest before, but they approached us and we thought it was a good fit. One of the directors, Paul Collins, is from B.C. and grew up on the Lower Mainland.""

YAKONA follows the San Marcos River from source to sea, through the changing seasons, interpreting the river’s time and memory and documenting this relationship between the natural world and man. The film previously has won five awards since its release, including the coveted SXSW Visions Audience Award at its World Premiere in Austin TX.

“Although YAKONA is about the San Marcos River in Texas, it really is a metaphor for all rivers around the world,” added Stephen, “It’s a reminder about how important they are to all of us in so many different ways.

Following the premiere, there will be a Q&A with Paul Collins, which Stephen will moderate.

“I’m looking forward to the discussion with Paul,” says Stephen. “Given how striking the film is, I expect we will have lots of questions about how it was made and what his main interests were. Personally, I am also interested in how it relates to our own Fraser River and the ongoing efforts to find a balance between its environmental, cultural and economic priorities. As someone who is from BC and Lower Mainland, I expect Paul will have some personal perspectives on that topic.”

The Fraser River Discovery Centre’s River Fest is Metro Vancouver’s biggest celebration of the environmental, economic and socio-cultural importance of the Fraser River. With an annual attendance of 10,000, RiverFest is a wonderful week of lively music, engaging activities, informative presentations, delicious foods, and beautiful art. It is free to attend and has something for the whole family.

“Each date will have different food trucks,” New West resident Guy Ciprian said in an email to the Record. “Vendor rosters and menus will eventually be posted on our Facebook page.”

More information can be found on the Braid StrEAT Experience Facebook page.

According to Ciprian, the event is being run as a drive-thru food truck experience and is only accepting debit and credit cards in order to meet health regulations. Organizers are working with Fraser Health to provide a walk-up service in the future, but it’s unclear if that will be available during Phase 3 of the province’s COVID-19 restart plan.

Along with supporting some food trucks that have struggled financially through the pandemic, the events are also raising money and donating partial proceeds to the Royal Columbian Hospital Foundation. Organizers recently presented the hospital foundation with a $900 donation from the Canada Day event.

“It was fantastic,” said Ciprian of the inaugural event, noting vendors were busy from the moment they opened until an hour before closing time.

Ciprian said the event has had great support from city staff and Fraser Health in getting it up and running. The event is employing several students who will be doing things like general labour, traffic control and sales.

Ciprian works at Savi Integrated Marketing (SIM), which is producing the event in partnership with West Coast Pop Up Events.

“SIM represents West Coast Pop Ups, which is a collective group of small businesses who have operated through COVID by either sharing their revenue with other struggling Sapperton businesses or with charities like RCHF,” he said of the hospital foundation. “This whole event is a collective effort of small businesses working together.”",[]

While owner Susan Cartwright-Coates has considered it a privilege to be part of customer’s special moments, from selecting baby bracelets to engagement and wedding rings, retirement is beckoning. After closing on July 11, the shop remained closed until July 15 so the store could prepare for its big retirement sale.

“It’s been a pleasure. Really, it’s been a pleasure. I know I will miss the people the most. It’s being part of the relationships,” she said. “The big sale and the little sale – to me it’s the relationship, and it doesn’t matter if it’s a huge, huge ring sale or some young fellow coming in to buy a locket for his girlfriend. Those are all important to me.”

James Daniel Cartwright opened a small watchmaker and jewelry business in 1933, at a t time when he was unable to find work. His son Don joined in the family-owned and -operated business in 1965 and took over the store in 1980.

Cartwright-Coates joined the family business in 1984 and took over when her father Don retired in 2001. Before her father passed away in late 2019, they’d discussed the fact that she would be the last of the Cartwright family to run the business.

“It’s going to be sad,” she said. “I think it is going to be a little shocking to the community – it’s been 87 years this year.”

Cartwright-Coates said she is proud of Cartwright Jewelers legacy in New Westminster and for being a part of so many people’s special moments.

“We continue to have generations of customers. Many of the young fellows that come in for engagement rings are here because ‘Well, this is where grandma told me I should come’ or ‘Mom said this is where her engagement ring came from.’ That to me is such an honour that people are so supportive of us as a small and independent local business,” she said. “But I also think that we have been able to give back to the community.”

Now located at 649 Sixth St., Cartwright Jewelers has been located in a number of locations in Uptown New Westminster during its 87 years. It’s also evolved to customers through the decades.

“Back in the day, there was tons and tons of giftware in our old store on Sixth Avenue. China. Flatware. Vases. Most of the jewelry – ‘there it is; what you see is what you get.’ Then as people’s tastes changed and were not collectors of things that need to be dusted anymore, and as people wanted to put their own, unique stamp, technology has allowed us to become designers of beautiful jewelry,” said Cartwright-Coates. “A very large component of what we have done in these last few years is custom design for people.”

Although Cartwright Jewelers has had a huge customer base in New Westminster, it has drawn customers from the Gulf Islands and the Interior. Last week it shipped a pair of diamond earrings to someone in Ontario.

“Business is as good as it’s ever been right now,” said Cartwright-Coates. “We are doing Christmas business right now, since we opened the doors from COVID. I think there’s just been events and things happening in people’s lives and they still want to celebrate. I am so excited for these young couples who have decided they are getting married, and they’ll have a party later. You should see the joy in their faces – way more than I have seen with these big weddings. Way, way more. They are so happy. Maybe this is teaching us there are simpler things in life.”

The retirement sale, beginning July 15, will last until the store is down to the “bare bones” of stock. With social distancing procedures in place, it’s anticipated the sale will last into the fall.

During the retirement sale, custom design and repair services will carry on at Cartwright Jewelers.

“We do a huge, huge repair business here,” said Cartwright-Coates. “There is just going to be some slight differences in that at the moment, strictly because of timelines. I expect us to be here into the fall. So, if there was that special piece that you were wanting us to make but just quite hadn’t got yourself there, we can still do it.”

While it’s been a privilege for her family to be a part of the New Westminster community for so many years, Cartwright-Coates is looking forward to the adventures that await in retirement – including spending more time with her husband Brian, who retired from the City of New Westminster 14 years ago, and with her daughter and her family (including five grandchildren) who live in Salmon Arm. While Cartwright Jewelers closed temporarily because of COVID-19, it didn’t cause the business to close – but that time at home gave Cartwright-Coates time to reflect on what she was missing out on because she was so busy with work.

“The wheels were turning,” she said. “I doubt they would have turned this quickly if it hadn’t been for COVID.”

Susan Cartwright-Coates is thrilled that Cartwright Jewelers was able to donate more than $170,000 to the CKNW Kids' Fund through the annual Christmas sale of items such as snow globes and stuffed animals. - File

Cartwright-Coates said she will be putting the business up for sale, so it’s possible someone will want to continue the shop’s legacy, but that’s uncertain at this point.

Each year, Cartwright Jewelers sells an item, including snow globes and stuffed animals, and donates 100% of the proceeds to the CKNW Kids Fund (formerly the CKNW Orphans Fund) to help B.C. kids living with physical, mental and social challenges.

“We did it for 20 years, and we raised over $170,000,” said Cartwright-Coates. “We have been strong and supportive, and sometimes it’s also time that other people need to step up and take some torches.”",[]

After being shuttered by COVID-19, the business is reopening its doors in Sapperton on Friday, July 10. Customers will have a chance to play about 70 classic video games, including some new ones that were refurbished during the closure.

""We are humbled by all the supportive messages we have had from our customers and the New West community while we have been closed,” owners Brad and Maryanne Eyers said in an email to the Record. “We can't wait to everyone again.""

According to the Eyers, British Columbia’s reopening plan is missing reopening guidelines for arcades, kids play places and family amusement centres, but they’ve implementing major changes in order to open up as safely as possible.

“We have made considerable changes to our arcade to make it a safe place for our customers to play classic games and for our employees and family to work. It's a tough balance right now to open responsibly and to pay our bills,” said the Eyers. “We are preferring to err on the side of safety by significantly reducing our capacity and closing multiple times a day for deep cleaning of all of our games and other high-touch surfaces.""

Capital City Arcade has temporarily removed its pinball machines to allow for more space on the floor, so customers won’t need quarters because all games are included with the $20 admission for a two-hour session. The arcade’s nacho bar has also closed temporarily.

In order to allow for social distancing, Capital City Arcade has cut its occupancy by 50%. That means 20 customers will be permitted in the space at any given time.

Other changes include an online ticket system where customers can book their session ahead of time and contactless mobile check-in, where customers can show a QR code instead of printed tickets. The business will be closing shop between sessions for one hour so staff can do a thorough cleaning of all high-touch surfaces.

Inside the space at 457 East Columbia St., customers will notice that the games have been rearranged to provide as much social distancing as possible in the space. Hand sanitizer will be available at the door and throughout the arcade.

“You’ll be asked to use hand sanitizer when you check-in to keep everyone safe while at the arcade and to use hand sanitizer on your way out to protect yourself and others after leaving in the arcade,” said a notice about the new guidelines. “Everyone is encouraged to use our washrooms to wash your hands.”

Enhanced cleaning procedures include regular wiping down e

Each control panel, button and joystick will be regularly wiped down, as will all door handles and bathrooms.

Along with staff training related to social distancing and and sanitizing, employees will be wearing non-medical masks while in the arcade, using gloves when cleaning and getting monitored for their health at the beginning of each shift.

Capital City Arcade asks that customers use hand sanitizer and wash their hands frequently when they’re at the arcade, keep their distance from other people as they move around the arcade, avoid touching their face while playing games and stay at home if they’re not feeling well.

Masks are a must for all customers as they will reduce respiratory droplets in the air and on the games. The arcade will have a limited number of masks available, but people are encouraged to bring their own masks from home.

“Our space is small and we feel this is the biggest way everyone can work together to keep people safe while in the arcade,” said a notice. “If you feel that wearing a mask while playing games is not possible, please postpone your visit until we all can be without masks in small indoor spaces.”

While the federal Cannabis Act has permitted the sale of cannabis in Canada since October 2018, applicants have been slowly making their way through the various steps required before the doors open. The Queensborough Cannabis Co., whose application was approved by city council in October 2019, opened on July 2.

article continues below

With “so many people” knocking on the door and coming by in search of product, owner Calvin Basran said the Queensborough Cannabis Co. thought a soft opening was the way to go. The store’s grand opening, taking place on Saturday, July 11, will include a contest and prize package giveaways for the first 50 customers.

“We are ready to go for our grand opening and ready to serve the public,” he said. “We are very excited about it.”

New Westminster's first private cannabis shop is now open in Queensborough. - Contributed

According to Basran, the store has had an “amazing” response from the neighbourhood, and business “has been great” during its first week.

“My staff is very well educated on all of our products,” he said. “They are amazing.”

Basran said the soft opening helped prepared the staff for the volume of customers the Queensborough Cannabis Co. anticipates.

“I am expecting that it is going to be very busy,” he said. “We are already getting people from all over the place – all of New West, there’s customers that are travelling down here. There are customers from Burnaby, Richmond, Surrey, Delta. There’s nothing in Burnaby. There’s nothing in Richmond. There’s nothing in South Delta/Surrey. There’s nothing out there.”

Following a public hearing in October 2019, city council approved the Queensborough Cannabis Co. application – one of two cannabis shops planned for Queensborough, as a government-run store has been given the green light at Queensborough Landing shopping centre. About 20 people spoke about the private store at the public hearing, with the supporters and opponents evenly divided.

“We did whatever we can to over-exceed the neighbourhood’s and the City of New West, their expectations of a legal cannabis shop. We really over-exceeded ourselves, I feel,” said Basran, when asked about residents’ concerns. “Design was a big part of this. The main thing is making sure that customers feel safe and welcome coming into our establishment, and something safe and clean for the neighbourhood.”

Basran describes the Queensborough Cannabis Co.’s design as being West Coast modern, with a light and airy feel.

“I encourage anybody, whether they use any products or not, to stop by and check it out and see what’s new in the neighbourhood,” he said.

While the store is licensed to operate from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m., it is currently operating from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. and will be open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. starting next week.

In the spring of 2018, the City of New Westminster launched a public process regarding the development of a regulatory framework related to the sale of cannabis. As part of that process, the city sought public input about five areas within municipal jurisdiction: regulation of cannabis retail locations through the zoning bylaw; business licence requirements for retail locations; business licence regulations for cannabis production, warehousing and cultivation facilities; public consumption limits through smoking control bylaws; and personal cultivation limits.

Following the development of the regulatory framework, the city decided to support a mix of private and public stores in different commercial areas of the city.

Along with the government-operated B.C. Cannabis Store in Queensborough, council has approved rezoning applications for four private stores: Queensborough Cannabis Co. at 540 Ewen Ave.; Maple Leaf Greenery at 71 Sixth St.; Westcanna at 710 12th St.; and Muse Cannabis at 532 Sixth St.

Mike Watson, a senior planner with the city, said the city still has not heard back from the Liquor and Cannabis Regulation Branch regarding the financial integrity and security checks for the Herb Co. Cannabis Store, so a public hearing regarding the application for 452 East Columbia St. hasn’t been scheduled.

While it’s taking time for stores to open in New West, Basran said he give props to city staff and council for their efforts.

“The City of New West did a great job of putting this thing together,” he said. “They made the application process intense, as it should be, because this way they were very selective about who they were bringing in to operate these shops in the city. I feel that’s very, very important.”

Making it through the province’s regulatory checks and getting rezoning approval from the city are among the hurdles applicants must overcome before they can open their doors.

“Once you get the approval from the city it’s not that bad,” Basran said. “It’s just a matter of renovations and working with the province, working with the cannabis inspectors, making sure everything is compliant.”",[]

Sisters Lynn-Marie and Melissa-Rae Angus, who co-founded Sisters Sage in September 2018, use traditional Indigenous ingredients like cedar, sage, sweetgrass, lavender and tobacco to create self-care and wellness products such as soaps, bath bombs and smudge sprays. The sisters’ heritage is Gitxaala, Nisga’a and Metis Nations.

A number of New West businesses worked together to host and sponsor the Level-Up My Brand contesst, with thousands of dollars in business support up for grabs.

The other semi-finalists in this year’s contest were: New West Hospice Society, New West Farmers Market, Barley’s Homebrewing Supplies, Sew Good, Florezca Designs, Laughter Zone 101, MOVE Studio, Mila + Paige clothing boutique and IMPACT Parkinson’s. MOVE Studio placed second and Mila + Page took third place.

“Congratulations Sister Sage. You earned it. You definitely deserved it,” said Stefania Butkovic, a judge in this year’s contest and the winner of the 2018 contest. “If we could have given first prizes to everyone, I’m sure we would have. Everyone did so amazing.”

Rich Patterson, one of the contest’s co-founders, agreed.

Whatafood, known for their Brazilian street food, is setting up inside the New Westminster SkyTrain Station's Shops at New West.

The new restaurant has moved into Pizza Garden's old spot - they've since moved to a bigger space inside the station's mall.

Launched in 2017, Whatafood has become a staple at street fairs and festivals around Metro Vancouver, including the Richmond Night Market.

Whatafood's menu is centred on Brazilian pastries, in both sweet and savoury offerings.They are best known for their pasteis (plural for pastel), which is like a large hand-pie that's stuffed with meat and/or cheese, or sweet fillings, then deep fried. Whatafood uses their own original recipe for their pasteis, and makes everything from scratch in-house.

For their New West bricks-and-mortar, however, Whatafood is expanding their menu, and will have pasteis that are filled with things like shrimp, Beyond Meat and veggies, and guava jam with mozzarella cheese (called the Romeo & Julieta).

In addition to their signature pasteis, Whatafood's menu includes their gluten-free cheese puffs, as well as Brazilian chocolate bon bons, and beverages like sugar cane juice and cans of Guarana Antarctica - a popular Brazilian soda pop.

Opening day for Whatafood's permanent spot had been set for Saturday, June 27, however the restaurant has had to put their launch on hold due to some construction delays.

""The date was settled with a lot of caution and we have worked hard to maintain the promised date as much as we could. However, we’re still missing some key components [...] The decision was made taking into consideration the quality and standards that you deserve,"" explains Whatafood, adding: ""Thank you for your understanding and support. We will be announcing the new opening date soon.""

Whatafood is located at 800 Carnarvon Street, Unit 255, in New Westminster.

In an email to workers Wednesday night, the company said that since January it has had fewer than 10 cases of the virus that causes COVID-19 that were transmitted in the workplace.

article continues below

But the email from Laurie Shelby, Tesla’s vice-president of environmental, safety and health, also confirmed reports that Tesla is looking into more than 130 positive tests among employees, including those who contracted the virus outside of Tesla facilities. She said less than 0.25% of employees worldwide have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, which equals just over 137 workers.

Her message came in response to a report by Electrek.co that over 130 Tesla employees or contractors have tested positive, and hundreds more are waiting for test results. The website said it based the report on internal company data.

Shelby wrote that the story referred to data ""that was in the process of being validated"" and included employees worldwide who may have been infected but never entered a Tesla site, or were infected at home while Tesla's operations were shut down earlier in the year. A Tesla spokesman would not comment on the report or the email, which was obtained by The Associated Press.

""Nearly all — more than 99.99% — of these occurrences were not cases of virus transmitted at work,"" Shelby wrote in the email. ""Most of the positive cases resulted from an individual living with or travelling with someone with COVID-19 and have returned to work after recovering from home.""

Shelby wrote that Tesla doesn't have any employees in serious condition anywhere in the world because of COVID-19.

A message was left Thursday seeking comment on the numbers from the public health department in Alameda County, California, which includes Fremont, the location of Tesla's only U.S. assembly plant. The factory employs about 10,000 workers.

Some workers have refused to return to the plant out of fear of catching the virus. They did so after CEO Elon Musk in May defied Health Department orders not to restart production under shutdown orders due to the virus.

Some Tesla workers and labour activists say the company is threatening to fire employees who haven’t returned, but Tesla officials have said claims about firings are not true. Workers say they've heard about COVID-19 cases at the plant but they don't know numbers. They have called on the company and health department to release the figures.

However, Shelby wrote in the email that an employee survey found the vast majority of workers feel comfortable with the safety measures being taken by the company.

Among the measures are increased cleaning, limiting access to facilities, temperature checks for employees before they enter buildings, staggered shifts to keep workers apart, additional barriers between employees and providing protective equipment, Shelby wrote.

She urged workers to wear masks or face coverings to stay healthy and save lives and warned that failing to wear masks where required, or not wearing them properly, will bring disciplinary actions. She also wrote that workers should stay home if they're sick.

Musk reopened the Fremont plant May 11 in defiance of county orders. The health department had deemed the factory a nonessential business that can’t fully open under virus restrictions, but Tesla contended it was essential under federal guidelines.

The next day, however, the Health Department announced that the plant could return to manufacturing as long as it delivers on worker safety precautions that it agreed to.",[]
552,newwestrecord,https://www.newwestrecord.ca/business/arkansas-to-require-face-masks-to-combat-coronavirus-surge-1.24171566,Arkansas to require face masks to combat coronavirus surge,['Andrew Demillo'],,"LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson issued an order Thursday requiring people to wear face masks in public throughout the state, which has had a surge in coronavirus cases over the past several weeks.

The Republican governor had resisted a statewide mask mandate and opposed issuing a stay-at-home order earlier in the pandemic, but he signed the order requiring masks when social distancing isn't possible in the hopes of slowing the disease's rapid spread in the state. The order takes effect Monday.

article continues below

Hutchinson’s decision comes amid growing support for mask requirements from business and health leaders and a day after Bentonville-based Walmart said it would require customers to wear masks in all of its U.S. stores. The state’s largest newspaper, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, also called for a statewide requirement on Thursday.

Hutchinson previously encouraged people to wear masks and allowed cities to pass ordinances requiring their use, but he stopped short of requiring them statewide. He’s the latest Republican governor to relent on the mask issue in the face of a surge in COVID-19 cases. Alabama's governor issued a similar mask mandate on Wednesday.

Arkansas' coronavirus cases have dramatically risen since May, when the state began allowing businesses that had closed because of the pandemic to reopen despite warnings from national health officials about the risks of doing so too soon. Arkansas was one of a handful of states that did not issue a broader stay-at-home order that kept most businesses closed.

Hutchinson previously questioned how a mask mandate could be enforced in a rural state such as Arkansas, but this week he left open the possibility of such a requirement. The chancellor of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences called for a statewide requirement last weekend.

Hutchinson's order was expected to face criticism from some conservatives in the state. Hours before he issued the order, a Republican legislator urged people to call Hutchinson to oppose any mask directive.

A poll by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business suggested tensions are flaring between workers and employers, with around 27 per cent of 3,389 employers polled indicating some of their laid-off staff have refused to return to work.

article continues below

Of the nearly 870 businesses that provided the reasons their employees gave for refusing to return to work, 62 per cent reported workers ""prefer the Canada Emergency Response Benefit."" Employers could choose more than one explanation for why a worker refused to return, and respondents also selected options such as concern for health (47 per cent), childcare obligations (27 per cent) or lack of hours in return offer (16 per cent).

CFIB president Dan Kelly said it's ""clear"" that CERB ""created a disincentive to return to work for some staff, especially in industries like hospitality."" Other sectors where conflicts are arising include child care, dental offices, home health care, amusement parks, gambling and spectator sports, the study suggested.

""CERB was created as emergency support for workers who had lost their job due to the pandemic, not to fund a summer break,"" Kelly said in a statement.

But Ian Robb, Canadian director of the Unite Here union that represents hospitality workers, disagrees. He said workers are impatient to return to work — for what is usually the lucrative summer season — but employers are the ones failing to adopt measures like frequent cleaning and wage subsidies. The union previously estimated that average wages in cities like Toronto are around $20 per hour for hospitality.

""A number of our members in the U.S. have gone to work and contracted (COVID-19),"" Robb said.

""There's just not enough safety in front of service. Nobody wants to stay home and make two grand when they can make double that by working.""

The survey suggested that the hospitality sector had the biggest share of employers, 45 per cent, who had trouble recalling workers. CFIB defines hospitality as including hotels, restaurants and bars.

The CFIB study suggests that in the hospitality sector, 56 per cent of hard-to-fill positions were ""unskilled, entry-level jobs"" that pay ""at or around minimum wage,"" although across sectors, skilled and semi-skilled jobs were harder to fill.

Employment and human rights lawyer Neena Gupta says she has heard of tradespeople unable to perform jobs because workers failed to return.

She said the reason an employee is refusing the work matters. Lack of childcare, like daycare and camps, can be a job-protected reason for staying home, as can disabilities such as being immunocompromised, says Gupta, a partner in Gowling WLG's Waterloo Region and Toronto offices.

The federal government's website states that workers seeking CERB, which offers $500 per week over a limited period, ""should be seeking work opportunities and/or return to work when their employer makes a request for their return, provided they are able and it is reasonable to do so."" The government's COVID-19 guidelines also provide for employees to refuse to do a dangerous job, although the worker must already ""be at work"" to refuse such a task.

However, notes Gupta, general apprehension about the pandemic is likely not enough to merit a job refusal. She said workplaces must comply with health and safety guidelines, and that a ministry inspection must find some sort of violation to justify a job refusal.

Managers should give workers a written ""come back to work"" recall and an indication that it will be treated as job abandonment if the worker doesn't return, says Gupta. After that process is completed, the employer could consider that worker terminated for cause, and hire a replacement.

While reporting misuse of CERB by a former employee might appear to give an employer some moral satisfaction, Gupta says it’s unlikely to help with staffing concerns or worker morale.

""I do ask people to be reasonable. You can’t call someone at noon on a Thursday and expect them in at 7 a.m. on Friday,"" she says.

CFIB, a policy advocacy group that represents small and medium-sized businesses and has 110,000 members, collected the data from members online between July 3 to July 6.

However, Cogeco says its cable television and internet operations in Ontario, Quebec and the United States have felt less impact from the pandemic.

Cogeco chief executive Philippe Jette told analysts Thursday that adjusted earnings and revenue at the cable and internet operations are expected to grow in the fourth quarter.

Cogeco Inc. reported late Wednesday that its third-quarter profit from continuing operations was $97.5 million, down 4.9 per cent from nearly $102.6 million last year.

A U.S. acquisition and favourable currency exchange rates helped push up overall revenue by 1.4 per cent to $626 million for the three months ended May 31.

“Lack of transparency when it comes to the true costs of investments can be an issue for investors,” says Waddington, a Chartered Financial Analyst born and raised in the New Westminster area. “Hidden fees associated with mutual funds can cost clients in excess of 2.5% a year. A good Investment Advisor should be able to help you mitigate these costs through a comprehensive investment strategy.”

article continues below

According to Waddington, here are three must-knows for mutual funds investors:

1. New regulations, statements –“New regulations have come out regarding financial statements that are designed to increase transparency for investors,” says Waddington. “All investors will receive a statement in January 2017 showing their total fees for the previous year. Reading these statements carefully may open your eyes to potential cost savings opportunities and hopefully start a conversation about fees.”

2. Secret fees – “Although these new statements will disclose the amount paid to the advisor from the mutual fund company, otherwise known as the mutual fund trailers, other fees charged by the company , including the management fee, will not be disclosed,” Waddington explains. “This is important because management fees are often the largest portion of the overall costs of mutual funds. So investors still won’t know their total costs unless they look into the management expense ratios, or MER – which includes the management and trailer fees—or contact us to figure out the real costs and find more cost effective alternatives.”

3. Investment alternatives – “With the average Canadian mutual fund costing around 2.5 per cent annually, alternatives such as separately managed accounts (SMA) and Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) portfolios can help to lower clients’ costs while still providing well diversified managed accounts,” says Waddington. “SMAs provide similar exposure to mutual funds, but allow investors to actually hold individual positions in their accounts, which can reduce overhead costs. ETF portfolios are a great way to achieve diversification at very low costs, with smaller accounts.”

“Using these tools we’ve been able to consistently reduce the costs for our clients by up to one per cent annually,” says Waddington. “While one per cent may seem like a small amount, compounding that over a lifetime can make a huge impact on the funds available in retirement.”

While Dr. Steven Blyth of Polo Health and Longevity Centre assures his patients that this isn’t the case, he also encourages them to take measures into their own hands by implementing a regular home-cleansing routine for their skin.

“Cleansing and toning is the first step for preventative anti-aging for your skin,” says Dr. Blyth, “and definitely the number one thing to do at home if you’re serious about proper skin cleansing.”

article continues below

According to Dr. Blyth, skin cleansing is a daily—yet simple—two-step process involving a liquid cleanser and skin toner.

“If you’re properly cleansing, you’re cleaning out bacteria that can damage your skin from your pores on a regular basis,” he says. “Over time the top layer of your skin – known as the epidermis – will be filled with this kind of bacteria and it makes your skin look dull or wrinkly. By cleansing and toning your skin, we are removing that unhealthy surface layer and revealing a healthier one.”

If your home skincare regime needs to be taken to the next level, replenishing vitamins and minerals is the logical next step. According to Dr. Blyth, many of his patients integrate a skin-cleanser brush that incorporates mechanical brushes into their home regimes.

“Studies have shown these products to be ten times more efficient than simply cleansing on your own,” he says. “That’s why they’ve become so popular.”

The popular Columbia Street and River Market restaurants, both owned by New West resident Alejandro Diaz, have helped out community members on a number of different fronts during the COVID-19 pandemic. Diaz said it was hard both financially and emotionally to have to close the restaurants in March.

article continues below

Having just received a large produce order for El Santo and just finished making soups for Amaranthus, he said it was important to come up with a quick strategy about what to do with all that food.

“Originally, we thought that the restaurant would be closed for just couple of weeks. Some items would last a couple of weeks but we knew that the vegetables wouldn't stay fresh for opening,” he said in an email to the Record. “We posted a few times on Facebook offering to share the soups and vegetables. The response was phenomenal. It was obvious that there were many people in need in our community.”

A few weeks later, plans were made to start selling soups as a way of staying engaged with the community.

“We decided to donate one soup from El Santo and one from Amaranthus to families in need,” Diaz said. “Then we offered three-course dinners from both restaurants and decided to keep the same structure of donating two meals. People would nominate families, and we would go and deliver that meal to those peoples in need. ‘Need’ included folks down on their luck, and an offer of a meal would show someone cared.”

During that time, Diaz said the restaurants were lucky enough to get connected and provide food for the Royal Columbian Hospital Foundation and the food bank.

“One of the most rewarding moments that we had as a restaurant and as a business owner has been partnering with BC Housing to support the Lookout Society,” he said. “The Lookout Society provides housing and a social safety net to low-income individuals. The great thing about partnering with them was the ability to bring back some people to work. This relationship is very much a cost-recovery partnership on which the objective was not to make money, but also not to lose money.”

Diaz said “the break-even point” meant getting some volunteer assistance. His nine-year-old son Parker volunteers daily to help scoop, pack and deliver meals to 91 guests, and friends Rick and Melissa Fabbro help deliver the meals on the weekends.

“Another great and challenging situation has been learning what our new guests like,” he said. “It's not just about making 91 breakfasts, 91 lunches and 91 dinners – it’s about making something that they enjoy. The team has been focused creating a balanced and diverse menu while following their requests. Dave Brown from the Lookout Society told me that these folks will have a chance to try a culturally diverse menu.”

Diaz said he has thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to meet people connected to the program. He’s also grateful for the support his restaurants have received from community members who have been “very generous” in providing extra items for the meals, such as desserts.

“The whole experience is a lesson for us all. These people are not homeless people or needy people. They are people without a home or people with economic needs. Everyone has a story. Everyone has a name,” Diaz said. “The good story attached to having to close the restaurants is we got the chance to remind ourselves of this lesson. And also know that, but for any number of simple twists of fate, we all could be people without a home or in economic need.”",[]

Gill won the million on Canada’s birthday after purchasing his ticket at the Chevron Town Pantry on 58 Avenue in Surrey.

He says when he initially checked his ticket, he wasn’t quite convinced he was a big winner.

“I checked at the self-checker,” said Gill. “I told my son, and then I had to go to another gas station to make sure it was correct. After I told my wife, they both thought I was joking and didn’t believe me.”

Gill says the $1 million means he can take a step back from work.

Research Co. and Glacier Media have been tracking perceptions about legalization every six months in British Columbia. Our latest survey shows that agreement with the new rules remains high across the entire province, that some residents are starting to ponder a future when other drugs could be treated in the same fashion as cannabis, and that – in stark contrast with what we found last year – marijuana users in British Columbia are starting to acquire all of their product through licensed retailers.

As more time passes, British Columbians appear happier with the decision to end prohibition. Seven in 10 of the province’s residents (70%) agree with marijuana being legal in Canada, while 26% disagree and 3% are undecided.

These findings represent a seven-point increase since a similar survey conducted in October 2019, as legal cannabis approached its first anniversary. The groups that are more likely to voice satisfaction with the new status quo are men (75%), British Columbians aged 35 to 54 (76%) and residents of northern B.C. (80%).

In recent weeks, we have seen more talk about creating a safe supply for drugs that are currently available only through illegal means. The impact of these discussions has led to a shift in the views of British Columbians about legalizing all drugs. It must be completely acknowledged that sizable majorities of the province’s residents continue to oppose a move to place any controlled substance inside a store, but the proponents of this option have grown since late last year.

At least two-thirds of British Columbians are opposed to legalizing ecstasy (66%), powder cocaine (70%), heroin (72%), crack cocaine (73%), methamphetamine or “crystal meth” (74%) and fentanyl (75%).

Support for making some of these drugs available in a fashion that would conceivably meet the same guidelines that govern cannabis has risen over the past six months, to 25% for cocaine (up from 18%) and to 24% for heroin (up from 19%). While these are still low proportions, the fluctuation could signal the start of a trend.

Just 10% of British Columbians say they only consumed marijuana after it became legal. Identical proportions of residents tried it before October 2018 (45%) or have never consumed it in Canada (also 45%). The incidence of “legal-only” marijuana users is highest among residents aged 18 to 34 (18%) and those who live in southern B.C. (19%).

But perhaps the biggest surprise, and a source of satisfaction for policy makers, is the way in which cannabis is being sought by users. Just over half of British Columbians who have consumed marijuana since legalization (51%) say that all of their product was acquired at a licensed retailer. In October 2019, only 31% of cannabis consumers in the province were getting all of their product at a licensed retailer.

We still see 16% of British Columbians who say none of their marijuana has been bought at a licensed retailer – a proportion that climbs to 25% among those aged 55 and over. Two-thirds of cannabis consumers aged 35 to 54 (68%) are buying all of their product at a licensed retailer.

Even though the delivery of cannabis products has improved over the past six months, there are significant regional differences that are indubitably related to the presence of stores in specific areas of the province. Cannabis consumers who reside in southern B.C. and Metro Vancouver are the most likely to be getting all of their product from licensed retailers (63% and 62%). The numbers are significantly lower in Vancouver Island (29%), northern B.C. (24%) and the Fraser Valley (19%).

Finally, the issue of “drug testing” remains a priority for British Columbians, with 61% saying that companies in the province should “definitely” or “probably” be able to administer these examinations to any employee now that marijuana is legal.

After a bumpy start that featured slow store openings and hitches with delivery options, there are signs that cannabis legalization is starting to work in a better fashion. More consumers are getting all of their product through licensed retailers, and the number of “new users” has not increased dramatically. Still, the significant regional disparities suggest that more marijuana outlets will need to be authorized in order to effectively eliminate the black market.

A month after the BC Junior A Lacrosse League was supposed to begin playing, the league officially cancelled its 2020 season.

The Minto Cup, along with all other minor and senior national championships, has also been cancelled by the Canadian Lacrosse Association.

In a release, BCJALL president Karl Christiansen said ongoing restrictions in British Columbia limiting the size of public gatherings during the COVID-19 pandemic to no more than 50 people made it impossible for games to be played.

“We had hope we might be able to compete this year,” he said. “But it became evident we wouldn’t be able to have a normal season.”

Christiansen said alternative schedules were considered, but public health directives were insurmountable.

CLA president Shawn Williams said health and safety, travel concerns and venue closures were the main considerations in its decision to cancel all 2020 national championships from the Mann Cup senior men’s title to the U12 finals, as well as the U19 women’s field lacrosse championships.

“We recognize that national championships are important to lacrosse players of all ages,” he said, adding all hosts for 2020 events will be charged with staging their championships in 2021. That means the Minto and Mann Cups will both be played in Ontario.

Also expected to be talked about is the directive issued a week ago by the Canadian Lacrosse Association that suspends all activity until April 5 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, BCJALL president Karl Christiansen said in a statement.

In an email response to query as to the status of Sunday’s planned meeting, Christiansen said the plan is still to meet.

“Everything is ever changing and very different than when we met 2 weeks ago. We will have our meeting Sunday and release information shortly after,” Christiansen said. “Our top priority is the health and safety of not just athletes, coaches (and) officials but also our fans and families involved with the BCJALL.

“These are trying times and we wish everyone great health and wellness.”

The league was scheduled to start the regular season play on April 25.

All minor lacrosse associations, including Burnaby and New West, are following edicts of the CLA and B.C. Lacrosse Association to suspend all in-person activities until further notice.

“We’re lucky to have had strong leadershiop from the province’s public health officials. This is why we’re basing our response on the expert advice of those organizations, as well as the B.C. Lacrosse Association and the (CLA),” NWMLA president Rich Catton said in a statement on the website.

As a result of the health concerns, New West has postponed its mini-tyke and tyke evaluation events, originally scheduled for March 31 and April 1, as well as the Olivia Malcom mini-tyke and tyke Jamboree, scheduled for April 4 and 5.

“We will continue to monitor the directives from our governing bodies as well as the federal and provincial governments and will follow and enforce these directives. We will update our membership when there is a change,” stated a post on the Burnaby minor website.

Meanwhile, the Western Lacrosse Association says its business as usual — for now.

But with the start of the regular season less than two months away, the league is monitoring the ever-evolving novel coronavirus outbreak, commissioner Paul Dal Monte said. He added none of the teams are currently practising.

The league’s website has removed its 2020 schedule, which was to begin May 21 with Maple Ridge visiting New West at Queen’s Park Arena. The Burnaby Lakers are to launch the 2020 season a day later, May 22, in Victoria.

Many of the league’s players who are part of teams in the professional National Lacrosse League are already idle as that circuit suspended its season two weeks ago.

The U.S. east coast-based professional outdoor Major League Lacrosse has not altered its schedule online from its May 31 opener, although the sport’s governing body in the United States has also postponed all events until at least April 5 as well as cancelled two national women’s tournaments scheduled in May.",[]

In terms of overall global impact, however, the best comparison may be the 1918 influenza pandemic, which was inaccurately named “Spanish Flu.”

The NHL’s response to COVID-19 has likewise been compared to the 1918 pandemic for obvious reasons: the only year the Stanley Cup was not awarded was 1919, because of a flu outbreak that ravaged the roster of the Montreal Canadiens during the playoff series. The timeline for the pandemic and the hockey season deserves some closer scrutiny, however, as it provides an important warning.

article continues below

Just like now, the 1918 pandemic threw the world of sports into chaos. College football games were cancelled or postponed, though some ignored bans and played games in front of large crowds anyway. Bowling alleys were closed, to great protest, and the public was urged to stop gathering together for games of rugby and baseball.

Professional sports, however, continued unabated. The Major League Baseball season continued even as the flu spread across the United States. When the league ended the regular season early in September, it was because of World War I shutting down non-essential industries, not the flu, and the league still played the World Series later that month.

Perhaps it was for the best: the second wave of the flu struck in October and November, the deadliest wave of the pandemic. The early end to the MLB season might have saved lives.

The NHL, meanwhile, chose to begin their season as planned in December, despite the danger. To be fair, the league wasn’t playing to thousands of fans in large arenas at the time. The Montreal Canadiens played in Jubilee Arena, with a seating capacity of 3,000.

It was also a much, much smaller league. Just three teams played during the 1918-19 season: the Canadiens, Toronto Arenas, and Ottawa Senators. It was just the second season for the fledgling NHL and what threatened the league’s operations wasn’t influenza, but legal actions and competing leagues. This was despite one player, Hamby Shore of the Senators, already having died from the pandemic in October.

Only 18 games of the planned 20-game season were played, but again, it wasn’t because of concerns due to the flu. The Arenas, who were the defending Stanley Cup champions, were a mess behind the scenes — their players didn’t have contracts and were being paid under the table and attendance for the struggling Arenas was abysmal — and officially withdrew from the league in February.

The Canadiens defeated the Senators for the NHL championship and travelled to Seattle to play the Pacific Coast Hockey Association champion Seattle Metropolitans. Worry over the flu pandemic had subsided to a certain extent. After all, it had been a full year since the first outbreak in the US.

In Seattle, the schools had reopened in January. By March, no influenza deaths were reported in the city. It seemed like the danger had largely passed, so why not play for the Stanley Cup?

Then, in Game 5, veteran defenceman Joe Hall collapsed on the ice. He was hospitalized with a temperature of 104 F. Players on both teams reported symptoms of the flu and, eventually, all but three of the Canadiens players were diagnosed.

The Canadiens tried to forfeit the Cup to Seattle, but the Metropolitans refused to win the Cup that way and the series was cancelled. Hall contracted pneumonia and passed away a few days after the final game was to be played.

What can the NHL learn from this experience? One important aspect is that they can’t let their guard down. It seemed like the worst had passed when the Canadiens travelled to Seattle, but that clearly wasn’t the case. That strain of the flu even came back for another wave in 1920.

The other aspect is how quickly the flu was able to spread through the entire Canadiens roster. The NHL can’t get back to playing before there are clear protocols for identifying who is carrying the COVID-19 virus and quarantining those affected. That can’t happen until tests are widespread and readily available to the general population.

Most importantly, the NHL needs to understand that this could take a long time. While medical science has taken leaps and bounds in the last century, there’s no guarantee that the COVID-19 pandemic will be dealt with any faster than that of the 1918 flu pandemic. Fortunately, the league appears to be taking this pandemic far more seriously than a century ago.

Big Numbers

7 Under the more progressive PCHA rules, which allowed forward passing in all zones of the ice, the Metropolitans dominated the Canadiens in 1919, scoring 7 goals in Games 1 and 3. The Canadiens won two games played under NHL rules, while Game 4 ended in a tie.

Stick-taps and Glove-drops

A tap of the stick to all the healthcare workers in Vancouver, British Columbia, and around the world that are on the frontlines of this pandemic. In a just world, you’d all be paid like professional hockey players.

A stick-tap to Vancouver residents who have taken to cheering for said health care workers every evening at 7 p.m. Without being able to cheer for the Canucks, you’ve chosen the right people to cheer on.

New Westminster’s Brenden Bissett said it was a decision that had to be made, and hopefully one that will steer the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to postpone the 2020 Games.

“My reaction was first quite sad, but relieved in a way because the decision was made by our country with everyone’s health in mind,” Bissett told the Record on Monday. “Before (the decision) I was uncertain and anxious at the same time. As a team, the country and the world, we’re kind of facing something totally global in (COVID-19) and we need to take serious action.”

The COC and CPC have also urged the IOC, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) to postpone the Games for one year.

“We offer them our full support in helping navigate all the complexities that rescheduling the Games will bring. While we recognize the inherent complexities around a postponement, nothing is more important than the health and safety of our athletes and the world community,” the Canadian organizations stated in a joint statement.

Burnaby’s Gabriel Ho-Garcia said that it was apparent when the team was in Chile for a test match series of games with the host nation and Argentina that the Games could be in trouble as news from China kept coming out.

“We were (in Chile) when news of the virus broke out,” said Ho-Garcia, 26. “We arrived home and while Tokyo’s close to China, it wasn’t clear that it would get to where we are now. It just started to get closer and closer, so we had to prepare ourselves (for no Games).”

Bissett said he and his teammates, like so many striving over the past four years to get to the Olympics, were excited and dedicated to being in Tokyo for the July 24 opening ceremonies until COVID-19 became a deadly pandemic.

“Up until a couple of weeks ago I was looking forward and anticipating it,” said Bissett. “When the pro (sports) leagues all shut down it kind of became obvious that this was a big thing. We just didn’t see how July 24th start date was possible.”

The Canadian team had earned its berth with a dramatic two-game series win over Ireland in North Vancouver last October.

Bissett, who has 132 caps with Team Canada, was a member of the 2016 men’s Olympic team in Brazil that posted a 0-1-4 record.

Getting to represent your country on the largest stage is something that has no comparison, he said.

“It was the best experience of my life. We went in with high expectations and wanted to do our best. We didn’t have the success we wanted but when I look back at it it was such a rewarding experience,” said Bissett.

A number of family members, including his parents and uncle, had booked trips to Tokyo to watch him compete.

“They’re disappointed and also relieved,” he noted.

The 27-year-old forward/midfielder said his Olympic dream was inspired by his uncle, David Bissett, who competed at the 1976 Montreal and 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, including the latter as captain.

“He’s the reason I got into it, why my family got into it,” said Bissett.",[]

A basketball season of so many pinnacles, including a 17-1 record during the regular season, was shuttered due to the world-wide COVID-19 pandemic. If everything was right in the world, Douglas would have played this weekend (March 16 to 21) in Toronto for the big prize.

Enevoldson, the team’s coach and architect, says while there are bigger things than basketball in these trying times, that doesn’t diminish the frustration the squad felt over the lost opportunity.

“It’s very disappointing. Obviously from where we were at and the success we had all year, disappointing to see we weren’t going to be able to close it out on our terms,” said Enevoldson. “Obviously there’s a lot of stuff going on in the world and we have to take care of ourselves, our families and everything like that, but this team was a family. It was really, really painful to see them not get a chance to play for a national championship.”

That that dream came to a halt a week before the Canadian Collegiate Athletic Association tournament, where the New West-based Royals held the No. 1-ranking, was a tough pill to swallow.

Entering the PacWest provincial championships three weeks ago, Douglas was on a 10-game winning streak. The squad topped Camosun in the semis and bested frequent foil Vancouver Island 97-89 in the final for the organization’s second B.C. title in three years.

“We played our best basketball when we needed to, and I think that was a sign of the athletes we had in our program,” he said.

Point guard Courtney Anderson enjoyed a standout fourth year with the program, putting up top-10 numbers across the board in offensive categories, averaging 18.9 point per game. The Palestine, Texas native went on to be named the provincial tourney MVP and PacWest Player of the Year. Burnaby brothers Cam and Reese Morris were named to the all-star team, while fellow Royal standouts Dylan Kinley, Shane Toporowski and Bollo Gnahore counted double-digit games on the scoresheet during the semifinal.

Although there will be no 2020 champions, the CCAA did name an All-Canadian team, with Anderson front and centre. Enevoldson, meanwhile, was chosen the national association’s Men’s Coach of the Year.

“Enevoldson has seen much success since being named head coach at Douglas College,” CCAA men’s basketball convenor Jonathan Lambert stated in a press release. “He has used a well-developed mixture of domestic and international talent to become one of the premier programs in the CCAA.”

In 2018, he guided the team to the CCAA national final, where they fell to Seneca of Ontario.

This year’s roster featured numerous local talents, from Burnaby (the Morrises, Jiordano Khan, Kobe McKnight and Aidan Wilson), Port Coquitlam (Josiah Mastandrea) and Surrey (Kinley). Six-foot-10 post Gnahore arrived at Douglas from Ivory Coast via New Mexico State, while Toporowski was a standout in Kamloops a handful of years ago. Guard Patrick Ryan hails from Belgrade, Montana.

A year ago, primed for a big run, the team was unceremoniously upset in the PacWest final by VIU, so this season started with a bit of redemption as a driving force. Seven players carried that memory into 2019-20.

While there will be no championship celebration, Enevoldson said that so much was gained over nearly a year of preparation and team building.

“I think the biggest thing I learned from the athletes was how much they truly cared about this program, this school and how much they care for each other,” he said. “That sometimes gets lost in it, but they’re going to have life-long memories from this season.

“There were a ton of highlights through the course of the year. We had an incredible season. Winning the provincial championship was the epitome of this group. … I think the big thing was, we got to be No. 1 ranking during the course of the year and ended the season up as No. 1, but knew it could be taken away from us in a heartbeat.”

And at the collegiate level there isn’t ‘always next year,’ the Royals do have the special bond of family to take with them.",[]

The New Westminster-based women’s squad successfully repeated as the Canadian Collegiate Athletic Association’s women’s curling champions, finishing the season last week just as other leagues and championships were shut down over the COVID-19 virus.

They defeated the Humber Hawks 10-1 in the final last Sunday in Portage La Prairie, Manitoba.

By defeating the Hawks, the Kyla MacMillan-skipped team achieved a rare double-double as two-time collegiate victor.

Jumping out to a quick 3-0 advantage in the opening frame, Douglas built up a comfortable 7-1 lead by the fifth end. A three-point steal in the sixth completed the rout.

Their spot in the final was a result of a 7-4 decision over Red Deer earlier in the day. It was a case of another strong start, as the Royals were in the clear 5-1 after five ends, and matched the Queens down the stretch.

The Royals lineup includes third Sarah Loken, second and vice-skip Patty Wallingham and lead Kylie Karoway. They are coached by Burnaby’s Daniel Wenzek. For MacMillan, Loken and Wallingham, it was a second successful trip to the national tourney.

Douglas, which trains at the Royal City Curling Club, posted a 6-1 record in the round robin, opening with a 5-2 victory over Northern Alberta. Red Deer handed them their first setback, a 9-8 in a nailbiter to start the second day, in a match that went to an extra end. The Royals rebounded with an 8-3 triumph over the Augustana Vikings.

They’d continue their good fortune by stopping Fanshawe 7-2 and Humber 11-4 on Day 3 of the competition.

A day later, Douglas was put on the defensive when the Sault Cougars lit out to a 6-0 lead after five ends. The Royals composed themselves and rallied, peeling off five points over the eighth and ninth ends to put them within striking distance. They completed the comeback with three in the 10th for a thrilling 9-7 win.

Wrapping up the round-robin, Douglas dropped Concordia 7-5 to advance to the semifinals.

Members of the New Westminster Blackout all get that – and feel the same unease and concerns for health of their families and friends as everyone else.

But for a brief moment, they had visions of big things. And like a lot of people’s hopes, it’s all changed. Just like their moniker, there’s been a virtual blackout when it comes to activities as Canadians try to contain and prevent the spread of the deadly COVID-19 virus.

The women’s soccer team was revelling in a Metro Women’s Soccer League Div. 3 regular season title, and had trained to meet the rival North Shore Fusion last Sunday in a semifinal. The Metro circuit, along with every other sports league, pulled the plug as public safety understandably took precedence over a soccer game.

“This is not how we imagined ending our season,” said Blackout head coach, Scott Loewen. “These players were killing it this year.”

In their final game, played two weeks ago, New West blanked the North Shore Icicles 8-0. In February, they racked up a couple shutouts – 9-0 over West Coast and 5-0 over city rival New West Hyacks, along with a 3-1 victory over Delta United.

What they did accomplish over a season was an impressive 15-2-1 record – with the lone loss coming in the season opener. Once the calendar turned to cup action, New West turned it up a notch in four straight victories, that saw them out-score the competition 25-3 and post three shutouts.

Netminder Jasmine Kazi has been a major part of the team’s success, registering nine clean sheets over 18 games. Her hope was to push it right to a championship final.

“I was really hoping for the chance to play for a medal,” she said.

Carly Cody counted 21 goals on the year, including 10 in knockout and cup games. Teammate Celeste Bain counted 16 goals, and tied Cody with a team-high 11 during the regular season.

When the soccer does resume, the 2020-21 season will see the spoils of their efforts rewarded with promotion to Div. 2, something that the players had their eye on when the season started last September.

“This is the second straight year the Blackout have earned promotion to a higher division for next season,” remarked team manager Wayne McCarthy. “The MWSL Cup final is a large event with hundreds of people in attendance. With the government and health officials banning events with more than 250 people, the writing was on the wall. It would have been great if we had the chance to play for the cup but it is completely understandable that the league chose the safety of the players over anything else. I have no doubt the Blackout will want to prove this season wasn’t a one-off when we come back in September.”

Also contributing on the standout season were Madison Catton, Sydney Chu, Oriana Dalla-Vecchia, Jupdeep Dhillon, Simran Dhillon, Ellery Hardy, Maya Hoonjan, Jordan Liebelt, Xena Loewen, Zoe Loewen, Camilla Markman, Sarah McCarthy, Naomi Noda, Julia Saraiva, Sarah Spring and Sierra Watkinson.

School Sports (BCSS) announced Monday that the spring season of play has been suspended indefinitely.

Prior to Tuesday’s announcement from the provincial government that shuttered B.C. schools until further notice, BCSS issued a notice to all coaches and athletic directors.

The memorandum, sent to all BCSS members from its board of directors, directed that all activities related to school sports, including training, practices, jamborees, scrimmages, matches and inter- and intra-school sports activities, were to cease.

“We recognize that schools across the province are out on spring break for the next one or two weeks, but note that many train or compete with their school team during spring break. … All school sports activities, including those noted above, are to remain cancelled until further notice from B.C. School Sports,” the memorandum stated.

“Due to the speed at which things are changing, we will evaluate the situation moving forward, and determine the ability to safely offer a spring season of play at a later date.”

That decision involves all spring sports, including girls soccer, rugby, badminton, track and field, golf, ball hockey, netball, tennis, ultimate and volleyball.

The scheduled BCSS annual general meeting, scheduled for April 18 to 19, has also been suspended. The board is looking at potential dates in June but will wait for guidance from provincial health authorities before proceeding.

The Burnaby-New West spring season began a couple of weeks ago. The senior girls soccer season got off to a bang for both Alpha and Burnaby Central.

New Westminster and Burnaby North also won a pair of games each.

It’s a prudent measure that will hopefully help slow the spread of the disease. It also has fans wondering: what does this mean for the Canucks?

Let’s start with the obvious: one of the least important aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic is how it affects your favourite sports team. Focus first on taking appropriate precautionary measures: wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, work from home if you can, avoid large gatherings and disinfect frequently touched surfaces.

article continues below

If you do feel symptoms, stay home and self-quarantine except to get medical care if you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing. It’s important for everyone not to panic, but also to take this pandemic seriously. Being too cautious can make a big difference in limiting the strain on our medical system during these types of outbreaks.

With all that in mind, let’s look at how this could all play out for the Canucks. Here are six different possibilities.

1 | The NHL completes the regular season after a break

If the NHL is open to pushing the playoffs through the end of July, they likely could complete the regular season, albeit with some likely awkward scheduling. This is the best case scenario for the NHL, which would surely like to avoid a shortened season, but is it the best case scenario for the Canucks?

The upside for the Canucks is that this would likely mean the return of some key players for those last 13 games of the regular season. Josh Leivo (fractured knee) was a possibility to return for the playoffs, so could potentially return for the regular season in this scenario. The same is true for Jay Beagle, who has been day-to-day with an undisclosed injury, and Chris Tanev, who might actually be able to make it to 82 games for the first time in his career after all.

The most important player that could return, however, is Jacob Markstrom. The Canucks have yet to place a timeline on Markstrom’s return, which is concerning, but he has started skating again. That suggests Markstrom could have returned to game action sometime in March, so should hopefully be ready to go if the NHL season resumes in April.

One thing that has become clear is that the Canucks don’t actually have the depth to deal with significant injuries. In particular, Markstrom’s injury has exposed some serious flaws in the Canucks’ defensive game that aren’t going away any time soon. If Markstrom can return before the regular season restarts, that increases the Canucks’ odds of finishing strong and not only staying in playoff position, but moving up the standings in the Pacific Division.

The issue is that this might be too optimistic. In order to fit in the remainder of the regular season, the COVID-19 pandemic would need to wind down remarkably quickly, with various governments around the world taking ideal steps to limit the spread of the virus. The warmer weather is supposed to help, but it might be more realistic to expect the NHL's season to be on hold for longer than four to six weeks.

2 | The NHL runs a limited regular season schedule to even out games

This is a dangerous scenario for the Canucks, who currently sit just outside the playoffs, but with games in hand. The Canucks are tied in points with the Nashville Predators at 78, but are below them in the standings because they have one fewer regulation win.

The most games played by any NHL team right now is 71. The Canucks have played 69. That means they, and several other teams, would need to play two more games to balance out the schedule.

Likewise, the Predators would play two more games, as would the Minnesota Wild, who are just one point behind the Canucks.

The Winnipeg Jets are currently in the first Wild Card spot with 80 points in 71 games played. In order to guarantee a playoff spot, the Canucks would have to finish ahead of the Jets, as the Jets would hold the tiebreaker with 30 regulation wins. That means they would need three points in those two games: they’d have to win one game and get the other at least to overtime.

If the Canucks lose both games, they’d be out for sure, as they would finish below the Predators. If they pick up just one or two points, they’d be at the mercy of the Predators and Wild. Three points would be the only way to be sure.

Do you trust these Canucks, who have swung so wildly from excellent to awful this season, to pick up three points in two games?

3 | The NHL jumps straight to the playoffs, uses standard tiebreaker rules

I wouldn’t say this is the worst case scenario for the Canucks — that involves a zombie apocalypse — but this still wouldn’t be good.

As mentioned above, the Canucks are currently just outside the playoff picture, tied in points with the Predators but below them in the standings due to one fewer regulation win.

That would mean the Canucks’ final game of the season was the shootout win on Wednesday against the New York Islanders. If they had won that game in regulation, they’d still be tied with the Predators in points, but would have the advantage in the tiebreaker, as they would have one more regulation or overtime win.

That would be the most painful way possible for the Canucks to miss the playoffs this season, particularly since they’d still have games in hand on six of the teams ahead of them in the standings in the Western Conference.

4 | The NHL jumps straight to the playoffs, uses points percentage

The first tiebreaker in the standings is points percentage, which means the percentage of available points a team has earned given the number of games they have played. This is mainly used during the season to determine waiver wire priority and to sort the standings.

At the end of the season, points percentage is meaningless, as all teams have played the same number of games — the standings by points percentage are the exact same as the standings by points. When teams have played differing numbers of games, however, the standings change significantly when you go by points percentage.

To wit, the Canucks would go from ninth place in the Western Conference and outside the playoffs all the way up to third in the Pacific Division based on points percentage. Those two games in hand make a big difference, as would the crucial shootout win on Wednesday against the Islanders.

It’s extremely close. The Canucks’ points percentage is 0.565: they’ve earned 56.5 per cent of the available 138 points from their 69 games, placing them behind the Vegas Golden Knights (0.606) and Edmonton Oilers (0.585) in the Pacific.

It also places them just barely ahead of the Calgary Flames (0.564), who would fall to the second Wild Card spot, just barely making the playoffs ahead of the Winnipeg Jets (0.563). You can imagine how upset the Jets and their fans would be, missing the playoffs by 0.1 per cent despite actually having one more point than the Flames and two more points than the Canucks and Predators.

While ranking by points percentage would be the most fair way to sort the standings for teams that have played a differing amount of games, it certainly wouldn’t feel very fair to the Jets.

For the Canucks, this would be an ideal scenario. They would face the Oilers in the first round of the playoffs, likely with important players returning from injury. They’re 2-2-0 against the Oilers this season, but have out-shot them 131 to 109 and out-scored them 13 to 10. While it wouldn’t be an easy series against two of the most dangerous forwards in the NHL, Leon Draisaitl and Connor McDavid, it would be a winnable one.

5 | The NHL gets wacky, hosts play-in games

Let’s say the NHL recognizes the unfairness of ranking the standings by standard tiebreaker rules or by points percentage, but also doesn’t want to deal with rescheduling a bunch of regular season games, particularly for a bunch of teams that have no hope of making the playoffs?

One possible way would be to have play-in games for teams on the playoff bubble. Let’s say that the top two teams in each division are in the playoffs, but the remaining eight playoff spots are up for grabs, with each conference holding single-elimination games between the next eight best teams, seeded by the current standings.

That would give the Canucks a chance to make the playoffs, but they would have to beat the Nashville Predators to do it. That seems fairer than eliminating the Canucks because they have one fewer regulation win than the Predators, or eliminating the Jets because they have a 0.1 per cent lower points percentage than the Flames.

Alternately, the NHL could declare that the top three teams in each division make the playoffs and have play-in games for the two wild card spots between the next four teams. The end result would be the same for the Canucks: a one game playoff against the Predators to make the playoffs.

Honestly, it seems pretty fair and adds some drama to the proceedings. For the Canucks, they’d have to like their chances: they swept the season series against the Predators, out-scoring them 17 to 8.

6 | The NHL cancels the whole season and the playoffs

The last time the Stanley Cup wasn’t awarded was because of the 2004-05 lockout. But before that, the Cup was awarded every year in its history except for 1919, when the playoffs were cancelled due to an outbreak of Spanish Flu, which hit the Montreal Canadiens particularly hard.

All but three Canadiens players fell ill and were hospitalized and Canadiens defenceman Joe Hall died from pneumonia brought on by the flu four days after the playoffs were canceled.

If the COVID-19 pandemic becomes serious enough that the NHL cancels the playoffs and the Stanley Cup isn’t awarded, perhaps it should be seen as a blessing in disguise. Better to cancel the playoffs than have an entire team contract a potentially deadly disease.

As to what this would mean for the Canucks, one of the key questions is whether they would be considered to have “made the playoffs” in regards to their first-round pick that was traded to the Tampa Bay Lightning for J.T. Miller.

If the standings go by standard tiebreakers, then the Canucks retain their pick. If it goes by points percentage, they lose the pick, with no playoffs as consolation.

Let’s hope it doesn’t come to that.

Against the Canucks on Tuesday night, the Islanders racked up a season-high 49 shots on goal, desperate to pick up a win and stay in the Eastern Conference playoff race. Unfortunately for the Islanders, their season-high in shots was met by a career-high in saves from Thatcher Demko.

article continues below

While he needed some run support from the skaters in front of him, Demko absolutely stole this game for the Canucks, making 45 saves. Many of those saves were absolute robbery, repeatedly stealing what seemed to be sure goals away from the visiting team.

Demko appeared to have it out for Mathew Barzal in particular. Barzal had a game-high seven shots, but didn’t score a single goal. Demko stymied him time after time in all three periods in regulation, then once more in overtime. Then, to really rub it in, Demko stopped him for an eighth time in the shootout.

It was exactly the type of goaltending performance the Canucks needed to bust them out of their current slump. Now they just need phenomenal goaltending every single game so they don’t immediately fall into another slump. Either that or they could improve their defensive efforts, but let’s not get crazy here.

I didn’t get crazy when I watched this game.

Loui Eriksson was a healthy scratch for this game, but I’m not sure the team giving up 49 shots in his absence will disabuse Travis Green of the notion that he needs Eriksson’s steady (and boring) defensive game in the Canucks’ lineup. The only Canuck that has been on the ice for a lower rate of scoring chances against than Eriksson is Brock Boeser.



Speaking of, Boeser made his return to the lineup and looked good. I mean, he always looks good — it’s the hair — but he also played some solid hockey, finishing the game with three shots on goal in 17:17 in ice time. He wasn’t perfect and there were a couple moments where his timing looked a little off and he was a second slow to a loose puck or board battle, but it’s a positive sign that he looked so comfortable so quickly.



One of those sluggish moments came on his first shift, when he reached with his stick along the boards instead of engaging in a puck battle. That led to an extended possession in the offensive zone for the Islanders. When Tanner Pearson gave the puck away on a bad pass to Boeser, the Islanders took advantage: Andrew Ladd tipped in Josh Bailey’s point shot to open the scoring.



Boeser and Pearson deserve a bit of flak on the goal, but Oscar Fantenberg didn’t look great either, standing back and watching instead of trying to tie up Ladd’s stick in front. It was a tough night for Fantenberg: like Hera in The Adjuster, he mostly just watched terrible things happen in front of him, while doing very little about it.



The Canucks responded 21 seconds later, with the energy line of Antoine Roussel, Adam Gaudette and Zack MacEwen going to work in the offensive zone. Roussel chased down a loose puck behind the net, and then banked the puck back to Troy Stecher at the point, who relayed it to Alex Edler. His point shot was neatly tipped past Semyon Varlamov by Gaudette, with Roussel simultaneously crashing the crease.



Less than a minute later, the Canucks took the lead. Quinn Hughes jumped up in the rush to create a three on two, giving the puck to Elias Pettersson for the zone entry. He found Tyler Toffoli cross-ice with a lovely saucer pass that evaded three Islanders’ sticks before finding Toffoli’s perfectly. A pass that perfect deserved a perfect finish and Toffoli delivered, roofing the puck over Varlamov’s glove.



A pair of penalties put the Canucks down by two men, which is when Thatcher Demko went off. He was remarkable on the five on three, making a series of fantastic saves; none better than his lunging right pad save on Barzal while in the splits. His legs were splayed out like a banana peel to make that save.

After the successful kill, the Canucks swarmed the Islanders like a cloud of flies, buzzing all around the net, with the first and second lines combining for a long offensive zone possession and a drawn penalty. But it was the Islanders that got the next goal, taking advantage of a defensive breakdown by Jake Virtanen and Brandon Sutter.



The Canucks were in good shape on the 2-2 goal, matched up man-on-man on an Islanders rush, but then Virtanen got caught puck watching and his man slipped in behind him. That left Sutter with a choice: stick with his man or take Virtanen’s. He ended up in no man’s land, taking neither. Virtanen’s man was Jordan Eberle, and Barzal slipped a sneaky pass through to him and Eberle had plenty of room to deke to the backhand and beat Demko.



The energy line got the Canucks back in the lead with another tip-in goal. It seemed to come out of nowhere, created ex nihilo. Edler blocked a ring-around along the boards and threw the puck towards the net. Like Al Jackson Jr., MacEwen had perfect timing, darting in front of the net just as Edler shot, tipping the puck past Varlamov.



Demko robbed Barzal off the rush not long after, with a picture-perfect slide to his left. It wasn’t a desperation save, but he pushed across hard, got his pad level with the ice with his glove open above his pad, with everything aligned just right to steal a goal away from Barzal. He was pulling out bigger stops than an organist playing the Wanamaker Organ.





Unfortunately, the skaters in front of Demko weren’t making as many stops. Oscar Fantenberg got caught puck-watching as he expected the play to get blown dead for a hand pass. Instead, Brock Nelson, who originally played the puck with his hand, skated behind Fantenberg and onto the loose puck, negating the hand pass, and then negating the Canucks’ lead with a nifty backhand to make it 3-3.



The Canucks regained the lead before the end of the second with a perfectly-executed power play. Quinn Hughes walked the line, opening up J.T. Miller on the left side. Miller faked a slap shot, freezing defenceman Scott Mayfield, who was defending Bo Horvat in the slot. Miller sent the puck down to Toffoli below the goal line and he one-touched it to Horvat, who sent the puck up stairs without any dinner for his team-leading 12th power play goal of the season.



The one-goal lead didn’t last, as the Canucks continued to bleed shots against. The sheer number of shots they allowed increased the probability of a lucky bounce for the Islanders and they got one as a third period power play expired. Derrick Brassard’s shot was tipped and went up off the chest of Anthony Beauvillier to Brock Nelson at the side of the net for the tap-in goal.



The Canucks rang some posts after Nelson’s goal, but couldn’t get the game-winner in either the third period or overtime. In the shootout, Demko continued his dominance, shutting out the three Islanders shooters. At the other end, Miller came through with a glove-side finish while moving from left to right, the only goal scored in the shootout.



There was an oddity: with Boeser shooting for the win in his return to the lineup, his shootout attempt was cut short by a fan throwing a puck onto the ice. The refs blew the play dead and Boeser got to shoot again, but it was like icing the kicker. Would Boeser have scored on that initial attempt? Maybe. Maybe not. But he didn’t on the second attempt, so we’re free to speculate that the thrown puck also threw off his concentration.



The win puts the Canucks back in playoff position, but precariously so. They’re now in the second wild card spot, tied in points with the Nashville Predators ahead of them and the Winnipeg Jets behind them, with the Minnesota Wild just one point back.

583,newwestrecord,https://www.newwestrecord.ca/sports/brock-boeser-returning-to-the-canucks-lineup-tuesday-night-1.24094773,Brock Boeser returning to the Canucks lineup Tuesday night,['Daniel Wagner'],,"The Canucks got some good news this week at a time when they badly needed some: Brock Boeser is back.

The sniper is expected to be in the lineup against the New York Islanders on Tuesday night, a welcome surprise considering Canucks GM Jim Benning had previously reported he could miss the rest of the regular season.

article continues below

“I’m in tonight,” Boeser told reporters after Tuesday’s game day skate. “I’m ready to go and help this team out any way I can.”

It raises questions about why his injury was reported as an eight-week timeline in the first place, but Boeser suggested it was because other Canucks have had the same injury and faced different timelines.

“I think we’ve had a few guys in the past that have had different timelines,” said Boeser, “so it was kind of hard to say when I’d be ready, but I was doing everything I could to get back as fast as I could.”

The Canucks have badly missed Brock Boeser since he left the lineup a month ago with fractured rib cartilage.

As much as the Canucks have struggled without Jacob Markstrom, their issues started before Markstrom got hurt, with the second-worst record in the NHL since Feb. 1. They’re currently just outside the playoffs, one point behind the Minnesota Wild. A big reason for their struggles has been the absence of Boeser.

The Canucks quickly traded for Tyler Toffoli to play in Boeser’s spot on the top line, and Toffoli has been good, but he doesn’t quite fill that Boeser-sized gap. One of the issues is that, by the numbers, the top line with Elias Pettersson and J.T. Miller has been better defensively this season with Boeser than they have been with Toffoli.

Meanwhile, Bo Horvat has played with a Franken-winger stitched together from two imperfect forwards: Loui Eriksson when the Canucks needed defensive responsibility and Jake Virtanen when they needed free-wheeling offence.

It was an imperfect solution for Horvat’s wing: with Eriksson they could shut down opposing lines but struggled to create anything offensively. With Virtanen, the line was more dangerous offensively, but his defensive issues make it harder to use them as a match-up line.

At practice on Tuesday, Boeser was on Horvat’s line with Pearson, suggesting that the Franken-winger experiment has ended. Boeser provides plenty of offensive pop and has shown plenty of chemistry with Horvat in the past, but he also has taken big steps forward in his all-around, two-way game, making him a better fit in a match-up role.

“Bo and Peers and whoever they’re playing with always go against the top guys and I’ve personally felt I’ve taken some strides defensively,” said Boeser. “I know if I’m with them tonight, I’ve gotta be prepared in that aspect. Then again, I think if we play our game we can get a lot of offensive zone time and produce for the team.”

Boeser’s return also gives the Canucks the option of reuniting the Lotto Line — putting Boeser back with Miller and Pettersson — and bumping Toffoli down to the Horvat line. Toffoli also has a strong two-way profile and past chemistry with Pearson from their years together in the Los Angeles Kings organization.

That gives the Canucks a stronger top two lines and allows them to be more deliberate with the construction of their bottom six. It looks like both Eriksson and Virtanen will play with Brandon Sutter, while the line of Antoine Roussel, Adam Gaudette and Zack MacEwen, which recently saw success against the Colorado Avalanche, will stay together.

As for the power play, the Canucks are keeping the top unit from the last month intact, putting Boeser on the second unit.

For Boeser, the quick return to the lineup is some welcome good luck in a career that has thus far been filled with bad luck when it comes to injuries. He has yet to play 70 games in a season thus far in his career, though he could reach that number if he stays healthy for the Canucks’ remaining 14 games.

“I think it’s just part of the game. You could say it’s unlucky or whatever, it’s just kind of frustrating,” said Boeser. “It’s rare, breaking your back, then from that compensating, having a different injury, and then taking just a small little soft bump and something popping. It sucks, but I try to look at it as a positive and come back and be fresh.”

Perhaps that will help the Canucks the most: Boeser is well-rested, even if he may have to take short shifts Tuesday night, as he acknowledged with a smile. His return will hopefully provide a spark to the rest of the lineup as they look to halt their recent slide in the standings.

The win put the Canucks within two points of the Pacific Division lead, with two games in hand.

Two days later, fans got the news that Jacob Markstrom was out with a knee injury and the Canucks have just two wins since. With five losses in their last six games, the team has slid down to the final wild card spot in the Western Conference and their hold on the playoffs is tenuous at best: they’re tied in points with the two teams below them in the standings, the Nashville Predators and Winnipeg Jets.

They’re in a tight spot and things are looking grim. They’re 6-9-2 since the beginning of February — the only team with fewer points in that time is the Detroit Red Wings, and the Red Wings are having a legendarily bad season, with a chance at the worst record in franchise history.

Suffice it to say, you don’t want to be compared to the Red Wings this season.

Of course, the season isn’t over yet and the Canucks still have an opportunity to reverse their fortunes and claim their first playoff spot in five years. They’re not even sitting outside the playoffs right now! Their fate is in their hands!



According to the playoff odds at HockeyViz, the Canucks have a 54 per cent chance of making the playoffs. That’s slightly better odds than flipping a coin, but that’s not particularly comforting: the Canucks have never had much luck with coin flips.

Keep in mind, however, the Canucks have outperformed expectations and are likely to exceed the experts’ point projections from the preseason. This season still feels like a step forward from last season, even if they fall short of the playoffs. So, would it really be so bad to miss the playoffs?

Yes. Yes, it would.

Missing the playoffs this season would be a disaster: here are six reasons why.

1 | They spent on a rental at the trade deadline

The Canucks were in a position to be buyers at the trade deadline, so they bought, adding Tyler Toffoli from the Los Angeles Kings. They made the move a little earlier than deadline day, with Brock Boeser’s injury adding urgency to their need for another top-six winger.

Toffoli quickly fit in on the top line and has eight points in nine games with the Canucks. He’s been fine — good, even! — but he’s also in the final year of his contract. It’s possible, perhaps even likely, that the Canucks won’t be able to re-sign Toffoli, as they’ll have other contracts to negotiate taking up cap space, and Toffoli could potentially get a big payday on the open market, where he’ll be one of the top forwards available in free agency.

Sending a second-round pick and prospect Tyler Madden to the Kings for Toffoli is a reasonable price to pay for a contending team that needs one more piece. It’s a little more questionable for a team with no certainty of making the playoffs. If Toffoli doesn’t re-sign and the Canucks miss the playoffs, that price is going to look very high for 23 games from Toffoli.

2 | They might not get elite goaltending from Jacob Markstrom again

Jacob Markstrom has been a beast for the Canucks this season, wedging himself into not just the Vezina conversation, but also the Hart conversation. He’s stolen games for the Canucks all year long and repeatedly bailed out his teammates when they’ve given up golden scoring chances.

Simply put, the Canucks are not in playoff position right now without his outstanding play. Here’s the problem: they might not get goaltending that good next season.

There are two reasons for that. One is that Markstrom is a pending unrestricted free agent. The Canucks would love to re-sign the goaltender, but he will command a high price for his services, whether it’s the Canucks coughing up the coin or another team opening their coffers. There’s a real possibility that he signs somewhere else.

Even if he doesn’t, however, there’s no guarantee that Markstrom will be able to repeat his performance from this season, which has been truly remarkable. Keep in mind, Markstrom is 30 years old. While some goaltenders continue to perform at a high level into their 30s, some don’t — you just have to look at 31-year-old Sergei Bobrovsky, who has crashed and burned in his first season of a seven-year, $10 million-per-year contract with the Florida Panthers.

Hopefully Markstrom returns to the Canucks next season and excels, but in case he doesn’t, it would seem a shame to waste such a fantastic season by missing the playoffs, particularly since he had no control over his fate given his injury.

3 | It would mean squandering healthy seasons from key players

As much as the Canucks have recently been bitten by the injury bug — in this case a bullet ant — they’ve been remarkably healthy the rest of the season.

Elias Pettersson, J.T. Miller and Bo Horvat have stayed healthy all season long. Quinn Hughes has missed just one game. The Canucks’ defence hasn’t had to dig any deeper than their seventh defenceman, as, against all likelihood, Chris Tanev has played every game this season. Jacob Markstrom and Thatcher Demko have started all but one game for the Canucks this season. By Canucks standards, they’ve been incredibly healthy.

Sure, by normal teams’ standards, they haven’t been healthy at all — they have the fifth-most man games lost this season — but their key players have mostly been in the lineup all season. That’s not something you can count on happening every season.

4 | Missing the playoffs means next year’s first-round draft pick isn’t lottery protected

Here’s a big one: the first-round pick that the Canucks sent to the Tampa Bay Lightning for J.T. Miller — which they then traded to the New Jersey Devils — is a conditional pick. If the Canucks make the playoffs, the Devils get the 2020 pick; if they miss the playoffs, the Devils get the 2021 pick.

On the one hand, getting a first-round pick in what is expected to be a deep 2020 draft isn’t the worst consolation prize for missing the playoffs. On the other hand, the 2021 pick has no lottery protections, which means it could wind up being the first-overall pick — the first in Canucks history — and it will go to the Devils.

That’s a worst-case scenario, but it’s also one that’s terrifyingly realistic. It’s easy to imagine the Canucks having worse injury luck next season and sliding down the standings but with no first-round pick to console them, much like what is currently occurring with the San Jose Sharks, whose first-round pick belongs to the Ottawa Senators.

5 | It would be a waste of J.T. Miller's career year

When Jim Benning traded a first-round pick for J.T. Miller, he was taking a risk. Miller had never scored more than 23 goals in a season and had a career high of 58 points. Whilie he was playing in a more limited role on a deep Tampa Bay Lightning team, there was no guarantee that he would thrive in a first-line role with the Canucks.

Miller has blown everyone's expectations out of the water. He's blown his previous career highs out of the water: his 27 goals is tied for the team lead with Pettersson and his 71 points leads the Canucks outright. Miller has meshed wonderfully with Pettersson on the first line and been a big boon to the first power play unit.

While it would be nice if a point-per-game was the new normal for Miller, there's a distinct possibility that he regresses next season. His on-ice shooting percentage at five on five — the percentage of shots that go in for the Canucks while he's on the ice — is 10.25 per cent, the highest of his career. His individual shooting percentage at five on five is 15.79 per cent, again the highest of his career.

While it's possible that those numbers are sustainable as long as he plays with a great playmaker and finisher like Pettersson, it's not likely. It's more probable that those percentages regress closer to his career average, which means a likely dip in production next year.

There's something to be said for striking while the iron is hot. Missing the playoffs while Miller is playing the best hockey of his career would seem like a missed opportunity.

6 | Playoff hockey is the best hockey and it sucks to be on the outside looking in

This is the reason that, in many ways, matters most. There are few things better in the world of sports than playoff hockey. It’s a thrilling, sickening, devastating and enthralling spectacle that can take you to emotional extremes in an instant.

Canucks fans haven’t known those thrills for four long years. Sure, that’s nothing compared to the playoff droughts of some other NHL franchises, but that doesn’t make it any less painful to repeatedly be looking forward to the draft lottery instead of the playoffs.

This year would be particularly painful because fans got their hopes so high. The Canucks weren’t just on the playoff bubble, battling for a wild card spot; they were at the top of the Pacific Division, with visions of home-ice advantage in the playoffs. For the Canucks to miss the playoffs now would be devastating.

If it would be devastating for the fans, it would be doubly so for the players.

“That’s where everyone in the room wants to be, that’s what we’re pushing for,” said Elias Pettersson after Sunday’s loss to the Columbus Blue Jackets. “Every game, every point matters. Every shift matters, like today we lost the game with one puck. I want to do everything I can to make the playoffs.”

If the Canucks do miss the playoffs, perhaps one of the few positives is that it will likely light a fire in the belly of Pettersson and the other hyper-competitive young Canucks to come out next season with more speed, more power and more skill.

An even bigger positive, of course, would be the Canucks making the playoffs right now, then still getting that belly-fire lit for next season by whatever occurs in the playoffs. The reeling Canucks need to reel off some wins in a hurry.

The notion of establishing a framework to commercialize cannabis began as a promise by the Liberal Party in the 2015 federal election campaign that led to Justin Trudeau becoming prime minister. The implementation of the policy was not as smooth as first envisioned, and the provincial governments were put in charge of setting guidelines for the sale and consumption of marijuana.

article continues below

Research Co. and Glacier Media have been tracking perceptions about legalization every six months in British Columbia. Our latest survey shows that agreement with the new rules remains high across the entire province, that some residents are starting to ponder a future when other drugs could be treated in the same fashion as cannabis, and that – in stark contrast with what we found last year – marijuana users in British Columbia are starting to acquire all of their product through licensed retailers.

As more time passes, British Columbians appear happier with the decision to end prohibition. Seven in 10 of the province’s residents (70%) agree with marijuana being legal in Canada, while 26% disagree and 3% are undecided.

These findings represent a seven-point increase since a similar survey conducted in October 2019, as legal cannabis approached its first anniversary. The groups that are more likely to voice satisfaction with the new status quo are men (75%), British Columbians aged 35 to 54 (76%) and residents of northern B.C. (80%).

In recent weeks, we have seen more talk about creating a safe supply for drugs that are currently available only through illegal means. The impact of these discussions has led to a shift in the views of British Columbians about legalizing all drugs. It must be completely acknowledged that sizable majorities of the province’s residents continue to oppose a move to place any controlled substance inside a store, but the proponents of this option have grown since late last year.

At least two-thirds of British Columbians are opposed to legalizing ecstasy (66%), powder cocaine (70%), heroin (72%), crack cocaine (73%), methamphetamine or “crystal meth” (74%) and fentanyl (75%).

Support for making some of these drugs available in a fashion that would conceivably meet the same guidelines that govern cannabis has risen over the past six months, to 25% for cocaine (up from 18%) and to 24% for heroin (up from 19%). While these are still low proportions, the fluctuation could signal the start of a trend.

Just 10% of British Columbians say they only consumed marijuana after it became legal. Identical proportions of residents tried it before October 2018 (45%) or have never consumed it in Canada (also 45%). The incidence of “legal-only” marijuana users is highest among residents aged 18 to 34 (18%) and those who live in southern B.C. (19%).

But perhaps the biggest surprise, and a source of satisfaction for policy makers, is the way in which cannabis is being sought by users. Just over half of British Columbians who have consumed marijuana since legalization (51%) say that all of their product was acquired at a licensed retailer. In October 2019, only 31% of cannabis consumers in the province were getting all of their product at a licensed retailer.

We still see 16% of British Columbians who say none of their marijuana has been bought at a licensed retailer – a proportion that climbs to 25% among those aged 55 and over. Two-thirds of cannabis consumers aged 35 to 54 (68%) are buying all of their product at a licensed retailer.

Even though the delivery of cannabis products has improved over the past six months, there are significant regional differences that are indubitably related to the presence of stores in specific areas of the province. Cannabis consumers who reside in southern B.C. and Metro Vancouver are the most likely to be getting all of their product from licensed retailers (63% and 62%). The numbers are significantly lower in Vancouver Island (29%), northern B.C. (24%) and the Fraser Valley (19%).

Finally, the issue of “drug testing” remains a priority for British Columbians, with 61% saying that companies in the province should “definitely” or “probably” be able to administer these examinations to any employee now that marijuana is legal.

After a bumpy start that featured slow store openings and hitches with delivery options, there are signs that cannabis legalization is starting to work in a better fashion. More consumers are getting all of their product through licensed retailers, and the number of “new users” has not increased dramatically. Still, the significant regional disparities suggest that more marijuana outlets will need to be authorized in order to effectively eliminate the black market.

Prejudice is indeed pandemic. Bigotry is a virus. And we all have the potential to be hosts (even those of us from racialized minorities).

We’re not born with it in our blood. It’s transmitted from person to person. From family to family. It’s learned through conversations, comments, jokes, judgements, looks, books, micro-aggressions, political rhetoric, insults, attitudes, ignorance, and even classroom lesson plans.

It infects entire institutions to the point where everyone within the organization becomes immune to biased hiring practices, offensive language, token diversity, racial and religious profiling, and exclusive, patriarchal power structures.

And like COVID-19, it won’t just go away on its own. We have to track it and attack it. We have to trace it, isolate it, and call it out. By name. Persistently. We have to propose anti-racist policies, pass anti-racist laws, and push for anti-racist consequences.

We have to stop passively and proudly saying we’re not racist. And we have to start actively and loudly being anti-racist. We have to listen to those with lived experience.

We have to hold elected officials (and each other) accountable. We have to. And we can.

The world has changed dramatically over the last two months, since George Floyd took his last breath on May 25, 2020. In many ways, the globe has gotten smaller, as evidenced by the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus (with about 13.5 million cases worldwide and over 580,000 deaths and rising), and the massive outpouring of protesters on city streets from Vancouver to Sydney screaming that Black Lives Matter.

No matter what language we speak or what corner of the Earth we inhabit, “social distancing” has become a part of our everyday vocabulary and behaviour.

Yet science has proven that all human beings – regardless of colour, class, culture, gender, or sexual orientation – are inextricably linked like never before.

As the motto goes, we’re all in this together. Overnight, we’ve all become armchair epidemiologists. Following the lead of our Provincial Health Officer, Dr. Bonnie Henry, British Columbians have sacrificed and worked hard to flatten the curve of COVID-19.

Complacency is not an option. We can’t afford to go backwards. And we must be equally vigilant and aggressive to finally squash the scourge of white supremacy, police brutality, systemic racism, and hatred in all its insidious forms.

Silence is no longer acceptable. We’re in a pandemic. And lives are at stake.

587,newwestrecord,https://www.newwestrecord.ca/sports/gun-violence-imported-from-u-s-is-a-key-concern-for-canadians-1.24169958,Gun violence imported from U.S. is a key concern for Canadians,['Mario Canseco'],,"National governments have a tendency to overreact immediately after they are forced to face an unexpected challenge. No example is better than the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks in the United States, which gave us the “Patriot Act” after just 45 days of deliberation to expand government surveillance of Americans to previously unimagined levels.

In mid-April, the actions of Gabriel Wortman led to the deaths of 22 people in Nova Scotia after multiple shootings and fires. Most Canadians, at the time still under lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, were horrified at Wortman’s actions, which included impersonating a police officer.

article continues below

It took the federal government only 13 days after Wortman’s criminal activity was evident for the entire country to announce a nationwide ban on 1,500 types of military-grade “assault-style” weapons in Canada. Any Canadian who possesses these firearms will have two years to get rid of them. The prohibition led to many new discussions about the role that firearms play in Canada’s urban and rural areas.

We know now that the perpetrator of the 22 murders in Nova Scotia had obtained his weapons illegally from Canadian and American sources. This was not a surprise for Canadian authorities, who have consistently reported that more than 70% of the weapons used in gun-related crimes in our country come from the United States.

On the issue of firearms, Canada is decidedly different from the United States. In Canada, it is not legal for a person to own or carry a firearm for the purpose of self defence against human beings. When Research Co. and Glacier Media asked Canadians about this key precept of Canadian law, more than three in four (77%) agreed with it, while 18% disagreed and 5% were undecided.

Atlantic Canada (31%), Saskatchewan and Manitoba (29%) and Alberta (24%) boast the highest number of residents who openly question Canada’s long-standing regulations for firearms. While higher than what is observed in Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia, these are not proportions of voters that would sway an election, certainly not in the way American statewide and congressional races can be tilted if your candidate can adequately hold a shotgun and recite the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution in a manner that panders to the base.

Fewer than one in five Canadians welcome the notion of citizens carrying firearms for something other than hunting or scaring wildlife away. Any survey measuring opinions on banning “assault-style” weapons would be met with near unanimity. The opposition reacted to the announced ban as it always has under its outgoing leader, by claiming the regulations would affect law-abiding Canadians. Lost in this unfortunate combination of inadequate polling and incapable opposition are the solutions that matter to Canadians.

In our survey, more than three in five Canadians (63%) told us that gun violence in Canada is a “very serious” or “moderately serious” problem – a proportion that climbs to 69% among women and 68% among those aged 55 and over.

Sizable majorities of Ontarians and British Columbians, who have experienced gang wars in urban areas, are more likely to look at gun violence as particularly problematic (76% and 67%, respectively). The COVID-19 pandemic did little to curb gun violence in Toronto, where 61 people were shot in the first four months of the year.

We asked Canadians about the effectiveness of four possible measures, and their responses outline a public that is ready for bold action. More than three in five Canadians (62%) think enacting a complete ban on handguns would be “very effective” or “moderately effective” in reducing gun violence in Canada. Most crimes, after all, are not being committed with the military-grade “assault-style” weapons that the federal government was quick to ban.

A higher proportion of Canadians deem two other measures as effective: imposing mandatory jail terms for crimes committed with firearms (74%) and introducing new outreach programs to steer youth away from gangs (also 74%).

Canadians place dealing with firearms smuggled from the United States as the most important issue that needs to be addressed. Many of the country’s residents also want to make sure gangs are not attractive to our country’s youth and believe mandatory minimum jail sentences would act as a deterrent.

Banning military-grade “assault-style” weapons is low-hanging fruit in a challenge that definitely has Canadians preoccupied and wishing for a type of government intervention that goes beyond a photo-op celebrated by poorly executed survey charity work.

True sociologists know that we learn nothing from posing the wrong questions to Canadians, and capable politicians should go beyond voicing displeasure with plans and proposals just because that is what they are expected to do. Meanwhile, Canadians are still worried about gun violence and expecting their elected officials to do better. •

“Needles aren’t used on the face,” Doreen explains, “Instead, I use an extremely low stimulation of electric current gently applied to the skin and underlying muscles of the face.”

article continues below

Doreen lists five benefits of facial acupuncture you may have not considered:

1. Look and feel younger and rejuvenated

Cosmetic acupuncture combines the wisdom of body acupuncture with facial processes to help you look younger and feel rejuvenated. The process works internally to optimize your health and, therefore, your appearance.

2. Acupuncture addresses the whole face

Unlike Botox injections and other facial treatments, cosmetic acupuncture improves the health of the skin and gently brightens and firms the surface, rather than just addressing the fine lines and wrinkles.

3. Habitual expression lines can be transformed

Acupuncture pathways extend from the tips of your toes to the top of your head and back down again. The acupuncture points on your body relate to the face in a way that can transform those habitual expression lines to give you a calmer, more relaxed appearance.

4. Healthy skin and muscle tissue

The micro-current, low-grade stimulation works from the inside to the outside to stimulate the regeneration of healthy skin and muscle tissue. This type of beauty treatment is unique and offers a combination of several powerful beautifying and energy balancing treatments in one.

5. Reducing furrows between the eyebrows

The furrows between your eyebrows relate to the energy of the liver meridian. The furrows are a quick, visible way for the acupuncturist to assess the state of your liver and the intensity of your stressors.

“I specialize in natural, holistic, non-invasive anti-aging beauty treatments,” says Doreen. “I use high standard, effective and quality products that get results. These products do not contain fillers or synthetic ingredients. I use the best products because my patients deserve the best results the products can offer.”

1. It’s not a seasonal problem

article continues below

Some people think of lice as a school issue, but that’s not the case. “Kids can catch them any time they are mixing with different groups, like at day-camp or on vacation, and with a new class at the start of the school year,” explains Vivian. “It’s a year-round problem.”

2. They do prefer clean hair but any hair will do

It’s not an oldwives’ tale – it’s harder to lay eggs on an oily surface. But, says Vivian, it doesn’t make that much difference, so that’s no reason to skip showers. “Lice will go to anyone. Like mosquitos, they like certain blood types and certain body temperatures, but that won’t stop them from moving to a new head.”

3. Keep your hair tight to the head

“Don’t make a highway for them to travel on. It’s best to tie long hair up – ballerina buns and tight braids are ideal,” says Vivian. “Also, brush your hair daily. They like un-brushed hair because they don’t like to be agitated. Bug them, brush often.”

4. Standard treatments don’t work that well

Chemical treatments like pesticides and insecticides were the only treatment for decades, but they’re not ideal. “Lice have become resistant to them like antibiotic-resistant bacteria,” Vivian says. “They’re really irritating to scalps that are already sensitive, and you need to repeat them every week because they only eradicate live lice.” Combing nits is an option but it is time-consuming, stressful, and can be frustrating because even if you do it for at least an hour, every day, it can still take months.

5. Alternative treatments are available

Vivian is the owner of two Lice Clinics of Canada offices, which use the AirAllé. This FDA- and Health Canada-cleared medical device uses microprocessed heated air to dehydrate lice and their eggs, killing them completely in a single session. Prices for an AirAllé session start at $165. All treatments take place in Lice Clinics of Canada’s clinical setting, which use salon-standard hygiene and sterilisation to ensure no cross-contamination. You can also buy at-home treatments that are toxin-, pesticide- and insecticide-free starting at $25.

Here’s why immigrants are turning to Canada,[],,"We live in an unsettled world—there’s Brexit in Great Britain, labour conflict in France, immigration issues in Germany and economic hardships across Latin America.

Add to that the messages coming out of the United States about border walls and denied entries. No wonder more and more people are choosing Canada as their immigration destination.

article continues below

And Canada couldn’t be happier as it is welcoming people from around the world. By 2021, the country is looking to attract 350,000 immigrants each year.

What is the reason? Canada was built by immigrants and is firmly committed to the ideal that the country is made stronger by the diversity of its people. However, Canada also needs more skilled workers to reach its full economic potential.

“Canada welcomes everyone regardless of race or religion,” says Rachel Gary, COO of Canada Direct. “The Canadian government wants brilliant minds and skilled workers to come here.”

Now is the perfect time for people who want to move to Canada. “More and more people want to become Canadian citizens,” Gary says. “North America has always had huge appeal to people from around the world, even Europeans. Now, with everything that’s happening in the States, more are turning to Canada.”

Canada is a place where everyone can thrive, meet their personal potential and live a happy live.

However, simply stating that you’re moving to Canada for a better life is not enough for immigration. The requirements for immigrating to Canada are based on people’s willingness as well as the ability to contribute to the country’s economy.

“When people come to us asking for information, we make sure they meet proper age and education requirements,” Gary says, explaining that Canada Direct can help their clients go through the entire immigration process from the application stage to submitting all documents for permanent residency.

“There are things that the Canadian government asks of the potential immigrant. It works on a points system and we help people get the required number of points. For instance, everyone, even if they are native speakers, has to take an English proficiency test. We provide the course and help them prepare. We let them know which documents they need and how to bring them up to Canadian standards. If they are able to apply to multiple programs, we do hybrid applications.”

610,newwestrecord,https://www.newwestrecord.ca/standout/5-things-you-didn-t-know-about-dentures-1.23172389,5 things you didn’t know about dentures,[],,"1. What are the advantages?

There are many benefits to wearing dentures, according to Quan Gifford, founder of New West Dentureworks. “Dentures can help improve your chewing ability and help prevent natural teeth from shifting. They give a natural appearance to the face and will help support lips and cheeks so they don’t collapse,” she says. “Wearing dentures can even help with speech – there’s often an improvement in pronunciation when you replace missing teeth. Finally, there’s self-esteem: having teeth can boost one’s confidence in social interactions.”

article continues below

2. How can we look after them?

Plaque and tartar can build up on false teeth so daily cleaning is recommended, either with chemical products or mechanical methods. You can also visit your Denturist for deep cleaning and polishing of your dentures. “It is important to care for and maintain a clean denture because in time the build-up can pose a risk of development of fungal infections,” says Gifford.

3. What if they don’t feel stable?

As well as daily cleaning, dentures need thorough maintenance every two or three years. “People don’t realize that basic services can reinforce the stability and retention of the denture,” says Gifford. “The ridges in our mouths are constantly changing and resorbing (deteriorating) over time, so dentures may no longer fit or feel stable. Relining (reshaping the underside of a denture) is one way to deal with this. There are other options for a better fitting, more stable denture, such as dentures over implants, and your Denturist can provide options and solutions for this.”

4. How can implants and dentures be combined?

Implants can be surgically placed in the ridge and dentures can be snapped onto them with an attachment. “This technology can improve the patient’s eating experience, as well as increasing retention and stability and preventing bone loss,” says Gifford.

5. Why see a Denturist?

“Making dentures can be challenging – there are many elements that must be understood,” Gifford says. She believes it takes patience and experience to do a great job, so it may be in patients’ best interests to seek a Denturist. “A Denturist is a professional who sees patients that need any kind of dentures, relines or repairs,” she says. “He or she will not only take the impressions, but make the entire denture in his or her own laboratory.” Gifford, a Denturist with 18 years’ experience, sees patients in her Seventh Street clinic and also visits elderly people living in care homes.

It can include future goals, personal values, family priorities, and much more – but making plans around wealth can seem a daunting task to tackle without help.

That’s where Harjit Sandhu with IG Wealth Management comes in. As an adviser, Sandhu can help clients look at the big picture – where they’ve come from, where they are today and where they want to go – and create a personalized path with advice and guidance.

article continues below

“That’s my role here, is to really help people navigate through the planning while looking at all the pieces of the puzzle,” he said. “That doesn’t mean just looking at investments but considering a variety of areas: tax planning, tax advice, insurance advice, estate planning, budgeting, cash flow management, debt management. It’s a full spectrum of services.”

IG Wealth Management, previously known as Investors Group, specializes in providing services that fit a diverse and highly personalized set of needs, because there’s really no such thing as one-size-fits-all when it comes to financial planning.

“We see a lot of different people, a lot of different situations and goals,” said Sandhu. “Being able to respond to that, find good solutions, and help people feel confident about their decisions is really a primary goal.”

Sandhu says that many people can feel uncertain, nervous, or even frightened when it comes to money conversations or planning for the future, but there’s no need to be wary. It’s not uncommon for people to have little to no formal education or understanding of how investing, retirement planning, debt management, or tax planning works.

“That’s why people come to us,” he said. “We have the knowledge and information to help guide them. People don’t need to feel nervous about that, we’re not here to judge but to help.” Sandhu’s experience and commitment to his clients has helped him build a strong reputation in the industry. Many people reach out to him because of word-of-mouth referrals.

“When a client has no hesitation recommending you to friends and family, that feels great,” he said. “That’s excellence to me, when you’ve done your job to the degree that people want to tell others about your work.”

His client base has continued to grow year over year. In fact, he’s preparing to move his team to a larger office space in the Metrotown area in 2020, which will allow him to continue serving clients not just in Burnaby but throughout the region.

“I love the work that I do, and being part of IG Wealth Management allows me to help so many people. That’s a wonderful feeling,” he said.

IG Wealth Management first opened in 1926, and has 100 offices nationally with headquarters in Winnipeg. It is part of the Power Financial Group of companies, which includes Great West Life Co., Canada Life, Freedom 55, Mackenzie Financial and Putnam Investments.

Sandhu notes that IG Wealth Management has a strong commitment to the communities it serves, including being donors or supporters for local-level organizations, such as South Burnaby Neighbourhood House and the Burnaby Rotary Club. Sandhu’s work in financial planning has been recognized over the years within IG Wealth Management with a variety of awards.

""To the light-heavyweight title — veni, vidi, vici,"" tweeted Jones, using the Latin phrase of ""I came, I saw, I conquered,"" attributed to Julius Caesar.

article continues below

Asked if was giving up his title, he tweeted ""Yes.""

When a follower suggested he was hurting himself more than the UFC, Jones replied: ""I hurt myself every time I walk out there and take a punch to the head and not feel my pay is worth it anymore.""

The 32-year-old Jones, who sits at No. 1 in the UFC's pound-for-pound fighter ratings, has used social media in recent days to wage a war of words with the UFC over his pay.

He had been eyeing a super-fight with hard-punching Francis Ngannou, currently ranked second among heavyweight contenders, but said the UFC did not want to pay him enough.

Asked about Jones' social media complaints, UFC president Dana White said the fighter wanted ""crazy"" money, citing demands of US$15 million, $20 million and $30 million.

""He can do whatever he wants to do. He can sit out, he can fight, he can whatever,"" White told reporters after Saturday's Fight Night card in Las Vegas.

""Jon Jones can say whatever he wants publicly. It's his God-given right here in America,"" he added. ""He can say whatever he wants. And when he's ready to come back and fight, he can.""

White said his lawyer, Hunter Campbell, offered to walk Jones through the numbers but to no avail.

That drew a sarcastic Twitter response from Jones.

""I love how you're trying to paint this picture of me being some angry guy disrespectfully demanding money. And then bringing up my out of the cage affairs to justify underpaying me by tens of millions for years.""

""At no point did I ever demand anything from you Dana, I simply asked for a super fight and asked to be compensated for it,"" he said in another tweet.

While seen as perhaps the greatest MMA fighter ever, Jones has been in the news for the wrong reasons more often than not since he was involved in a hit-and-run accident with a pregnant woman and stripped of his title in 2015.

Jones has defended the 205-pound title 11 times and been stripped of the championship belt twice, once for violating the UFC's athlete code of conduct (in 2015) and once for failing a drug test (in 2017). He also lost the interim title in 2016 after a positive drug test.

Jones holds a 26-1-0 record with one-no contest.

The loss came via disqualification in 2009 for an illegal elbow against Matt (The Hammer) Hamill, who was being savaged prior to the stoppage. A 2017 win over Daniel Cormier was turned into a no contest after Jones testing positive for steroids.

White said Jones could have been ""the LeBron"" of MMA, had it not been for his antics outside the cage.

The UFC did not immediately respond to a request for comment Sunday.

This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 31, 2020.

Since June 2017, the rent bank has been providing low-cost loans to residents who are at risk of eviction and/or at risk of having their utilities disconnected.

“During the first three months of the pandemic (i.e. March 1 to May 31, 2020), the program issued 22 loans for a total of $27,462,” said a staff report to council. “If this pace of demand continues for the next nine months, this would result in 88 loans for a total of $109,848. This would be a dramatic increase when compared to the fiscal year (April 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020) in which the program issued 37 loans for a total of $40,775.”

The rent bank provides loans of up to $1,400 for individuals and up to $1,700 for families. The Lower Mainland Purpose Society operates the rent bank in New West.

On July 13, city council approved a staff recommendation to continue to fund the administrative costs of the New Westminster Rent Bank program. The city will contribute $35,000 annually for a three-year period from Sept. 1 to Aug. 31, 2023.

According to the report, the province has provided $48,400, with another $42,820 having been requested for the program. The city previously provided onetime funding of $100,000 to the rent bank in March to expand administrative and loan capacity in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“The program has a demonstrated need,” said the report. “It has been highly effective in preventing evictions and essential utility disconnections; it is one of the city’s tools in preventing homelessness; it has facilitated partnerships, including with the financial sector; and it has leveraged provincial funding,” said the report. “Regarding the latter, this was an objective of the program from its initiation.”

In 2015, New Westminster MLA Judy Darcy and her constituency office staff began working on the concept of creating a rent bank in New West by meeting with stakeholders and seeking financial contributions toward an endowment fund. After securing $35,000 in donations from a number of financial organizations, Darcy and her team received a commitment from city council in 2016 to support the program and to contribute $20,000 annually for three years (increased to $35,000 in December 2018) to cover administrative costs associated with operating a rent bank.

""If you prevent homelessness, you prevent that downward spiral that is really, really hard for people to get out of,"" Darcy told council when seeking the city’s support for the rent bank. ""There are a lot of people who are one paycheque away from being homeless.""",[]

Police set up a roadblock in the 900 block of McBride Blvd. early Sunday morning. At around 1:50 a.m., as police were checking drivers for sobriety, a car in the line attempted a U-turn across the center median, said police.

“The driver mounted the car on the center median and attempted to drive away,” said a news release. “As officers ran to the vehicle, the driver attempted to dislodge the stuck vehicle from the median by hard acceleration to evade arrest.”

The driver was unsuccessful at fleeing in the vehicle before officers arrived and arrested the driver. Once in custody, the officers located a gun (pictured) on the back seat with ammunition.

“Policing is an unpredictable line of work, where the situation can rapidly change from a routine impaired driving CounterAttack to a possible dangerous and unpredictable encounter,” said Sgt. Jeff Scott. “Having public safety at the forefront of their minds, officers put themselves in harm’s way to help prevent a potentially more dangerous situation from occurring.”

The driver was arrested, and charges are being recommended to Crown counsel for dangerous driving, prohibited driving, breach of undertaking, breach of recognizance, and several possible firearms-related offences.",[]

Robert Billard, a lifelong musician, did just that by creating Fifth Chord Studios in uptown New Westminster.

The old clinic sat empty for many years. It’s positioned under a medical building and resides mainly under the landscaping and walkway in the 600 block of Fifth Avenue.

Billard said he realized the opportunity the space provided and undertook extensive renovations to turn the space into a sound-controlled rehearsal and recording studio.

“This isn’t just any music space,” said Billard. “We’ve worked to develop a space that is accessible, comfortable, and professional. While in the process of setting it up, we talked about who we want this space to support, and made a special commitment to supporting Black, Indigenous and artists of colour.”

Fifth Chord Studios features five locked-off monthly-rent rehearsal spaces, a live recording space, control studio, and gathering area to relax and meet the other musicians post-pandemic.

A special feature of the space is that it is accessible for people in wheelchairs and with mobility limitations, including an accessible washroom and thoughtful considerations such as offering light dimmers and low-noise air flow for neuro-diverse musicians.

The walls currently feature visual art by local artists, including PJ Patten, Sherida Charles, and Iris Mes Low.

“We are working with Black and Indigenous musicians to determine what kinds of programs would support their work best and how we can support their art,” said Billard.

Following COVID-19 protocols, Fifth Chord Studios is available for viewing by appointment only. Musicians interested in renting space can contact Robert Billard directly at 778 789-0621. You can visit the website here.",[]

The notion of establishing a framework to commercialize cannabis began as a promise by the Liberal Party in the 2015 federal election campaign that led to Justin Trudeau becoming prime minister. The implementation of the policy was not as smooth as first envisioned, and the provincial governments were put in charge of setting guidelines for the sale and consumption of marijuana.

article continues below

Research Co. and Glacier Media have been tracking perceptions about legalization every six months in British Columbia. Our latest survey shows that agreement with the new rules remains high across the entire province, that some residents are starting to ponder a future when other drugs could be treated in the same fashion as cannabis, and that – in stark contrast with what we found last year – marijuana users in British Columbia are starting to acquire all of their product through licensed retailers.

As more time passes, British Columbians appear happier with the decision to end prohibition. Seven in 10 of the province’s residents (70%) agree with marijuana being legal in Canada, while 26% disagree and 3% are undecided.

These findings represent a seven-point increase since a similar survey conducted in October 2019, as legal cannabis approached its first anniversary. The groups that are more likely to voice satisfaction with the new status quo are men (75%), British Columbians aged 35 to 54 (76%) and residents of northern B.C. (80%).

In recent weeks, we have seen more talk about creating a safe supply for drugs that are currently available only through illegal means. The impact of these discussions has led to a shift in the views of British Columbians about legalizing all drugs. It must be completely acknowledged that sizable majorities of the province’s residents continue to oppose a move to place any controlled substance inside a store, but the proponents of this option have grown since late last year.

At least two-thirds of British Columbians are opposed to legalizing ecstasy (66%), powder cocaine (70%), heroin (72%), crack cocaine (73%), methamphetamine or “crystal meth” (74%) and fentanyl (75%).

Support for making some of these drugs available in a fashion that would conceivably meet the same guidelines that govern cannabis has risen over the past six months, to 25% for cocaine (up from 18%) and to 24% for heroin (up from 19%). While these are still low proportions, the fluctuation could signal the start of a trend.

Just 10% of British Columbians say they only consumed marijuana after it became legal. Identical proportions of residents tried it before October 2018 (45%) or have never consumed it in Canada (also 45%). The incidence of “legal-only” marijuana users is highest among residents aged 18 to 34 (18%) and those who live in southern B.C. (19%).

But perhaps the biggest surprise, and a source of satisfaction for policy makers, is the way in which cannabis is being sought by users. Just over half of British Columbians who have consumed marijuana since legalization (51%) say that all of their product was acquired at a licensed retailer. In October 2019, only 31% of cannabis consumers in the province were getting all of their product at a licensed retailer.

We still see 16% of British Columbians who say none of their marijuana has been bought at a licensed retailer – a proportion that climbs to 25% among those aged 55 and over. Two-thirds of cannabis consumers aged 35 to 54 (68%) are buying all of their product at a licensed retailer.

Even though the delivery of cannabis products has improved over the past six months, there are significant regional differences that are indubitably related to the presence of stores in specific areas of the province. Cannabis consumers who reside in southern B.C. and Metro Vancouver are the most likely to be getting all of their product from licensed retailers (63% and 62%). The numbers are significantly lower in Vancouver Island (29%), northern B.C. (24%) and the Fraser Valley (19%).

Finally, the issue of “drug testing” remains a priority for British Columbians, with 61% saying that companies in the province should “definitely” or “probably” be able to administer these examinations to any employee now that marijuana is legal.

After a bumpy start that featured slow store openings and hitches with delivery options, there are signs that cannabis legalization is starting to work in a better fashion. More consumers are getting all of their product through licensed retailers, and the number of “new users” has not increased dramatically. Still, the significant regional disparities suggest that more marijuana outlets will need to be authorized in order to effectively eliminate the black market.

Results are based on an online study conducted from July 10 to July 12, 2020, among 800 adult British Columbians.

“Advance fee loans, the second riskiest scam in Canada for 2019, continues to wreak havoc for B.C. residents in a financial bind because of the pandemic,” according to the BBB, which is warning consumers, who may be urgently trying to acquire funds, to be on “high alert” to avoid losing money and exposing their personal information.

article continues below

The BBB says that the reports its received from victims across the province show consumers are extremely susceptible to the scam.

As part of the scam, the BBB says consumers may receive an email or phone call, or – as in the case of more recent reports to the bureau’s Scam Tracker – a pop-up ad online or find a website while searching for a loan company.

In this con, scammers disguised as loan brokers and other lending institutions advertise and promise loans to those in a financial bind. The loan, which is guaranteed regardless of credit history, comes with upfront charges labelled as “taxes,” “insurance” or “processing fees.”

However, when the charges are paid, the loan never materializes and the applicant is left with larger debts. The BBB says that requiring advance fees for loans is illegal in Canada

“Typically, the scammers will ask you to pay a fee for a seemingly legitimate reason,” said Karla Laird, the BBB’s manager for community and public relations.

“Oftentimes, they require that payment to be made by wire transfer, bitcoin or some other hard-to-recover method. However, once the fee is paid, the phony loan company stops communication and the consumer cannot get a refund.”

Vancouver man loses nearly $1,500

In one instance of the scam, which was reported to the BBB, a Vancouver resident lost nearly $1,500 to a company he found online with an Ontario address on its website.

The company told the Vancouver man his loan was approved for $10,000 at the rate of seven per cent for four years, however, the company needed a three-month advance payment in order to release the funds – a total of $718.

The company also told the man that his credit is high risk, so he would need to pay $1,500 insurance for the lender, although the company would cover half. The company wanted the Vancouver man to send the money using Bitcoin.

The company, Kingsway Lending, according to the BBB, is using the address of a Canada Revenue Agency office in Ontario.

“Scammers understand that consumers are searching for websites that look professional, and will put effort into making your loan application process feel like the real deal,” said Laird.

“With this in mind, thorough research on a company before initiating any transactions, is the best way to avoid being tricked out of your money and personal information.”

The BBB says consumers should look out for the following red flags is they are searching for a lender or loan broker:

The health authority added the outbreak of C. difficile to its list of current outbreaks on July 14.

According to Health Canada, Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is a bacterium that causes mild to severe diarrhea and intestinal conditions like pseudomembranous colitis (inflammation of the colon). C. difficile is the most frequent cause of infectious diarrhea in hospitals and long-term care facilities in Canada, as well as in other industrialized countries.

C. difficile bacteria and their spores are found in feces. People can get infected if they touch surfaces contaminated with feces, and then touch their mouth. Healthcare workers can spread the bacteria to their patients if their hands are contaminated.

Symptoms include watery diarrhea, fever, loss of appetite, nausea, and abdominal pain/tenderness.

For healthy people, C. difficile does not pose a health risk. The elderly and those with other illnesses or who are taking antibiotics, are at a greater risk of infection.

Fraser Health asks all visitors to use our hand hygiene stations when they enter and exit its facilities, particularly if there is a reported outbreak.

If you have any of the following, please do not visit at this time:

Vomiting or diarrhea

Cough or flu-like symptoms

Fever

Rash

If you are visiting someone who is located on an outbreak unit, visitors may be limited to two people at a time. Fraser Health asks that you do not visit other patient rooms or common areas on the unit such as the lounge and patient kitchenette. It also recommends you don’t visit public areas in the hospital such as the cafeteria and gift shop.",[]

Hate-fuelled graffiti on the home of a Summerland family. Systemic racism and sexism, both overt and covert, at all levels of society.

Prejudice is indeed pandemic. Bigotry is a virus. And we all have the potential to be hosts (even those of us from racialized minorities).

We’re not born with it in our blood. It’s transmitted from person to person. From family to family. It’s learned through conversations, comments, jokes, judgements, looks, books, micro-aggressions, political rhetoric, insults, attitudes, ignorance, and even classroom lesson plans.

It infects entire institutions to the point where everyone within the organization becomes immune to biased hiring practices, offensive language, token diversity, racial and religious profiling, and exclusive, patriarchal power structures.

And like COVID-19, it won’t just go away on its own. We have to track it and attack it. We have to trace it, isolate it, and call it out. By name. Persistently. We have to propose anti-racist policies, pass anti-racist laws, and push for anti-racist consequences.

We have to stop passively and proudly saying we’re not racist. And we have to start actively and loudly being anti-racist. We have to listen to those with lived experience.

We have to hold elected officials (and each other) accountable. We have to. And we can.

The world has changed dramatically over the last two months, since George Floyd took his last breath on May 25, 2020. In many ways, the globe has gotten smaller, as evidenced by the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus (with about 13.5 million cases worldwide and over 580,000 deaths and rising), and the massive outpouring of protesters on city streets from Vancouver to Sydney screaming that Black Lives Matter.

No matter what language we speak or what corner of the Earth we inhabit, “social distancing” has become a part of our everyday vocabulary and behaviour.

Yet science has proven that all human beings – regardless of colour, class, culture, gender, or sexual orientation – are inextricably linked like never before.

As the motto goes, we’re all in this together. Overnight, we’ve all become armchair epidemiologists. Following the lead of our Provincial Health Officer, Dr. Bonnie Henry, British Columbians have sacrificed and worked hard to flatten the curve of COVID-19.

Complacency is not an option. We can’t afford to go backwards. And we must be equally vigilant and aggressive to finally squash the scourge of white supremacy, police brutality, systemic racism, and hatred in all its insidious forms.

Silence is no longer acceptable. We’re in a pandemic. And lives are at stake.

The city has received rezoning and development permit applications related to a proposed five-storey residential building being proposed at 909 to 915 12th St. The project would include nine ground-oriented units.

In a four to three vote, council directed staff to process a rezoning and development permit application for 909 to 915 12 St., as well as an official community plan amendment application for part of the rear lane adjacent to the site. Mayor Jonathan Cote, along with councillors Patrick Johnstone, Nadine Nakagawa and Mary Trentadue, supported the staff recommendation, while councillors Chinu Das, Jaimie McEvoy and Chuck Puchmayr were opposed.

In order to build this project, the applicant would buy a 96.6-square-metre (1,040-squrae-foot) city-owned lane at the rear of the property.

According to a staff report, the site’s current zoning allows for the development of a four-storey commercial or mixed-used building. While the site would need to be rezoned in order for the project to proceed, the report stated the five-storey residential building being proposed is consistent with the official community plan’s designation for the site, except for the city-owned lane.

Das noted three small businesses will be lost as a result of this proposal. She said upper 12th Street has been a vibrant area, but that could change if it becomes entirely residential and loses its retail.

“There will be no reason for people to step out into the street. Who would want to walk down 12th Street? Where is the activity? Where is the vibrancy?” she said. “Although I have nothing against this proposal per se – it is in its preliminary stage – my worry is that there is going to be more and more and more.”

Das questioned how many other development proposals are in the works on upper 12th Street that would see ground-level commercial replaced by residential.

“I don’t have the exact number of projects at my fingertips,” Jackie Teed, the city’s senior manager of development services, told council July 13. “However, I am aware of two that we are currently evaluating, potentially three. There’s one that is a little bit behind the rest.”

Puchmayr said the updated official community plan (OCP) didn’t provide protection of all of the commercial spaces on upper 12th Street. He said the area where this project is proposed is relatively flat, so it makes sense to have commercial at that location.

“I am very concerned about 12th Street. It is an incubator for a lot of new immigrants and small businesses. It has some affordable rents,” he said. “As soon as the OCP passed, there was a rash of purchases of these commercial businesses, which showed that people were literally buying them up to develop multi-family or residential properties at the expense of commercial.”

Puchmayr said he’d like council to send the application back to staff and have them tell the proponent that the city won’t sell the lane unless the development includes commercial space.

Mayor Jonathan Cote said a retail strategy that’s getting underway will consider issues related to 12th Street. During the official community plan process, he said some people expressed concern that the 12th Street business district was “too long to be a thriving business district” and would benefit by having a more compact commercial area.

“Whether that was the right decision or not, that’s what came out of the OCP process. Certainly I would be more than open in reengaging in this conversation,” he said. “We are embarking on a retail strategy, which I support, which very well may revisit that strategy.”

Based on council’s past instructions to staff, Cote said some development applications on 12th Street will still be coming to council for its consideration.

In June 2019, council and staff discussed the impact that new development is having on existing businesses on 12th Street. Council directed staff to report back on the impact of temporarily suspending all 12th Street development permits.

Council subsequently considered a staff recommendation to support continued application review of the four in-stream development applications on upper 12th Street, but to temporarily suspend any new rezoning applications for mixed-used sites until staff completes the retail strategy and the upper 12th Street land-use strategy. Instead of staff’s recommendation, council voted three to two in favour of considering new development applications on 12th Street on a case-by-case basis.

Base d on that decision, Cote said it would be “problematic” to now notify an applicant that council won’t consider its application.

“I think we need to be more consistent there,” he said. “The message we gave is, we would at least consider the application. Ultimately, this has to go through a full public process and is not necessarily going to be supported by council. But to me, I think the decision we made is that we would see these processes through, so I will be consistent with that.”",[]
632,newwestrecord,https://newwestrecord.ca/airborne-transmission-of-covid-19-hasn-t-played-a-major-role-in-b-c-outbreaks-1.24171053,Airborne transmission of COVID-19 hasn’t ‘played a major role’ in B.C. outbreaks,['Stefan Labbé'],,"A leading medical health officer says the airborne transmission of COVID-19 doesn’t appear to be a major factor in the spread of the virus in outbreaks across B.C.

Dr. Michael Schwandt, who was one of the first infectious disease specialists from Vancouver Coastal Health to help contain outbreaks at sites like the Lynn Valley Care Centre, made the comments not long after a group of 239 scientists from 32 countries wrote an open letter to the World Health Organization, successfully appealing for the world health body to change its guidance on aerosolized transmission.

article continues below

“We'll be watching closely the science around airborne transmission. At this time, we don't think it's played a major role in the outbreaks in Vancouver Coastal Health that we've had direct experience with,” said Dr. Schwandt.

The new W.H.O. guidance, which came last Thursday, accepts that the novel coronavirus can spread through aerosolized particles — tiny droplets in the air — in crowded indoor settings for prolonged periods of time.

“There have been reported outbreaks of COVID-19 in some closed settings, such as restaurants, nightclubs, places of worship or places of work where people may be shouting, talking, or singing.

“In these outbreaks, aerosol transmission, particularly in these indoor locations where there are crowded and inadequately ventilated spaces where infected persons spend long periods of time with others, cannot be ruled out,” reads the W.H.O.’s new guidance, which also calls for more research into aerosol transmission. aerosol transmission.

But Dr. Schwandt said his team doesn’t view the airborne versus droplet transmission debate as a binary, and that while the virus can be traced at varying distances at concentrations, most of the cases he’s come across in Vancouver Coastal Health region, home to the first outbreaks in the country, have been from “face-to-face” transmission.

The proof, he said, comes from Vancouver Coastal’s success in tracing contacts based on direct contact, an experience a spokesperson for Fraser Health told the Tri-City News has been echoed in their health authority.

“Without taking airborne transmission into account as a risk factor, we've been able to bring outbreaks under good control, really looking at close physical contact as the main risk factor,” said Dr. Schwandt.

That means, at the moment, current ventilation systems in places like long-term care homes are not considered a risk factor in the spread of the virus.

Airborne or not, sharing air in large, indoor public gatherings raises everyone’s risk of transmitting the virus, as Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry reminded British Columbians in her daily update Tuesday.

“Stay away from closed spaces as much as possible,” she said. “If it’s a house party, you may not know all the people who are there.”

And like the W.H.O., health officials in B.C. said they are keeping an eye on the science.

“If more evidence were to develop around airborne or aerosol transmission, then naturally we'd need to look at preventative measures that include attention to ventilation,” said Dr. Schwandt.",[]

Provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix announced July 15 that there were 21 new cases in the past 24 hours, including two cases that they call ""epi-linked,"" or presumed cases that have not been proven through testing but are being treated as official cases.

The province has now recorded 3,149 cases since the novel coronavirus first appeared in B.C. in late January.

More than 87.4% of those infected, or 2,753 people, have recovered. Of those who haven't, 189 people have died and 207 people are actively fighting the virus. Only 14 people are hospitalized, with five of those in intensive care units. The rest are self-isolating at home. There were no new deaths recorded in the past 24 hours.

Recording at least 20 new COVID-19 cases in a 24-hour period has become common in B.C., and Henry said yesterday that she found that number ""distressing,"" even though, she added, the good news is that the province knows where the clusters of infection are, many of the infections are linked and the number is not really that large given the province's population of more than five million residents.

The numbers in the past week were:

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12;

• 21 new cases on July 13;

• 13 new cases on July 14; and now

• 21 new cases on July 15.

In June, the number of daily new cases many times was in the single digits.

""There is one active community outbreak, in addition to several community exposure events,"" Henry and Dix said. ""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks.""

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,023 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,659 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 216 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 51 people who reside outside Canada.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons is expected to take Sidoo into custody on September 23 and release him from a Pacific Northwest area facility just before Christmas.

article continues below

Sidoo, 61, appeared online via Zoom in front of United States District Judge Nathaniel Gorton of the United States District Court for District of Massachusetts, as well as his lawyers and prosecutors. He wore a plaid suit while sitting in an office space inside his $31.7 million home in Vancouver’s Point Grey neighbourhood.

Sidoo, now a convicted felon, initially pled innocent to fraud and money laundering charges; he teared up before being sentenced and read a prepared statement:

“The last several months have been the hardest in my entire life and today I accept the court’s decision without reservation. No words can express how sorry I am for my decisions and actions that led to this day. I make no excuses, your honour. I broke the law and pled guilty and I now must pay for my actions.

“To my wife and boys, all I ever wanted was your love and respect and to be a good role model. And I know I have made a terrible mistake that has deeply affected our family. To my friends and colleagues and former teammates over the years, I am deeply ashamed today. To the young men and women who looked up to me as a role model, you deserve better. To the court and all of you, I wish to apologize for my actions.

“I will serve my sentence and am committed to returning to the community and doing everything possible to make a positive impact. I hope in time people will not judge me for the worst mistake in my life but for the work in the days, weeks and years ahead in which I am committed to being a better man.”

Gorton told Sidoo he was “impressed” by the businessman’s “obvious remorse.”

But Gorton pointed out two omissions in Sidoo’s statement.

“You expect to put this behind you and go forward and make up for what you called mistakes. I would call it a crime, not a mistake, but nevertheless, it is important that you acknowledge it and realize how many constituencies you have disappointed,” said the judge.

Sidoo also did not explicitly acknowledge that his crimes resulted in two students missing an opportunity to attend the universities his sons, Dylan Sidoo and Jordan Sidoo, were admitted to.

“What you accomplished, along with getting them into college, is to deprive two other deserving students of admittance into those universities — an act that is the very antithesis of one you want to be known for,” said Gorton.

Likewise, United States Attorney Andrew Lelling submitted to Gorton: “Sidoo engaged in serious criminal conduct involving fraud and deception that stretched over multiple years.

“His crimes warrant significant punishment. By engaging in the scheme, with [scheme mastermind Rick Singer] and others, Sidoo was able to steal two college admissions slots for his sons, including one from the University of California at Berkeley, one of the top public universities in the nation.”

Sidoo, said Gorton, “committed a crime that displayed an unbelievable lack of integrity, morality and common sense.

“You have let your selfish desire, your pride and your enormous wealth overcome all of what you apparently want to stand for with your works of charity,” Gorton told Sidoo.

Sidoo’s philanthropy, derived from his earnings in the capital markets, was central to his sentencing defense. According to Sidoo he has donated several million dollars to charitable causes, such as the University of B.C. football program.

In pleading guilty to fraud, Sidoo avoided a maximum prison term of 20 years and prosecutors subsequently agreed to 90 days behind bars, plus a $250,000 fine and one-year of supervised release, which will not be enforced in Canada by the U.S. Probation Department. Prosecutors also agreed to drop the money laundering charge.

The prison Sidoo goes to is expected to have harsher conditions since his options are limited due to his foreign citizenship. His attorney Martin Weinberg said he is expected to spend 14 days in isolation in a “maximum security setting,” due to COVID-19.

Sidoo will get four days credit for time already served. If he serves the full 90 days he will be released December 17 but will have to spend 14 days in isolation at home should B.C. public health rules for international travellers and COVID-19 continue into the fall.

Gorton said Sidoo’s crime would normally warrant more time in jail but there are mitigating circumstances, such as his remorse, lack of criminal record, philanthropy and “collateral consequences,” such as not being able to enter the U.S. as a felon and being stripped last month of his Order of B.C. medal for community service. Sidoo’s attorneys also previously noted he did not directly pay the universities but that his fraud was limited to cheating on the tests.

The former B.C. Lions football player worked as a stock broker in the 1990s and an investment banker between 2000 and 2010. Since 2010 he has made millions of dollars directing a handful of public companies that have failed to generate wealth for retail investors.

Sidoo was arrested March 8, 2019, in San Jose, California, on charges by the U.S. Department of Justice of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering related to the high-profile U.S. college admissions and bribery scandal, brought to light by a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe dubbed Operation Varsity Blues.

One of dozens of parents to be charged, Sidoo initially pled innocent to paying $200,000 total to scheme mastermind William ‘Rick’ Singer, who hired corrupt exam expert Mark Riddell to take Dylan and Jordan’s SAT exams, in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Sidoo also helped falsify one of his son Jordan’s university applications in October 2013 with an essay that originally included a fake claim of Jordan being held up at gunpoint by gangsters, while he was purported to be an intern for an anti-gang organization.

Co-conspirators Singer and Riddell pled guilty last year in exchange for cooperating with the government’s investigation.

The guilty parties in the case, who used Singer’s criminal services, were generally well-off individuals. Celebrities such as actress Lori Loughlin and her clothing designer husband Mossimo Gianulli and actress Felicity Huffman also pled guilty for related crimes and brought much media attention to the investigation.

Sidoo’s sons had no involvement in their father’s crime.

Jordan is now a 2018 history graduate from University of California Berkeley. Dylan graduated in cinematic arts in 2016 from the University of Southern California (USC). The two previously attended Vancouver’s prestigious St. George’s School.

Neither university has announced whether or not their degrees will remain valid. Dylan, according to the sentencing documents, had scored a 1,460/2,400 SAT score until Riddell, using a fake ID in December 2011, bumped up the score to 1,700, which was high enough for Dylan to enter Chapman University (and later transfer to USC). Riddell then scored 2,280/2,400 for Jordan in December 2012, paving the way to Berkley.

Riddell also took a high school test for Dylan. The B.C. Ministry of Education has issued no statement on how its testing process was so vulnerable to fraud.

Both sons have since entered into penny stock promotion with their father.

In one cluster, at least 17 cases have been traced to a group of people who met up in Kelowna, some from the Interior and Alberta, others from the Lower Mainland.

“There are a number of people who have been exposed in those events,” said Henry Tuesday.

More troubling still is the emergence of new cases at the Krazy Cherry Fruit Company in Oliver, where two have been identified among migrant workers. They were among 62 cases identified in B.C. between Friday and Monday.

“Public health teams are monitoring the situation closely and have placed restrictions on those living and working on the farm to limit the potential for further transmission,” said Dr. Henry in a written statement today.

But others have expressed concerns that not enough is being done to prevent outbreaks among vulnerable groups. Where newly arrived immigrants were disproportionately affected at earlier outbreaks at poultry plants in Coquitlam, others say migrant agricultural workers still run higher risks due to inadequate housing.

“As anticipated,” said Byron Cruz of Sanctuary Health, an organization that works to protect migrant workers from predatory practices. “We knew that something was going to happen because the situation for housing in that farm is terrible. They were all crowded.”

‘WAY ABOVE MY COMFORT ZONE’

Yesterday, Dr. Henry warned 25 cases a day was “distressing” and “cautionary to us.” And while not unexpected due to the increased travel and social interaction of phase 3, she said “That’s way above my comfort zone.”

Dr. Henry urged anyone who attended Canada Day parties in the vicinity of the Kelowna cluster to self-monitor for even the mildest of symptoms, noting that anyone can be tested should they feel they’ve been exposed.

Just how quickly a province or state can backslide has been painted in stark relief among our neighbours to the south.

In comments to the press Tuesday, Health Minister Adrian Dix pointed to surges in several U.S. states where record breaking daily caseloads in several states have led jurisdictions like California to re-introduce physical distancing protocols, in what Dix described as “lockdown 2.0.”

“All our neighbouring jurisdictions continue to see an increase, whether it’s our neighbouring province to the east, Alberta, or others, Washington, Oregon and California, in Nevada, Arizona and in other American states — we’ve seen record days of new cases of COVID-19 recently,” said Dix.

Here in B.C., Henry said that on Monday, she checked how weekly caseloads are tracking with the province’s modelling that suggests British Columbians keep their social contacts to 65% of normal.

“We are still skirting that line. The RT, the reproductive number, is hovering around one… which is sort of pushing the limits of where we need to be,” she said.

While health officials work to contain the outbreak in Oliver, it’s unclear how a potential surge in cases will affect that calculation, and Byron Cruz of Sanctuary Health said he expects more cases to crop up in coming days due to their tight living quarters.

What is clear is the more cases are contained to a single cluster, the easier they are to track.

“This is going to be our dance over the next few months, where we do what we can do, we travel, we have those social interactions, but we do it in a thoughtful way so we do it with the people we know we’re with,” said Dr. Henry.",[]

The man and woman, who have asked not to be identified, were taken in by what appeared to be a call from their grandson in dire need of help.

article continues below

“The guy sounded so much like our grandson. If he had said ‘Grandma,’ we’d have known [it wasn’t him] right away, but he said ‘Nan’ and so does my grandson,” said the man.

The imposter grandson, who used their grandson’s name, called on Monday and told them he had been driving a friend’s car and struck a vehicle with Quebec licence plates that had turned sharply in front of him.

The fake grandson went on to say he had been taken to jail, but a judge would free him if he could pay for the damage, estimated to be $5,000. The grandparents were told to send money to the car’s owner in Montreal.

“I wasn’t cluing in at all [that this was a scam], he sounded so much like our grandson,” the man said.

The dutiful grandparents then took cash from their bank and went to the Bank of Montreal and using an account number the scammer had provided via an accomplice posing as a lawyer, they sent money to a BMO branch in downtown Montreal.

“The kid said, ‘Please don’t tell Dad,’ ” the man said. It wasn’t until he later talked to his grandson that it became clear they had been scammed.

The couple has since been in touch with police and the Bank of Montreal, which they say has been very helpful.

“They are doing their best to try and get the money back,” said the man, who thinks the scammers “took a shot in the dark and got lucky.”

But according to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre, it’s likely the scammers mined information like the grandson’s name from social media to make the pitch more convincing.

The centre calls these types of scams “the emergency scam.” It preys on the fear of a loved one being hurt or in trouble. The scammer claims to be someone you know and says they need money immediately. They tend to use scenarios like needing bail money because they’ve been arrested, or being in a car accident, or having trouble returning from a foreign country.

The targets are often seniors and the scammer pretends to be a grandchild, who begs them not to tell their parents that they’re in trouble, the Anti-Fraud Centre said. As a result, the grandparent doesn’t find out until after they’ve sent the money that their grandchild was not the person who asked for help.

Const. Cam MacIntyre said scammers will go to any lengths to defraud a victim.

“They will pose as a family member, a trusted member of the public, or even the police. We strongly recommend that people never deposit money into accounts of people or entities they do know personally,” he said.

“It’s so important to verify where your money is going. Call a family member, a friend, or the police if you are suspicious.”

The Anti-Fraud Centre says there were 18,803 reports of fraud, and 6,671 victims reporting losses of $22.6 million in Canada in the first four months of this year.

MacIntyre suggests if you are in the process of providing financial information or sending money to potential fraudsters, stop immediately.

“Contact your financial institutions and ensure all payments that you have not authorized are stopped. Inform them of the fraud and change both passwords and access information,” he said.

Suspected frauds can be reported to your local police or the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre at 1-888-495-8501.

The Canadian director of the hospitality union, Unite Here, says the challenges facing their workers are unprecedented.

Ian Robb says over 90 per cent of hospitality employees in the country's hotels, airports, stadiums, universities and schools haven't worked since March.

He says too few employers are using the federal wage subsidy program to keep workers tied to their jobs and all levels of government need to work creatively to avoid long-term unemployment in the sector.

The union wants governments and employers to ensure their jobs are protected, that there is a safe way back to work and that there is income support for the duration of the crisis.

Robb says analysts predict the industry may not fully recover until the summer of 2022, leading to uncertainty for tens of thousands of workers and their families.

The Mounties say in a release that four people were taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, including a Calgary man who was driving the westbound semi.

Police say there were heavy brake marks at the scene, and they believe the semi crossed into the oncoming lane after the driver failed to safely make a turn on the highway.

The truck flipped onto its side and skidded down the highway before striking the five other vehicles travelling eastbound.

Police say the driver has been charged with crossing a double line under the B.C. Motor Vehicle Act.

The Mounties say speed may have been a factor in the crash but there's no evidence to suggest impaired driving was involved.

Only 16 per cent of businesses were confident in B.C.'s restart plan and 47 per cent were not.

Two-thirds of those surveyed were relying on some form of government support and owners were braced for a ""second wave"" of shutdowns or other problems if programs expire too quickly.

Some 28 per cent believed they'll return to normal once programs end, 32 per cent expected to cut workers' hours, 27 per cent anticipated layoffs, and one business in every 10 forecast either temporary or permanent closure.

Owners say payroll and wage supports must remain key components of B.C.'s recovery plan, along with fee and tax cuts.

The survey also identified expectations that the province must create better investment conditions.

Bridgitte Anderson, president and CEO of the Greater Vancouver Board of Trade, says business viability hinges on those measures.

Val Litwin with the BC Chamber of Commerce urges policy-makers to ""stay sensitive"" to the vulnerability of the business sector.

The fiscal and economic report released a week ago detailed the Liberals' financial expectations, including a $343.2-billion deficit due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Parliamentary budget officer Yves Giroux says in a report that there are other numbers behind the biggest ones that MPs and senators should question.

He points to projections that enterprise Crown corporations, such as the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. and Business Development Bank of Canada, will collectively lose $12 billion this fiscal year.

Giroux notes that loss is a sharp turnaround from the $7.3 billion in gains for the 12-month period ending in March.

He says losses are unusual for these Crown corporations and adds that each should provide detailed projections to Parliament as soon as possible about its COVID-19 liquidity programs.

Similarly, Giroux says the Liberals should provide details of their own borrowing, which his office estimates will exceed by $150 billion the ceiling set by federal legislation.

The budget office estimates the government's planned debt issuance this fiscal year of $713 billion will cost $2.2 billion annually in interest.

The report released Thursday also notes $4.4 billion in spending for measures the government has yet to announce.

All the spending is expected to push the federal debt past the $1-trillion mark.

The Liberals had previously made a declining debt-to-GDP ratio key to their fiscal plans, but skyrocketing spending will push the ratio to 49 per cent from 31.1 per cent.

Giroux says fiscal transparency and accountability would be enhanced if the Liberals identify their new ""fiscal anchor,"" how they'll measure their own successful handling of the budget and national economy, which wasn't specifically laid out in the update last week.

He said the federal government will contribute $19 billion under the ""Safe Restart Agreement.""

article continues below

The money is to help the lower-tier governments with needs such as funding child care, bailing out cities whose expenses have soared and revenues plunged, increasing contact-tracing capacity, and buying personal protective equipment.

Trudeau had promised $14 billion in early June, but several premiers resisted some of the conditions the federal Liberals wanted to put on the money and said it wasn't enough.

Ontario's Doug Ford was one who didn't like a federal demand that some of it fund up to 10 days of paid sick leave to discourage workers with precarious employment from going into work ill. Quebec's Francois Legault wanted the money to be transferred without conditions so provinces could use it on whatever they considered most important.

Trudeau said the agreement outlines seven priority areas, with some flexibility for the provinces to apply the money to their particular needs over the next six to eight months.

""The provinces agreed to invest in the targeted sectors,"" Trudeau said. ""There are areas like support for vulnerable people where we will expect the provinces to declare publicly what they will do.""

At his side, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland added the agreement includes standards in certain areas, such as COVID-19 testing, in exchange for the federal money.

The pandemic is a health crisis, but Trudeau said it has a deep economic dimension that the funding is intended to address.

He said workers can't work if their children don't have safe care, and many can't get to their jobs if they don't have access to safe transit systems.

That means funding public services better so they don't have to rely on crowding many people into small spaces for their finances to make sense.

Municipal governments, which deliver many of those services, have been warning for months that their finances are careening toward brick walls and have been begging for aid.

Canada's largest city, Toronto, has reported that it's facing a $1.35-billion deficit this year. Montreal says it has a $500-million shortfall. Halifax expects to be short $85.4 million.

""The ruin of the First Nations and peoples of Canada is not just statistics. As seen here, it is real pain,"" Justice Chris Martin said in a written decision delivered July 10.

article continues below

Anthony McKay was sentenced to four years after pleading guilty to manslaughter in the death of his mother, Shirley McKay. He faces two years behind bars, after receiving credit for time already served, and will be subject to three years of supervised probation after that.

""As a human, Mrs. McKay deserved better. And, like anyone born in this bountiful country, her son, her killer, deserved a better start, a better chance, in life,"" Martin wrote.

The judge said the killing on the Berens River First Nation, about 300 kilometres north of Winnipeg, was a ""calamity of almost 150 years of government policy, actions and inactions affecting the Indigenous community.""

Anthony McKay, who was 21 at the time, went to his mother's home after a night of drinking on June 22, 2018.

Court was told there was blood everywhere when a cousin came over about 8 a.m. The cousin found Shirley McKay unconscious and badly beaten. Her son has said he doesn't know why he viciously beat her.

The woman was taken to a nursing station before being transported to a hospital in Winnipeg. Her son visited her in hospital daily and was overheard at her bedside sobbing and apologizing.

Court heard he was confronted by a stepbrother and admitted that he had hurt his mother.

Shirley McKay died that September. Her son was arrested the following month.

""She did not recover and died months later, another victim in a mass of slain Aboriginal women,"" Martin said. ""He pled guilty to manslaughter, joining an appalling line of young Aboriginals ending up in prison.""

Crown prosecutors were asking for a seven-year sentence in a federal penitentiary. The defence asked for two years behind bars plus the probation so that McKay could have access to programming available in provincial custody.

The judge pointed to impacts of colonization, the pass system which restricted Indigenous Peoples' movement, residential schools and the '60s Scoop in his sentencing.

""It is well accepted that the government's role, since the early days of dealing with First Nations peoples, has had the effect of isolating, infantilizing, marginalizing, and traumatizing Indigenous societies like the Ojibwa (or Anishinaabe) of Berens River,"" Martin wrote.

""Mr. McKay is a person shaped by a system historically designed to 'take the Indian out of the Indian.'""

Reports provided to the judge on McKay's background said he has partial fetal alcohol syndrome.

One of 13 siblings, he spent most of his time in foster homes on the First Nation or more often in Winnipeg. His parents struggled with alcohol and sniffing substances, and McKay followed a similar path starting when he was 13. His father died in 2010.

McKay was neglected and not cared for, files from child and family services said. He asked to become a permanent ward of child welfare in 2013 because he didn't feel safe with his family.

Martin said McKay's troubled upbringing doesn't excuse his behaviour, but does help explain why he is who he is.

Occasionally it is incumbent on a judge to underscore systemic issues, he said, adding Indigenous people are disproportionately affected by serious crime and disproportionately incarcerated.

""Like so many other cases, this case is troubling, not only for its specific facts, but because it reminds that core issues affecting many in the Indigenous population are not really being addressed sufficiently or urgently enough,"" Martin wrote.

""Many in this and the next generation of Indigenous people are at risk.""

646,newwestrecord,https://newwestrecord.ca/experts-say-twitter-breach-troubling-undermines-trust-1.24171586,"Experts say Twitter breach troubling, undermines trust",['Zen Soo'],,"HONG KONG — A breach in Twitter’s security that allowed hackers to break into the accounts of leaders and technology moguls is one of the worst attacks in recent years and may shake trust in a platform politicians and CEOs use to communicate with the public, experts said Thursday.

The FBI is investigating the hack, according to a person familiar with the probe who was not authorized to discuss an ongoing probe and spoke on the condition of anonymity Thursday.

article continues below

The ruse discovered Wednesday included bogus tweets from Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Mike Bloomberg and a number of tech billionaires including Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Celebrities Kanye West and his wife, Kim Kardashian West, were also hacked.

Hackers used social engineering to target some of Twitter’s employees and then gained access to the high-profile accounts. The attackers sent out tweets from the accounts of the public figures, offering to send $2,000 for every $1,000 sent to an anonymous Bitcoin address.

Cybersecurity experts say such a breach could have dire consequences since the attackers were tweeting from verified, globally influential accounts with millions of followers.

""If you receive a tweet from a verified account, belonging to a well-known and therefore trusted person, you can no longer assume it’s really from them,"" said Michael Gazeley, managing director of cybersecurity firm Network Box.

Reacting to the breach, Twitter swiftly deleted the tweets and locked down the accounts to investigate. In the process it prevented verified users from sending out tweets for several hours.

The company said Thursday it has taken ""significant steps to limit access to internal systems and tools.""

Many celebrities, politicians and business leaders often use Twitter as a public platform to make statements. U.S. President Donald Trump, for example, regularly uses Twitter to post about national and geopolitical matters, and his account is closely followed by media, analysts and governments around the world.

Twitter faces an uphill battle in regaining people’s confidence, Gazeley said. For a start, it needs to figure out exactly the accounts were hacked and show the vulnerabilities have been fixed, he said.

""If key employees at Twitter were tricked, that’s actually a serious cybersecurity problem in itself,"" he said. ""How can one of the world’s most used social media platforms have such weak security, from a human perspective?""

Rachel Tobac, CEO of Socialproof Security, said that the breach appeared to be largely financially motivated. But such an attack could cause more serious consequences.

""Can you imagine if they had taken over a world leader’s account, and tweeted out a threat of violence to another country’s leader?"" asked Tobac, a social engineering hacker who specializes in providing training for companies to protect themselves from such breaches.

Social engineering attacks typically target human weaknesses to exploit networks and online platforms. Companies can guard themselves against such attacks by beefing up multi-factor authentication -– where users have to present multiple pieces of evidence as authentication before being allowed to log into a system, Tobac said.

Such a process could include having a physical token that an employee must have with them, on top of a password, before they can log into a corporate or other private system. Other methods include installing technical tools to monitor for suspicious insider activities and reducing the number of people who have access to an administrative panel, Tobac said.

Several U.S. lawmakers called on Twitter to co-operate with authorities including the Department of Justice and the FBI to secure the site.

""I am concerned that this event may represent not merely a co-ordinated set of separate hacking incidents but rather a successful attack on the security of Twitter itself,"" said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican.

He added that millions of users relied on Twitter not just to send tweets but also communicate privately via direct messaging. Twitter hasn't said if hackers were able to access the private messages of their high-profile targets.

Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden said Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey told him in a private conversation in 2018 that the company was working on protecting direct messages, known as DMs, with end-to-end encryption.

But that promise never materialized, Wyden said Thursday, leaving everyone's private messages ""vulnerable to employees who abuse their internal access to the company’s systems, and hackers who gain unauthorized access.""

""This is a vulnerability that has lasted for far too long, and one that is not present in other, competing platforms,"" Wyden said in an emailed statement. ""If hackers gained access to users’ DMs, this breach could have a breathtaking impact, for years to come.""

Mohammed Shahed, a member of the governing party who regularly appeared on TV talk shows, was arrested Wednesday by the Rapid Action Battalion near the Indian border after a nine-day manhunt.

Shahed is chairman of the Regent Group and owner of two Regent hospitals in the capital, Dhaka.

Abdul Baten, a commissioner of the Detective Branch in Dhaka, said Shahed admitted after his arrest that his hospitals did not have proper equipment to conduct coronavirus tests.

A court in Dhaka on Thursday allowed investigators to keep Shahed in custody for 10 days for questioning.

Officials said the hospitals had issued more than 10,000 coronavirus test results and about 60% were fake even though patients were charged for them. The hospitals allegedly arranged for the remaining tests to be conducted by another hospital.

The two hospitals had not renewed their medical licenses for years, but the Ministry of Health nevertheless signed a deal with Shahed to dedicate the hospitals to coronavirus testing and treatment as the number of cases rose in Bangladesh.

Bangladesh on Thursday was nearing 200,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, including 2,496 deaths. Public health experts say the actual number is much higher because only about 70 testing facilities are available in the country of 160 million people.

Shahed belongs to the governing Awami League party headed by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and is a member of its foreign affairs subcommittee. He has more than 50 illegal cases pending against him across the country on various charges including forgery and cheating.

Another doctor and her husband were also arrested recently on similar charges of falsifying test results.

Local media reports say the scams could hurt Bangladesh’s earnings from overseas workers. Last week, Italy suspended all flights from Bangladesh to Rome after some Bangladeshis reportedly presented fake negative test reports for the coronavirus.

Bangladesh earns about $19 billion a year from about 10 million overseas workers. Authorities said about 15,000 Bangladeshi workers with jobs in Italy remain stranded in Bangladesh and it is unclear whether they will be able to travel to the European country.

The Anti-Defamation league and some Jewish leaders had condemned what they called anti-Semitic theories expressed by Cannon and demanded the apology.

article continues below

""First and foremost I extend my deepest and most sincere apologies to my Jewish sisters and brothers for the hurtful and divisive words that came out of my mouth during my interview with Richard Griffin,"" Cannon said on his Twitter account.

""They reinforced the worst stereotypes of a proud and magnificent people and I feel ashamed of the uninformed and naïve place that these words came from. The video of this interview has since been removed.""

ViacomCBS cut ties with the TV host and producer Tuesday in response to his comments on a podcast where he discussed racial bias.

Rabbi Abraham Cooper, the Simon Wiesenthal Center’s associate dean, told The Associated Press that Cannon reached out to him Wednesday and during a 30-minute telephone conversation he apologized to the Jewish community and Cooper asked him to post it on social media.

""He started out the right way, he said the right things. Half an hour is a long time, and we'll probably meet tomorrow in the LA area,"" Cooper said.

""He understood that the words and references that he thought were based on fact, turned out to be hateful propaganda and stereotypical rhetoric.""

The TV host and producer wrote earlier a lengthy Facebook post defending himself and criticizing his firing for what the company deemed ""bigotry"" and ""anti-Semitism,"" prominent members of the U.S. Jewish community said the post fell well short and demanded an apology.

""It’s not enough to say, ‘I’m not a racist, I’m not a bigot,’"" Cooper had told the AP earlier. ""The statements he made are hurtful, and they’re false.""

Cooper said Cannon should read and heed the words of Martin Luther King Jr., who ""dedicated his life for civil rights for all and a colour-blind America."" Cooper also had advised him to seek out the guidance of basketball Hall of Famer-turned-writer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who has condemned several sports and entertainment celebrities for anti-Semitic posts.

In the hour-plus episode of ""Cannon's Class"" released last month that prompted his firing, Cannon and Richard ""Professor Griff"" Griffin, formerly of the rap group Public Enemy, contended that Black people are the true Hebrews and Jews have usurped that identity.

Cannon then argued that lighter-skinned people — ""Jewish people, white people, Europeans"" — ""are a little less"" and have a ""deficiency"" that historically caused them to act out of fear and commit acts of violence to survive.

""They had to be savages,"" he said.

""When I first heard about the comments Mr. Cannon made, it was very, very disappointing,"" said Oren Segal, director of the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism. ""We’re in a time where hatred of all kinds is very much apparent. It’s in the news every day.""

""Anti-Semitism in particular over the past several years has been something that we've seen in increase , as well as racism and other issues,"" Segal added. ""So when you hear an individual who has a public profile, who has influence over people, make statements that are highly offensive to the Jewish community, the first reaction is disappointment.""

Anti-Semitic violent attacks rose worldwide by 18% in 2019 compared with the previous year, according to a report published in April by Tel Aviv University’s Kantor Center for the Study of Contemporary Jewry.

Segal said some members of the Black Hebrew Israelite movement see themselves as the true ""chosen people,"" and believe that Blacks, Hispanics and Native Americans are the true descendants of the 12 Tribes of Israel. He noted that not all spew hateful rhetoric, although many adhere to an extreme set of anti-Semitic beliefs.

Bruce D. Haynes, a professor of sociology at the University of California, Davis, who has been studying Black Jews for more than two decades, agreed that the remarks echo the ideas of extreme Black Hebrew Israelites and of Minister Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam leader who last year referenced ""Satanic Jews"" in a speech denying allegations of anti-Semitism. But Haynes took a more nuanced view.

""The danger is that those groups get confused with other self-identified Israelites like (Rabbi) Capers Funnye, who has a congregation in Chicago, and who is very much involved with the Ashkenazim Jewish community. So I want to make clear that the term 'Israelites' is a tricky term,"" he said.

""Is it anti-Semitic to say Black people are the real Israelites or the real Jews? I’m not sure I’d call it anti-Semitism,"" Haynes said. ""It’s not a good reading of history, but I wouldn’t call it anti-Semitism. On the other hand, some of those groups that call Jews impostors certainly cross the line.""

Until his firing, Cannon produced ""Wild ’n Out,"" a comedy improv series for VH1, the ViacomCBS-owned cable channel.

In an earlier Facebook post, he had said that he welcomes being held accountable and takes responsibility for his words, while also accusing the company of trying to silence an ""outspoken black man"" and demanding full ownership of the ""Wild ’n Out"" brand.

""I do not condone hate speech nor the spread of hateful rhetoric. ... The Black and Jewish communities have both faced enormous hatred, oppression persecution and prejudice for thousands of years and in many ways have and will continue to work together to overcome these obstacles,"" he wrote.

Cooper had said that Cannon should reject Farrakhan’s hate speech and ""reduce the long statement to two sentences"" — a simple apology, which he did after their conversation.

""I just had the blessed opportunity to converse with Rabbi Abraham Cooper director of global social action @SimonWiesenthal. My first words to my brother was, I apologize for the hurt I caused the Jewish Community"" Cannon tweeted.

""On my podcast I used words & referenced literature I assumed to be factual to uplift my community instead turned out to be hateful propaganda and stereotypical rhetoric that pained another community For this I am deeply sorry but now together we can write a new chapter of healing.""

In an email to workers Wednesday night, the company said that since January it has had fewer than 10 cases of the virus that causes COVID-19 that were transmitted in the workplace.

article continues below

But the email from Laurie Shelby, Tesla’s vice-president of environmental, safety and health, also confirmed reports that Tesla is looking into more than 130 positive tests among employees, including those who contracted the virus outside of Tesla facilities. She said less than 0.25% of employees worldwide have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, which equals just over 137 workers.

Her message came in response to a report by Electrek.co that over 130 Tesla employees or contractors have tested positive, and hundreds more are waiting for test results. The website said it based the report on internal company data.

Shelby wrote that the story referred to data ""that was in the process of being validated"" and included employees worldwide who may have been infected but never entered a Tesla site, or were infected at home while Tesla's operations were shut down earlier in the year. A Tesla spokesman would not comment on the report or the email, which was obtained by The Associated Press.

""Nearly all — more than 99.99% — of these occurrences were not cases of virus transmitted at work,"" Shelby wrote in the email. ""Most of the positive cases resulted from an individual living with or travelling with someone with COVID-19 and have returned to work after recovering from home.""

Shelby wrote that Tesla doesn't have any employees in serious condition anywhere in the world because of COVID-19.

A message was left Thursday seeking comment on the numbers from the public health department in Alameda County, California, which includes Fremont, the location of Tesla's only U.S. assembly plant. The factory employs about 10,000 workers.

Some workers have refused to return to the plant out of fear of catching the virus. They did so after CEO Elon Musk in May defied Health Department orders not to restart production under shutdown orders due to the virus.

Some Tesla workers and labour activists say the company is threatening to fire employees who haven’t returned, but Tesla officials have said claims about firings are not true. Workers say they've heard about COVID-19 cases at the plant but they don't know numbers. They have called on the company and health department to release the figures.

However, Shelby wrote in the email that an employee survey found the vast majority of workers feel comfortable with the safety measures being taken by the company.

Among the measures are increased cleaning, limiting access to facilities, temperature checks for employees before they enter buildings, staggered shifts to keep workers apart, additional barriers between employees and providing protective equipment, Shelby wrote.

She urged workers to wear masks or face coverings to stay healthy and save lives and warned that failing to wear masks where required, or not wearing them properly, will bring disciplinary actions. She also wrote that workers should stay home if they're sick.

Musk reopened the Fremont plant May 11 in defiance of county orders. The health department had deemed the factory a nonessential business that can’t fully open under virus restrictions, but Tesla contended it was essential under federal guidelines.

The next day, however, the Health Department announced that the plant could return to manufacturing as long as it delivers on worker safety precautions that it agreed to.",[]

The order takes effect Monday.

Hutchinson’s decision comes amid growing support for mask requirements from business and health leaders and a day after Bentonville-based Walmart said it would require customers to wear masks in all of its U.S. stores. The state’s largest newspaper, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, also called for a statewide requirement on Thursday.

Hutchinson previously encouraged people to wear masks and allowed cities to pass ordinances requiring their use, but he stopped short of requiring them statewide. He’s the latest Republican governor to relent on the mask issue in the face of a surge in COVID-19 cases. Alabama's governor issued a similar mask mandate on Wednesday.

Arkansas' coronavirus cases have dramatically risen since May, when the state began allowing businesses that had closed because of the pandemic to reopen despite warnings from national health officials about the risks of doing so too soon. Arkansas was one of a handful of states that did not issue a broader stay-at-home order that kept most businesses closed.

Hutchinson previously questioned how a mask mandate could be enforced in a rural state such as Arkansas, but this week he left open the possibility of such a requirement. The chancellor of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences called for a statewide requirement last weekend.

Hutchinson's order was expected to face criticism from some conservatives in the state. Hours before he issued the order, a Republican legislator urged people to call Hutchinson to oppose any mask directive.

A poll by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business suggested tensions are flaring between workers and employers, with around 27 per cent of 3,389 employers polled indicating some of their laid-off staff have refused to return to work.

article continues below

Of the nearly 870 businesses that provided the reasons their employees gave for refusing to return to work, 62 per cent reported workers ""prefer the Canada Emergency Response Benefit."" Employers could choose more than one explanation for why a worker refused to return, and respondents also selected options such as concern for health (47 per cent), childcare obligations (27 per cent) or lack of hours in return offer (16 per cent).

CFIB president Dan Kelly said it's ""clear"" that CERB ""created a disincentive to return to work for some staff, especially in industries like hospitality."" Other sectors where conflicts are arising include child care, dental offices, home health care, amusement parks, gambling and spectator sports, the study suggested.

""CERB was created as emergency support for workers who had lost their job due to the pandemic, not to fund a summer break,"" Kelly said in a statement.

But Ian Robb, Canadian director of the Unite Here union that represents hospitality workers, disagrees. He said workers are impatient to return to work — for what is usually the lucrative summer season — but employers are the ones failing to adopt measures like frequent cleaning and wage subsidies. The union previously estimated that average wages in cities like Toronto are around $20 per hour for hospitality.

""A number of our members in the U.S. have gone to work and contracted (COVID-19),"" Robb said.

""There's just not enough safety in front of service. Nobody wants to stay home and make two grand when they can make double that by working.""

The survey suggested that the hospitality sector had the biggest share of employers, 45 per cent, who had trouble recalling workers. CFIB defines hospitality as including hotels, restaurants and bars.

The CFIB study suggests that in the hospitality sector, 56 per cent of hard-to-fill positions were ""unskilled, entry-level jobs"" that pay ""at or around minimum wage,"" although across sectors, skilled and semi-skilled jobs were harder to fill.

Employment and human rights lawyer Neena Gupta says she has heard of tradespeople unable to perform jobs because workers failed to return.

She said the reason an employee is refusing the work matters. Lack of childcare, like daycare and camps, can be a job-protected reason for staying home, as can disabilities such as being immunocompromised, says Gupta, a partner in Gowling WLG's Waterloo Region and Toronto offices.

The federal government's website states that workers seeking CERB, which offers $500 per week over a limited period, ""should be seeking work opportunities and/or return to work when their employer makes a request for their return, provided they are able and it is reasonable to do so."" The government's COVID-19 guidelines also provide for employees to refuse to do a dangerous job, although the worker must already ""be at work"" to refuse such a task.

However, notes Gupta, general apprehension about the pandemic is likely not enough to merit a job refusal. She said workplaces must comply with health and safety guidelines, and that a ministry inspection must find some sort of violation to justify a job refusal.

Managers should give workers a written ""come back to work"" recall and an indication that it will be treated as job abandonment if the worker doesn't return, says Gupta. After that process is completed, the employer could consider that worker terminated for cause, and hire a replacement.

While reporting misuse of CERB by a former employee might appear to give an employer some moral satisfaction, Gupta says it’s unlikely to help with staffing concerns or worker morale.

""I do ask people to be reasonable. You can’t call someone at noon on a Thursday and expect them in at 7 a.m. on Friday,"" she says.

CFIB, a policy advocacy group that represents small and medium-sized businesses and has 110,000 members, collected the data from members online between July 3 to July 6.

A month after the BC Junior A Lacrosse League was supposed to begin playing, the league officially cancelled its 2020 season.

The Minto Cup, along with all other minor and senior national championships, has also been cancelled by the Canadian Lacrosse Association.

In a release, BCJALL president Karl Christiansen said ongoing restrictions in British Columbia limiting the size of public gatherings during the COVID-19 pandemic to no more than 50 people made it impossible for games to be played.

“We had hope we might be able to compete this year,” he said. “But it became evident we wouldn’t be able to have a normal season.”

Christiansen said alternative schedules were considered, but public health directives were insurmountable.

CLA president Shawn Williams said health and safety, travel concerns and venue closures were the main considerations in its decision to cancel all 2020 national championships from the Mann Cup senior men’s title to the U12 finals, as well as the U19 women’s field lacrosse championships.

“We recognize that national championships are important to lacrosse players of all ages,” he said, adding all hosts for 2020 events will be charged with staging their championships in 2021. That means the Minto and Mann Cups will both be played in Ontario.

But Paul Dal Monte said the league’s executive and governors are doing everything they can to ensure that doesn’t happen, even as the uncertainty about when restrictions on public gatherings could be lifted continues.

article continues below

At the very least, the coming season - which has already been postponed from its scheduled May 21 start - is unlikely to look like any other normal campaign.

Dal Monte said the league has a contingency to play a schedule as short as 12 games. But any decision on how to proceed relies on continuing direction from health authorities, as well as the Canadian Lacrosse Association.

Dal Monte added he’s also in regular communication with his counterpart at Major Series Lacrosse in Ontario, which is supposed to be hosting the Mann Cup national championship in September.

“We stay on top of things,” Dal Monte said. “We understand the pain points and challenges.”

One of those pain points is the financial viability of the league and its seven teams, including the Coquitlam Adanacs, Burnaby Lakers and New Westminster Salmonbellies.

Dal Monte said the niche nature of lacrosse means teams rely on sponsors and partnerships rather than gate receipts to cover expenses, and with so many businesses suffering because of the pandemic, those dollars may be hard to come by this summer.

“At this stage, it creates a significant obstacle for us and many of our teams,” he said, adding without the certainty of a schedule, it’s difficult for teams to even begin having a conversation with potential sponsors.

Dal Monte conceded some teams might have a hard time operating.

Still, he said, time is on the league’s side. Virtual meetings with team governors are being held May 2 and 16 to assess the current situation and options for moving forward.

Any final call on how to proceed with a season could be held off as late as June 1, Dal Monte said. Then “we would have to make a decision one way or the other.”

Meanwhile, the president of the BC Junior A Lacrosse League said a recent pronouncement by British Columbia’s health officer, Dr. Bonnie Henry, suggesting large gatherings of people may not be allowed through the summer in an effort to quash transmission of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 puts his league’s ability to hold a season “at risk.”

The BCJALL, which includes the Coquitlam Jr. Adanacs, PoCo Saints as well as junior incarnations of the Lakers and Salmonbellies among its eight teams, was supposed to play its first regular season game on Saturday. But that’s now on hold with the league executive meeting next on May 19.

Karl Kristiansen said the league could reduce its schedule to 14 games from 21, or even stage a tournament-style season to determine playoff teams that could compete for a chance to go to the Minto Cup in St. Catharines in August. That is, if the national championship even gets the green light to play.

Kristiansen said his group should have more clarity after the CLA meets May 15 when the fate of several national championships, from youth to senior leagues, is expected to be decided.

League governors decided to postpone the start, and officials with both the WLA and Major Series Lacrosse of Ontario are working together with an aim of having a Mann Cup championship series between the two leagues in September, hosted by Ontario.

Everything hinges on Canadian and provincial health officials ending the state of emergency, which has closed all community facilities and put a ban on large gatherings.

“Our intention is to play a full season but we have alternately drafted a few proposals that give us options should the situation not permit (a regular length schedule),” WLA commissioner Paul Dal Monte said in an interview with the Record on Tuesday. “We have drafted two alternative schedules, with playoff options, and aligned in lock-step with the MSL.”

When they receive the all-clear from health officials to open shuttered community facilities and permit public gatherings, municipal schedulers will be inundated with requests for floor time from the minor sports and recreation sports user groups, as well. That would also require some coordinating on a local standpoint, Dal Monte said.

The WLA governors are slated to meet again on April 11 to review their options. Dal Monte said the focus is on preparing for a possible spring startup that could facilitate a condensed schedule and playoffs and a September Mann Cup tournament.

“Obviously we all want to start the season soon,” New West Salmonbellies general manager Ray Porcellato said. “This is unprecedented, and everyone needs to follow (health officials) instructions. The goal is to have a season and playoffs leading to a Mann Cup. It’s going to be a challenge, as (most) Ontario teams play second or third fiddle to junior hockey in regards to their arenas.”

With Ontario slated to host the Mann Cup championship and as a number of the competitive teams there share their arenas with Ontario Hockey League clubs, postponing the national series past mid-September would be a challenge.

“In arenas where a number of Ontario teams play, junior hockey takes precedent, like in Peterborough,” noted Dal Monte. “But the Mann Cup is the Mann Cup, so we’ll have to see.”

The WLA regular season usually sees teams play each other three times in an 18-game schedule, for a total of 63 games. If the league reduced to a home-and-home series each, it would result in a 12-game schedule per team, for 42 league games.

Porcellato said he’s been in contact with the ‘Bellie players and says they are working out in anticipation of an eventual start to the season.

“They’re Instagramming each other with push-up challenges, staying home and doing what they can,” he noted. “I guess if there’s any benefit to this, the guys who play pro (in the National Lacrosse League) are getting a chance to heal up, rest and recuperate.”

The Ontario league has not announced a postponement to its schedule as of Tuesday, but released a statement that extends the ban on all in-person lacrosse activities to May 15, pending further provincial directives. The MSL was slated to launch May 31 and run until July 30, with the league playoffs running through August.

With both leagues working together in mapping out various options for condensed regular seasons and playoffs, Porcellato said his squad is all-in for however the 2020 season is drawn up.

“We will be ready to go, right to the bitter end until a Mann Cup is not feasible,” he said. “We plan on being there, even if it’s a one-game winner take-all.”",[]

The Lower Mainland Baseball Association, which oversees 37 teams over four leagues for 18-and older players, announced Monday that all events, games and meetings are cancelled as it encourages its members to remain safe.

Among the scrapped events was a league meeting slated for Saturday.

Lower Mainland Baseball League commissioner Dan Taylor said there the public health concerns trump sports, but has set some possible scenarios that would see the health scare abate and regular activities begin to return.

“I’m hoping it isn’t too long. I’ve got about 700 guys who are itching to play,” said Taylor. “We’re not anticipating starting the season any time soon, but I’ve sort of set a date in my head of the Victoria Day (May 16 to 18), and hopefully start a schedule then.”

His 38 teams, which compete in 18-plus, 30-plus and 45-plus divisions, would have to play a short-season schedule. In a regular season the teams play 16-game schedules, plus playoffs.

“Basically, we’re just in a great big holding pattern, like everybody else.”

Taylor notes his league is also dependent upon what the region’s minor baseball associations can do, since most of the men’s league field access relies on what is available after the kids need.

“We share all the same diamonds as the minor associations,” he noted. “Most parks are allocated (municipally) for the minor organizations, because the kids come first, as it should be. Over our 26 years we’ve built up a lot of goodwill so I’m confident that we can work together.”

The league has kept the registration system open, and has advised teams that have not yet paid its registration fees to hold on until an opening day is determined.

“LMBA is instructing all teams not to practice until parks have been re-opened – per instructions from Baseball BC and all Lower Mainland municipalities. We are optimistic that we will get in some baseball time in 2020 and will keep everyone updated,” a notice posted on the LMBL website.

While the three different divisions are full with teams, one squad that has competed over the past two seasons – the B.C. Badgers, a female team composed of provincial and national-level players – won’t be returning due to scheduling conflicts.

Taylor said it was a great experience having the Badgers compete in the over-45 division, where they received steady competition in preparing for the women’s national team responsibilities. Unfortunately, because their roster includes players from Vancouver Island and right through to the Fraser Valley, it was difficult to guarantee the Badgers could make the often early weekend games. They ended up forfeiting some games due to travel difficulties, he said.

“The schedule just didn’t mesh well with them,” said Taylor. “I’ve followed the female program for a while and you can see how much it’s improved over time, here in B.C. but also across Canada.

“We told the national level players that they could come out and tryout for any team in our league.”

He said the Badgers have decided to join the Vancouver Recreational Baseball League, which operates out of Burnaby’s Central Park and New West’s Queen’s Park.",[]

Four months after the NBA was forced to shut down due to COVID-19, the Raptors are making up for lost time with their fierce fight at practice.

article continues below

""Practices have been super, super competitive,"" said Patrick McCaw. ""A lot of trash talk, a lot of guys going at it, just pushing each other. We've been away from each other for two or three months, so guys are excited to see each other but also excited to play.

""So that energy (at) practice is super intense, and it's fun, because you're competing against the guys that you're going to war with. It's been a couple weeks of great fun.""

Coach Nick Nurse wasn't quite sure what to expected in this unprecedented situation. He's been pleased with his players' feistiness.

""There's a lot of juice in there, a lot of juice in the building, and high spirits,"" Nurse said after Thursday's practice at Disney, where courts have been laid down in a massive convention hall.

""It's all good-natured stuff — it's competitive-natured stuff, but it's all been fine.""

Norm Powell, the unofficial leader of the second unit, said the younger players have been pushing the veterans hard.

""Man, we're competing,"" Powell said. ""I was actually really happy and excited the way the younger guys were getting Fred (VanVleet) and Kyle (Lowry) and Pascal (Siakam) worked up, taking their intensity level even higher. The games have been really good when we're getting after it in our in-team scrimmages and things like that.""

The Raptors were second in the Eastern Conference when the league shuttered on March 11, and that was despite having a revolving door of a roster due to numerous injuries to key players. The Raptors were fifth in the league in games lost to injury.

Nurse now has the luxury of a full roster to choose from.

Powell, who was playing the most consistent basketball of his NBA career before the hiatus, is being more vocal at practice. He's taken aside players such as Chris Boucher, rookie Terence Davis, McCaw and Stanley Johnson to remind them to make Nurse's job more difficult, to constantly battle for more a bigger role.

""I'm telling them, 'We've got to go at these guys (the starters) because we want their spot. They are in the position we want to be in. So we're not going to take it easy on them in these drills, we're not going to let them feel like they can do whatever they want and take it easy and go through the motions. We're going to go after them, we're going to compete, and we're going to show them that we're here and we want more,'"" Powell said.

Nurse said he could go deep into his bench for the three scrimmages and eight-game seeding round before tightening it up for the playoffs.

""I just think that you're going to play eight, nine in the playoffs. Everybody sort of gets to that point, every possession is so critical,"" he said.

""One thing that's for sure, each series always seems to be so different. Sometimes there's just some guy that doesn't fit and then maybe there's a series where a Chris Boucher or Rondae Hollis-Jefferson or somebody who's in the rotation but towards the back of it maybe they get slotted in for a matchup or something.

""So I think it's always good to have some versatility, maybe 12 guys you can use because you can never know who suits each series.""

Nurse received a virtual thumbs up from reporters in Thursday's Zoom video call for his sweater. It said ""Box + One,"" a nod to the box-and-one defence, most often seen in collegiate games, that he implemented against Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors in last year's NBA Finals.

The Raptors could be at Disney World for the next three months if they go deep into the playoffs. The team has tried to make them feel at home, and most recently decorated their floor of the hotel. There's large ""We The North"" banners on players' doors, and a huge photo of the Toronto skyline decorates one wall of the hallway.

A cracked bone? Good to go. What about a sore shoulder? No problem.

It's well-known NHLers battle through aches, pains and even illness. Almost like clockwork, a flu bug tears through more than a few locker rooms every season. Players often attempt to soldier on without missing any time, especially when the games matter most.

In the era of COVID-19, however, some of that old the definition of ""toughness"" is being thrown out the window.

Players and coaches are keenly aware that if they're feeling even the slightest bit off — and there are a laundry list of symptoms associated with the novel coronavirus, from chills to headaches to fatigue and weakness — it needs to be reported immediately.

""Doesn't matter if you're a tough hockey player or not,"" said Tippett, now the head coach of the Edmonton Oilers. ""I had a lot of games where I hid a broken finger or something like that from doctors. I didn't want them to know because they wouldn't let me play.

""But when you get sick, you're going to have to tell people. That's just the way of the new world.""

The NHL opened training camps this week as part of its plan to kickstart a campaign that was suspended in mid-March by the pandemic. Players and staff are getting tested every 48 hours — they're not currently quarantined — and that will be kick up another notch to once a day when the 24 teams involved in the resumption head to the hub cities of Edmonton and Toronto, where they'll be kept in a bubble separate from the general public.

Vancouver Canucks captain Bo Horvat said the mentality of the past has been turned on its head when it comes to illness.

""As hockey players you want to be in every single game, you want to play, and you want to help your teammate, and you want to be a difference-maker,"" he said. ""Before you played through colds, you played through injuries, you played through sickness and stuff like that.

""You have to step back and think a little bit now. It's a different animal, this virus. You have to be not only cautious of yourself and how you're feeling, but the people around you, too. It's not just your teammates, it's the medical staff, it's the trainers, it's everybody you're around every single day, and even obviously opposing teams. You've got to think of everybody. You've got to be very cautious.""

Edmonton Oilers centre and NHL leading scorer Leon Draisaitl said that caution is going to become the new norm.

""Every hockey player has played through certain things and we've all played through a flu or sickness or whatever it is,"" he said. ""But now with this going around, it makes it a little more dangerous.

""You have to be careful.""

Winnipeg Jets centre Andrew Copp said hockey's team-first mentality should kick in if someone isn't feeling right.

""You hope that everyone's pretty dialled in, and not only for everyone's health and safety, but for the team too,"" he said. ""If this guy gets it, he's not playing. Hopefully everyone can realize that we're all making a lot of sacrifices here.""

The NHL hasn't said how many positive tests would constitute the ""uncontrolled outbreak"" listed in its return-to-play protocol that could conceivably shut the league's resumption down. There's a difference between cases being spread out and a cluster of infections on a team or teams.

The league said earlier this week 30 players tested positive for COVID-19 during voluntary workouts at team facilities between June 8 and July 12. Another 13 positive results came outside of the league's protocol, while 10 other players tested positive in the spring. Training camps opened Monday, but individuals and teams won't be named moving forward with regards to positive tests.

It's no secret players have hid countless injuries in the past, and the league has been criticized heavily for how it dealt with the concussion issue, but Mathieu Schneider, special assistant to NHLPA executive director Don Fehr, said the virus is different territory.

""If concussions were contagious, I think players would feel differently about it,"" Schneider said. ""Guys certainly understand the notion that if they are not honest with symptoms or how they might feel, that they put their entire team in jeopardy.

""There's going to be a huge onus on the players here in (training camp) to make sure that they're taking care of themselves and looking out for their teammates — going to the rink, going home, going to the grocery store, social distancing, wearing mask, washing your hands. All the things that all of us are practising every single day now.""

Toronto Maple Leafs defenceman Morgan Rielly said it simply comes down to common sense is in this new reality.

""It's on the players and our staff to be honest with each other,"" he said. ""You don't want to put anyone else at risk.

""You want to do what's best for them.""

Matthews finished third in the NHL with a career-high 47 goals, one behind Maurice (Rocket) Richard Trophy co-winners Alex Ovechkin and David Pastrnak, while also topping the Maple Leafs with a career-best 80 points in 70 games.

The 22-year-old Scottsdale, Ariz., native also established a career-low with eight penalty minutes, tied for the fewest among the NHL's top 100 scorers. He did so while sharing second place in the League in takeaways (78) and ranking eighth among NHL forwards in total time on ice (1,467 minutes 52 seconds).

MacKinnon ranked fifth in the NHL with 93 points (35 goals, 58 assists) in 69 games to lead the Avalanche into the playoffs for the third consecutive season. The 24-year-old from Cole Harbour, N.S., registered a career-low 12 penalty minutes, the second-fewest among the league's top 25 scorers.

“With COVID being what it is, my work with musicians from Canadian bands like Prism, Trooper, Idle Eyes, Barney Bentall, has ground to a halt,” Young said in email to the Record. “The side-effect of not be able to currently produce records and perform has opened up time to work on my own music, which never seemed to get done.”

Young was thinking about a longtime friend who works at Royal Columbian Hospital and had recently entered a promising new relationship.

“Then COVID swoops in, and because he is frontline in the pandemic, he can’t see his new love close up,” Young said. “My wife and I chatted about how that must be really tough. It inspired me to write this cheeky little pop-rock song, called Lock Down Love Affair. I hope it can put a smile on some faces.”

To date, Lock Down Love Affair has been viewed more than 11,000 times on YouTube.

Young, the in-house producer and engineer at Alchemy Sound Studios in New West, said COVID-19 is the latest blow to his industry.

“The recording studio business has gone from being ambushed by the MP3, which turned the music industry upside down, to Vancouver’s crazy real estate, which has forced most professional recording facilities out of business,” he said. “The responsibility of recording young, local, indie artists and Canadian legacy artists has fallen to the smaller, agile studios like myself at Alchemy Sound Studios. COVID is another blow that is hitting an industry already on its knees.”

Just as COVID was warming up, Young said he was finishing up work on a record project involving Al Harlow (Prism) and Kevin Stuart Swain (Idle Eyes/Barney Bentall.) He was also producing a record by fellow New West resident/artist Clayton Hill from Trooper.

Musicians, said Young, are in a bit of a pickle because of COVID-19 and restrictions on large gatherings.

“Playing music live has been an important part of my life and income,” he said. “On a local level, I regularly played music at the Union Jack Public House, whose owner Darell Myers has actively supported live music from the moment he took over the pub.”

Along with playing at the Union Jack on weekends, Young hosted a jam night every Wednesday evening. He said the jam night was a hub where music lovers and amateur and pro musicians could get together to hit the stage and socialize.

“This evening is greatly missed in the community,” he said.

Young said the “silver lining” in the COVID situation is that it’s given him time to finally work on personal projects that always seemed to get put on the back burner. You can check out Young’s new tune on YouTube – search for Lockdown Love Affair.",[]

The show is part of a series of stand-up performances that are being produced in support of local businesses to help them with recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. For each show, audience members are given a chance to enjoy the show for free with purchase of gift certificates from the local business in question (ranging from $10 to $50 in value) or to pay $10 for just the online show. All the ticket proceeds go back to the business.

The coming show is in support of the Heritage Grill and its sister restaurant, Begbie’s Tavern, both of which are owned by New Westminster entrepreneur Paul Minhas.

A press release notes that Minhas was one of many small business owners that were hit hard by the pandemic when he was forced to close his doors for more than two months. The performers wanted to help Minhas because he has been a longtime supporter of the local entertainment scene.

“Prior to closing, Heritage Grill and Begbie’s have been home to several arts programs, shows and communities including the ukulele club, open mic nights, live music, trivia night, Way Off-Broadway Wednesdays, drag and, of course, stand-up comedy,” the release says. “(Minhas) has been an advocate and supporter of the arts, and these comedians want to give back.”

The show is being produced by Life is Still Funny and Laugh Wild Comedy. It’s set to feature Ray Morrison, Simi C., Ragini Kapil, Kalyn Miles, Helen Schneiderman and Nina Wilder, and it’s being hosted by Christine Hackman.

The New Westminster-based quintet is offering up a live-streamed concert on Sunday, July 5 from 100 Braid Street Studios – the group’s home base and, as they call it, their “living room.”

article continues below

Quayside in the House will feature a set of the group’s favourite songs, pulled from their repertoire of original a cappella arrangements of pop music.

It’s being brought to the stage thanks to a New Westminster Responsive Neighbourhood Small Grant from the Vancouver Foundation.

Audience members won’t be allowed in to watch live, out of concerns over COVID-19, but the singers will be able to work together – at appropriate physical distance from each other – thanks to some new technology.

“Using in-ear monitors and microphones will allow the five of us to sing apart from each other while being able to hear the blend and voices clearly,” explained Stephanie Lam, who sings alto with the group.

The group’s sound engineer, Emil Wu, has been working with the technology to ensure the group can produce a clear sound for the online audience.

Lam noted that their tech use stems from training sessions they had with Tony Huerta, the sound engineer for international a cappella stars Take 6 and The Real Group. Huerta flew in earlier this year to give the Quayside singers a weekend intensive.

Along with the technology, the singers have benefited from having the spacious surroundings of 100 Braid Street to work in.

“100 Braid Street has also been a huge factor in why we can even do this, as the space is large enough, with tall ceilings and circulation, to ease our minds and fears of aerosols and droplets,” Lam said.

As a result, she said, the singers will be able to put on a concert that, despite social distancing, will still provide the musical intricacies experienced through a cappella vocal music.

Looking ahead, Lam said, the singers are hoping to be able to stage an outdoor performance – and a musically satisfying one, since the in-ear monitors and microphones will allow them to produce good sound, even physically distanced, in the open air.

Quayside Voices features the talents of Lam, Justin Pham and Troy Martell, along with Elyse Kantonen and Megan Dray – who are filling in for Maggie Ma and Alyssa Inouye, both on maternity leave.

That’s the news released today by the B.C. government, which claims the move will allow help with the cannabis retail industry's need for more security-screened workers, as well as reducing costs to cannabis workers and reducing interruptions from having to go through criminal record checks.

The government claims the move will also “allow provincial security screening resources to focus on the qualification of new workers rather than the requalification of current workers who are already working in the legal cannabis retail industry.”

Security screening and re-screening requirements were implemented as a measure to keep organized crime out of the legal, non-medical cannabis market.

Screenings involve background checks with police, courts and corrections databases. To date, 4,300 workers have been screened.

All workers with a current valid security screening will have their security verification period extended from the date of their initial verification. Security verifications for all new workers will be valid for five years.",[]

Facing challenges in getting temporary foreign workers into the country and encouraging local labour into the market, farmers know all about covid-19.

So the news of a record $3.9 billion in sales last year may temper some of the adverse effects no doubt coming down the pipe later this year and beyond.

Areas of growth included a close to $300-million increase in cannabis sales, along with a $47-million increase in dairy sales, a $25-million increase in beef sales and a $17.5-million increase in field vegetable sales.

The figures represent an increase of more than 13 per cent, or $462 million, more than 2018.

Indeed, the B.C. government hopes 2019’s bumper sales in the farming industry is a sign of a strong recovery in the future.

""For the past three years, our government has been focused on helping farmers farm and strengthening food security,” said Lana Popham, Minister of Agriculture.

“We know the pandemic has impacted farmers greatly this year, but the farming sector's record economic growth in 2019 sets the sector up for a strong recovery.

“COVID-19 has opened our eyes to the importance of our province's self-sufficiency. I urge everyone to continue to show their appreciation for our farmers and support our local food system by making a special effort to Buy BC.""

As government works on the overall economic restart, more British Columbian farm workers are still needed to ensure B.C.'s agriculture sector remains strong.

""Connecting more British Columbians to agriculture jobs and careers is more important than ever as we work to restart the economy and keep this momentum going,"" added Popham.

“We are working together with industry as we focus on restarting our farming sector.""

In May, government launched the BC Farm, Fish and Food Job Connector and a digital campaign is underway to further promote these job opportunities for the summer.

* Farm cash receipts refer to the revenues from the sale of agricultural commodities, program payments from government agencies and payments from private crop and livestock insurance programs.

* Other sectors/commodities with increased sales include:

* chicken - $12 million;

* blueberries - $7 million;

* grapes - $5.6 million; and

* grains and oilseeds - $2.7 million.",[]

Along with completing an online survey, the city is inviting people to attend small group discussions on the topic. It’s also providing an opportunity for people to make arrangements to complete the survey in a different language (with a translator) by phone by emailing engage@newwestcity.ca or calling 604-527-4653.



“Engagement on the city’s pandemic recovery is expected to continue through the summer and into September 2020,” said a notice about the survey. “We will report back to council and the community in the fall about what we heard, and input received will be considered in recovery planning as well as various departments, projects and decision-making.”

The survey asks community members to rank their level of support for the nine principles developed by the city to guide the city’s pandemic recovery plan.

“In responding to the pandemic, the city has worked quickly to put physical changes and supports in place to help manage impacts in the community,” says the survey. “Some examples include changes to roadways to allow more space for pedestrians and cyclists, allowing expanded patio space for restaurants, and exploring creation of new parklets (outdoor seating areas, etc. that are not connected with a specific business / no purchase required. In May, city council passed a resolution to “move quickly in 2020 to expand road re-allocation toward pedestrian, cyclist, and public gathering space, using temporary measures where necessary with a mind towards more permanent solutions that can be applied after the period of crisis has passed.”

Aside from initiatives that have already been introduced, the survey asks survey respondents if they have any ideas for additional physical changes or innovations residents would like the city to consider in their neighbourhoods or in New Westminster as it moves through the recovery period and plans for the post-pandemic future.

The survey also asks people to rank the community benefits the city is anticipating as a result of city council’s declaration of a climate emergency and support of Seven Bold Steps on climate change – initiatives approved prior to the pandemic. It also asks if there are any particular climate-action activities the city should prioritize through the recovery period.

Prior to the pandemic, council approved a 2019 to 2022 strategic plan that identified priority areas, which included: affordable housing; culture and economic development; environment and climate action; reconciliation, inclusion and engagement; and sustainable transportation. In light of “the new COVID-19 pandemic reality and thinking about recovery” the survey asks how important these priorities are now, what types of actions in these areas are most important, and if any new priorities have come to light because of the pandemic.

According to the survey, the pandemic has increased and drawn attention to ongoing social issues and inequities in New Westminster, including economic inequality, systemic racism, quality of long-term care for and social isolation of elders and people with disabilities, the opioid overdose crisis, food insecurity, lack of affordable housing, employment inequities such as precarious jobs with no sick leave or other benefits, increasing poverty due to job loss, lack of affordable childcare, domestic violence, and others. On this front, the survey asks what actions the city should take to build a more equitable, sustainable and resilient city, and questions the degree of support for the city’s efforts to take transformation action during the pandemic recovery and beyond.

“City council would specifically like to hear from members of demographic groups that have been disproportionally impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic,” said the survey. “This information is important to understand what perspectives might be missing from the conversation, and to ensure diversity of participation.”",[]

On Monday, city council approved a motion calling on the federal government to extend the emergency wage subsidy program until such time that businesses are able to resume business at full pre-pandemic capacity. The motion states Canada’s emergency wage supplement is currently making the difference between the survival and failure of many small businesses.

While presenting his motion, Coun. Chuck Puchmayr said he had just learned the federal government had agreed to extend the benefit, which was set to expire Aug. 29. Given that council won’t be meeting again until Aug. 31, he said he wanted to ensure the city informed the federal government of its support for the program.

“One of the businesses that brought this up gave me a really good example; they would have lost probably half of their work force had this not if already been in existence,” he said. “Losing this program, they would lose a lot of their skilled workers.”

Puchmayr said one local restaurant has had to reduce its seating from 129 to 55 seats because of social spacing requirements, something that’s not sustainable for many businesses.

“There are many, many restaurants that are in this same position right now. As one of the owners said, this is a slow moving train wreck that is going to have some dire consequences – by the time COVID is over, there will be a lot of casualties,” he said. “This motion is to ask (the federal government) to continue that support and keep these restaurants viable, and small businesses that are limited to capacity limits.”

Mayor Jonathan Cote agreed the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy has been among a number of important programs helping Canadians through the pandemic.

“We know that many of our local businesses, definitely in some specific sectors, are going to have a rough period during this time,” he said. “I think it’s important that we show our support for these types of programs.”

Launched as part of the federal government’s response to the pandemic, Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) provides eligible businesses affected by COVID-19 with a subsidy of 75% of employee wages for up to 24 weeks. The wage subsidy aims to allow businesses to rehire workers previously laid off because of COVID-19, to help prevent further job losses and to put them in a better position to resume normal operations following the crisis.

New Westminster-Buranby MP Peter Julian says the federal government must do more to ensure Canadians are supported while business owners and workers begin to get back on their feet. - File

New Westminster-Burnaby MP Peter Julian said he welcomes the announcement that the CEWS program will be extended, but believes more help is needed for Canadian businesses.

“For weeks, we have been calling on the government to extend the CEWS past Aug. 29 and to adopt more flexible criteria so that more businesses can get the help they desperately need,” he said in a news release. “The existing criteria for CEWS is too restrictive, and New Democrats are pushing for changes to make the program more flexible.”

Julian, who is the federal NDP’s finance critic, said New Democrats have proposed a sliding-scale for the wage subsidy in order to help more businesses over the summer.

“Right now, if a business loses less than 30% of their revenue they don’t qualify for the CEWS. This arbitrary number chosen by the government is unfairly leaving too many businesses without the support they need,” he said. “Under the NDP approach, businesses with a smaller loss of revenue could still qualify for a partial wage subsidy so that more businesses get support.”",[]

Can you help?,['Darrell Hoekstra'],,"We are blessed to live in a society and a part of the world where we experience a level of freedom and prosperity almost unparalleled in the history of human existence.

We aren't often pushed (and then typically not far) outside our comfort zone. One of the things that COVID-19 has done is helped me to re-evaluate my priorities.

article continues below

To spend time thinking about what is really important in life. To recognize how pervasive an underlying attitude of selfishness and laziness has become in my life because of such ease. I believe this to be true (to some extent at least) of our society generally without denying for a second the very real hardships that we do still experience as human beings.

Call it a wake-up call, call it a paradigm shift, these lines of thought have galvanized me to action. My wife Mary-Lin and her two brothers Jonathan and Timothy all have Cystic Fibrosis.

This is the most common fatal genetic disease in Canada, affecting over 4,300 Canadians. There is a defect in the body’s cells resulting in the production of particularly thick mucus in the lungs which, if left untreated, creates the perfect breeding ground for bad infections.

Forty years ago, children born with CF typically died young. For decades, Canada has been at the forefront of research and development of therapies and improved patient care.

Now CFers often live into adulthood, sometimes even middle age. But it’s still not possible to beat the disease, with the final recourse of treatment being a lung transplant. As drastic a procedure as that is, it is really like putting a Band Aid on a broken leg.

I've known that Mary-Lin has CF as long as I've known her. I try to convince myself that I've been supportive in regards to her disease throughout the years that we dated and have been married. But, if I'm honest, I haven’t really done much about it.

I was reminded this spring about an annual cycling fundraiser called GearUp4CF that I first heard of a decade ago. When I was a teenager, I rode my bike all the time, so why haven't I been part of this for the last 10 years?

Well, better late than never. I jumped online and found the website (www.gearup4cf.com).

Turns out this year's fundraising ride is ""virtual"" to encourage social distancing. What that means is instead of a group ride, participants are setting personal challenges to complete individually. I signed up the same day, and set a fundraising target of $25,000. Within an hour, a ride challenge began to formulate in my mind.

I would ride to Penticton and back from New West in five days. I literally hadn't pedaled my bike for 10 years.

That was two months ago.

So, for the last two months I've been training. I knew I had to do two things.

1) Get my legs in shape. The ride requires me to pull off at least 150 kilometres per day for five days, with some real climbs involved too (day one includes summiting the Coquihalla)

2) Prepare my mind. I'm not an athlete, but I am in reasonably good shape and my work involves physical labour, so I was fairly confident I could prepare physically.

However, to pull off five long endurance rides in a row requires mental toughness as well. I realized that the mental training could come partly from the physical training. Confidence in my physical ability to accomplish my goal would go a long way towards being mentally prepared. Therefore, I would train towards a really hard training ride to be accomplished shortly before the actual challenge.

Darrell Hoekstra with his wife Mary-Lin, who has Cystic Fibrosis. submitted

Well, I dug out the rusty old mountain bike I bought as a teenager and brought it to the shop. I decided it was better to ride that than buy a new one so that I could kick-start my fundraising campaign with my own money (which I did).

Unfortunately, after a full tune-up and new tires, it was stolen out of my parkade after only a couple rides. I borrowed a bike for a week so I could keep riding (often commuting to the jobsite as a way to squeeze more time out of the day, since I was working fulltime) and then replaced it the next weekend.

Now the training could really begin. I've put 1,300 kilometres on the new bike in the last six weeks, and last weekend accomplished the last big training ride, a Triple Crown ride which involves summiting Seymour, Grouse and Cypress on the same day.

Which brings us to today. Now I just have to pull off five of them in a row, while sleeping on the ground and eating from a backpack.

On July 20, I'm leaving from New West early in the morning. And since five days might be too easy, my new goal is to do it ""as fast as possible.""

I'm going push myself hard every day, and post regularly to social media so people can follow along.

I want to say a heartfelt thank-you to all my supporters. Together we've raised $16,000 (over 60% of my goal so far!) and this money is so important for everyone whose lives are directly or indirectly affected by CF.

The funds are for CF Canada, a non-profit that works tirelessly advocating for and funding world class patient care and research into life-sustaining therapies and treatments and ultimately, hopefully, a cure.

You can help, too, by doing your part to protect immuno-compromised people like those with CF.

Washing your hands, staying home when you're sick, the exact things we're so aware of the need to do now due to COVID-19.

Normal little seasonal illnesses take a huge toll on someone with CF, and as Mary-Lin's husband I've observed the cumulative damage they have caused her over time.

Save lives by being an organ donor.

You can also help by sponsoring my ride. Donations go directly to CFCanada and are tax receipted. Just go to www.gearup4cf.com and search for Darrell. And follow along on Instagram (@darrell.hoekstra) if you'd like to see how the ride goes.

Together we can make CF stand for “Cure Found.”

No example is better than the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks in the United States, which gave us the “Patriot Act” after just 45 days of deliberation to expand government surveillance of Americans to previously unimagined levels.

In mid-April, the actions of Gabriel Wortman led to the deaths of 22 people in Nova Scotia after multiple shootings and fires. Most Canadians, at the time still under lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, were horrified at Wortman’s actions, which included impersonating a police officer.

article continues below

It took the federal government only 13 days after Wortman’s criminal activity was evident for the entire country to announce a nationwide ban on 1,500 types of military-grade “assault-style” weapons in Canada. Any Canadian who possesses these firearms will have two years to get rid of them. The prohibition led to many new discussions about the role that firearms play in Canada’s urban and rural areas.

We know now that the perpetrator of the 22 murders in Nova Scotia had obtained his weapons illegally from Canadian and American sources. This was not a surprise for Canadian authorities, who have consistently reported that more than 70% of the weapons used in gun-related crimes in our country come from the United States.

On the issue of firearms, Canada is decidedly different from the United States. In Canada, it is not legal for a person to own or carry a firearm for the purpose of self defence against human beings. When Research Co. and Glacier Media asked Canadians about this key precept of Canadian law, more than three in four (77%) agreed with it, while 18% disagreed and 5% were undecided.

Atlantic Canada (31%), Saskatchewan and Manitoba (29%) and Alberta (24%) boast the highest number of residents who openly question Canada’s long-standing regulations for firearms. While higher than what is observed in Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia, these are not proportions of voters that would sway an election, certainly not in the way American statewide and congressional races can be tilted if your candidate can adequately hold a shotgun and recite the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution in a manner that panders to the base.

Fewer than one in five Canadians welcome the notion of citizens carrying firearms for something other than hunting or scaring wildlife away. Any survey measuring opinions on banning “assault-style” weapons would be met with near unanimity. The opposition reacted to the announced ban as it always has under its outgoing leader, by claiming the regulations would affect law-abiding Canadians. Lost in this unfortunate combination of inadequate polling and incapable opposition are the solutions that matter to Canadians.

In our survey, more than three in five Canadians (63%) told us that gun violence in Canada is a “very serious” or “moderately serious” problem – a proportion that climbs to 69% among women and 68% among those aged 55 and over.

Sizable majorities of Ontarians and British Columbians, who have experienced gang wars in urban areas, are more likely to look at gun violence as particularly problematic (76% and 67%, respectively). The COVID-19 pandemic did little to curb gun violence in Toronto, where 61 people were shot in the first four months of the year.

We asked Canadians about the effectiveness of four possible measures, and their responses outline a public that is ready for bold action. More than three in five Canadians (62%) think enacting a complete ban on handguns would be “very effective” or “moderately effective” in reducing gun violence in Canada. Most crimes, after all, are not being committed with the military-grade “assault-style” weapons that the federal government was quick to ban.

A higher proportion of Canadians deem two other measures as effective: imposing mandatory jail terms for crimes committed with firearms (74%) and introducing new outreach programs to steer youth away from gangs (also 74%).

Canadians place dealing with firearms smuggled from the United States as the most important issue that needs to be addressed. Many of the country’s residents also want to make sure gangs are not attractive to our country’s youth and believe mandatory minimum jail sentences would act as a deterrent.

Banning military-grade “assault-style” weapons is low-hanging fruit in a challenge that definitely has Canadians preoccupied and wishing for a type of government intervention that goes beyond a photo-op celebrated by poorly executed survey charity work.

True sociologists know that we learn nothing from posing the wrong questions to Canadians, and capable politicians should go beyond voicing displeasure with plans and proposals just because that is what they are expected to do. Meanwhile, Canadians are still worried about gun violence and expecting their elected officials to do better. •

The metaphor suggested by the title of Christian Sands’ new album is apt.

The jazz pianist says he was trying to be freer and more flexible on ""Be Water,"" and it shows. The set's 10 cuts explore a wide range of moods and instrumental combinations, with Sands' trio at the core.

Much of the material is built on the same pattern of tension and release found in a body of water. That begins with the opening ""Intro,"" which settles on the tonic chord after nearly four minutes of shimmering undulation.

The reflective ""Still,"" featuring Marvin Sewell on acoustic guitar, rides a mere ripple of rhythm. On ""Be Water II,"" a string quartet plays against the lapping beat established by Sands' piano. Marcus Strickland's woodwind work makes ""Drive"" swing as it crests with a cascading electric guitar solo by Sewell.

Sands rarely cuts loose at the piano — his objective isn't to be splashy — but he takes an active role as the producer, overdubbing extra keyboards and including sound effects and brief recitations by martial artist Bruce Lee. ""Water can flow, or it can crash,"" Lee says. Forgive the flood of puns, but ""Be Water"" flows freely.",[]

Everything about this album is intimidating, including the growling, nether-worldly voice of singer Udo Dirkschneider, and the fact that his backing band is the official concert band of the German military. This album is not for the faint of heart.

article continues below

The former Accept frontman's solo band U.D.O. teams with the Musikkorps der Bundeswehr to put some real metal in heavy metal on ""We Are One.""

The pairing has undeniable power and force on 15 tracks that deal with environmental threats to the planet (""Future Is the Reason Why"", ""Mother Earth""), the refugee crisis (""Children of the World""), and a reunited Germany (""Rebel Town""), among other topics. The band lends a sweeping grandeur to most of the tracks with horns and strings punching up already-rowdy guitar riffs.

And for those who still miss the diminutive singer's 1980s heyday with Accept, U.D.O. throws them a bone in ""We Strike Back,"" a close cousin of the classic Accept concert opener ""Fast as a Shark,"" with very similar speed, style and structure, right down to the harmonic twin guitar solos. When this band sings ""We Strike Back,"" you'd best believe it, in the most literal sense.",[]

The newspaper explained the decision in a note by Bill Sternberg, editorial page editor, attached to the column online. Navarro's column originally moved online late Tuesday and was published in Wednesday's newspaper.

article continues below

Navarro wrote that Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, ""has been wrong about everything I interacted with him on.""

The newspaper on Wednesday evening also ran a fact-check story by Washington reporter Ledyard King examining five of Navarro's claims.

It wasn't clear how Navarro's column escaped such scrutiny before being published. Sternberg said in an email that he's letting his editorial note speak for itself. The incident is reminiscent of The New York Times saying last month that an opinion column by U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton hadn't been properly vetted, which led to the resignation of the paper's opinion editor.

Navarro did not immediately return a message for comment.

USA Today said it had sought Navarro's opinion to accompany an editorial that the newspaper ran calling Fauci ""a national treasure.""

That editorial said the fact that Navarro was writing the opposing viewpoint ""shows how hard it is to find an actual medical professional willing to undercut Fauci.""

It wasn't clear whether the newspaper sought those opinions.

Fauci has essentially been shelved by the White House as a prominent spokesperson on the coronavirus pandemic because he's publicly been more pessimistic than the president. He does webcasts but rarely gives television interviews anymore.

Trump distanced himself from Navarro's column, saying Wednesday that the column was Navarro's views and ""he shouldn't be doing that.""

Navarro claimed in the column that Fauci opposed travel restrictions from China that were imposed by Trump that ""might well have saved hundreds of thousands of American lives."" USA Today said there isn't enough data to conclude the restrictions made a significant difference, and that despite some initial skepticism, Fauci backed the president.

The fact-checker also gave more context to Navarro claims about masks, the drug hydroxychloroquine and Fauci's early statements of concern about the virus.",[]

He’s returned to the charts in 2020, working on songs for rising and established rap stars, including Lil Wayne, Juice WRLD, Saweetie and Doja Cat.

The songmaster, who has been entangled in a bitter lawsuit with former collaborator Kesha since 2014, has produced and co-written Saweetie’s new single ""Tap In,"" the follow-up to her double-platinum smash ""My Type."" Dr. Luke also co-wrote and co-produced Juice WRLD’s ""Wishing Well,"" taken from the rapper’s first posthumous album ""Legends Never Die,"" released last week.

article continues below

The recent successes mean all three major U.S. record label companies have worked with Dr. Luke this year, even if he hasn't always put his widely recognizable professional name to the new collaborations.

Dr. Luke marked a major comeback this year with the success of the Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hit ""Say So"" by rapper-singer Doja Cat, who is signed to Dr. Luke's Kemosabe Records. Dr. Luke, born Lukasz Sebastian Gottwald, produced several songs on Cat’s sophomore album ""Hot Pink,"" including single ""Like That,"" which is No. 5 on Billboard’s Hot R&B songs chart. He is the only producer with two songs in the Top 10 on the latter chart (""Say So"" sits at No. 2).

For his work with Cat, he used the alias Tyson Traxe. He used the same pseudonym for his production credit on Toronto rapper-singer Benny Mayne’s ""Hokey Pokey,"" released this year. For Lil Wayne’s ""Shimmy,"" a track featuring Cat on the deluxe edition of his latest album ""Funeral,"" Dr. Luke used the name Loctor Duke.

Label representatives for Saweetie, Juice WRLD, Lil Wayne and Cat didn’t immediately reply to emails seeking comment. Neither did a representative for Dr. Luke.

Luke has sprinkled his comeback among the major labels. Cat is signed to Sony Music’s RCA Records, while Saweetie is part of the Warner Music family. Lil Wayne releases music through his Young Money imprint and Republic Records, a division of Universal Music Group.

Before Dr. Luke topped the charts this year with ""Say So,"" he last had a No. 1 with Katy Perry's ""Dark Horse"" in 2014. Months later, Kesha accused him of sexual assault during their yearslong partnership (Dr. Luke has vigorously denied the allegations.)

A New York court dismissed Kesha’s sexual abuse-related claims in 2016 because of legal issues, without ruling on whether the allegations were true. Kesha lost another round in February, when a New York judge said she made a defamatory statement about Dr. Luke on a different occasion: a 2016 text message telling Gaga the producer had also raped Perry. Both he and Perry have denied it, and the judge said there was ""no evidence whatsoever"" to support the claim.

Kesha’s lawyers have said they plan to appeal the ruling, but it didn’t resolve other aspects of his defamation and breach-of-contract suit, including the crucial question of whether Kesha’s allegation that he raped her is true. The judge said that’s for a jury to decide at trial.

Outside of rap in 2020, Dr. Luke has produced music for pop singer Kim Petras, using the pseudonym MADE IN CHINA.",[]
684,newwestrecord,https://newwestrecord.ca/standout/growing-old-gleefully-the-four-keys-to-happier-aging-1.23163430,Growing old gleefully: The four keys to happier aging,[],,"Home care is key to helping seniors live in their own homes for longer. But home care isn’t just about medical care, in fact it’s as much about helping seniors keep their independence for longer.

“For us, senior home care is about caring, not just health care,” Susan and Wendy Scott from Nurse Next Door say. “In our experience, once a senior begins to lose their independence, their happiness starts to disappear too, so we do everything in our power to help keep them in their own home as long as they want to remain there and can so safely.”

article continues below

Here the Scott’s draw on their experience with seniors to share the four keys to happier aging.

1. Play: Seniors with a full dance card of hobbies and passions are much less likely to fall foul to the pitfalls of social isolation that we traditionally associate with old age. However for a variety of reasons seniors can find themselves drifting from passions that were once a key part of their lives. A good caregiver’s job involves helping seniors to continue the pursuit of their passions, helping them to maintain hobbies and interests that encourage them to remain active both socially and physically.

2. Connections and relationships: No matter what age we are, personal connections with our friends and families remain crucial to living happy and healthy lives. Research has shown that those people who maintain their interpersonal connections live longer than people who are isolated as they get older. As well as making us happy, maintaining these relationships can also impact our health, boosting things like our immune systems, lowering blood pressure and alleviating depression.

3. Learning: We’ve all heard the saying “It’s never too late to teach an old dog new tricks” but did you know the same applied to us humans too? Indeed ongoing learning, even in the later stages of our lives, has been widely proven to help boost health and longevity.

4. Travel and adventure: Whether it’s soaking up some Vitamin D on a pristine beach or venturing off of the beaten track, everyone has dreams of travelling. And these don't just stop as we start to get older. Many seniors have had to shelve their dreams and aspirations due to family commitments, work, or financial constraints. But those dreams never fade and just because you are getting older doesn’t mean that they cannot become a reality.

685,newwestrecord,https://newwestrecord.ca/standout/four-trends-in-funeral-planning-1.23175885,Four trends in funeral planning,[],,"Just like wedding trends, varying funeral rituals and décor ebb and flow. Here are four we’re seeing in memorial and funeral planning, according to Andrew Knapman Location Manager of Burnaby’s Forest Lawn Funeral Home.

1. Cremation is becoming more and more popular as opposed to a more traditional burial or mausoleum interment. “B.C. has one of the highest cremation rates in North America because of space concerns … Also, the further West you go, the less traditional people tend to be,” Knapman explains. That said, a lot of people are purchasing cemetery property for cremation so that families have a site at which to visit their loved ones.

article continues below

2. These days many people are taking a proactive approach to their funeral planning by arranging many of the logistics—from the music to flowers to ceremony rituals—before they pass on. Not only does this help take the burden off of loved ones, it also ensures that you are remembered the way you want to be.

3. There’s also a trend towards putting a more optimistic spin on what has traditionally been a sad event by planning a Celebration of Life, where a person’s accomplishments, contributions and passions are the focus of the occasion. “It can be a time to memorialize you and talk about the stories that surround you,” says Knapman.

4. In terms of funeral service ideas, many people are foregoing the traditional church ceremony and personalizing the event. “We try to encourage clients to think outside the box,” says Knapman. Often, that means incorporating symbols of your loved one’s passions into the event. For one family that meant driving the funeral hearse around a race track to commemorate a person who had a deep love of car racing, says Knapman.

Between Oct. 24 and Dec. 5, the city received rezoning and business licence applications for cannabis retail stores at 22 locations around the city. Following an evaluation process, staff recommended five applications for retail cannabis stores including four private stores – Maple Leaf Greenery at 71 Sixth St. (downtown); Muse Cannabis – 532 Sixth St. (uptown); the Herb Co. Cannabis Store – 451 East Columbia St. (Sapperton); and Westcanna – 710 12th St. – and one public store to be operated by B.C. Cannabis Stores at Queensborough Landing Shopping Centre.

article continues below

As part of a plan to allow five initial cannabis retail shops to open in New Westminster, city staff evaluated all of the applications using a checklist that includes items related to: location and land use; business operations, nuisance and security; and esthetics (such as signage, windows and gates).

The city’s plan has been to see a blend of public and private operators, and to have one shop in each of the downtown, uptown and Sapperton neighbourhoods and two shops in remaining commercial areas. At Monday’s meeting, council voted four to three to consider the Queensborough Cannabis Co. Ltd.’s application for a store at 540 Ewen Ave. instead of the government store in Queensborough Landing.

“I understand that council originally was hopeful or interested in the idea of a public cannabis store to be part of the first stores that opened. I support that, except I feel that the B.C. Cannabis Store that has put forward an application has scored quite low as compared to the other location in Queensborough,” said Coun. Mary Trentadue. “I don’t feel that the argument of having a public store is strong enough to outweigh the scores of those two. I feel an independent store has done its work. It’s provided all the information required. It has a fairly high score, and I think that’s a reasonable reason to put forward that business, as opposed to the B.C. one, which has not scored well at all.”

Because the city’s plan was to have a mix of public and private stores, Coun. Jaimie McEvoy said the staff recommendation was consistent with the process laid out by the city.

“I believe in the role of the public sector in this. I think it’s important,” he said. “I think the role of the B.C. Liquor Branch in this is going to be a critical part of its success, particularly in a community-sensitive location like Queensborough. That role is going to be an important part of seeing how this works and being able to compare and draw lessons from both the public and private sector, rather than just one of those sectors.”

Councillors Trentadue, Patrick Johnstone and Nadine Nakagawa and Mayor Jonathan Cote supported consideration of the application from the private store, while councillors Chinu Das, McEvoy and Puchmayr preferred having a government-run store in Queensborough. (BC Cannabis Stores had an overall score of 28, compared to the Queensborough Cannabis Co. Ltd. score of 40.)

Council has directed staff to prepare a zoning amendment bylaw to permit the retail sale of cannabis at the five locations in the city and will consider first and second readings of the bylaw on April 8. The city will hold a public hearing on April 29, at which time council would also consider third reading and adoption of the bylaw.",[]

This disgusting anti-abortion material has started arriving in New West mail boxes and mail slots.

article continues below

The flyers are being called out for the terrible images displayed and the anti-choice message.

“Hey #NewWest, someone just put a very graphic anti-choice/anti-abortion flyer through my mail slot,” tweeted New West resident @IjustKat. “It appears there is active campaigning in our city attacking the rights and autonomy of people with uteruses over our own bodies .., it’s gross enough on its own but something about putting it through my mail slot into my house that makes it extra offensive.”

That’s a key point for people. Someone coming onto your property and inserting it through a mail slot also exposes children to the graphic images, which can be seen embedded in this blog post.

Flyers being delivered by hand to residents. Screenshot

I wrote recently about a father of two named Dustin whose children sadly saw the graphic flyers.

“My kids went to get my neighbours mail as they were away,” Dustin said. “I found our 7 and 4 year olds sitting on my neighbour’s front lawn looking at that disgusting anti-abortion pamphlet. My 4-year-old ran to his room screaming. I phoned the RCMP and they said they would call the company to suggest they don’t distribute them that way. They didn’t care to find the person distributing them.”

I’ve included a photo below of one of the images because some readers said they wanted more ""proof,"" but I have blurred out the more disgusting parts of it.

People legally have a right to print up flyers like this, but I don’t feel they have the right to step on private property and inflict this on people.

I wrote recently about Keith, a Burnaby resident with two young children who get a kick out of going to grab the daily mail from the box outside his home.

Luckily, Keith’s kids didn’t see the flyers.

“(They) would have been greeted by very explicit images that should not be shown to kids,” said Keith.

Keith checked the footage from the security cameras he had installed and they show a woman with a stack of the flyers dropping one off.

The flyers were not delivered in a sealed envelope and Keith thinks that, at the very least, they should be.

“As the pamphlets are not delivered in a sealed envelope, they often end up in the hands of children,” he said. “And the girl delivering the flyers could clearly tell we have kids by the amount of kids’ stuff around our yard. Distributing graphic images like these, which easily end up being viewed by children, should be illegal. Movies, books and games all have a rating system and packaging must be made appropriate. These images are worse, and should be provided only with a warning.”

The question was one faced by parents around British Columbia as their children’s schools sent out surveys asking one deceptively simple question: Do you intend to have your child return to in-class instruction starting June 1?

article continues below

It’s amazing how complicated one simple question can be.

For the record, I said No. My daughter isn’t returning for in-class instruction in New West on Monday. But I can’t remember the last time a simple question caused me so much what-iffing, but-waiting and on-the-other-handing.

My initial response to the news that schools were reopening their doors in June was one huge and enthusiastic “yahoo!” Our seven-year-old is an only child. She’s been learning at home since March break, while my husband and I have both been working remotely at jobs that have demanded more-than-full-time attention.

Finding a way to spend time with her has been, without a doubt, the single biggest challenge we’ve faced since we all came home for March break and never went back to our outside lives. Trying to engage and interact with her, to help her figure out the necessary technology, to make sure she’s on top of her assignments and gets her half-hour of reading done and writes her daily journal and checks out her virtual music lesson and doesn’t try to sneak extra YouTube videos in while she’s supposed to be doing Mathletics and then trying to think of ways we can all get fresh air and exercise and do something fun because you’re supposed to do something fun every day and why can’t I just bake cookies and if I was a good mom I would be baking cookies right now and helping her learn how to do more household chores and after all this pandemic isn’t supposed to be all bad I mean other people are having fun right now so why am I not having fun and why am I not sleeping and somebody hand me the Advil because I have a migraine and dammit I’m not supposed to take Advil now because wasn’t there something about Advil and COVID-19 so fine make it Tylenol and where is my coffee and

and

and

My right eye is twitching again just typing it all out.

Suffice it to say, sending our daughter back to school seemed like a good idea.

The thought that somebody else – somebody trained and qualified and good at teaching; somebody she’ll listen to and learn properly from instead of digging in her heels and resisting help – would take over her education? Yes, please.

And friends? In the solitary life of only children everywhere, Facetime and Messenger Kids have been her lifeline to other humans under the age of 10. And even though she’s an introvert at heart who enjoys her own space and keeps herself company pretty well, it’s not the same as spending time with other kids.

Returning to class, even part-time, could only be a win all around – for my husband, for me and for my daughter.

But wait.

We’re still in the midst of a viral pandemic. And, although all indications at this point are that the virus doesn’t transmit readily among groups of children, there are still a lot of question marks. What do we really know about how the virus will react until we try it out and see? And do I want my child to be part of one of those test groups? What if it all gets worse, fast, once groups of kids start assembling again? Do I want our family to come in contact with so many other people who may or may not have been taking social distancing as seriously as we have?

But wait.

I know the school district is taking its direction from people who know far more than I do. The B.C. Centre for Disease Control and public health officials and the Ministry of Education wouldn’t be clearing the return to school if they hadn’t decided, based on science and evidence, that it was possible to minimize and contain the risks.

But wait.

Even if our daughter does go back to school, will her friends be there? And will she really enjoy it, given how different the school day is going to look? If the kids aren’t allowed to work together and interact normally and play on the playground like they usually would, is she going to get the kind of social interaction that is at least half the reason we want to send her back? On the other hand, isn’t some social interaction, even limited and restricted interaction, better than none at all?

But wait.

If she doesn’t go back to school, can I keep doing this? Can I really make it through another month of muddling through home learning while I’m trying to navigate a full-time job? Can I handle being the “bad guy” every day (or, more accurately, taking turns with my husband being the bad guy) and forcing her to do the schoolwork she’d rather skip and dealing with the subsequent moods and attitude? Do I even want to try?

But wait.

Anxiety. She’s an anxiety-prone kind of kid, and we’ve finally managed to work through a lot of the anxiety she had – and, let’s face it, that we had - about the world turning upside down around us. We’ve found a bit of a “normal” in the way we live now, and we’re making it work (ish), so do I want to turn that all on its head, again, for the sake of a few weeks of school? If she takes a couple of weeks to get used to a new routine – and she always does – then is it even worth it for the little time that’s left in the school year?

But wait.

Is it fair to our daughter’s teacher to keep her home, when the teacher is going to be in class and ready to teach? Is it fair to my daughter to keep her home if her friends are going to be at school? Is it fair to me and my husband to keep her home when our jobs are still as demanding as ever? Is it fair that I even feel like all of this isn’t fair, given that we’re both employed and we have a home and we lack for nothing and we rate pretty damn high on the scale of pandemic privilege?

So yeah.

That “do you intend to send your child back to school” question was a simple one. It just didn’t come with a built-in guaranteed right answer.

In the end, our daughter’s own verdict that she’d rather continue learning at home tipped the balance for us. But even as I filled out “No” on the survey and sent it back to the school principal, I wondered if we were doing the right thing.

I still wonder.

It helps to know that our daughter is, after all, in Grade 2. Realizing that whatever decision we make, her entire academic future is not at stake here – well, that helps. And so does the fact that she has a dedicated and supportive teacher who has been 100% available to her students and their families since this crazy journey began. She’s assured us that our child will be fine, either way, and that she’s here to support the decision that works best for us.

So I feel good about our “No.” Mostly.

But let me be clear: I’m not casting judgment on anyone who said Yes and whose children will be back in school on Monday. I can think of a thousand reasons why parents want – and, in some cases, need – to have their children back in class. My decision isn’t intended to in any way cast aspersions on those reasons. I only hope that, by having families like ours step out of the in-class instruction part of learning, perhaps we can free up some of the teachers’ time and attention for those students who need that face-to-face contact more than we do.

We may still change our minds.

If COVID-19 has taught us nothing else, it has at least taught us that we can’t predict what life’s going to throw at us next. Everything may stay very much the same for the next month. Or everything could be upside down tomorrow.

All we can do is make the best decision for us right now, with the information we have available. And if something changes? Well, we’ll move on and do the next right thing – whatever that may be.

For all my fellow parents who’ve agonized over all of this too, solidarity. And for the teachers and administrators who have been working so phenomenally hard to make remote learning work and then to gear up for the return to class, all without missing a beat for our kids, my deepest gratitude.

As for my daughter? Well, she just got off a long Messenger Kids chat with her aunt in Toronto and is now, I suspect, sneaking YouTube videos instead of doing Mathletics.

But you know what? She’s done all her work for the week, and she’s not in any danger of losing her Grade 2 year if I give us both a break and let it go.

So I think I’ll pretend not to notice and have an iced coffee while I sit on the patio and proofread this post.

Here’s to the weekend – and here’s to Monday, whatever it may bring.",[]

Me too.

I’m sitting here writing this post as an act of solidarity with all of the parents who are also muddling through the brave new world of working full-time from home while attempting something resembling “home schooling” with your children.

Let me preface this up front by saying this: I know what a fortunate position I am in. Right here, right now, this house has two partners who are both working full-time. We are caring for one child, we have a freezer and a pantry full of food, and we have enough tucked away for a rainy day that even if it all came crashing down tomorrow we’d be fine for the time being.

These are blessings that I don’t take for granted.

But, while my gratitude for full-time work (work that I love and happen to get a paycheque for) remains boundless, it also means that neither my husband nor I have the time to be as engaged and involved with our daughter as we’d like. All those marvellous lists of resources and educational ideas for parents that are going around social media? They’re awesome, but the chances of me having time to delve into them, let alone sit down and actually interact with my child to make most of them happen, are slim to none.

I do not need any posts about “how to make baking muffins an educational activity for your child” or “how you and your child can build a backyard rocketship.” What I need are basic strategies for survival. Period.

So I’m writing my own.

Thanks to some crowd-sourced wisdom from the New West Moms Group on Facebook, I have come up with this list of strategies to help you stay sane while you pretend this is a balancing act you can actually accomplish.

Take what will help you, discard what won’t, or just swear at me from the comfort of your own home if it’ll make you feel better.

Here, for what it’s worth, are my 10 survival strategies:

1. MAKE SURE EVERYONE HAS A WORK SPACE.

Whether you have an actual “home office” or you’re working on a laptop in the living room, try to make sure everyone in the house has a defined work space – and that includes your child. Everyone needs a space where they can go to be (mostly) uninterrupted and where they can work without being distracted by others.

Be sure your children know that when you’re at your work space, you’re working and therefore not meant to be interrupted except for important questions. Offer them the same courtesy in return with their schoolwork space.

Consider making your own “Do Not Disturb” sign to hang next to you when you really need a designated amount of quiet time (for an important meeting, for instance).

No, you’ll never stop the “Moo-ooooom” questions. But the more you can provide visual cues that you are “at work” or “at school,” the more you can help your whole family separate those tasks from the “at home” hours – and the more fun it’ll be to hang out together when you’re all “at home” again in the evening.

Or, at least, you can tell yourself that. It hasn’t entirely worked for me yet, but I remain convinced that it’s a strategy that will pay off – eventually.

2. ACCEPT REALITY.

Reality #1: You’re not at your office, so your dream of uninterrupted time to focus on work is officially on hold. Indefinitely.

Reality #2: You’re not “home schooling.” You’re pinch hitting in a crisis, to the best of your ability (whatever that means for you), but unless you’re actually a teacher in real life, you’re not a teacher – and you didn’t just suddenly become one because your kid is sitting there staring expectantly at you expecting you to make this all make sense for her.

So work isn’t going to be “normal,” and neither is school. The faster you can accept both of those facts, the better off you’ll be.





3. COMMUNICATE.

Communicate with your own work team – your co-workers, your boss – and being clear about what you can and cannot achieve and when you can and cannot be available. No one (well, no one with any common sense and compassion) expects that you’ll be the exact same employee you are at the office when your child is safely ensconced at school or daycare. Everyone knows you will have some distractions and that maybe the old nine-to-five expectations are off the table right now. Talk to your team, if you need to, about how you can all help each other make this transition to working at home easier.

Even more importantly, communicate with your child’s teacher. That teacher is still guiding your child’s education, and he or she is now also struggling to navigate some very unfamiliar territory. Stay in touch. If you’re struggling to help your child, reach out. Chances are other parents are struggling, too, and the more honest we all are with the teachers in our lives, the more those teachers will be able to help us help our children.

And, above all, communicate to yourself. Repeat to yourself, as many times a day as you need to: I am not alone. We are in this together.

4. BE FLEXIBLE WITH YOUR HOURS.

How much of your work must be done at a certain time, and how much do you just stick to your routines because that’s how you’ve always done it? Your answer will be individual to your own situation, but, wherever possible, now’s the time to rethink the way your schedule works.

If you have a partner in the house, sit down and rethink your schedules together. Can one be the “more available” parent in the morning and one in the afternoon? Can some work get done in the evenings or on the weekends? Can you take longer lunch hours to give yourself a chance to play in the backyard or go for a walk with your child in the middle of the day? However you can free yourself up to give your child some attention and engagement during the day, it’s worth giving it a try.

And if that way fails? Then try something different. These days life is all about different. Go with it, and see what kind of new “normal” you can create for your own family in a world where nothing is normal at all.



5. SET UP A SCHEDULE.

Whether you’re the kind of person who likes to map out your day down to the minute or the kind who likes to go with the flow, everyone – especially the small humans in the house – will benefit from some kind of routine.

Decide how your household’s “schedule” is going to work. Whether it’s a list of tasks that can be accomplished in any order (which is how we like it), or whether it’s a specific hourly plan, commit that plan to paper and post it in a place where you can all see it.

My daughter’s in Grade 2; I know that her academic future won’t be irredeemably altered if she fails to complete her journal writing or her two tasks in Mathletics today. But having those expectations written down on a task list helps her, because she can take her checklist and run with it while I do my own work (and, yes, answer the inevitable questions that arise while she’s working).

Another help for us? Build rewards into your schedule to keep everyone motivated. For my kidlet, it’s earning extra screen time by finishing academic, creative and household tasks. For me, it’s sitting down with a glass of Naramata rosé and a satisfying murder mystery novel to end my evening.



6. KEEP EVERYONE FED.

Snacks, snacks and more snacks. Make sure your day, and your child’s, includes food.

It seems like a foolish thing to say, but it’s amazing to me how often I can “forget” to eat when I get engrossed in something work-related. And if you have a child who, like mine, suffers from a bad case of the hangries when food doesn’t arrive on time, you want to be prepared.

However you choose to provide that food is up to you. Maybe your household works best with specific snack items set out in easy-to-reach bins for the kids so they can grab their own food when they need it. Maybe you’re more of a fridge free-for-all family or a formal-sit-down-meal household. Whatever your style, just keep everyone nourished and hydrated.

And then do it all again tomorrow. And the next day. And the next day. And the one after that.



7. GET OUTDOORS AND GET MOVING.

Your child needs fresh air, and so do you. And, here on the West Coast, we’ve been blessed by the arrival of spring in all its cherry-blossom-and-magnolia-tree glory. So get outside, every day. Twice a day if you can. Whether that means taking a longer lunch to get outdoors together, going for an early-morning jog or taking to your neighbourhood streets for an after-work stroll, make sure you get out and give yourselves that brain break.

And get moving. Crank the tunes and throw yourselves a dance party, search out some yoga on YouTube, or whatever it takes to work out your body and shake off some stress. Heck, just run laps around the yard or the living room if it helps.

Tire out all the bodies in your house, and hopefully all the minds will sleep better.

8. RELAX SCREEN TIME RIGIDITY.

I know, I know, you have screen time limits for a reason, and so do I. But we can all allow ourselves to relax those limits – at least a little - right about now.

If you absolutely need your child to stay out of your hair while you’re in a Zoom meeting, or you have two hard hours of work to complete on a tight deadline, then maybe a movie on the TV or a half-hour of precious games on the iPad will be the solution to buy you the time you require.

If your child is a bookworm who loves reading more than screen time, then embrace the magical unicorn that you are raising and let her go to town on books instead. But for the rest of us mortals? Screen time may be just the break we need.

9. LAUGH.

Seriously, just start laughing now, because it’s all crazy, and someday it’ll have to be funny because if it’s not funny you’ll just start crying and you might not stop.

So find the funny side, fast. And if you can’t find the funny side in your daughter’s attempt to dress the cats in Easter outfits or in your own attempts to produce home baking, then turn to the experts and put on your favourite funny TV show or podcast, or seek out some comedy on YouTube. Or something. Anything to get the giggles going.

Embrace this new life you are leading, in all its bizarre gloriousness, and laugh. And, yes, laughter tinged with overtired maniacal hysteria is still laughter.

10. ALLOW YOURSELF THE GRACE TO BE IMPERFECT.

You’re going to suck at this sometimes. Probably even a lot of the time. You’re going to be stressed, frazzled and emotional. You may lose your patience with your child, forget to return a phone call, or not remember what day it is. And you may do all of those things with or without a shower, with or without clean hair, and with or without pants.

You are not in fact an incurable mess. You are just a human being, navigating what is undoubtedly the strangest time in your personal history. It’s OK if that contact has to wait a few hours for an email, or if your child does not in fact finish her two tasks in Mathletics today.

Her future and yours do not depend upon perfection. They depend only upon you showing up and doing your best, whatever that looks like today.

That’s it. That’s all I’ve got. And if you see a frazzled-looking mom with her unwashed hair in a messy ponytail wearing the same leggings she’s been wearing for a week and dragging a whining blonde seven-year-old around the neighbourhood for a walk, that’s probably me.

Feel free to say hi. I’ll say hi back, and I promise I’ll even smile.

We may or may not actually have this whole situation in hand. But whatever happens, remember: we’re all in this together.",[]

But right now, it just pisses me off.

When I see a troop of teens huddled together on the beach, sharing drinks and scooching closer to snap selfies, it doesn’t make me miss my high school days, it makes my stomach turn.

This isn’t a snow day, and it’s not the spring break social time that we’ve come to expect during this time of year.

We have yet to see the worst of this global pandemic, and while some seem to be brushing off the warnings by the authorities, I’m starting to take their ignorance personally.

COVID-19 is spreading quickly, and we’ve been urged to stay home and act as though we’ve already contracted the contagious disease.

Many cases are mild enough that the carrier doesn’t realize that they’ve been infected. One visit to a family member or friend, and the virus is passed on, and the spread continues.

In one of her latest updates, Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer, urges residents to stay home, and only go out for essential trips such as to the grocery store. She emphasized that it’s alright to go for walks, but only with the members that live in your household.

Playdates are not ok. Coffee dates with friends are unacceptable. Crowding into public spaces - even if they are outdoors, is not practicing social distancing. Continuing to do these things will put our province in the same position as Italy, with rapidly spiking cases and increasing death rates by the hour. We could be where they are, only weeks from now, if we don’t start listening to the cautions today.

Physicians are working together to help spread the word, encouraging everyone to stay indoors. In an email sent to my aunt by her own physician, the content reads, “The time to act is now. Our province is in a state of emergency. What we do today will impact the health of British Columbians in the weeks to come. Stay home unless absolutely necessary. No dinner parties. No shopping. No sports, not even outside. Instead, have coffee with a friend online. Keep six feet or two metres away from everyone at all times. Call your loved ones and tell them to do the same.

Remind young people in your life that they can get sick from this virus. More importantly, they can be carriers and cause a lot of harm to parents, grandparents, and other loved ones.”

I get it, your kids are bored. Your teens are craving social interactions, and you need to separate stir crazy siblings. But it’s time to listen to the experts.

Our city shouldn’t have to tape up playgrounds, close down coffee shops, and barricade beaches to get you to stay home.

Because the only thing more annoying than staying home, is knowing that other people aren’t.

She didn’t seem concerned, more just curious about the introduction of a new word to her ever-growing vocabulary, and as she looked back down at her Lego structure that she was building, I realized that it was time to be honest with her.

Because while I’ve spent the last couple of weeks hovered over my computer, watching live Q&A broadcasts with the World Health Organization (WHO), reading updates on the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) website, and following the latest travel advisories posted on Health Canada, my kids have been mostly in the dark about the quickly-spreading disease.

Last week we cancelled what was going to be our first-ever family trip abroad, a two-week trek through the south of France for spring break, and since then, our plans have been ever-changing. Maybe we’ll just go to Palm Springs or Phoenix instead? Nope, increased cases in the US. Maybe we’ll visit another province in Canada? Nope, air travel is not recommended. A ferry to Victoria? Social distancing doesn’t recommend time spent in such close quarters with so many people.

As I write this, the coronavirus has spread to 146 countries, with over 153,000 confirmed cases around the world - 73 of which are right here in BC. Things are changing by the hour, and while we’re all, for the most part, trying to remain calm, most of our kids are concerned, curious, or confused as they watch us as we watch things evolve.

It’s time to be open and honest with our kids about the coronavirus and all that’s happening around the world. They need to know why they can’t go to Science World, or hang out at the mall, and they need to know the severity of the situation.

Start by asking them questions to find out what they know - or think they know already. Then, let’s not just tell them to wash their hands, but explain why it’s more important than ever right now. Let’s explain to them that it’s not just about us getting sick, but about the people around us who are already sick or immunocompromised too. Let’s make sure they know that it’s not ok to make jokes about COVID-19 as the global death toll continues to rise.

Let’s tell our kids where to find the facts, and not to listen to the fiction that is filling their ears from friends and on social media platforms. Let’s explain the border closures and self-quarantines and stockpiling that’s happening, and let’s also show them videos of how people are coming together, supporting small businesses, providing for their sick neighbours who need help, and using this pandemic to come together as a community.

And then let’s comfort them, let them know that we’re here to answer their questions, and that we’ll do our best to keep them healthy and safe. And let’s follow through with that promise, because friends, this is only the beginning.
